Taliban kill civilians in resistance stronghold,"This man, a shopkeeper, believed he would be safe from the Taliban, sources said The BBC has found that at least 20 civilians have been killed in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, which has seen fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces. Communications have been cut in the valley, making reporting difficult, but the BBC has evidence of Taliban killings despite promises of restraint. Footage from a dusty roadside in Panjshir shows a man wearing military gear surrounded by Taliban fighters. Gunfire rings out and he slumps to the ground. It is not clear if the man killed was an army member - combat uniforms are common in the region. In the video a bystander insisted he was a civilian. The BBC has established there have been at least 20 such deaths in Panjshir. One of the victims was a shopkeeper and father-of-two called Abdul Sami. Local sources said the man would not flee when the Taliban advanced, telling them: ""I'm just a poor shop owner and have nothing to do with war."" But he was arrested, accused of selling sim cards to resistance fighters. Days later his body was dumped near his home. Witnesses who saw his body said it showed signs of torture. Moments later the man circled was shot dead When the Taliban swept to power last month, just one region held out. The Panjshir Valley has long been a focal point for resistance in Afghanistan. Under the opposition commander Ahmad Shah Massoud, the region repelled both the Soviet forces and the Taliban. Mountain peaks surround the valley making it difficult for anyone trying to capture it. Massoud's son Ahmad led the resistance against the Taliban the second time they took control of Afghanistan, but last week the militant group declared victory, posting footage of their fighters raising their flag. The resistance forces have vowed to fight on, with Ahmad Massoud calling for a ""national uprising"" against the Taliban. Now attention is turning to what happens next in Panjshir, as elsewhere in Afghanistan, with the Taliban back in charge. When the Taliban entered the valley, they encouraged residents to carry on as normal. ""They should come out, do their daily activities,"" said a spokesman, Malavi Abdullah Rahamani. ""If they are shopkeepers they can go to their shops. If they are farmers, they can go to their farms. We are here to protect them, their lives and their families."" But instead of this, footage from the ground shows once-busy marketplaces deserted. People have been trying to flee, with long lines of vehicles forming below the valley's craggy peaks. There have been warnings of shortages of food and medicine. The 'undefeated' Panjshir Valley - an hour from Kabul Who are the Taliban? Afghanistan, its future, and why China matters The Taliban has denied targeting civilians. But coming after reports ofa massacre of members of the Hazara minorityandthe killing of a policewoman, it is a further sign that the reality on the ground differs from the Taliban's promises of no revenge attacks. ""These kind of reports seem to fall in to a pattern that we've already documented throughout Afghanistan,"" said Patricia Grossman of Human Rights Watch. ""As the Taliban made their way towards Kabul through July and August we had similar reports and we were able to document summary executions of former security personnel, former members of the government and civilians often in revenge killings. This looks to very much be the same pattern."" The story of Afghanistanâs 'undefeated' valley Who are the Taliban?

"Axe Covid tests for most travellers, says industry","Covid PCR testing should be abandoned for most holidaymakers, says travel organisation Abta. Fully vaccinated travellers should not need to be tested on their return from lower-risk countries, it said. It also called for a ""significant overhaul"" of the traffic light system for travel destinations. Abta said the policies had ""choked off"" this summer's travel trade, with seven out of 10 travel firms planning to make redundancies after furlough ends. It also called for the government to reduce the traffic light system to just a small number of ""red list"" countries, purely for the management of known Covid variants of concern. The expense of PCR testing is widely blamed for discouraging people from travelling abroad. At present, going on holiday abroad means taking Covid tests when you are returning to the UK. Most private providers charge above Â£60 for PCR tests and Â£30 for lateral flow devices. The government has warned more than 80 providers over misleading prices. The next formal review of the government's travel policies is expected by 1 October, while the furlough scheme is due to end on 30 September. What are the holiday rules for travel? Watchdog urges tougher line on Covid test firms With more than 80% of eligible UK adults already vaccinated against Covid, it was time for a ""stable framework"" for international travel, said Abta, which represents tour operators and travel agents. New summer foreign holiday bookings for 2021 were down 83% on 2019, Abta said, while almost half of travel companies reported they had seen no increase in 2021 bookings compared with last year, despite the rollout of the vaccine programme. The summer sun is fading, but the travel industry's fears are heating up as the end of furlough approaches. The industry is disappointed that vaccination didn't open up international travel as they would have hoped. The government said it will review the way international travel works before October and many expect it will come this week. Voices in the industry are hoping to make themselves heard before ministers meet to discuss exactly what might change. A sticking point could be PCR testing. The government has argued so far that it's needed for all travellers to catch variants of concern as early as possible, but the industry say these expensive tests are putting off travellers. Winter is approaching and travel companies need to make decisions about their future operations: they are waiting anxiously to see which way the government will go. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: ""The government's travel requirements have choked off this summer's travel trade - putting jobs, businesses and the UK's connectivity at risk. ""While our European neighbours have been travelling freely and safely, the British were subject to expensive measures which have stood in the way of people visiting family and friends, taking that much-needed foreign holiday and making important business connections. ""The government needs to wake up to the damage its policies are doing to the UK travel industry and the impact they will have on the wider economic recovery."" Abta urged the government to extend the furlough scheme for travel businesses alongside a package of tailored financial support for the industry. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Our top priority is to protect public health. Decisions on our traffic light system are kept under regular review and are informed by the latest risk assessment from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and wider public health factors. ""We recognise the challenging times facing the travel sector, which is why we have committed around Â£7bn of support by September 2021 and continue to work with industry to help them navigate this difficult period.""

Andrew Neil quits GB News three months after launch,"Andrew Neil has resigned as chairman and lead presenter of GB News, just three months after helping to launch the channel. Neil, 72, was on air for less than two weeks before announcing he was taking a break. The former BBC political presenter will continue to contribute to GB News as a regular guest commentator. In a statement, he said he had decided to ""reduce my commitments on a number of fronts"". He added: ""Over the summer I've had time to reflect on my extensive portfolio of interests and decided it was time to cut back."" ""I wish GB News well in continuing to fulfil its founding promise and mission to reach audiences currently underserved by existing news broadcasters."" Allow Twitter content?

A statement from GB News said: ""Andrew is without doubt one of the finest journalists and interviewers in this country. ""GB News thanks him for his 12 months of leadership, wisdom and advice, and we wish him well."" Andrew Neil was more than just another presenter on GB News - he was the face of the channel, its chairman and the lead presenter of its flagship evening programme. To go on a summer holiday after just eight programmes naturally attracted attention, and when that holiday continued for more than two months, it was clear something was going on. The channel was launched with a strong editorial vision to cover stories that Neil said were neglected by other broadcasters and to counter a ""metropolitan mindset"". There were a few technical problems at the start but early viewing figures were, for a news channel, good. Its desire to challenge the BBC and Sky looked a possibility, but since those early days much has changed. The Andrew Neil slot - which has been covered by Colin Brazier during this long summer holiday - was at the beginning of September sometimes attracting fewer than ten thousand viewers. Some programmes were getting even lower ratings. The line-up of presenters has also changed, most notably the arrival of Nigel Farage, who is drawing their biggest audience. The channel's direction, taking on what it calls ""woke"" and ""cancel"" culture, is clear. Neil may continue as an occasional commentator, but the face and character of the channel is now more Farage than Neil. Neil left the BBC after 25 years following the US presidential election last November. He then turned his attention to launching GB News in mid-June, with the channel promising to ""change the face of news and debate in the UK"". However, he was said to have gone on leave at the end of June. He did not return, and earlier this month it was reported that relations between Neil and chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos had broken down over the direction of the company. The network recruited former UKIP leader Nigel Farage in his absence, to join ex-Sun journalist Dan Wootton and experienced news anchors Simon McCoy, who was recruited from the BBC, and Alastair Stewart, who was previously a newsreader on ITV News. Neil appeared in a commentator capacity on Nigel Farage's show on the network on Monday evening, with Farage emphasising Neil's new role as a regular GB News contributor. Farage briefly alluded to the media coverage, but did not comment beyond saying he had ""enormous respect"" for Neil. The journalist's departure comes two months after Guto Harri quit the network following a row over his decision to take the knee during a discussion about racism towards England's black footballers. Neil is next due to appear on BBC One's Question Time this Thursday.

Fake Walmart news story boosts crypto price,"Cryptocurrency Litecoin saw a sudden surge in price on Monday over a press release about Walmart accepting it for payment - which turned out to be fake. The release, published through a legitimate press channel, claimed that Walmart would accept the currency through all its digital stores. Walmart later told US media outlets the announcement was ""inauthentic"". By that time, several major news websites and press agencies had spread the supposed news. The announcement made it on to Globe Newswire, a service widely used to distribute press material from companies. The faked release has since been deleted, and did not appear on Walmart's own website. A tweet from a verified Litecoin Twitter account linking to the release has also been deleted. Hours later, the Litecoin Foundation tweeted that it had no such partnership. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But while it was being reported as fact, the price of Litecoin jumped from about Â£125 per token to close to Â£170, before falling back near its original price, at about Â£128. Globe Newswire said ""a fraudulent user account was used to issue an illegitimate press release"". ""This has never happened before,"" the company said in a statement - adding that it was bringing in ""enhanced authentication"" to stop it happening again. It did not detail exactly what went wrong or who was behind the fake release. But so called ""pump and dump"" schemes are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world - where bad actors attempt to raise hype around a coin, inflating its price, and quickly sell off their own stock before the market corrects itself. The false press release suggested that Litecoin would be accepted on all Walmart ecommerce platforms from 1 October. It contained quotes that appeared to come from both the Walmart chief executive and the founder of Litecoin. One clue to its nature was that a press contact email address pointed to a web domain which had been registered only last month. Emails to that address bounced as undeliverable. The fabrication was unmasked when CNBC reached representatives of Walmart by phone and were told the press release was fake. CNBC said it had been among the news organisations to publish the story before discovering it was not true. Walmart, the Litecoin Foundation, and Global Newswire have been contacted for comment. The announcement raised eyebrows among some sceptical observers because of the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can be an obstacle in using them for retail purchases. Other companies which have accepted Bitcoin have drawn up terms to limit their exposure to large price swings. For example, when Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin as a payment option for its cars, it made clear that the price was in US dollars - and that any quote in equivalent Bitcoin was only valid for a limited time window. It also said that if a refund was needed, Tesla would have the choice of whether to pay it back in US dollars or Bitcoin, which may work out as a lower cash value than what was paid. Similarly, PayPal recently introduced the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin - but it cannot be used to make payment purchases. Instead, the cryptocurrency assets will be sold for the right amount of real money to make the purchase.

Climate change: World now sees twice as many days over 50C,"The number of extremely hot days every year when the temperature reaches 50C has doubled since the 1980s, a global BBC analysis has found. They also now happen in more areas of the world than before, presenting unprecedented challenges to human health and to how we live. The total number of days above 50C (122F) has increased in each decade since 1980. On average, between 1980 and 2009, temperatures passed 50C about 14 days a year. The number rose to 26 days a year between 2010 and 2019. In the same period, temperatures of 45C and above occurred on average an extra two weeks a year. ""The increase can be 100% attributed to the burning of fossil fuels,"" says Dr Friederike Otto, associate director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford. A location refers to an individual area of the globe about 25 sq km. Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large area. The grids in this dataset are 0.25 degrees latitude by 0.25 degrees longitude. Locations displayed on the map above are those where the maximum temperature in a grid area went above 50C on a given day that year. The size of the circle plotted on the map relates to the number of days per year that crossed 50C at that specific location. The circles range in size from 1 to 25 days. When all years are represented, the circles show the total number of days over 50C at each point. The scale remains capped at 25 days for legibility. This analysis uses maximum daily temperatures from theglobal ERA5 dataset, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large area. Although each grid can contain different topographies, the data treats each grid area uniformly. ERA5 combines weather observations from many sources, such as stations and satellites, with data from weather forecasting models. This process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world. As the whole world warms, extreme temperatures become more likely. High heat can be deadly for humans and nature, and cause major problems to buildings, roads and power systems. Temperatures of 50C happen predominantly in the Middle East and Gulf regions. And after record-breaking temperatures of48.8C in Italyand49.6C in Canadathis summer,scientists have warned,externalthat days over 50C will happen elsewhere unless we cut fossil fuel emissions. ""We need to act quickly. The faster we cut our emissions, the better off we'll all be,"" says Dr Sihan Li, a climate researcher at the School of Geography and the Environment at the University of Oxford. ""With continued emissions and lack of action, not only will these extreme heat events become more severe and more frequent, but emergency response and recovery will become more challenging,"" warns Dr Li. The BBC analysis also found that in the most recent decade, maximum temperatures increased by 0.5C compared with the long-term average from 1980 to 2009. But these increases have not been felt equally around the world: Eastern Europe, southern Africa and Brazil saw some maximum temperatures rise by more than 1C, and parts of the Arctic and Middle East recorded increases of more than 2C. Scientists are calling for urgent action from world leaders at aUN summit in Glasgow in November, where governments will be asked to commit to new emissions cuts in order to limit global temperature rises. A really simple guide to climate change This BBC analysis launches a documentary series called Life at 50C investigating how extreme heat is affecting lives across the world. Even below 50C, high temperatures and humidity can create severe health risks. As many as 1.2 billion people around the world could face heat stress conditions by 2100 if current levels of global warming continue, according to astudy from Rutgers University in the US,externalpublished last year. That is at least four times more than those affected today. People are also facing difficult choices as the landscape around them changes, as extreme heat makes drought and wildfires more likely. While, other factors can contribute, climate change is also an important driving force behind desertification. Sheikh Kazem Al Kaabi is a wheat farmer from a village in central Iraq. The land around him was once fertile enough to sustain him and his neighbours, but it has gradually become dry and barren. ""All this land was green, but all of that is gone. Now it is a desert, drought."" Almost all the people from his village have moved away to look for work in other provinces. ""I lost my brother, dear friends and loyal neighbours. They shared everything with me, even my laughter. Now nobody shares anything with me, I'm just face-to-face with this empty land.""

What extreme heat does to the human body How extreme weather is linked to climate change It went over 50C in my area, why is it not featured? Reports of record temperatures usually come from measurements taken at an individual weather station, but the data we have studied represents larger areas than those covered by a single station. For example, Death Valley National Park in southern California is one of the hottest places on Earth. Temperatures in certain parts of the park regularly pass 50C in summer. But when creating an average for maximum temperatures for the wider area, using several different sources, a figure below 50C is reached. Where is the data from? The BBC has used the maximum daily temperatures from the high resolution global ERA5 dataset, produced by the Copernicus Climate Change Service. The data is often used to study global climate trends. ERA5 combines actual weather observations from many sources, such as stations and satellites, with data from modern weather forecasting models. The process fills in gaps created by poor station coverage in many parts of the world and helps us to understand climate change. What analysis have we done? Using the maximum temperature for every day from 1980 to 2020, we identified how often temperatures exceeded 50C. We counted the number of days and locations with a maximum temperature of 50C or higher for every year, to determine the trend over time. We also looked at the change in maximum temperatures. We did this by working out the difference between the average maximum temperature over land and sea for the most recent decade (2010-2019) compared with the 30 years before (1980-2009). Averages of at least 30 consecutive years are known as climatologies. These are used for showing how recent periods compare to a climate average. What do we mean by 'location'? Each location is represented by a grid square of roughly 25 km by 25 km, and about  27-28 km wide at the equator. These grid squares can cover large areas and may contain many different types of landscape. The grids are squares of 0.25 degrees latitude by 0.25 degrees longitude.

Resilient Raducanu basks in New York fame,"On Monday, Emma Raducanu posted this picture on Instagram, saying: 'Sightseeing in New York. Never thought I would see thisâ¦ coolest thing.' Less than three weeks ago, Emma Raducanu began battling for her place in the US Open main draw. On Monday, she stumbled across a giant billboard of her face on the streets of New York as she squeezed some sightseeing between appearances on prime-time American breakfast television. It is this unexpected, unpredictable change in circumstances that has made the 18-year-old's first Grand Slam title front-page news around the world. Raducanu has not only made British history as the country's first woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in 44 years, but becoming the first qualifier to win a major means she has made tennis history too. Despite the high stakes, the teenager has sailed through the past few weeks with a look of composed joy on her face and the fallout to the biggest win of her career has been no different. Raducanu looked as poised as ever when faced with the Good Morning America panel in the show's Times Square studio and there she explained how she reached such levels of resilience so young. ""From a young age I've always been brought up to have mental strength,"" she said on the ABC show. ""My parents played a huge part in my upbringing. They were pretty tough on me when I was young and it kind of shaped the way. ""I think now it is helping on the biggest stages in the world when you really need it."" Raducanu described her Chinese mother Renee and Romanian father Ian as her ""toughest critics"" and ""very hard to please"". ""But I got them with this one,"" she joked. ""They couldn't resist. ""It was really nice to talk to them after I won. They were just so happy and proud of me."" 'Raducanu's mental strength is special' Raducanu storms to US Open title - report & analysis 'I don't want to let go of the trophy' Later on Monday, Raducanu appeared at the Met Gala as she rubbed shoulders with some of the biggest names in the fashion and celebrity world This video can not be played Watch the best shots as Raducanu wins US Open As well as her parents, it seems Raducanu's coaching team has had an important role to play in keeping her grounded. The Canada-born player received a letter from the Queen after beating Leylah Fernandez in the final at Flushing Meadows and David Beckham and Lewis Hamilton were among the British sports stars to comment on her Instagram post with the trophy. Raducanu says she was ""honoured"" by the Queen's message and will be framing it and keeping it in her room, but it was only with those closest to her that she wanted to celebrate on the night. ""I haven't even checked my messages yet,"" she said. ""I've just been trying to enjoy the moment. With my team the night of the final we just had a really nice night reflecting. ""Everything has gone so fast. We were taking care of every single day and before you know it three weeks had gone. ""We just got to reflect and share a few stories and it was a really nice night to have with everyone.""

As if further proof were needed that Raducanu is not getting ahead of herself, in one post-match interview the first use she could think of for her Â£1.8m prize money was a pair of headphones to replace some she lost in the changing rooms after her first-round qualifying win. Now ranked 23rd in the world - having climbed 127 places in two weeks - and the new British number one, Raducanu is eager to keep up the hard work. She suggested her retirement during a fourth-round match at Wimbledon against Ajla Tomljanovic due to breathing difficulties was a fitness issue, but believes that adversity was an important step in her rise to the top. ""I took away that it was for me more of a physical issue,"" she said. ""To win a Grand Slam you need a lot of mental strength so I think the resilience part of it sort of speaks for itself. ""I needed to go through all of that to win a Slam. Physically I've still got a lot of work to do because I'm still new to the game and haven't had time to really develop. ""On tour for the last four or five weeks I think naturally with each match and tournament I've played I've just increased my endurance a bit."" This video can not be played 'Incredibly special' Raducanu is a 'one-off' - Sue Barker Raducanu may yet compete in the Indian Wells tournament which begins in California on 7 October, although she would have to enter the WTA event as a wildcard because the entry list has already been published. The season-ending WTA Finals take place in Guadalajara, Mexico in November and the year's top-eight players will qualify. Making the grade for that event is a big ask for Raducanu but, after the past few weeks, if anyone is up to the challenge it is surely the newly crowned US Open champion.

Vaccine passport spot checks 'an option' for events,"Scotland's vaccine passport scheme may feature spot checks for large scale events such as football matches. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said such a move could ""potentially"" be introduced when the scheme goes live on 1 October. It came after the head of Scotland's professional football league said it would be""very difficult""to check that all fans had a vaccine passport. Plans to introduce the scheme in Englandhave been scrapped. Scotland's vaccine certification scheme means people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of a Covid vaccine before they are allowed entry to nightclubs and major events. This includes outdoor events of more than 10,000, which will cover football matches involving larger clubs. Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October What do we know about the vaccine passport? England vaccine passport plans ditched, Sajid Javid says Mr Yousaf was asked about the practical difficulties of vaccine passports on BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme. The health minister quoted from apaper published in advance of last week's Holyrood debate,externalon the issue which stated: ""What is proportionate on entry to a nightclub of 200 people may not be proportionate, or possible, in an event crowd of 60,000."" He added: ""We acknowledged that for a different setting you are going to have to have, probably, different rules depending on that setting and you wouldn't want any adverse impacts, for example lots of people queuing and then potentially any crowd trouble that would follow on from there."" Questioned specifically about spot checks, he told the programme: ""That is absolutely an option that we are happy to consider."" People will need to show a QR code before they are allowed into some venues The health secretary said he was ""surprised"" by the decision to ditch the vaccine passport scheme in England and questioned whether it was taken on public health or political grounds. Mr Yousaf also said ministers were ""still working"" on the definition of a nightclub. Meanwhile, Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser welcomed the UK government's decision to abandon vaccine passports and said Scotland should now follow suit. ""The Scottish government have made a decision in the absence of evidence,"" he said. Mr Fraser also branded the plan ""half baked"". He added: ""Now it seems that they're considering spot checks, but only after football clubs made it clear their plan was unworkable. ""The scheme will come into force in a matter of weeks and the SNP still can't provide any clarity on key questions surrounding its implementation."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton welcomed the move to abandon vaccine passports south of the border. He said: ""It's sad to see that the Conservative government in Westminster has more concern for medical privacy than the SNP-Green coalition in Scotland does. ""The solution to the current crisis is vaccinations and a functioning contact tracing system, not Covid ID cards. ""You shouldn't have to share your private medical information with someone who is not your clinician."" Prof Devi Sridhar, of the University of Edinburgh, told Good Morning Scotland that the country needed to rely on testing and vaccines to keep the NHS running and the economy open. She said: ""We have seen internationally other places that have raced ahead with vaccine passports. Look at New York City. Look at France. Look at Denmark. ""And what they have found is that this is a way to keep businesses open, increase consumer confidence - so actually some of the big spenders in their 40s and 50s do go to these venues -  and, in a way, increase uptake among young people."" On Sunday the SPFL's Neil Doncaster said the only way to make the scheme work would be tocarry out spot checks to avoid lengthy queues and possible disorder. Mr Doncaster told BBC Scotland'sThe Sunday Showthat the SPFL was ""hugely concerned"" about the practicalities of delivering the scheme. The football executive said blanket inspections of vaccine certification would risk ""disorder"" as frustrated fans turned up for games ahead of kick-off. He added: ""I think it can work, but I think spot-checking is frankly the only practical reality because if you are expecting football clubs to vaccine-passport-check 30,000 or 40,000 people in the minutes before kick-off, that's simply not going to happen. ""I don't think it's achievable, realistically."" The vaccine passport plan wasformally approved by Holyroodlast week after the SNP and Scottish Greens voted in favour. Some businesses have complained of a lack of detail about how the scheme will work in practice. The proposals were opposed by the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats.

Covid jab rollout for 12-to-15s to start in England's schools,"All children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. Invitations for jabs will begin soon - parental consent will be sought for the schools-based vaccination programme. It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education. It is hoped the first jabs in England would take place by 22 September, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government would""move to implement the advice as quickly as possible"". She said that drop-in clinics would open for any 12 to 15-year-old who had read information and, in discussion with parents and carers were able to make an informed decision, from next week. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said the move will help toprotect young people from catching the virus. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said parentswill have to weigh up the ""risks and benefits"". On Monday, the UK's four chief medical officers recommended the single dose for 12 to 15-year-olds - who are deemed at very low risk from the disease - saying factors such as disruption to education tipped the balance. Prof Chris Whitty, the lead CMO for the UK, said it was a ""difficult decision"" and should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"". But he said it could be an ""important and useful tool"" in reducing school disruption in the coming months - and when combined with the marginal health benefit identified by vaccine advisory body the JCVI, it meant offering a Covid vaccine to all children was appropriate. Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision NHS England prepares jabs plan for 12-15-year-olds Will parents have to give permission for children's jabs? Mr Zahawi said the School Age Immunisation Service would deliver the ""bulk"" of the programme, with separate vaccination sites used for schools where this was not possible. He said clinicians would share information on the vaccine with parents and if there was a difference in opinion between a parent and child, a clinician would bring them together to try and reach a consensus. However, in the rare cases agreement is not reached, the child could give consent themselvesif the clinician considered them ""competent"",external, he added. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said some of the union's members had already received letters from pressure groups threatening legal action if vaccination took place in schools. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any advice to parents and children on the vaccine should come from health professionals rather than teachers to avoid any ""unpleasantness"" in schools. There's a reason this decision-making process has been so long and, at times, seemingly painful - it's such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal - and not enough to warrant going ahead with a mass vaccination programme. And add in the benefit from limiting school disruption and you only just get there. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop 30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and spread of the virus in the coming months which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed days of in-person schooling - or one day for every 20 children. The attention given to this issue is, perhaps, rather disproportionate. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said he accepted the recommendation from the chief medical officers aimed at protecting young people from catching Covid, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom. ""Our outstanding NHS stands ready to move forward with rolling out the vaccine to this group with the same sense of urgency we've had at every point in our vaccination programme,"" he said. Children with health conditions and those living with clinically vulnerable people have already been told they can have the vaccine - and are being offered two doses. This accounts for around one in eight of the three million children in this age group.

Campaigners block M25 junctions in climate protest,"This video can not be played Aerial footage showed long queues of traffic Climate change protesters blocked five M25 junctions, causing long tailbacks and disruption for motorists. There were protests at junctions 20 for Kings Langley, Herts, 14 for Heathrow terminal four, three for Swanley in Kent, six for Godstone, Surrey and 31 for Lakeside, Essex. They have since been reopened but police said 42 people were arrested. Protest group Insulate Britaintweeted,externalit was ""disrupting the M25"" to ""demand the government insulate Britain"". A government spokeswoman condemned the protests and said it was supporting people to install energy efficiency measures in their homes. Hertfordshire Police said 18 people were arrested after officers were called to a protest near junction 20 at about 08:00 BST. Supt Adam Willmot said: ""Protesters ignored police requests to move location, so we took robust action to enable roads to be reopened and to remove the protesters causing obstructions."" The force closed the slip roads in both directions, which led to ""congestion and delays on both the M25 and the A41"", but the closures had lifted by 10:20 BST. The group said action would go on until a ""meaningful commitment"" was made by the government A government spokeswoman said ""resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions"" Essex Police said 12 people were arrested after it was called to reports that a number of people were blocking the road near junction 31 just before 08:15 BST. It said officers worked to resolve the situation ""quickly and safely"", which included shutting the slip road temporarily. Ch Insp Paul Austin said the action caused ""significant disruption"" and thanked drivers for their ""patience and understanding.""

Clive Farnham from Crawleytweeted,externalthat they should ""have a protest on the side of the road "" and ""allow others to go about their business"", while Lauraasked the group,externalif they had ""thought about the pollution you are causing to the environment with the tailbacks of 15/20 miles on several sections of the m25 which makes it all a joke"". Green Party member, Matt Hill, thanked the protesters andtweeted,externalthat while he was ""frustrated and concerned"" that his son was late for college, he was ""nowhere near as concerned as I am for his future if we don't act urgently to address our climate emergency"". In a statement on itswebsite,external, Insulate Britain said that Monday's disruption was ""just the start"". ""Actions will continue until the government makes a meaningful commitment to insulate Britain's 29 million leaky homes, some of the oldest and most energy inefficient in Europe,"" it said. It added that its demands were delivered by hand to 10 Downing Street on 21 August, but so far no-one in government had responded. Zoe Cohen from Insulate Britain told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We regret having to do this but we really have no other option. They're a group of ordinary people who've come together and put their bodies on the line. ""They're doing this because they're desperate for meaningful action from the government, and insulating our homes is the most efficient way to reduce our emissions and avoid climate catastrophe."" Supporter Liam Norton, 36, from London, said he was ""shocked at the lack of significant action"" from the government. ""It's a no-brainer. Insulating Britain will reduce emissions, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs and stop our elderly dying in cold homes each winter,"" he said. ""So stop messing about, Boris, and get on with the job. ""As soon as a statement is made that we can trust and is meaningful, we will get off the roads."" A government spokeswoman said: ""People's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted, especially on busy motorways where lives are put at risk and resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions. ""We are investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable."" The protesters say their goal is to raise the profile of insulation as an issue. They say it's absolutely central to tackling carbon emissions. There's definitely truth in that - heating our homes is a big component of personal carbon emissions. The AA say this is dangerous: they're blocking the road and could cause disruption to emergency vehicles. They say this backfires because it creates more delays and vehicles stuck in traffic create more emissions, so this is a ""lose"" for the protesters. The protesters say how else do you raise issues like insulation - get you and me talking about them - without these kinds of protests? It's a really interesting dilemma and an interesting evolution of direct action around climate. Do they stop at motorways? Where else are they going to go - and what other single-issue direct action protest groups might we see form? Were you stuck in traffic because of the protests today? Please share your experiences.

UK scraps Covid vaccine deal with Valneva,"French vaccine maker Valneva says the UK government has scrapped a deal for its Covid-19 vaccine. The UK had about 100 million doses on order, after it increased its request by 40 million in February. The firmsaid that the UK government,externalserved notice over allegations of a breach of the agreement, which it ""strenuously denies"". The government said the decision would have no impact on vaccine supply in the UK. ""The comments from the company will not have any impact on our vaccine supply and did not form any part of our vaccine rollout in autumn and winter,"" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has not yet approved the Valneva vaccine. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine What is happening at Scotland's Covid vaccine lab? 'The world needs greater vaccine supply' In a statement on its website, Valneva said: ""Valneva SE, a specialty vaccine company, today announced that it has received a termination notice from the UK Government (HMG) in relation to the Supply Agreement for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001. ""The contract provides HMG with the right to terminate. HMG has alleged that the company is in breach of its obligations under the supply agreement, but the company strenuously denies this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valneva's Scottish manufacturing site in January this year The firm said on Monday that results from its phase three trials were due later this year. It added: ""Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG's requests for variant-derived vaccines."" The company hopes that, dependent on the results of its continuing trials and sign-off from the UK's MHRA, initial approval could still be granted in 2021. Its vaccine is expected to be given as two doses and contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease, but should teach the body's immune system how to fight it. Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""We have enough supply even for a booster programme. I want to give absolute confidence to anyone listening that we have the supplies necessary to continue to vaccinate and particularly with a booster programme on the horizon."" Mr Yousaf said that while the announcement would be a big set-back for the Livingston plant, he would speak to Valneva to discuss its future. The Scottish Health Secretary added that he was waiting for further information from the UK government over Valneva's alleged failure to meet the terms of its contract. SNP MP Hannah Bardell, whose constituency contains the Valneva plant, said she was ""incredibly disappointed"" by the news. She pledged she would be ""working with Valneva - who have worked tirelessly on this vaccine - and will raise this urgently with the UK government"". Valneva is a French company but this was billed as the vaccine made in Scotland. I first visited the Livingston factory back in December 2020.  At that point, the UK government had already pre-ordered 60 million doses of their inactivated whole virus vaccine. The company has a background in making vaccines for other diseases and were hopeful their Covid-19 offering would have a good safety profile, perhaps making it suitable for children or those with compromised immune systems. Given the early supply issues we experienced with some of the other vaccines, having one made here in the UK was also seen as a bonus. The prime minister visited the factory earlier this year just as commercial production began and the order for Valneva's vaccine was increased to 100 million doses. Two hundred extra staff were brought in and additional production space was built. The Valneva vaccine was already being trialled as a potential booster and three weeks ago the company announced they had begun a rolling submission to regulators the MHRA with approval expected later this year. So what now?  The company say they were told over the weekend that the UK government is terminating the deal because of an alleged breach in the supply agreement, something Valneva deny.  They say work will continue to gain approval, but they may now look to other countries. Valneva said on Monday that it would also look to other potential customers to ensure that the vaccines can still be used in the fight against the pandemic. French President Emmanuel Macron faced criticism earlier this year after failing to secure doses from the company, which has its headquarters near Nantes. In March, he pledged that France's vaccination roll-out would have caught up with the UK's ""in a few weeks"" amid tensions over the vaccine supplies, although the country has since reached more than 90 million doses given. The Department for Health did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"Covid jab rollout to start in schools in EnglandParental consent will be sought for the programme for children aged 12 to 15, the government says.UK","All children aged 12 to 15 across the UK will be offered one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid jab. Invitations for jabs will begin soon - parental consent will be sought for the schools-based vaccination programme. It follows advice from the UK's chief medical officers, who say the jab will help reduce disruption to education. It is hoped the first jabs in England would take place by 22 September, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government would""move to implement the advice as quickly as possible"". She said that drop-in clinics would open for any 12 to 15-year-old who had read information and, in discussion with parents and carers were able to make an informed decision, from next week. Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann said the move will help toprotect young people from catching the virus. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan said parentswill have to weigh up the ""risks and benefits"". On Monday, the UK's four chief medical officers recommended the single dose for 12 to 15-year-olds - who are deemed at very low risk from the disease - saying factors such as disruption to education tipped the balance. Prof Chris Whitty, the lead CMO for the UK, said it was a ""difficult decision"" and should not be seen as a ""silver bullet"". But he said it could be an ""important and useful tool"" in reducing school disruption in the coming months - and when combined with the marginal health benefit identified by vaccine advisory body the JCVI, it meant offering a Covid vaccine to all children was appropriate. Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision NHS England prepares jabs plan for 12-15-year-olds Will parents have to give permission for children's jabs? Mr Zahawi said the School Age Immunisation Service would deliver the ""bulk"" of the programme, with separate vaccination sites used for schools where this was not possible. He said clinicians would share information on the vaccine with parents and if there was a difference in opinion between a parent and child, a clinician would bring them together to try and reach a consensus. However, in the rare cases agreement is not reached, the child could give consent themselvesif the clinician considered them ""competent"",external, he added. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said some of the union's members had already received letters from pressure groups threatening legal action if vaccination took place in schools. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme any advice to parents and children on the vaccine should come from health professionals rather than teachers to avoid any ""unpleasantness"" in schools. There's a reason this decision-making process has been so long and, at times, seemingly painful - it's such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal - and not enough to warrant going ahead with a mass vaccination programme. And add in the benefit from limiting school disruption and you only just get there. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop 30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and spread of the virus in the coming months which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed days of in-person schooling - or one day for every 20 children. The attention given to this issue is, perhaps, rather disproportionate. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said he accepted the recommendation from the chief medical officers aimed at protecting young people from catching Covid, reducing transmission in schools and keeping pupils in the classroom. ""Our outstanding NHS stands ready to move forward with rolling out the vaccine to this group with the same sense of urgency we've had at every point in our vaccination programme,"" he said. Children with health conditions and those living with clinically vulnerable people have already been told they can have the vaccine - and are being offered two doses. This accounts for around one in eight of the three million children in this age group.

"Campaigners block M25 junctions in climate protestPolice make more than 40 arrests at a series of co-ordinated protests around the motorway.Beds, Herts & Bucks","This video can not be played Aerial footage showed long queues of traffic Climate change protesters blocked five M25 junctions, causing long tailbacks and disruption for motorists. There were protests at junctions 20 for Kings Langley, Herts, 14 for Heathrow terminal four, three for Swanley in Kent, six for Godstone, Surrey and 31 for Lakeside, Essex. They have since been reopened but police said 42 people were arrested. Protest group Insulate Britaintweeted,externalit was ""disrupting the M25"" to ""demand the government insulate Britain"". A government spokeswoman condemned the protests and said it was supporting people to install energy efficiency measures in their homes. Hertfordshire Police said 18 people were arrested after officers were called to a protest near junction 20 at about 08:00 BST. Supt Adam Willmot said: ""Protesters ignored police requests to move location, so we took robust action to enable roads to be reopened and to remove the protesters causing obstructions."" The force closed the slip roads in both directions, which led to ""congestion and delays on both the M25 and the A41"", but the closures had lifted by 10:20 BST. The group said action would go on until a ""meaningful commitment"" was made by the government A government spokeswoman said ""resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions"" Essex Police said 12 people were arrested after it was called to reports that a number of people were blocking the road near junction 31 just before 08:15 BST. It said officers worked to resolve the situation ""quickly and safely"", which included shutting the slip road temporarily. Ch Insp Paul Austin said the action caused ""significant disruption"" and thanked drivers for their ""patience and understanding.""

Clive Farnham from Crawleytweeted,externalthat they should ""have a protest on the side of the road "" and ""allow others to go about their business"", while Lauraasked the group,externalif they had ""thought about the pollution you are causing to the environment with the tailbacks of 15/20 miles on several sections of the m25 which makes it all a joke"". Green Party member, Matt Hill, thanked the protesters andtweeted,externalthat while he was ""frustrated and concerned"" that his son was late for college, he was ""nowhere near as concerned as I am for his future if we don't act urgently to address our climate emergency"". In a statement on itswebsite,external, Insulate Britain said that Monday's disruption was ""just the start"". ""Actions will continue until the government makes a meaningful commitment to insulate Britain's 29 million leaky homes, some of the oldest and most energy inefficient in Europe,"" it said. It added that its demands were delivered by hand to 10 Downing Street on 21 August, but so far no-one in government had responded. Zoe Cohen from Insulate Britain told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We regret having to do this but we really have no other option. They're a group of ordinary people who've come together and put their bodies on the line. ""They're doing this because they're desperate for meaningful action from the government, and insulating our homes is the most efficient way to reduce our emissions and avoid climate catastrophe."" Supporter Liam Norton, 36, from London, said he was ""shocked at the lack of significant action"" from the government. ""It's a no-brainer. Insulating Britain will reduce emissions, provide hundreds of thousands of jobs and stop our elderly dying in cold homes each winter,"" he said. ""So stop messing about, Boris, and get on with the job. ""As soon as a statement is made that we can trust and is meaningful, we will get off the roads."" A government spokeswoman said: ""People's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted, especially on busy motorways where lives are put at risk and resulting traffic delays will only add to vehicle emissions. ""We are investing Â£1.3bn this year alone to support people to install energy efficiency measures, and our upcoming Heat and Buildings Strategy will set out how we decarbonise the nation's homes in a way that is fair, practical and affordable."" The protesters say their goal is to raise the profile of insulation as an issue. They say it's absolutely central to tackling carbon emissions. There's definitely truth in that - heating our homes is a big component of personal carbon emissions. The AA say this is dangerous: they're blocking the road and could cause disruption to emergency vehicles. They say this backfires because it creates more delays and vehicles stuck in traffic create more emissions, so this is a ""lose"" for the protesters. The protesters say how else do you raise issues like insulation - get you and me talking about them - without these kinds of protests? It's a really interesting dilemma and an interesting evolution of direct action around climate. Do they stop at motorways? Where else are they going to go - and what other single-issue direct action protest groups might we see form? Were you stuck in traffic because of the protests today? Please share your experiences.

Over $1bn pledged as UN warns of Afghan crisis,"Aid organisations have warned there is an urgent need for food and medical supplies More than $1bn (Â£720m) in aid has been pledged for Afghanistan, following warnings from the United Nations of a ""looming catastrophe"". The plea for global support was made at a conference in Geneva, following the Taliban's takeover last month. The UN said the country was facing a major humanitarian crisis. After decades of war and suffering, it was ""perhaps their most perilous hour"", Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. The poverty rate was ""spiralling"" and public services were close to collapse, he told the conference. ""Many people could run out of food by the end of this month just as winter approaches,"" he warned. The UN had called for $606m to be raised, saying this would bring ""vital relief"" to millions. Mr Guterres said it was unclear how much of the more than $1bn promised would go towards the UN appeal. The UN has urged the Taliban to give aid workers unimpeded access. Even before the Islamist militants retook control of Afghanistan in August, fighting had forced more than 550,000 people to flee their homes. An estimated 3.5 million people are currently internally displaced within the country. Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought. The conference on Monday was attended by top UN officials as well as aid organisations including the Red Cross and various governments. The UN said about a third of the money it was seeking to raise would be used by its World Food Programme (WFP), which earlier said many Afghans did not have access to cash to afford sufficient food. ""We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid food stocks running out,"" WFP deputy regional director Anthea Webb told Reuters news agency. EXPLAINED: How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? ANALYSIS: Afghanistan, its future, and why China matters CONTEXT: What's changed in Afghanistan in 20 years As well as pledging aid, officials told the conference of their concerns over Taliban abuses. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet accused the Taliban of contradicting their own public promises on human rights. She cited ""multiple"" allegations of Taliban forces conducting house-to-house searches for former officials, and said women had been ""progressively excluded"" from public life. The BBC has found thatat least 20 civilians were killed in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley,which has seen fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces. In a statement echoed by other officials, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said respecting basic rights would be a ""benchmark... in determining our future engagement with a new Afghan government - including for possible development assistance"". Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted that he had arrived in Kabul on Monday to ""assess the country's acute humanitarian needs"". Thousands of people have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul on 15 August following a rapid offensive. On Monday, a special Pakistan International Airlines flight arrived in Kabul to take passengers to Islamabad. ""I will come back here only if the situation allows women to work and move freely,"" one 35-year-old evacuee told AFP news agency. In a separate development, Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban co-founder and new deputy prime minister of Afghanistan, issued an apparent audio statement after reports that he had died spread on social media. ""I have been away on trips,"" he said in the clip. ""Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine, all my brothers and friends.""

Andrew Neil resigns from GB News,"Andrew Neil has resigned as chairman and lead presenter of GB News, just three months after helping to launch the channel. Neil, 72, was on air for less than two weeks before announcing he was taking a break. The former BBC political presenter will continue to contribute to GB News as a regular guest commentator. In a statement, he said he had decided to ""reduce my commitments on a number of fronts"". He added: ""Over the summer I've had time to reflect on my extensive portfolio of interests and decided it was time to cut back."" ""I wish GB News well in continuing to fulfil its founding promise and mission to reach audiences currently underserved by existing news broadcasters."" Allow Twitter content?

A statement from GB News said: ""Andrew is without doubt one of the finest journalists and interviewers in this country. ""GB News thanks him for his 12 months of leadership, wisdom and advice, and we wish him well."" Andrew Neil was more than just another presenter on GB News - he was the face of the channel, its chairman and the lead presenter of its flagship evening programme. To go on a summer holiday after just eight programmes naturally attracted attention, and when that holiday continued for more than two months, it was clear something was going on. The channel was launched with a strong editorial vision to cover stories that Neil said were neglected by other broadcasters and to counter a ""metropolitan mindset"". There were a few technical problems at the start but early viewing figures were, for a news channel, good. Its desire to challenge the BBC and Sky looked a possibility, but since those early days much has changed. The Andrew Neil slot - which has been covered by Colin Brazier during this long summer holiday - was at the beginning of September sometimes attracting fewer than ten thousand viewers. Some programmes were getting even lower ratings. The line-up of presenters has also changed, most notably the arrival of Nigel Farage, who is drawing their biggest audience. The channel's direction, taking on what it calls ""woke"" and ""cancel"" culture, is clear. Neil may continue as an occasional commentator, but the face and character of the channel is now more Farage than Neil. Neil left the BBC after 25 years following the US presidential election last November. He then turned his attention to launching GB News in mid-June, with the channel promising to ""change the face of news and debate in the UK"". However, he was said to have gone on leave at the end of June. He did not return, and earlier this month it was reported that relations between Neil and chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos had broken down over the direction of the company. The network recruited former UKIP leader Nigel Farage in his absence, to join ex-Sun journalist Dan Wootton and experienced news anchors Simon McCoy, who was recruited from the BBC, and Alastair Stewart, who was previously a newsreader on ITV News. Neil appeared in a commentator capacity on Nigel Farage's show on the network on Monday evening, with Farage emphasising Neil's new role as a regular GB News contributor. Farage briefly alluded to the media coverage, but did not comment beyond saying he had ""enormous respect"" for Neil. The journalist's departure comes two months after Guto Harri quit the network following a row over his decision to take the knee during a discussion about racism towards England's black footballers. Neil is next due to appear on BBC One's Question Time this Thursday.

"300,000 suspected of breaking travel quarantine","Labour said the figures obtained by the BBC suggested the policy enforcing quarantine on arrivals was ""lax"" Nearly a third of people arriving in England and Northern Ireland as the coronavirus Delta variant took off may have broken quarantine rules. More than 300,000 cases were passed to investigators between March and May, according to figures seen by the BBC. The government was not able to say how many of these were found to have broken the rules or could not be traced. The Home Office has said it aims to pay home visits to all travellers suspected of not following the rules. But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the figures obtained by the BBC ""confirm our worst fears"" about the government's ""lax border policy"". And he accused the Home Office of ""gross negligence"". Which countries have been added to the green list? What is the Delta variant and is it more dangerous? Test and Trace fault 'helped new variant spread' It comes asthe UK's four chief medical officers recommendvaccinating healthy children aged between 12 and 15 - as part of a series of measures to control the virus this winter. It will now be up to ministers whether to accept the recommendation of the four CMOs. Earlier this year, the government introduced new rules for people arriving from abroad in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus and stop new variants arriving in the country. People arriving from high-risk countries - deemed ""red list"" - had to quarantine in a hotel. Those coming from ""amber list"" - or medium-risk areas - were required to self-isolate for 10 days and provide evidence of negative Covid tests. From 17 March to 31 May more than a million people arrived in England and Northern Ireland from amber list countries. Figures for this period obtained under Freedom of Information laws show a total of 301,076 cases were referred to investigators for checks on whether they were self-isolating. During this time, the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus - first detected in India - was spreading rapidly through the country. Some travellers had to quarantine in hotels, rather than at home Call handlers employed by the Department of Health and Social Care were tasked with contacting arrivals to check they were obeying the self-isolation and testing rules. Cases where the contact ended the call, refused to co-operate, indicated they would break the quarantine or testing rules, or could not be contacted after three attempts were referred to investigators at the Border Force Criminal Justice Unit and the police. Officers would then attempt to visit the contact at home to check they were following the rules. After 26 April, the Home Office hired private contractor Mitie to carry out home visits to international travellers required to isolate, from contacts supplied by NHS Test and Trace. ""We visit over 99% of the cases referred to this service by NHS Test and Trace,"" a government spokesman said. In Wales, the Arriving Travellers Team is responsible for monitoring compliance with the rules - including escalating cases to regional teams to undertake doorstep visits if deemed necessary. And in Scotland, quarantine measures are monitored by Public Health Scotland through the National Contact Tracing Centre. PHS has the ability to refer to cases to Police Scotland. Henrik Pakula isolated at home after returning from Poland On 1 April, Henrik Pakula began 10 days of isolation at home after returning to England from Poland, where he had been visiting relatives. ""On day one I received a phone call just asking me if I knew the rules on self-isolation, and informing me that there could be random phone calls over the next 10 days just to check I was still at home, but none of those calls materialised,"" he said. ""I could have nipped out to the supermarket if I had so desired - no-one would have checked, no-one would have known. ""I got a text message saying these were the rules but there was no contact with anybody at all. ""I knew I had to isolate for 10 days, which I did, but it was taken on trust."" Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said the quarantine system ""very much relied on the honesty of people to do the right thing, rather than any type of meaningful enforcement"". ""There's limited point in putting rules in place if you don't enforce them,"" she added. Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said: ""We've been concerned throughout that there just weren't proper follow-ups on the checks that were done, and as a result you just had these huge gaps in the home quarantine system and that's what made it easier for the Delta variant to spread."" But Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport Committee, said: ""There was a balancing act from government... would we have had the resources to check every single person who was quarantining at home? Of course not - so we always knew those risks were in the system"". Have you broken quarantine rules? Please share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Fake Walmart news story boosts crypto priceA news story claiming Walmart would accept cryptocurrency Litecoin was fabricated, the retail giant says.Technology","Cryptocurrency Litecoin saw a sudden surge in price on Monday over a press release about Walmart accepting it for payment - which turned out to be fake. The release, published through a legitimate press channel, claimed that Walmart would accept the currency through all its digital stores. Walmart later told US media outlets the announcement was ""inauthentic"". By that time, several major news websites and press agencies had spread the supposed news. The announcement made it on to Globe Newswire, a service widely used to distribute press material from companies. The faked release has since been deleted, and did not appear on Walmart's own website. A tweet from a verified Litecoin Twitter account linking to the release has also been deleted. Hours later, the Litecoin Foundation tweeted that it had no such partnership. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But while it was being reported as fact, the price of Litecoin jumped from about Â£125 per token to close to Â£170, before falling back near its original price, at about Â£128. Globe Newswire said ""a fraudulent user account was used to issue an illegitimate press release"". ""This has never happened before,"" the company said in a statement - adding that it was bringing in ""enhanced authentication"" to stop it happening again. It did not detail exactly what went wrong or who was behind the fake release. But so called ""pump and dump"" schemes are not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world - where bad actors attempt to raise hype around a coin, inflating its price, and quickly sell off their own stock before the market corrects itself. The false press release suggested that Litecoin would be accepted on all Walmart ecommerce platforms from 1 October. It contained quotes that appeared to come from both the Walmart chief executive and the founder of Litecoin. One clue to its nature was that a press contact email address pointed to a web domain which had been registered only last month. Emails to that address bounced as undeliverable. The fabrication was unmasked when CNBC reached representatives of Walmart by phone and were told the press release was fake. CNBC said it had been among the news organisations to publish the story before discovering it was not true. Walmart, the Litecoin Foundation, and Global Newswire have been contacted for comment. The announcement raised eyebrows among some sceptical observers because of the volatility of cryptocurrency prices, which can be an obstacle in using them for retail purchases. Other companies which have accepted Bitcoin have drawn up terms to limit their exposure to large price swings. For example, when Tesla briefly accepted Bitcoin as a payment option for its cars, it made clear that the price was in US dollars - and that any quote in equivalent Bitcoin was only valid for a limited time window. It also said that if a refund was needed, Tesla would have the choice of whether to pay it back in US dollars or Bitcoin, which may work out as a lower cash value than what was paid. Similarly, PayPal recently introduced the ability to buy and sell Bitcoin - but it cannot be used to make payment purchases. Instead, the cryptocurrency assets will be sold for the right amount of real money to make the purchase.

"Afghans face most perilous hour, UN warns","Aid organisations have warned there is an urgent need for food and medical supplies More than $1bn (Â£720m) in aid has been pledged for Afghanistan, following warnings from the United Nations of a ""looming catastrophe"". The plea for global support was made at a conference in Geneva, following the Taliban's takeover last month. The UN said the country was facing a major humanitarian crisis. After decades of war and suffering, it was ""perhaps their most perilous hour"", Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. The poverty rate was ""spiralling"" and public services were close to collapse, he told the conference. ""Many people could run out of food by the end of this month just as winter approaches,"" he warned. The UN had called for $606m to be raised, saying this would bring ""vital relief"" to millions. Mr Guterres said it was unclear how much of the more than $1bn promised would go towards the UN appeal. The UN has urged the Taliban to give aid workers unimpeded access. Even before the Islamist militants retook control of Afghanistan in August, fighting had forced more than 550,000 people to flee their homes. An estimated 3.5 million people are currently internally displaced within the country. Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought. The conference on Monday was attended by top UN officials as well as aid organisations including the Red Cross and various governments. The UN said about a third of the money it was seeking to raise would be used by its World Food Programme (WFP), which earlier said many Afghans did not have access to cash to afford sufficient food. ""We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid food stocks running out,"" WFP deputy regional director Anthea Webb told Reuters news agency. EXPLAINED: How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? ANALYSIS: Afghanistan, its future, and why China matters CONTEXT: What's changed in Afghanistan in 20 years As well as pledging aid, officials told the conference of their concerns over Taliban abuses. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet accused the Taliban of contradicting their own public promises on human rights. She cited ""multiple"" allegations of Taliban forces conducting house-to-house searches for former officials, and said women had been ""progressively excluded"" from public life. The BBC has found thatat least 20 civilians were killed in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley,which has seen fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces. In a statement echoed by other officials, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said respecting basic rights would be a ""benchmark... in determining our future engagement with a new Afghan government - including for possible development assistance"". Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted that he had arrived in Kabul on Monday to ""assess the country's acute humanitarian needs"". Thousands of people have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul on 15 August following a rapid offensive. On Monday, a special Pakistan International Airlines flight arrived in Kabul to take passengers to Islamabad. ""I will come back here only if the situation allows women to work and move freely,"" one 35-year-old evacuee told AFP news agency. In a separate development, Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban co-founder and new deputy prime minister of Afghanistan, issued an apparent audio statement after reports that he had died spread on social media. ""I have been away on trips,"" he said in the clip. ""Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine, all my brothers and friends."" The BBC has not been able to verify the recording, which was posted on a number of official Taliban websites.

"300,000 suspected of breaking travel quarantineIt comes as the prime minister prepares to announce his winter Covid plan, including for booster jabs.UK PoliticsComments","Labour said the figures obtained by the BBC suggested the policy enforcing quarantine on arrivals was ""lax"" Nearly a third of people arriving in England and Northern Ireland as the coronavirus Delta variant took off may have broken quarantine rules. More than 300,000 cases were passed to investigators between March and May, according to figures seen by the BBC. The government was not able to say how many of these were found to have broken the rules or could not be traced. The Home Office has said it aims to pay home visits to all travellers suspected of not following the rules. But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the figures obtained by the BBC ""confirm our worst fears"" about the government's ""lax border policy"". And he accused the Home Office of ""gross negligence"". Which countries have been added to the green list? What is the Delta variant and is it more dangerous? Test and Trace fault 'helped new variant spread' It comes asthe UK's four chief medical officers recommendvaccinating healthy children aged between 12 and 15 - as part of a series of measures to control the virus this winter. It will now be up to ministers whether to accept the recommendation of the four CMOs. Earlier this year, the government introduced new rules for people arriving from abroad in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus and stop new variants arriving in the country. People arriving from high-risk countries - deemed ""red list"" - had to quarantine in a hotel. Those coming from ""amber list"" - or medium-risk areas - were required to self-isolate for 10 days and provide evidence of negative Covid tests. From 17 March to 31 May more than a million people arrived in England and Northern Ireland from amber list countries. Figures for this period obtained under Freedom of Information laws show a total of 301,076 cases were referred to investigators for checks on whether they were self-isolating. During this time, the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus - first detected in India - was spreading rapidly through the country. Some travellers had to quarantine in hotels, rather than at home Call handlers employed by the Department of Health and Social Care were tasked with contacting arrivals to check they were obeying the self-isolation and testing rules. Cases where the contact ended the call, refused to co-operate, indicated they would break the quarantine or testing rules, or could not be contacted after three attempts were referred to investigators at the Border Force Criminal Justice Unit and the police. Officers would then attempt to visit the contact at home to check they were following the rules. After 26 April, the Home Office hired private contractor Mitie to carry out home visits to international travellers required to isolate, from contacts supplied by NHS Test and Trace. ""We visit over 99% of the cases referred to this service by NHS Test and Trace,"" a government spokesman said. In Wales, the Arriving Travellers Team is responsible for monitoring compliance with the rules - including escalating cases to regional teams to undertake doorstep visits if deemed necessary. And in Scotland, quarantine measures are monitored by Public Health Scotland through the National Contact Tracing Centre. PHS has the ability to refer to cases to Police Scotland. Henrik Pakula isolated at home after returning from Poland On 1 April, Henrik Pakula began 10 days of isolation at home after returning to England from Poland, where he had been visiting relatives. ""On day one I received a phone call just asking me if I knew the rules on self-isolation, and informing me that there could be random phone calls over the next 10 days just to check I was still at home, but none of those calls materialised,"" he said. ""I could have nipped out to the supermarket if I had so desired - no-one would have checked, no-one would have known. ""I got a text message saying these were the rules but there was no contact with anybody at all. ""I knew I had to isolate for 10 days, which I did, but it was taken on trust."" Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said the quarantine system ""very much relied on the honesty of people to do the right thing, rather than any type of meaningful enforcement"". ""There's limited point in putting rules in place if you don't enforce them,"" she added. Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said: ""We've been concerned throughout that there just weren't proper follow-ups on the checks that were done, and as a result you just had these huge gaps in the home quarantine system and that's what made it easier for the Delta variant to spread."" But Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport Committee, said: ""There was a balancing act from government... would we have had the resources to check every single person who was quarantining at home? Of course not - so we always knew those risks were in the system"". Have you broken quarantine rules? Please share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Primark: Leggings still popular as comfort rules,"Primark says the trend for ""comfort wear"" has continued through the summer, with strong sales of leisurewear such as leggings and cycle shorts. Demand also rose for seam-free matching separates for women, as many people stayed in the UK for their holidays. However, sales at Primark were lower than expected, with sales in June and July being affected by the ""pingdemic"". The retailer also said it had seen some delays to stock because of ""port and container freight disruptions"". Despite this, Primark owner Associated British Foods said its profits were set to beat expectations. The move to working from home during the coronavirus restrictions led to a surge in demand for casual clothing as people no longer had to wear smart outfits for the office. Loungewear, defined as being a hybrid between pyjamas and track suits, has been particularly popular, as well as athleisure goods such as matching sets of sports bras, leggings and hoodies. Many brands and fashion designers, including London's fashionable Saville Row tailors,have pivoted to creating gymwear and loungewear linesin order to generate sales during the lockdowns. This video can not be played Savile Row shops pivot to loungewear Primark said it had enjoyed very strong trade in the third quarter of its financial year, which coincided with the relaxation of Covid measures, but then conditions became tougher. ""In the UK our sales were affected by the rapid and significant increase in late June and early July in the number of people required to self-isolate following contact tracing alerts - the 'pingdemic'. Data shows that High Street footfall was impacted by the caution displayed by many consumers at that time."" However, after self-isolation rules were eased in early August, Primark said it saw a ""consistent improvement through the period from a decline of 24% in the first four weeks of the quarter to a decline of 8% in the last four weeks"". Primark shoppers offered in-store vaccinations 'I returned my suits and spent Â£100 on joggers' Primark's sales for the second half of its financial year are expected to reach Â£3.4bn. It said sales of its autumn/winter range were doing well, and it had seen strong demand for its back-to-school products. It said disruption to ports and container freight meant it had suffered ""some delays"" to supplies, although John Bason, finance director of Associated British Foods, told the PA news agency the group had ""no worries"" about stock levels for Christmas. ""There has been supply chain disruption but our team has worked incredibly hard to mitigate this so I don't anticipate this being an issue for customers,"" he told PA. ""We are definitely seeing a lot of inflationary pressures in different parts of our supply chain, but there is absolutely no intention to put prices up in Primark because of it."" Gemma Boothroyd, an analyst at investment platform Freetrade, said:  ""Even with dwindling in-store sales, Primark has managed to maintain its market share compared to the same period two years ago. ""That's a notable feat given the number of new digital entrants,"" Primark was particularly hard hit during the Covid lockdowns as it does not sell its clothes online. By contrast, fast fashion retailers online enjoyed significant growth as consumers changed their shopping habits. In its latest update, Primark said it would launch a ""new and improved customer-facing website"" in the next 12 months, which would allow it ""to showcase a much larger proportion of the Primark range and to provide customers with range availability by store"". But Freetrade's Ms Boothroyd noted this was not a ""full-scale sales site"", but ""more of a tool for shoppers to check in-store inventory prior to hitting the shops"". ""If anything, this seems likely to result in decreased sales for the brand. After all, isn't it the uncertainty and thrill of hunting for a bargain that gets Primark shoppers in-store in the first place?"" she said. ""For now, Primark's proven it has staying power, but if it's finally going to go digital, it needs to do it right. Otherwise, it's going to find itself in an omnichannel no man's land.""

LiveLiveMedical experts to give update on jabs for children1 minute ago,"The UKâs four Chief Medical Officers have recommended all children aged 12-15 should be vaccinated against Covid They have agreed that children of those ages should be given one dose of the Pfizer vaccine to help prevent education being disrupted A final decision on rollout will be taken by ministers in the four nations of the UK The UK recorded 30,825 new coronavirus cases on Monday, and 61 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Boris Johnson confirms he'll announce his Covid winter strategy on Tuesday, saying he'll be ""setting it all out tomorrow"" The PM says he's ""very confident in the steps that we've taken"" but won't rule out a winter lockdown Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says nobody wants another lockdown and the best way to avoid it is to be cautious and use practical measures And Sir Keir says he will back vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds if the scientific advice is that it's safe French vaccine maker Valneva says the UK government has scrapped a deal for its Covid vaccine Edited by James Clarke That's all from us on a busy day of coronavirus news. These updates have been brought to you by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Sinead Wilson, Emma Harrison, Rob Corp and James Clarke. We'll be back with more tomorrow. Masks have been in evidence on the first day back at school in New York City And this is what's been happening around the world: Prof Chris Whitty, Dr June Raine and Prof Wei Shen Lim were at the briefing in Downing Street As we've almost come to the end of today's live page, here's a brief round-up of the key news lines in the UK:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Thereâs a reason this decision-making process has been so
painful â it is such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from
Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal â and
not enough to warrant going ahead with it. Even in terms of limiting school disruption, the modelling
suggests the benefits may only be small. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are
less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age
children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop
30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and
spread of the virus in the coming months, which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed
days of in-person schooling â or one day for every 20 children. Primark says the trend for ""comfort wear"" has continued through the summer, with strong sales of leisurewear such as leggings and cycle shorts. Demand also rose for seam-free matching separates for women, as many people stayed in the UK for their holidays. However, sales at Primark were lower than expected, withsales in June and July being affected by the ""pingdemic"". It comes after the boss of clothing brand Bodendeclared formal office wear over. Johnnie Boden says: ""Because of Covid and working from home women have all felt a freedom to wear what they want, what they are comfortable in. ""Employers are much more relaxed about what people can wear. So I think the plain structured work suit, it won't disappear totally, but the demand for those sorts of products has reduced and isn't going to come back.""

The western lowland gorillas were tested after keepers at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia noticed some of them coughing, nasal discharge, and minor changes in appetite,it said,external. The zoo is giving antibody therapy to gorillas at risk of complications; it will also vaccinate other animals including orangutans and Sumatran tigers. Zoo managers believe the gorillas caught coronavirus from an asymptomatic worker. ""While humans are known to be able to transmit the virus to animals such as gorillas, and these cases have occurred at other zoos, there is currently no data to suggest that zoo animals can transmit the virus to humans,"" the zoo said. Domestic cats and dogs are also known to have been infectedby the virus. Sainsbury's says it will keep all its stores shut this Boxing Day. The UK's second largest supermarket says it will keep all of its supermarket, convenience stores and petrol stations shut as a ""massive thank you to all our colleagues for everything they have done during the last challenging year"". Argos and Habitat stores will also remain shut for the day. Sainsbury's is following in the footsteps of fellow grocers Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, who previously announced their intention to keep stores shut on 26 December. ""Christmas is a really special time for so many, but because of lockdown restrictions last year, lots of us weren't able to celebrate in the way we wanted,"" says Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury's. He adds: ""I want to thank our customers in advance for their understanding, which will mean as many of our team as possible can have a well-deserved break to spend time with loved ones."" Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the Usdaw trade union, welcomes the move. ""The pandemic showed just how important shopworkers are to our society and communities, as they stepped up and kept essential services running throughout. ""Key workers have done so much this year and we don't think it is too much to ask to give them the longest possible break over the festive season."" For the final question in the briefing, Professor Wei Shen Lim is asked about the data that led the JCVI to conclude the benefit of vaccination among 12 to 15-year-olds was only 'marginal'. Prof Lim says it was ""not a straight case of just doing the maths... there's much more to those numbers"". ""We are talking about different reasons for being hospitalised (for either Covid or myocarditis)... and different longer term consequences."" He says: ""We spent many hours looking at the whole range of benefits [to vaccination]."" And that brings to an end their update explaining why vaccinations for children aged 12-15 have been recommended. This video can not be played The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ, says Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty. The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ says Englandâs chief medical officer. LBC's question is about consent. What say will parents have over whether or not their children get vaccinated? Whitty says the question of who provides consent for children was laid down in law by the Law Lords and it can't be over-ruled by ministers. He says we are not doing anything differently in this than would be done in any other medical situation. Gregor Smith says as a GP he has found himself talking to children and guardians about these issues. By and large there is a great deal of agreement between parents and their children, he says, about how to proceed.  GB News asks whether the UK should have been faster in coming to this decision. Whitty replies: ""I think to compare national differences is hard."" He says it is ""important to follow the normal process and take the time it takes to get the information needed"". A reporter from the i newspaper asks will the decision have a broader societal impact? Dr Gregor Smith says the CMO review had only considered the risks/benefits to this particular age group (12 to 15-year-olds) and the wider impact had not been looked at. But Prof Whitty adds that, in general, anyone who has a vaccine, ""will be protecting those around them"".  Natasha Clarke from the Sun newspaper asks if there is any evidence that jabbing all 12 to 15-year-olds will help prevent school closures in the winter and will it affect boosters for older people? Whitty says there is no concern about this getting in the way of jabbing the elderly. And in terms of the impact on education, it will reduce but not eliminate disruption, he says. It reduces the chance children will get Covid by about 55% so it would be ""very surprising"" if it does not reduce disruption ""by a significant extent"". However, he says jabs  alone are not going to be the thing that deals with education issues. There are no plans to re-examine jabs for under-12s, he says, adding ""let's not rush that one at all"". The Telegraph asks could this decision not have been taken sooner given the UK seems to have waited longer than other countries, which are vaccinating young people? Whitty replies that the Telegraph's reporter is ""absolutely right"" that other countries are giving the vaccine to younger people. He thinks most parents and most children and young people will want the decision to be thorough, he says. ""Rushing these things doesn't seem like the right thing to do,"" he says. ""It's about doing it thoroughly."" ""This is a more difficult decision"" compared with vaccinating adults, Whitty adds.  The Times asks if the vaccination is an offer or ""just advice""? ""What we are not trying to do is say to children you must do this - but  on balance - we are in favour,"" says Prof Whitty. Prof Whitty says the four CMOs aligned themselves with the JCVI's  nuanced recommendation. He says the view of the CMOs was that the cumulative thinking on vaccinating young people was that it pushed recommendation ""over the line"".   Sky asks the next question - do the CMOs feel undermined by how the whole process has been handled? Prof Whitty says he cares more about getting it right. Sound decisions are ""completely barn-door obvious"", he says, and - unlike jabs for 85-year-olds - vaccinating children is more complicated, he adds. Medicine is about communicating things that are complicated, he adds.  Emily Morgan from ITV asks how the medical establishment will convince parents to vaccinate children, given there are only marginal benefits. Dr Gregor Smith, CMO for Scotland, says informed consent remains ""really important"", It's vital ""not to mistake marginal benefit for no benefit"", he stresses. He says it is important to stick to straightforward language and explain in child-friendly terms the advantages of proceeding with vaccination. ""As a parent we all want the very best for all our children,"" Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland Dr Michael McBride says. Both the MHRA and JCVI had concluded there were benefits of vaccination even if that benefit was only small, he adds. Talking about the wider benefits, he says education is ""vitally important for realising our life opportunities"" ""Children need the continuity and predictability of being in school for their well-being."" All of that will be an important part of the consent process, he adds.   The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks isn't there a danger that many parents and children are going to be left confused because the JCVI did not recommend that all 12-15 year olds be vaccinated, yet the Chief Medical Officers have. Prof Chris Whitty says there is no conflict. The JCVI said there was a marginal benefit, he adds. In medicine you have to take various factors into account to work out risks and benefits, he says, and it is the CMOs' belief that there is an ""additional"" benefit from giving the jabs to all young people in this age group. ""We think that what we are doing is very much in line with JCVI,"" he says. Our children ""have suffered very significantly in terms of disruption through their education"", says Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael McBride.

We'll be back with more tomorrow. Masks have been in evidence on the first day back at school in New York City And this is what's been happening around the world: Prof Chris Whitty, Dr June Raine and Prof Wei Shen Lim were at the briefing in Downing Street As we've almost come to the end of today's live page, here's a brief round-up of the key news lines in the UK:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Thereâs a reason this decision-making process has been so
painful â it is such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from
Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal â and
not enough to warrant going ahead with it. Even in terms of limiting school disruption, the modelling
suggests the benefits may only be small. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are
less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age
children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop
30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and
spread of the virus in the coming months, which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed
days of in-person schooling â or one day for every 20 children. Primark says the trend for ""comfort wear"" has continued through the summer, with strong sales of leisurewear such as leggings and cycle shorts. Demand also rose for seam-free matching separates for women, as many people stayed in the UK for their holidays. However, sales at Primark were lower than expected, withsales in June and July being affected by the ""pingdemic"". It comes after the boss of clothing brand Bodendeclared formal office wear over. Johnnie Boden says: ""Because of Covid and working from home women have all felt a freedom to wear what they want, what they are comfortable in.

The zoo is giving antibody therapy to gorillas at risk of complications; it will also vaccinate other animals including orangutans and Sumatran tigers. Zoo managers believe the gorillas caught coronavirus from an asymptomatic worker. ""While humans are known to be able to transmit the virus to animals such as gorillas, and these cases have occurred at other zoos, there is currently no data to suggest that zoo animals can transmit the virus to humans,"" the zoo said. Domestic cats and dogs are also known to have been infectedby the virus. Sainsbury's says it will keep all its stores shut this Boxing Day. The UK's second largest supermarket says it will keep all of its supermarket, convenience stores and petrol stations shut as a ""massive thank you to all our colleagues for everything they have done during the last challenging year"". Argos and Habitat stores will also remain shut for the day. Sainsbury's is following in the footsteps of fellow grocers Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, who previously announced their intention to keep stores shut on 26 December. ""Christmas is a really special time for so many, but because of lockdown restrictions last year, lots of us weren't able to celebrate in the way we wanted,"" says Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury's. He adds: ""I want to thank our customers in advance for their understanding, which will mean as many of our team as possible can have a well-deserved break to spend time with loved ones."" Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the Usdaw trade union, welcomes the move. ""The pandemic showed just how important shopworkers are to our society and communities, as they stepped up and kept essential services running throughout. ""Key workers have done so much this year and we don't think it is too much to ask to give them the longest possible break over the festive season."" For the final question in the briefing, Professor Wei Shen Lim is asked about the data that led the JCVI to conclude the benefit of vaccination among 12 to 15-year-olds was only 'marginal'. Prof Lim says it was ""not a straight case of just doing the maths... there's much more to those numbers"". ""We are talking about different reasons for being hospitalised (for either Covid or myocarditis)... and different longer term consequences."" He says: ""We spent many hours looking at the whole range of benefits [to vaccination]."" And that brings to an end their update explaining why vaccinations for children aged 12-15 have been recommended. This video can not be played The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ, says Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty. The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ says Englandâs chief medical officer. LBC's question is about consent. What say will parents have over whether or not their children get vaccinated? Whitty says the question of who provides consent for children was laid down in law by the Law Lords and it can't be over-ruled by ministers. He says we are not doing anything differently in this than would be done in any other medical situation. Gregor Smith says as a GP he has found himself talking to children and guardians about these issues. By and large there is a great deal of agreement between parents and their children, he says, about how to proceed.  GB News asks whether the UK should have been faster in coming to this decision. Whitty replies: ""I think to compare national differences is hard."" He says it is ""important to follow the normal process and take the time it takes to get the information needed"". A reporter from the i newspaper asks will the decision have a broader societal impact? Dr Gregor Smith says the CMO review had only considered the risks/benefits to this particular age group (12 to 15-year-olds) and the wider impact had not been looked at. But Prof Whitty adds that, in general, anyone who has a vaccine, ""will be protecting those around them"".  Natasha Clarke from the Sun newspaper asks if there is any evidence that jabbing all 12 to 15-year-olds will help prevent school closures in the winter and will it affect boosters for older people? Whitty says there is no concern about this getting in the way of jabbing the elderly. And in terms of the impact on education, it will reduce but not eliminate disruption, he says. It reduces the chance children will get Covid by about 55% so it would be ""very surprising"" if it does not reduce disruption ""by a significant extent"". However, he says jabs  alone are not going to be the thing that deals with education issues. There are no plans to re-examine jabs for under-12s, he says, adding ""let's not rush that one at all"". The Telegraph asks could this decision not have been taken sooner given the UK seems to have waited longer than other countries, which are vaccinating young people? Whitty replies that the Telegraph's reporter is ""absolutely right"" that other countries are giving the vaccine to younger people. He thinks most parents and most children and young people will want the decision to be thorough, he says. ""Rushing these things doesn't seem like the right thing to do,"" he says. ""It's about doing it thoroughly."" ""This is a more difficult decision"" compared with vaccinating adults, Whitty adds.  The Times asks if the vaccination is an offer or ""just advice""? ""What we are not trying to do is say to children you must do this - but  on balance - we are in favour,"" says Prof Whitty. Prof Whitty says the four CMOs aligned themselves with the JCVI's  nuanced recommendation. He says the view of the CMOs was that the cumulative thinking on vaccinating young people was that it pushed recommendation ""over the line"".   Sky asks the next question - do the CMOs feel undermined by how the whole process has been handled? Prof Whitty says he cares more about getting it right. Sound decisions are ""completely barn-door obvious"", he says, and - unlike jabs for 85-year-olds - vaccinating children is more complicated, he adds. Medicine is about communicating things that are complicated, he adds.  Emily Morgan from ITV asks how the medical establishment will convince parents to vaccinate children, given there are only marginal benefits. Dr Gregor Smith, CMO for Scotland, says informed consent remains ""really important"", It's vital ""not to mistake marginal benefit for no benefit"", he stresses. He says it is important to stick to straightforward language and explain in child-friendly terms the advantages of proceeding with vaccination. ""As a parent we all want the very best for all our children,"" Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland Dr Michael McBride says. Both the MHRA and JCVI had concluded there were benefits of vaccination even if that benefit was only small, he adds. Talking about the wider benefits, he says education is ""vitally important for realising our life opportunities"" ""Children need the continuity and predictability of being in school for their well-being."" All of that will be an important part of the consent process, he adds.   The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks isn't there a danger that many parents and children are going to be left confused because the JCVI did not recommend that all 12-15 year olds be vaccinated, yet the Chief Medical Officers have. Prof Chris Whitty says there is no conflict. The JCVI said there was a marginal benefit, he adds. In medicine you have to take various factors into account to work out risks and benefits, he says, and it is the CMOs' belief that there is an ""additional"" benefit from giving the jabs to all young people in this age group. ""We think that what we are doing is very much in line with JCVI,"" he says. Our children ""have suffered very significantly in terms of disruption through their education"", says Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael McBride. ""I would wish to ensure... that the information and advice to ensure parents and children can make an informed decision is available to them,"" he says. Dr Frank

"300,000 suspected of breaking travel quarantineIt comes as the prime minister prepares to announce his winter Covid plan, including for booster jabs.","Labour said the figures obtained by the BBC suggested the policy enforcing quarantine on arrivals was ""lax"" Nearly a third of people arriving in England and Northern Ireland as the coronavirus Delta variant took off may have broken quarantine rules. More than 300,000 cases were passed to investigators between March and May, according to figures seen by the BBC. The government was not able to say how many of these were found to have broken the rules or could not be traced. The Home Office has said it aims to pay home visits to all travellers suspected of not following the rules. But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the figures obtained by the BBC ""confirm our worst fears"" about the government's ""lax border policy"". And he accused the Home Office of ""gross negligence"". Which countries have been added to the green list? What is the Delta variant and is it more dangerous? Test and Trace fault 'helped new variant spread' It comes asthe UK's four chief medical officers recommendvaccinating healthy children aged between 12 and 15 - as part of a series of measures to control the virus this winter. It will now be up to ministers whether to accept the recommendation of the four CMOs. Earlier this year, the government introduced new rules for people arriving from abroad in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus and stop new variants arriving in the country. People arriving from high-risk countries - deemed ""red list"" - had to quarantine in a hotel. Those coming from ""amber list"" - or medium-risk areas - were required to self-isolate for 10 days and provide evidence of negative Covid tests. From 17 March to 31 May more than a million people arrived in England and Northern Ireland from amber list countries. Figures for this period obtained under Freedom of Information laws show a total of 301,076 cases were referred to investigators for checks on whether they were self-isolating. During this time, the highly contagious Delta variant of coronavirus - first detected in India - was spreading rapidly through the country. Some travellers had to quarantine in hotels, rather than at home Call handlers employed by the Department of Health and Social Care were tasked with contacting arrivals to check they were obeying the self-isolation and testing rules. Cases where the contact ended the call, refused to co-operate, indicated they would break the quarantine or testing rules, or could not be contacted after three attempts were referred to investigators at the Border Force Criminal Justice Unit and the police. Officers would then attempt to visit the contact at home to check they were following the rules. After 26 April, the Home Office hired private contractor Mitie to carry out home visits to international travellers required to isolate, from contacts supplied by NHS Test and Trace. ""We visit over 99% of the cases referred to this service by NHS Test and Trace,"" a government spokesman said. In Wales, the Arriving Travellers Team is responsible for monitoring compliance with the rules - including escalating cases to regional teams to undertake doorstep visits if deemed necessary. And in Scotland, quarantine measures are monitored by Public Health Scotland through the National Contact Tracing Centre. PHS has the ability to refer to cases to Police Scotland. Henrik Pakula isolated at home after returning from Poland On 1 April, Henrik Pakula began 10 days of isolation at home after returning to England from Poland, where he had been visiting relatives. ""On day one I received a phone call just asking me if I knew the rules on self-isolation, and informing me that there could be random phone calls over the next 10 days just to check I was still at home, but none of those calls materialised,"" he said. ""I could have nipped out to the supermarket if I had so desired - no-one would have checked, no-one would have known. ""I got a text message saying these were the rules but there was no contact with anybody at all. ""I knew I had to isolate for 10 days, which I did, but it was taken on trust."" Lucy Moreton, of the Immigration Services Union, said the quarantine system ""very much relied on the honesty of people to do the right thing, rather than any type of meaningful enforcement"". ""There's limited point in putting rules in place if you don't enforce them,"" she added. Yvette Cooper, Labour MP and chair of the Home Affairs Committee, said: ""We've been concerned throughout that there just weren't proper follow-ups on the checks that were done, and as a result you just had these huge gaps in the home quarantine system and that's what made it easier for the Delta variant to spread."" But Conservative MP Huw Merriman, chair of the Transport Committee, said: ""There was a balancing act from government... would we have had the resources to check every single person who was quarantining at home? Of course not - so we always knew those risks were in the system"". Have you broken quarantine rules? Please share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

UN warns of humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan,"Aid organisations have warned there is an urgent need for food and medical supplies More than $1bn (Â£720m) in aid has been pledged for Afghanistan, following warnings from the United Nations of a ""looming catastrophe"". The plea for global support was made at a conference in Geneva, following the Taliban's takeover last month. The UN said the country was facing a major humanitarian crisis. After decades of war and suffering, it was ""perhaps their most perilous hour"", Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. The poverty rate was ""spiralling"" and public services were close to collapse, he told the conference. ""Many people could run out of food by the end of this month just as winter approaches,"" he warned. The UN had called for $606m to be raised, saying this would bring ""vital relief"" to millions. Mr Guterres said it was unclear how much of the more than $1bn promised would go towards the UN appeal. The UN has urged the Taliban to give aid workers unimpeded access. Even before the Islamist militants retook control of Afghanistan in August, fighting had forced more than 550,000 people to flee their homes. An estimated 3.5 million people are currently internally displaced within the country. Afghans have also had to deal with a severe drought. The conference on Monday was attended by top UN officials as well as aid organisations including the Red Cross and various governments. The UN said about a third of the money it was seeking to raise would be used by its World Food Programme (WFP), which earlier said many Afghans did not have access to cash to afford sufficient food. ""We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid food stocks running out,"" WFP deputy regional director Anthea Webb told Reuters news agency. EXPLAINED: How many Afghan refugees are fleeing? ANALYSIS: Afghanistan, its future, and why China matters CONTEXT: What's changed in Afghanistan in 20 years As well as pledging aid, officials told the conference of their concerns over Taliban abuses. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet accused the Taliban of contradicting their own public promises on human rights. She cited ""multiple"" allegations of Taliban forces conducting house-to-house searches for former officials, and said women had been ""progressively excluded"" from public life. The BBC has found thatat least 20 civilians were killed in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley,which has seen fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces. In a statement echoed by other officials, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said respecting basic rights would be a ""benchmark... in determining our future engagement with a new Afghan government - including for possible development assistance"". Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi tweeted that he had arrived in Kabul on Monday to ""assess the country's acute humanitarian needs"". Thousands of people have fled Afghanistan since the Taliban took control of Kabul on 15 August following a rapid offensive. On Monday, a special Pakistan International Airlines flight arrived in Kabul to take passengers to Islamabad. ""I will come back here only if the situation allows women to work and move freely,"" one 35-year-old evacuee told AFP news agency. In a separate development, Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban co-founder and new deputy prime minister of Afghanistan, issued an apparent audio statement after reports that he had died spread on social media. ""I have been away on trips,"" he said in the clip. ""Wherever I am at the moment, we are all fine, all my brothers and friends.""

North Korea tests new long-range missile,"North Korean state media released these images of the new cruise missile North Korea has tested a new long-range cruise missile capable of hitting much of Japan, state media said on Monday. The weekend tests saw missiles travelling up to 1,500km (930 miles), the official KCNA news agency said. It suggests North Korea is still capable of developing weapons despite food shortages and an economic crisis. The US military said the latest tests posed threats to the international community, and neighbouring Japan said it had ""significant concerns"". A picture in the North Korean Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a missile being fired from a launch vehicle, while another could be seen in horizontal flight. The missiles are a ""strategic weapon of great significance"", the KCNA agency said. The tests were carried out on Saturday and Sunday, it added, with the missiles hitting their targets before falling into North Korea's territorial waters. It is the country's first long-range cruise missile that could possibly carry a nuclear warhead, according toNorth Korea analyst Ankit Panda,external. UN Security Council sanctions forbid North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, but not cruise missiles such as these. The council considers ballistic missiles to be more threatening than cruise missiles because they can carry bigger and more powerful payloads, have a much longer range, and can fly faster. A ballistic missile is powered by a rocket and follows an arc-like trajectory, while a cruise missile is powered by a jet engine and flies at a lower height. Joseph Dempsey, defence researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, says the development of a cruise missile is still of concern. ""The development of a long-range cruise missile could pose additional challenges for South Korea's missile defences. ""A cruise missile doesn't have to follow a straight trajectory. Its flight plan may be programmed to avoid defences or use terrain to reduce detection, but we still don't know exactly how the North Korean version navigates."" So is this a big deal? Yes and no. The reason some may shrug this missile test off is because it was a cruise missile. This type of missile isn't subject to UN Security Council sanctions which are in place to curb North Korea's nuclear programme. Some may view this as a low-level provocation from Pyongyang - perhaps testing the waters to see what reaction it gets. It certainly didn't make the top headline in South Korea, nor did it make the front page of North Korea's state newspaper. The problem is that North Korea is once again proving that it can develop new and dangerous weapons despite being subject to strict international sanctions. These cruise missiles fly low and are difficult to detect, and a range of 1,500km would put much of Japan in range. State media also describe these missiles as ""strategic"" which usually means that the regime hopes to attach a nuclear warhead. Analysts aren't sure yet if North Korea can miniaturise a nuclear warhead to fit on a cruise missile. However given how many advances the secretive state has made so far, no one would bet against it. Pyongyang may have been quiet since talks between former US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un broke down in Hanoi in 2019. But that doesn't mean their weapons developers have not been busy. Japan's chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said the country had ""significant concerns"" and was working with the US and South Korea to monitor the situation. The US military said the test showed North Korea's ""continuing focus on developing its military programme"", adding that its commitment to defending allies South Korea and Japan remained ""ironclad"". Top-level officials from the three countries are due to meet this week to discuss North Korea's denuclearisation process. South Korea's military is also doing an in-depth analysis of the launches with US intelligence authorities, the news agency Yonhap reports. The US has been calling for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, and Pyongyang's relationship with President Joe Biden's administration has so far been fraught with tension. Japan and North Korea also have enduring tensions rooted in Japan's 35-year colonisation of Korea, Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear and missile programmes, and the North's past abduction of Japanese citizens. The latest launch comes just days after a scaled-down military parade was held in Pyongyang to mark the communist state's 73rd founding anniversary. It did not display any major ballistic missiles, however it did feature workers in hazmat suits which may have been a sign that a special force has been created to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. North Korea has spent more than a year in isolation. It cut off most trade with its closest ally China during the pandemic, and its economy is thought to be in a dire state. EXPLAINED: What weapons does North Korea have? In March, the country defied sanctions and tested ballistic missiles, which triggered a strong rebuke from the US, Japan and South Korea. And last month the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.

Primark says trend for comfort wear has continued,"Primark says the trend for ""comfort wear"" has continued through the summer, with strong sales of leisurewear such as leggings and cycle shorts. Demand also rose for seam-free matching separates for women, as many people stayed in the UK for their holidays. However, sales at Primark were lower than expected, with sales in June and July being affected by the ""pingdemic"". The retailer also said it had seen some delays to stock because of ""port and container freight disruptions"". Despite this, Primark owner Associated British Foods said its profits were set to beat expectations. The move to working from home during the coronavirus restrictions led to a surge in demand for casual clothing as people no longer had to wear smart outfits for the office. Loungewear, defined as being a hybrid between pyjamas and track suits, has been particularly popular, as well as athleisure goods such as matching sets of sports bras, leggings and hoodies. Many brands and fashion designers, including London's fashionable Saville Row tailors,have pivoted to creating gymwear and loungewear linesin order to generate sales during the lockdowns. This video can not be played Savile Row shops pivot to loungewear Primark said it had enjoyed very strong trade in the third quarter of its financial year, which coincided with the relaxation of Covid measures, but then conditions became tougher. ""In the UK our sales were affected by the rapid and significant increase in late June and early July in the number of people required to self-isolate following contact tracing alerts - the 'pingdemic'. Data shows that High Street footfall was impacted by the caution displayed by many consumers at that time."" However, after self-isolation rules were eased in early August, Primark said it saw a ""consistent improvement through the period from a decline of 24% in the first four weeks of the quarter to a decline of 8% in the last four weeks"". Primark shoppers offered in-store vaccinations 'I returned my suits and spent Â£100 on joggers' Primark's sales for the second half of its financial year are expected to reach Â£3.4bn. It said sales of its autumn/winter range were doing well, and it had seen strong demand for its back-to-school products. It said disruption to ports and container freight meant it had suffered ""some delays"" to supplies, although John Bason, finance director of Associated British Foods, told the PA news agency the group had ""no worries"" about stock levels for Christmas. ""There has been supply chain disruption but our team has worked incredibly hard to mitigate this so I don't anticipate this being an issue for customers,"" he told PA. ""We are definitely seeing a lot of inflationary pressures in different parts of our supply chain, but there is absolutely no intention to put prices up in Primark because of it."" Gemma Boothroyd, an analyst at investment platform Freetrade, said:  ""Even with dwindling in-store sales, Primark has managed to maintain its market share compared to the same period two years ago. ""That's a notable feat given the number of new digital entrants,"" Primark was particularly hard hit during the Covid lockdowns as it does not sell its clothes online. By contrast, fast fashion retailers online enjoyed significant growth as consumers changed their shopping habits. In its latest update, Primark said it would launch a ""new and improved customer-facing website"" in the next 12 months, which would allow it ""to showcase a much larger proportion of the Primark range and to provide customers with range availability by store"". But Freetrade's Ms Boothroyd noted this was not a ""full-scale sales site"", but ""more of a tool for shoppers to check in-store inventory prior to hitting the shops"". ""If anything, this seems likely to result in decreased sales for the brand. After all, isn't it the uncertainty and thrill of hunting for a bargain that gets Primark shoppers in-store in the first place?"" she said. ""For now, Primark's proven it has staying power, but if it's finally going to go digital, it needs to do it right. Otherwise, it's going to find itself in an omnichannel no man's land.""

LiveLiveCovid rules may still be needed in winter â minister2 minutes ago,"The UKâs four Chief Medical Officers have recommended all children aged 12-15 should be vaccinated against Covid They have agreed that children of those ages should be given one dose of the Pfizer vaccine to help prevent education being disrupted A final decision on rollout will be taken by ministers in the four nations of the UK The UK recorded 30,825 new coronavirus cases on Monday, and 61 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Boris Johnson confirms he'll announce his Covid winter strategy on Tuesday, saying he'll be ""setting it all out tomorrow"" The PM says he's ""very confident in the steps that we've taken"" but won't rule out a winter lockdown Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says nobody wants another lockdown and the best way to avoid it is to be cautious and use practical measures And Sir Keir says he will back vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds if the scientific advice is that it's safe French vaccine maker Valneva says the UK government has scrapped a deal for its Covid vaccine Edited by James Clarke That's all from us on a busy day of coronavirus news. These updates have been brought to you by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Sinead Wilson, Emma Harrison, Rob Corp and James Clarke. We'll be back with more tomorrow. Masks have been in evidence on the first day back at school in New York City And this is what's been happening around the world: Prof Chris Whitty, Dr June Raine and Prof Wei Shen Lim were at the briefing in Downing Street As we've almost come to the end of today's live page, here's a brief round-up of the key news lines in the UK:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Thereâs a reason this decision-making process has been so
painful â it is such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from
Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal â and
not enough to warrant going ahead with it. Even in terms of limiting school disruption, the modelling
suggests the benefits may only be small. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are
less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age
children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop
30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and
spread of the virus in the coming months, which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed
days of in-person schooling â or one day for every 20 children. Primark says the trend for ""comfort wear"" has continued through the summer, with strong sales of leisurewear such as leggings and cycle shorts. Demand also rose for seam-free matching separates for women, as many people stayed in the UK for their holidays. However, sales at Primark were lower than expected, withsales in June and July being affected by the ""pingdemic"". It comes after the boss of clothing brand Bodendeclared formal office wear over. Johnnie Boden says: ""Because of Covid and working from home women have all felt a freedom to wear what they want, what they are comfortable in. ""Employers are much more relaxed about what people can wear. So I think the plain structured work suit, it won't disappear totally, but the demand for those sorts of products has reduced and isn't going to come back.""

The western lowland gorillas were tested after keepers at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia noticed some of them coughing, nasal discharge, and minor changes in appetite,it said,external. The zoo is giving antibody therapy to gorillas at risk of complications; it will also vaccinate other animals including orangutans and Sumatran tigers. Zoo managers believe the gorillas caught coronavirus from an asymptomatic worker. ""While humans are known to be able to transmit the virus to animals such as gorillas, and these cases have occurred at other zoos, there is currently no data to suggest that zoo animals can transmit the virus to humans,"" the zoo said. Domestic cats and dogs are also known to have been infectedby the virus. Sainsbury's says it will keep all its stores shut this Boxing Day. The UK's second largest supermarket says it will keep all of its supermarket, convenience stores and petrol stations shut as a ""massive thank you to all our colleagues for everything they have done during the last challenging year"". Argos and Habitat stores will also remain shut for the day. Sainsbury's is following in the footsteps of fellow grocers Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, who previously announced their intention to keep stores shut on 26 December. ""Christmas is a really special time for so many, but because of lockdown restrictions last year, lots of us weren't able to celebrate in the way we wanted,"" says Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury's. He adds: ""I want to thank our customers in advance for their understanding, which will mean as many of our team as possible can have a well-deserved break to spend time with loved ones."" Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the Usdaw trade union, welcomes the move. ""The pandemic showed just how important shopworkers are to our society and communities, as they stepped up and kept essential services running throughout. ""Key workers have done so much this year and we don't think it is too much to ask to give them the longest possible break over the festive season."" For the final question in the briefing, Professor Wei Shen Lim is asked about the data that led the JCVI to conclude the benefit of vaccination among 12 to 15-year-olds was only 'marginal'. Prof Lim says it was ""not a straight case of just doing the maths... there's much more to those numbers"". ""We are talking about different reasons for being hospitalised (for either Covid or myocarditis)... and different longer term consequences."" He says: ""We spent many hours looking at the whole range of benefits [to vaccination]."" And that brings to an end their update explaining why vaccinations for children aged 12-15 have been recommended. This video can not be played The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ, says Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty. The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ says Englandâs chief medical officer. LBC's question is about consent. What say will parents have over whether or not their children get vaccinated? Whitty says the question of who provides consent for children was laid down in law by the Law Lords and it can't be over-ruled by ministers. He says we are not doing anything differently in this than would be done in any other medical situation. Gregor Smith says as a GP he has found himself talking to children and guardians about these issues. By and large there is a great deal of agreement between parents and their children, he says, about how to proceed.  GB News asks whether the UK should have been faster in coming to this decision. Whitty replies: ""I think to compare national differences is hard."" He says it is ""important to follow the normal process and take the time it takes to get the information needed"". A reporter from the i newspaper asks will the decision have a broader societal impact? Dr Gregor Smith says the CMO review had only considered the risks/benefits to this particular age group (12 to 15-year-olds) and the wider impact had not been looked at. But Prof Whitty adds that, in general, anyone who has a vaccine, ""will be protecting those around them"".  Natasha Clarke from the Sun newspaper asks if there is any evidence that jabbing all 12 to 15-year-olds will help prevent school closures in the winter and will it affect boosters for older people? Whitty says there is no concern about this getting in the way of jabbing the elderly. And in terms of the impact on education, it will reduce but not eliminate disruption, he says. It reduces the chance children will get Covid by about 55% so it would be ""very surprising"" if it does not reduce disruption ""by a significant extent"". However, he says jabs  alone are not going to be the thing that deals with education issues. There are no plans to re-examine jabs for under-12s, he says, adding ""let's not rush that one at all"". The Telegraph asks could this decision not have been taken sooner given the UK seems to have waited longer than other countries, which are vaccinating young people? Whitty replies that the Telegraph's reporter is ""absolutely right"" that other countries are giving the vaccine to younger people. He thinks most parents and most children and young people will want the decision to be thorough, he says. ""Rushing these things doesn't seem like the right thing to do,"" he says. ""It's about doing it thoroughly."" ""This is a more difficult decision"" compared with vaccinating adults, Whitty adds.  The Times asks if the vaccination is an offer or ""just advice""? ""What we are not trying to do is say to children you must do this - but  on balance - we are in favour,"" says Prof Whitty. Prof Whitty says the four CMOs aligned themselves with the JCVI's  nuanced recommendation. He says the view of the CMOs was that the cumulative thinking on vaccinating young people was that it pushed recommendation ""over the line"".   Sky asks the next question - do the CMOs feel undermined by how the whole process has been handled? Prof Whitty says he cares more about getting it right. Sound decisions are ""completely barn-door obvious"", he says, and - unlike jabs for 85-year-olds - vaccinating children is more complicated, he adds. Medicine is about communicating things that are complicated, he adds.  Emily Morgan from ITV asks how the medical establishment will convince parents to vaccinate children, given there are only marginal benefits. Dr Gregor Smith, CMO for Scotland, says informed consent remains ""really important"", It's vital ""not to mistake marginal benefit for no benefit"", he stresses. He says it is important to stick to straightforward language and explain in child-friendly terms the advantages of proceeding with vaccination. ""As a parent we all want the very best for all our children,"" Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland Dr Michael McBride says. Both the MHRA and JCVI had concluded there were benefits of vaccination even if that benefit was only small, he adds. Talking about the wider benefits, he says education is ""vitally important for realising our life opportunities"" ""Children need the continuity and predictability of being in school for their well-being."" All of that will be an important part of the consent process, he adds.   The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks isn't there a danger that many parents and children are going to be left confused because the JCVI did not recommend that all 12-15 year olds be vaccinated, yet the Chief Medical Officers have. Prof Chris Whitty says there is no conflict. The JCVI said there was a marginal benefit, he adds. In medicine you have to take various factors into account to work out risks and benefits, he says, and it is the CMOs' belief that there is an ""additional"" benefit from giving the jabs to all young people in this age group. ""We think that what we are doing is very much in line with JCVI,"" he says. Our children ""have suffered very significantly in terms of disruption through their education"", says Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael McBride. ""I would wish to ensure... that the information and advice to ensure parents and children can make an informed decision is available to them,"" he says. Dr Frank
Atherton, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, stresses the group of CMOs across the UK had taken account of the broad rights of children. He emphasises the importance of this wider picture - particularly with regard to Wales, where there exists specific legislation on human rights for young people. He says his message to the young people of Wales is that the vaccine will bring benefits both to them personally and their education, but ultimately the choice remains their own.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Legal action over quarantine hotel rules,"A law firm representing travellers is taking the government to court over the UK's quarantine hotel policy. Passengers must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel on returning from red list countries, even if fully vaccinated and testing negative for Covid. London-based firm PGMBM said it had called fora judicial review into the policy, but the government had refused. The cost of staying in a quarantine hotel is now Â£2,285. More than 60 locations including Turkey, Mexico, Kenya and many countries in Africa and Latin America are currently on the red list. The other European countries with mandatory quarantine involving hotel detentions - Ireland and Norway - have amended their schemes so fully vaccinated travellers are exempt from needing to quarantine. If PGMBM's claim was successful, not only would double-vaccinated travellers no longer have to quarantine at the hotels, but the government could also be forced to refund the fees of all those who were vaccinated and still had to stay there. It is estimated more than 100,000 people have been forced to quarantine in hotels since the policy came into force in February this year. What are the holiday rules for travel? PGMBM said it was launching a legal case, representing ""multiple"" clients. It described the policy as an ""unlawful deprivation of liberty"" that violated fundamental human rights. It is now asking anyone who was forced to stay in hotel quarantine to register their details and help form a class action aimed at forcing the government to reverse its policy. One of the firm's clients, Ozgur Akyuz, a bus driver from Hackney, said his pregnant wife and three-year-old daughter caught Covid while staying in hotel quarantine two weeks ago. ""They were put in a hotel near Heathrow and it was filthy. She was crying all day long,"" he said. ""She saw a rat in her room and kept being served bacon and sausages, even though she told them she didn't eat pork. ""I ended up cooking food at home to take to her, and I also bought a rat trap from B&Q to give her peace of mind because the hotel did nothing."" Mr Akyuz said both his wife and daughter tested positive for Covid on the third day of quarantine, despite having tested negative when they left Turkey. ""They were allowed home after 10 days but I then caught Covid from them. So we have all had it. If she had come home to quarantine, chances are none of us would have got it."" The government has said it has taken ""decisive action"" to protect the country, including the quarantine system. Other countries around the world had taken equivalent action, it said. This is the second case PGMBM has brought about quarantine hotels. The first was on the grounds of financial hardship and resulted in the government offering the option to pay in 12 monthly instalments for those facing financial hardship.

UK scraps Covid-19 vaccine deal with Valneva,"French vaccine maker Valneva says the UK government has scrapped a deal for its Covid-19 vaccine. The UK had about 100 million doses on order, after it increased its request by 40 million in February. The firmsaid that the UK government,externalserved notice over allegations of a breach of the agreement, which it ""strenuously denies"". The government said the decision would have no impact on vaccine supply in the UK. ""The comments from the company will not have any impact on our vaccine supply and did not form any part of our vaccine rollout in autumn and winter,"" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has not yet approved the Valneva vaccine. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine What is happening at Scotland's Covid vaccine lab? 'The world needs greater vaccine supply' In a statement on its website, Valneva said: ""Valneva SE, a specialty vaccine company, today announced that it has received a termination notice from the UK Government (HMG) in relation to the Supply Agreement for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001. ""The contract provides HMG with the right to terminate. HMG has alleged that the company is in breach of its obligations under the supply agreement, but the company strenuously denies this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valneva's Scottish manufacturing site in January this year The firm said on Monday that results from its phase three trials were due later this year. It added: ""Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG's requests for variant-derived vaccines."" The company hopes that, dependent on the results of its continuing trials and sign-off from the UK's MHRA, initial approval could still be granted in 2021. Its vaccine is expected to be given as two doses and contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease, but should teach the body's immune system how to fight it. Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""We have enough supply even for a booster programme. I want to give absolute confidence to anyone listening that we have the supplies necessary to continue to vaccinate and particularly with a booster programme on the horizon."" Mr Yousaf said that while the announcement would be a big set-back for the Livingston plant, he would speak to Valneva to discuss its future. The Scottish Health Secretary added that he was waiting for further information from the UK government over Valneva's alleged failure to meet the terms of its contract. SNP MP Hannah Bardell, whose constituency contains the Valneva plant, said she was ""incredibly disappointed"" by the news.

"UK scraps Covid-19 vaccine deal with ValnevaThe French firm says the deal was cancelled over allegations of a breach of the agreement, which it denies.Business","French vaccine maker Valneva says the UK government has scrapped a deal for its Covid-19 vaccine. The UK had about 100 million doses on order, after it increased its request by 40 million in February. The firmsaid that the UK government,externalserved notice over allegations of a breach of the agreement, which it ""strenuously denies"". The government said the decision would have no impact on vaccine supply in the UK. ""The comments from the company will not have any impact on our vaccine supply and did not form any part of our vaccine rollout in autumn and winter,"" a spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has not yet approved the Valneva vaccine. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine What is happening at Scotland's Covid vaccine lab? 'The world needs greater vaccine supply' In a statement on its website, Valneva said: ""Valneva SE, a specialty vaccine company, today announced that it has received a termination notice from the UK Government (HMG) in relation to the Supply Agreement for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, VLA2001. ""The contract provides HMG with the right to terminate. HMG has alleged that the company is in breach of its obligations under the supply agreement, but the company strenuously denies this."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Valneva's Scottish manufacturing site in January this year The firm said on Monday that results from its phase three trials were due later this year. It added: ""Valneva has worked tirelessly, and to its best efforts, on the collaboration with HMG including investing significant resources and effort to respond to HMG's requests for variant-derived vaccines."" The company hopes that, dependent on the results of its continuing trials and sign-off from the UK's MHRA, initial approval could still be granted in 2021. Its vaccine is expected to be given as two doses and contains a dead version of coronavirus that cannot cause disease, but should teach the body's immune system how to fight it. Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, Scotland's Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said: ""We have enough supply even for a booster programme. I want to give absolute confidence to anyone listening that we have the supplies necessary to continue to vaccinate and particularly with a booster programme on the horizon."" Mr Yousaf said that while the announcement would be a big set-back for the Livingston plant, he would speak to Valneva to discuss its future. The Scottish Health Secretary added that he was waiting for further information from the UK government over Valneva's alleged failure to meet the terms of its contract. SNP MP Hannah Bardell, whose constituency contains the Valneva plant, said she was ""incredibly disappointed"" by the news. She pledged she would be ""working with Valneva - who have worked tirelessly on this vaccine - and will raise this urgently with the UK government"".

These updates have been brought to you by Becky Morton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Sinead Wilson, Emma Harrison, Rob Corp and James Clarke. We'll be back with more tomorrow. Masks have been in evidence on the first day back at school in New York City And this is what's been happening around the world: Prof Chris Whitty, Dr June Raine and Prof Wei Shen Lim were at the briefing in Downing Street As we've almost come to the end of today's live page, here's a brief round-up of the key news lines in the UK:  Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Thereâs a reason this decision-making process has been so
painful â it is such a finely-balanced call. Healthy children aged 12 to 15 are at such low risk from
Covid, that the benefit of vaccination on health grounds is only marginal â and
not enough to warrant going ahead with it. Even in terms of limiting school disruption, the modelling
suggests the benefits may only be small. The emergence of the Delta variant means the vaccines are
less effective at preventing infection than they once were. What is more, more than half of secondary school age
children may have natural immunity after having been infected. The assessment released by the CMOs suggests it may stop
30,000 infections between October and March in England. This is based on a number of assumptions on uptake and
spread of the virus in the coming months, which could be wrong. But if that is the case that would prevent 110,000 missed
days of in-person schooling â or one day for every 20 children. Primark says the trend for ""comfort wear"" has continued through the summer, with strong sales of leisurewear such as leggings and cycle shorts. Demand also rose for seam-free matching separates for women, as many people stayed in the UK for their holidays. However, sales at Primark were lower than expected, withsales in June and July being affected by the ""pingdemic"". It comes after the boss of clothing brand Bodendeclared formal office wear over. Johnnie Boden says: ""Because of Covid and working from home women have all felt a freedom to wear what they want, what they are comfortable in. ""Employers are much more relaxed about what people can wear. So I think the plain structured work suit, it won't disappear totally, but the demand for those sorts of products has reduced and isn't going to come back.""

The western lowland gorillas were tested after keepers at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia noticed some of them coughing, nasal discharge, and minor changes in appetite,it said,external. The zoo is giving antibody therapy to gorillas at risk of complications; it will also vaccinate other animals including orangutans and Sumatran tigers. Zoo managers believe the gorillas caught coronavirus from an asymptomatic worker. ""While humans are known to be able to transmit the virus to animals such as gorillas, and these cases have occurred at other zoos, there is currently no data to suggest that zoo animals can transmit the virus to humans,"" the zoo said. Domestic cats and dogs are also known to have been infectedby the virus. Sainsbury's says it will keep all its stores shut this Boxing Day. The UK's second largest supermarket says it will keep all of its supermarket, convenience stores and petrol stations shut as a ""massive thank you to all our colleagues for everything they have done during the last challenging year"". Argos and Habitat stores will also remain shut for the day. Sainsbury's is following in the footsteps of fellow grocers Morrisons, Waitrose and Marks & Spencer, who previously announced their intention to keep stores shut on 26 December. ""Christmas is a really special time for so many, but because of lockdown restrictions last year, lots of us weren't able to celebrate in the way we wanted,"" says Simon Roberts, chief executive of Sainsbury's. He adds: ""I want to thank our customers in advance for their understanding, which will mean as many of our team as possible can have a well-deserved break to spend time with loved ones."" Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the Usdaw trade union, welcomes the move. ""The pandemic showed just how important shopworkers are to our society and communities, as they stepped up and kept essential services running throughout. ""Key workers have done so much this year and we don't think it is too much to ask to give them the longest possible break over the festive season."" For the final question in the briefing, Professor Wei Shen Lim is asked about the data that led the JCVI to conclude the benefit of vaccination among 12 to 15-year-olds was only 'marginal'. Prof Lim says it was ""not a straight case of just doing the maths... there's much more to those numbers"". ""We are talking about different reasons for being hospitalised (for either Covid or myocarditis)... and different longer term consequences."" He says: ""We spent many hours looking at the whole range of benefits [to vaccination]."" And that brings to an end their update explaining why vaccinations for children aged 12-15 have been recommended. This video can not be played The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ, says Englandâs chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty. The benefit of vaccinating younger people is an âimportant and potentially useful additional toolâ says Englandâs chief medical officer. LBC's question is about consent. What say will parents have over whether or not their children get vaccinated? Whitty says the question of who provides consent for children was laid down in law by the Law Lords and it can't be over-ruled by ministers. He says we are not doing anything differently in this than would be done in any other medical situation. Gregor Smith says as a GP he has found himself talking to children and guardians about these issues. By and large there is a great deal of agreement between parents and their children, he says, about how to proceed.  GB News asks whether the UK should have been faster in coming to this decision. Whitty replies: ""I think to compare national differences is hard."" He says it is ""important to follow the normal process and take the time it takes to get the information needed"". A reporter from the i newspaper asks will the decision have a broader societal impact? Dr Gregor Smith says the CMO review had only considered the risks/benefits to this particular age group (12 to 15-year-olds) and the wider impact had not been looked at. But Prof Whitty adds that, in general, anyone who has a vaccine, ""will be protecting those around them"".  Natasha Clarke from the Sun newspaper asks if there is any evidence that jabbing all 12 to 15-year-olds will help prevent school closures in the winter and will it affect boosters for older people? Whitty says there is no concern about this getting in the way of jabbing the elderly. And in terms of the impact on education, it will reduce but not eliminate disruption, he says. It reduces the chance children will get Covid by about 55% so it would be ""very surprising"" if it does not reduce disruption ""by a significant extent"". However, he says jabs  alone are not going to be the thing that deals with education issues. There are no plans to re-examine jabs for under-12s, he says, adding ""let's not rush that one at all"". The Telegraph asks could this decision not have been taken sooner given the UK seems to have waited longer than other countries, which are vaccinating young people? Whitty replies that the Telegraph's reporter is ""absolutely right"" that other countries are giving the vaccine to younger people. He thinks most parents and most children and young people will want the decision to be thorough, he says. ""Rushing these things doesn't seem like the right thing to do,"" he says. ""It's about doing it thoroughly."" ""This is a more difficult decision"" compared with vaccinating adults, Whitty adds.  The Times asks if the vaccination is an offer or ""just advice""? ""What we are not trying to do is say to children you must do this - but  on balance - we are in favour,"" says Prof Whitty. Prof Whitty says the four CMOs aligned themselves with the JCVI's  nuanced recommendation. He says the view of the CMOs was that the cumulative thinking on vaccinating young people was that it pushed recommendation ""over the line"".   Sky asks the next question - do the CMOs feel undermined by how the whole process has been handled? Prof Whitty says he cares more about getting it right. Sound decisions are ""completely barn-door obvious"", he says, and - unlike jabs for 85-year-olds - vaccinating children is more complicated, he adds. Medicine is about communicating things that are complicated, he adds.  Emily Morgan from ITV asks how the medical establishment will convince parents to vaccinate children, given there are only marginal benefits. Dr Gregor Smith, CMO for Scotland, says informed consent remains ""really important"", It's vital ""not to mistake marginal benefit for no benefit"", he stresses. He says it is important to stick to straightforward language and explain in child-friendly terms the advantages of proceeding with vaccination. ""As a parent we all want the very best for all our children,"" Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland Dr Michael McBride says. Both the MHRA and JCVI had concluded there were benefits of vaccination even if that benefit was only small, he adds. Talking about the wider benefits, he says education is ""vitally important for realising our life opportunities"" ""Children need the continuity and predictability of being in school for their well-being."" All of that will be an important part of the consent process, he adds.   The BBC's Fergus Walsh asks isn't there a danger that many parents and children are going to be left confused because the JCVI did not recommend that all 12-15 year olds be vaccinated, yet the Chief Medical Officers have. Prof Chris Whitty says there is no conflict. The JCVI said there was a marginal benefit, he adds. In medicine you have to take various factors into account to work out risks and benefits, he says, and it is the CMOs' belief that there is an ""additional"" benefit from giving the jabs to all young people in this age group. ""We think that what we are doing is very much in line with JCVI,"" he says. Our children ""have suffered very significantly in terms of disruption through their education"", says Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael McBride. ""I would wish to ensure... that the information and advice to ensure parents and children can make an informed decision is available to them,"" he says. Dr Frank
Atherton, Chief Medical Officer for Wales, stresses the group of CMOs across the UK had taken account of the broad rights of children. He emphasises the importance of this wider picture - particularly with regard to Wales, where there exists specific legislation on human rights for young people. He says his message to the young people of Wales is that the vaccine will bring benefits both to them personally and their education, but ultimately the choice remains their own.  Â© 2025 BBC.
