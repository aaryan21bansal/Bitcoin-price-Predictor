Partial lifting of Aberdeen lockdown restrictions,"Some of Aberdeen's lockdown restrictions have been lifted from midnight. Pubs and restaurants were shut 18 days ago, and restrictions were placed on travel and visits to other households, after a spike in Covid-19 cases linked to bars and nightlife in the city. The five-mile restriction on non-essential travel and the ban on indoor gatherings ended at midnight. Hospitality businesses will be able to reopen from Wednesday. However, the reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants will be subject to environmental health checks. Talks have been going on throughout Sunday involving the Scottish government, Aberdeen City Council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland. 'We will only open again when I think it is safe' Local lockdown in Aberdeen extended Restrictions 'having an impact on cases' Aberdeen lockdown 'feels never-ending' From midnight, limitations on hospital and care home visits will also be lifted. Businesses due to open on Monday in line with the national route map can also reopen, with the exception of cafes, restaurants or any hospitality element within them. Hospitality business owners are being urged to get in touch with Aberdeen City Council if they have not already had an environmental health check. The meeting heard the latest update from the Incident Management Team on the level of the virus and its transmission in Aberdeen. The latest figures show a total of 427 cases have been identified in the Grampian Health Board area since 26 July. Of these, 259 are associated with the same cluster linked to Aberdeen pubs, and 1,258 contacts have now been identified. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I am grateful to people in Aberdeen - the local authority and health board, local businesses, and everyone who lives there - for complying so well with the rules that were put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. ""In particular I am grateful for the understanding of the businesses that were required to close in order to help beat the virus. ""It's due to the commitment of people in the city, as well as world-class contact tracing that means we are now able to lift some of these measures from Monday and then again from Wednesday, but it is vitally important that everyone follows the FACTS rules in order to prevent an outbreak of this scale occurring again. ""That way we can move forward and get our economy, our society and our lives generally back to as much normality as possible."" The cluster was linked to bars in the city Susan Webb, director of Public Health for NHS Grampian said: ""We must be cautious to ensure the progress we have made is maintained. ""Crucially, we must all be observing physical distancing from those not in our immediate household; whether at work, meeting socially, in a supermarket or out for exercise and recreation."" She said it was also ""vitally important"" that anyone identified as a close contact of a detected case followed the guidance on isolating for 14 days. The local lockdown restrictions, which have affected 228,000 people in Aberdeen, were: bars, cafes, restaurants and pubs were closed no travel for more than five miles for leisure or holidays no travel to the city for leisure or to visit friends and family, even if you lived in Aberdeenshire no indoor visits with other households visiting suspended for most hospitals A Â£1m support fund was set up for the city, with grants of up to Â£1,500 available for hospitality businesses. FACTS F - Face coverings. These should be used in shops and on public transport (buses, trains and taxis) A - Avoid crowded places. C - Clean your hands frequently, using water and soap whenever possible. T - Two metres - observe physical distancing. S - Self-isolate and book a test if you are suffering from COVID-19 symptoms.

Teens' anxiety levels dropped in lockdown - study,"Anxiety levels among young teenagers dropped during the coronavirus pandemic, a study has suggested. Thirteen to 14-year-olds were less anxious during lockdown than they had been last October, according to the University of Bristol survey. Researchers surveyed 1,000 secondary school children in south west England. They said the results were a ""big surprise"" and it raised questions about the impact of the school environment on teenagers' mental health. The findings come after Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said childrenwere more likely to be harmed by not returning to schoolthan they were if they caught coronavirus. The UK's four chief medical officers have sought to allay parents' concerns ahead of schools reopening in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the coming days. Schools in Scotland have already returned. And in a bidto encourage parents to send children back to school,Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it is ""vitally important"" pupils return to the classroom, with the life chances of a generation at stake. What can we learn from schools that have reopened? Missing school is 'worse than virus for children' Schools let down by lack of 'plan B', says union Researchers compared findings from a survey taken in October last year to answers given by teenagers in May this year. Both girls and boys recorded decreased levels of anxiety during that timeframe. In October, 54% of 13 to 14-year-old girls and 26% of boys of the same age said they felt anxious. When surveyed in May - several weeks after schools shut to most pupils and nationwide lockdown restrictions came into force - the proportion dropped to 45% of girls and 18% of boys. Researchers questioned 1,000 year nine students from 17 secondary schools across the south west of England. ""With the whole world in the grip of a devastating pandemic, which has thrown everyone's lives into turmoil, the natural expectation would be to see an increase in anxiety,"" said lead author Emily Widnall. ""While we saw anxiety levels rise for a few of our participants, it was a big surprise to discover quite the opposite was the case for many of them."" Ms Widnall said pupils who felt least connected to school before lockdown saw a larger decrease in anxiety, raising questions about how the school environment affects some younger teenagers' mental well-being. Some parents said their experience echoed the survey results. Rebecca from Cardiff, who has a son aged 14 with Asperger's Syndrome and a 12-year-old boy who is also on the autism spectrum, said both children were happy before but the drop in their stress levels has been ""unbelievable"". She said they sleep better and have fewer ""teenage episodes"", such as ""shouting, screaming, not wanting to get ready for school, not wanting to get out of bed"". Their grades have also improved because ""removing the social side from education has allowed them to focus on the learning"", Rebecca said, but added that they were fortunate to have a school which handled online learning well. Caroline Ryder, from Warwickshire, said her sons, aged 13 and 15, missed friends but had been happier and calmer, with less conflict over homework or school behaviour issues. She said they had kept busy during lockdown learning things from YouTube that were unrelated to the curriculum, such as growing vegetables, bread-making, sewing, home-brewing, carpentry and bicycle maintenance. ""This whole episode has demonstrated to me that school, in its current format, is not a happy experience for many kids,"" she said. Others said their children had suffered from the lack of school, however. Dr Judi Kidger, from the University of Bristol, said: ""Our findings raise questions about the role of the school environment in explaining rises in mental health difficulties among teenagers in recent years. ""As schools reopen, we need to consider ways in which schools can be more supportive of mental health for all students."" SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? There was a 2% decrease in boys at risk of depression and a 3% increase in girls at risk of depression. The findings have been published in a report for the National Institute for Health Research School for Public Health Research. Meanwhile, the UK's largest teaching unionhas accused the government of letting down pupils, teachers and parentsby failing to have a ""plan B"" if infections rise. The National Education Union, which represents more than 450,000 members, said more staff, extra teaching space and greater clarity on what to do if there is a spike in cases is needed for schools to reopen safely. It is expected that pupils in Northern Ireland going into years seven, 12 and 14 will return to school full-time on Monday, with the rest going back from 31 August. In England and Wales, pupils will return to school from 1 September.

Trump's sister says he's an 'unprincipled phoney',"Maryanne Trump Barry said her brother Donald just ""wants to appeal to his base"" US President Donald Trump's eldest sister, a former federal judge, has said her brother is a liar who ""has no principles"", secret recordings reveal. The critical remarks by Maryanne Trump Barry were recorded by her niece, Mary Trump, who last month published a book excoriating the president. ""His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God,"" Ms Barry is heard saying. ""It's the phoniness and this cruelty."" Mary Trump said she had taped her aunt to protect herself from litigation. Mr Trump responded to the latest revelations in a statement issued by the White House, saying: ""Every day it's something else, who cares."" The recordings were first reported by The Washington Post, after which the Associated Press obtained them. In the secret recordings, Ms Barry criticises the Trump administration's immigration policy, which has led to children being held at migrant detention centres at the border. ""All he wants to do is appeal to his base,"" she said. One of the claims made in Mary Trump's memoir - Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man - is that her uncle paid a friend to take a SAT test for him - a standardised exam which determines university placement. Ms Barry refers to this in the recording, even suggesting that she remembers the name of the friend involved. ""He got into University of Pennsylvania because he had somebody take the exams,"" she said. Five shocking passages in Mary Trump's tell-all book Trump's parents and siblings: What do we know of them? Ms Barry has been supportive of her brother Donald and has previously said the two were close. She once told the story of how he had visited her every day she was in hospital following an operation. ""Once would have been enough - the duty call. That's how love shows, when you go that extra yard."" She also said she ""knew better even as a child than to even attempt to compete with Donald"". A Superior Court judge in California has ordered the president to pay $44,100 (Â£34,000) to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The sum was awarded to cover her legal fees relating to a non-disclosure agreement over an alleged affair between the two. Ms Daniels alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. The president denies the affair. Ms Daniels said she had signed an agreement to keep quiet about her claims in exchange for $130,000 in October 2016, days before the presidential election. In a court ruling published online, a judge ruled that despite the case being dismissed,Ms Daniels was ""the prevailing party"" in the dispute,externaland therefore her costs should be covered.

Cockpit exchange recorded after missile hit jet,"This video can not be played Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran A black box recorder recovered from a Ukrainian passenger jet mistakenly shot down by Iran in January captured a conversation in the cockpit moments after a missile strike, officials say. Data from the Boeing 737 indicated that the pilots and passengers were alive before a second missile hit 25 seconds later, Iran's aviation authority said. The Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) flight crashed shortly after taking off from Tehran. All 176 people on board were killed. After initially denying any responsibility for the incident, Iran admitted it had shot down the UIA flight ""unintentionally"", calling it a ""disastrous mistake"" by Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' Who were the victims of the crash? Iran's air defences had been on high alert at the time. Hours earlier, the country had fired ballistic missiles at two US bases in Iraq in retaliation for the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani by a US drone strike in Baghdad. During a press conference on Sunday, Capt Zanganeh, head of the Civil Aviation Organisation of Iran (CAOI), said ""up to 19 seconds"" of conversation between two pilots and a pilot instructor had been captured in the aircraft's cabin after the first missile struck. It was ""25 seconds later that the second missile hit the plane"", he said, adding: ""They were piloting the plane until the last moment."" He said information recorded by the plane's black boxes - which hold key data and communications from the cockpit - indicated that the aircraft had been ""in a normal flight corridor"" before the first missile exploded, sending shrapnel into the aircraft. Capt Zanganeh added: ""At this moment, the plane has an electrical problem and the auxiliary power of the plane is turned on at the order of the pilot instructor. Both engines were on in the seconds after the explosion. ""No sound was heard from the passenger cabin at that moment... The recording stopped after 19 seconds."" No details of the cockpit conversation were disclosed. The recovered flight recorder from Ukraine International Airlines (UIA) Flight PS752 Iran had delayed releasing the plane's ""black box"" voice recorder but in July sent it to France for examination. No other parties involved in the black box analysis have yet commented. On 8 January, at 06:12 local time (02:42 GMT), UIA flight PS752 took off from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran. The plane was a Boeing 737-800 - one of the international airline industry's most widely used aircraft models. Before leaving the airport's air space, the plane appeared to turn around to return to the runway. Shortly afterwards, it crashed. The government in Tehran initially said the UIA plane had suffered a technical problem shortly after take-off. It cited witnesses including the crew of another passenger plane who said it had been on fire prior to impact. Authorities said they had lost radar contact when the plane was at an altitude of about 8,000ft (2,400m), minutes after taking off. A later report by the CAOI said the air defence unit that targeted the passenger plane had recently moved and had failed to calibrate its equipment correctly. As a result, it misidentified the civilian plane as a hostile object. The report also said the missile battery had been unable to communicate with their command centre, and had fired on the plane without receiving official approval.

England force Pakistan to follow on,"This video can not be played Anderson closes in on 600 wickets to put England in control Third Test, Ageas Bowl, Southampton (day three of five) England 583-8 dec (154.4 overs):Crawley 267, Buttler 152 Pakistan 273 all out (93 overs):Azhar 141*, Anderson 5-56 Scorecard England forced Pakistan to follow on on day three of the final Test at the Ageas Bowl despite a defiant century by visiting captain Azhar Ali. Azhar's controlled 141 not out dragged his side from 75-5 and the point of implosion in reply to England 583-8 declared. He shared a sixth-wicket partnership of 138 with wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan, who battled to 53. After Rizwan was removed by Chris Woakes, England could have run through the tail had it not been for an incredible passage of play that saw three catches dropped in the space of 10 James Anderson deliveries. Anderson eventually had last man Naseem Shah caught at third slip to complete figures of 5-56 and move to 598 Test wickets. With Pakistan 273 all out, 310 behind, they were given half an hour to bat again in the evening gloom, and Azhar promoted himself to open. However, just as the players returned for the start of the Pakistan second innings, the umpires decided the light was not good enough to resume. With rain forecast for Tuesday, there may be added pressure on England to wrap up victory on day four in order to seal a 2-0 series win. Anderson is England's 'GOAT' - Bess Vote for England's Test player of the summer TMS podcast: Pakistan follow on against England With such a massive total on the board and Anderson charging towards 600 Test wickets, England seemed primed for a rush towards victory in a rain-interrupted morning session. However, it is to the credit of Azhar and Rizwan that Pakistan dug in and made the home side work hard. On a slow, flat pitch, England had to cycle through their options, particularly when the ball got soft. Jofra Archer bowled as quickly as he has since last summer's Ashes and Dom Bess found turn, but there was a period in the afternoon when batting was comfortable. It was at that time that England could have used the inspiration of a crowd, or the magic of the absent Ben Stokes. Still, they were only ever one breakthrough away from Pakistan's long tail, and it was their poor catching that delayed the inevitable. This video can not be played Azhar guides Archer for four to bring up his 6000th Test run Azhar has struggled with the bat since being appointed captain at the end of last year, part of a wider lean run that had seen him pass 40 only once in his previous 18 innings. This, though, was a determined return to form, produced when Pakistan were in huge trouble and celebrated joyfully by his team-mates. Circumspect at first, he gradually found fluency. Azhar scored only 29 runs from his first 112 balls, then 74 from his next 93. He was strong square on the wicket on both sides. The combative Rizwan, who took a nasty blow to the helmet from Archer, provided doughty support in the largest partnership made against England this summer. However, when Rizwan tickled Woakes down the leg side to be caught by diving wicketkeeper Jos Buttler, the lower order was exposed to the second new ball. Even then, Azhar managed to drag 60 more runs out of the last four wickets, with the skipper benefitting from two of England's drops and remaining unbeaten. This video can not be played 'What a catch that is!' - Broad's reaction to Buttler brilliance With Pakistan resuming on 24-3 and Asad Shafiq tentatively poking Anderson's sixth ball of the day to Joe Root at first slip, it seemed set to be a straightforward day for England, especially after Bess' ripping off-break took the edge of Fawad Alam. That was the first of three excellent catches by Buttler, whose keeping had previously been under fire, the best of which was a flying grab down the leg side to hold Shaheen Afridi off Stuart Broad. Skipper Root also held two smart catches, with England doing a professional job before things fell apart in the fading light late on. First Azhar was missed by Rory Burns at second slip, then, two balls later, fourth slip Zak Crawley put down a straightforward chance to reprieve Mohammad Abbas. In Anderson's next over, a comical passage of play saw Broad put down the simplest catch off Azhar at mid-on, only to angrily hurl the ball at the striker's end, hit the stumps direct and run out the dawdling Abbas. When the innings was finally wrapped up, there would still have been time for Anderson to attempt to reach his next milestone, only for the bizarre sight of the players being sent back to the dressing rooms before they could get to the middle. This video can not be played Watch England drop three chances off Anderson by Michael Vaughan, former England captain on the Test Match Special podcast Pakistan, when they lost the early wicket this morning, many of us thought they would fall in a heap, but then Azhar Ali came out. He played some glorious shots, and in Mohammad Rizwan they have found a fighter, a character. That partnership was special. I just hope James Anderson can grab a couple tomorrow and go home with some positivity of thought in his mind.

Christchurch gunman's sentencing hearing begins,"This video can not be played Maysoon Salama, whose son died in the attack, said Tarrant ""terrorised the whole of New Zealand and saddened the world"" The man who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019 had plans to target a third mosque, his sentencing hearing has heard. Brenton Tarrant also planned to burn down the mosques, wanting to ""inflict as many fatalities as possible"". The Australian has pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 attempted murders and one charge of terrorism. Tarrant, 29, faces life in prison, possibly without parole - a sentence never before imposed in New Zealand. He was confronted by survivors and relatives of the victims in court on Monday. ""You gave yourself the authority to take the souls of 51 innocent people, their only crime - in your eyes - being Muslims,"" said Maysoon Salama, whose son Atta Elayyan was killed. ""You transgress beyond comprehension, I cannot forgive you."" Survivors and relatives of victims are attending the court hearing The attacks, parts of which the gunman streamed live online, saw him open fire at two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March last year. He first drove to the Al Noor mosque, firing on people taking part in Friday prayers. He then drove about 5km (3 miles) to the Linwood mosque and killed more people. The attack sent shockwaves around the world and prompted New Zealand to make swift changes to its gun laws. The sentencing hearing, which will last four days, began on Monday morning in Christchurch. Covid-19 restrictions mean the main court room is relatively empty. Hundreds will watch the proceedings on video feeds from other courtrooms in the city to allow for social distancing measures. Dressed in grey prison clothes and surrounded in the dock by three police officers, the gunman reportedly remained silent, occasionally looking around the room where survivors and relatives of the victims were sitting. Tarrant was surrounded by police officers as he sat in the dock Crown prosecutor Barnaby Hawes told the court that the gunman had began formulating a plan years earlier, and his goal was to ""inflict as many fatalities as possible"". He gathered information about mosques in New Zealand - studying floor plans, locations and further details - with the aim of targeting them at the time they would be busiest. In the months before the attack, he travelled to Christchurch and flew a drone over his primary target, the Al Noor mosque. He also planned to target the Ashburton Mosque in addition to the Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre, but was detained while on his way to the third mosque. On the day of the attack, he shot people on the street as they tried to escape the Al Noor mosque, the court heard. This included one victim, Ansi Alibava, whose body he drove over as he left the mosque. As he drove towards the Linwood Islamic Centre, he stopped and shot at men of African origin who were able to escape. He briefly pointed his gun at a Caucasian man, the court heard, but then ""smiled and then drove off"". Who were the victims? How the attacks unfolded He told police after his arrest that his plan was to burn down the mosques after his attack, and that he wished he had done so. Tarrant is representing himself in court. He had previously denied the charges and was due to face trial in June, but reversed his plea. He faces a minimum sentence of 17 years, but Justice Cameron Mander, the High Court judge presiding over the case, has the power to sentence him to a full life term with no parole - a sentence never before imposed in New Zealand. More than 60 people will give victim impact statements over the course of the next few days. People arrive for the sentencing hearing at Christchurch High Court The imam of Al-Noor Mosque, Gamal Fouda - who was the first to speak - addressed Tarrant, calling him ""misguided and misled"". He said he saw the ""hate in the eyes of a brainwashed terrorist"" as he was standing in the pulpit, telling Tarrant: ""Your hatred is unnecessary."" The son of victim Ashraf Ali, said he still suffered trauma, saying: ""I have flashbacks, seeing dead bodies all around me. Blood everywhere."" Among the other victims were: Three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim, who was shot directly while clinging to his father's leg Abdukadir Elmi, 70, from Somalia who previously survived a civil war Naeem Rashid, originally from Pakistan, who was shot while trying to tackle the gunman Hosne Ara, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived. Some relatives of victims travelled from overseas and had undergone a two-week coronavirus quarantine in order to take part.

""I don't think there's anything I can say that is going to ease how traumatic that period is going to be,"" she said last week. She has vowed never to say the gunman's name, saying soon after the attack: ""He sought many things from his act of terror - but one was notoriety."" Less than a month after the shootings, New Zealand's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.

Bayern beat PSG to win Champions League,"Bayern are the first team to win every game en route to winning the European Cup or Champions League (11 wins) Bayern Munich overcame Paris St-Germain in a tightly contested Champions League final in Lisbon to claim the crown for the sixth time. Kingsley Coman, who started his career at PSG, settled a tense affair with a 59th-minute header at the far post from Joshua Kimmich's cross to leave the French giants still searching for that elusive Champions League triumph. It was a night of joy for Bayern coach Hansi Flick, who added the Champions League to the Bundesliga after initially taking over as interim coach from sacked Niko Kovac in November. In contrast, it was a night of bitter disappointment for PSG's two attacking superstars Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, who failed to produce their best and found themselves frustrated by Bayern keeper and man of the match Manuel Neuer when they had the best of the first-half chances. Mbappe's pain increased in the second half when he looked to be tripped by Kimmich in the area, but PSG's penalty claims were ignored - leaving Bayern to celebrate being crowned champions of Europe once more, becoming the first team to win the trophy by winning every Champions League game in a single campaign. 'Champions League format excites - but as a one-off' How you rated the players Football Daily podcast: Coman crowns Bayern kings of Europe Listen: Champions League final highlights on BBC Sounds Kingsley Coman is the fifth Frenchman to score in a Champions League final Bayern fully merited their sixth triumph in this tournament, an all-consuming machine that demonstrated graphically that they could overpower teams with attacking prowess but also showed the grit, determination and organisation to frustrate PSG's attacking golden boys Mbappe and Neymar. And huge credit must go to coach Flick, who has guided Bayern to 21 successive victories, reviving and inspiring Bayern after emerging from the shadows when Kovac was sacked in November and the club in crisis. Flick also illustrated his ability to make the big calls, selecting Coman ahead of the influential Croat Ivan Perisic and being rewarded with that decisive moment just before the hour. Bayern also leant heavily on one of the great figures of the club's successes, keeper Neuer, who was at his magnificent best to stand toe-to-toe with Neymar in those crucial first-half duels and make the saves that made such a huge contribution to this victory. Bayern's status as European champions is deserved, having won every game in the tournament this season, not only having the ability to produce blistering performances of the sort that overwhelmed Barcelona 8-2 in the quarter-final and frustrate PSG's threat in the final. This is a developing team, with Leroy Sane already signed from Manchester City for next season, and Bayern's future looks bright under Flick. Neymar is the most expensive footballer of all time (222m euros, Â£200m) PSG looked to the two great superstars Neymar and Mbappe to spearhead their assault on the trophy they crave most after such lavish investment - but they were unable to break down the Bayern Munich barrier. The pair had chances, especially in the first half, but their finishing was not at its best and the imposing figure of Neuer denied them, with Mbappe's bad miss at the end of the opening period proving a pivotal moment. This has been PSG's best Champions League campaign but this will not ease the pain of defeat for the players or coach Thomas Tuchel, who must now revamp his side as experienced captain and defensive pivot Thiago Silva leaves the club. Neymar and Mbappe will remain the big hopes for a club of huge ambition but they will know a huge opportunity to break this final frontier was missed in Lisbon, especially as their big rivals will come back stronger next season. Bayern have won the European Cup/Champions League for a sixth time (level with Liverpool) and for the first time since 2012-13. Only Real Madrid (13) and AC Milan (7) have been crowned champions on more occasions. PSG failed to score in a game in a major European competition for the first time in 35 matches, last failing to do so in a 1-0 defeat by Manchester City in April 2016. Each of the past seven teams competing in their first European Cup/Champions League final have all lost, with the last first-time winners being Borussia Dortmund in 1997 against Juventus. On only four previous occasions has a manager older than Bayern boss Hansi Flick (55y 181d) won the Champions League (Raymond Goethals with Marseille in 1993 - 71, Jupp Heynckes with Bayern Munich in 2013 - 68 and Alex Ferguson with Man Utd in 1999 and 2008 - 57 and 66). Bayern became just the third side in Champions League history to hit the 500-goal mark in the competition (500 goals in total), after Barcelona (517) and Real Madrid (567). Bayern attacker Kingsley Coman became the fifth Frenchman to score in a Champions League final (Karim Benzema 2018, Zinedine Zidane 2002, Marcel Desailly 1994 and Basile Boli 1993). PSG's Keylor Navas is the third goalkeeper to appear in a Champions League final with two different teams, after Hans-Jorg Butt (Bayern Munich and Bayer Leverkusen) and Edwin van der Sar (Man Utd and Ajax). Thiago Silva is the first Brazilian to start a European Cup/Champions League final as captain.

"Schools let down by lack of 'plan B', says union","More staff, extra teaching space and greater clarity on what to do if there is a spike in cases is needed for schools to reopen safely, the UK's largest teaching union has said. The National Education Union (NEU) accused the government of letting down pupils, teachers and parents by failing to have a ""plan B"" if infections rise. The UK's four chief medical officers have insisted it is safe to return. The education secretary said ministers were doing ""everything we can"" to help. Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school in the coming days and weeks. In Scotland, schools have already reopened. Writing in the Sunday Times,,externalGavin Williamson said he wanted to reassure every parent and pupil that schools were ""ready for them"", and the autumn return to schools was ""more important than ever"" this year. Meanwhile, a further six deaths have been announced in the UK, bringing the total number of people to have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus to 41,429. On Saturday, the UK's chief medical adviser warned that childrenwere more likely to be harmed by not returning to the classroom in Septemberthan if they catch coronavirus. Nerves and delight: What's it like back at school? Missing school is 'worse than virus for children' How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Prof Chris Whitty said ""the chances of children dying from Covid-19 are incredibly small"" - but missing lessons ""damages children in the long run"". Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, which represents more than 450,000 members, said the union agreed about the benefits of pupils returning to full-time education, but ministers needed to provide more information on what to do in the event of an outbreak. ""Government advice needs to cover the possible self-isolation of bubbles and, in extremis, moving to rotas or to more limited opening. It needs to cover advice to heads about the protections needed for staff in high-risk categories if infection rates rise."" This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The chances of children dying from Covid are incredibly small"" Extra staff should be employed and additional teaching space provided so education can continue ""in a Covid-secure manner"" if infections rise, Mr Courtney said. He added: ""This should include employment of student teachers who have finished their courses and not yet found jobs, as well as mobilisation of supply staff."" Will pupils do a full school day next term? Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? In a joint statement, the nations' four chief medical officers said: ""The current global pandemic means that there are no risk-free options, but it is important that parents and teachers understand the balance of risks to achieve the best course of action for their children."" The statement said evidence suggested schools were ""probably not a common route of transmission"". The NASUWT teachers' union said the ""critical importance"" of social distancing and hygiene had been reinforced by the chief medical officers' statement. Of the more than one million children who attended pre-school and primary schools in England in June, 70 children and 128 staff were infected in outbreaks of the virus,according to a Public Health England study published on Sunday.,external SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? It is expected that pupils in Northern Ireland going into years seven, 12 and 14 will return to school full-time on Monday, with the rest going back from 31 August. In England and Wales, pupils will return to school from 1 September. Paul Jackson, headteacher at Manorfield Primary School, Tower Hamlets, east London, told the BBC that it would have been useful to have clearer guidance from the government for school leaders and additional funding to help to pay for extra cleaning and other resources. ""The guidance is issued for all schools. So whether you are a very small school, with maybe just 70 pupils or whether you are a large school like us with 750 pupils, the guidance issued is exactly the same,"" he said. Mr Jackson said it was ""almost inevitable"" that there would be a rise in cases when schools reopened, but it was important that children return to the classroom. Prof Whitty, who is also England's chief medical officer, said ""many more [children] were likely to be harmed by not going than harmed by going"" to school. According to the Office for National Statistics' latest data on ages, there were 10 deaths recorded as ""due to Covid-19"" among those aged 19 and under in England and Wales between March and June - and 46,725 deaths among those aged 20 and over. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We welcome the report from Public Health England, which makes clear that coronavirus infections in schools are extremely rare, as part of the growing evidence base which indicates schools do not appear to be a primary driver of infections in the community.""

'Vitally important' children return to class - PM,"Schools in Northern Ireland welcomed some year groups back on Monday It is ""vitally important"" children go back to school, with the life chances of a generation at stake, Boris Johnson has said in a message to parents. As the autumn term began in Northern Ireland, the prime minister said the risk of contracting coronavirus at schools across the UK was ""very small"". He said missing any more school was ""far more damaging"" for children. Meanwhile No 10 said it had ""no plans"" to follow Scotland inreviewing rules on wearing face coverings at school. But the BBC understands the government is considering measures which could see secondary schools operating on a rota in parts of England where there are Covid-19 outbreaks. On face coverings, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a consultation on their use in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools was in its ""final stages"". It follows guidance from the World Health Organization thatchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. Since Scottish schools reopened last month, there have been several confirmed cases among pupils and staff, including at Kingspark School in Dundee, where23 people - most of them adult staff - have tested positiveand which has shut for two weeks. Heads in England - where face coverings are not recommended for schools -are calling for more clarityon whether staff or pupils can choose to wear face coverings. The Association of School and College Leaders' Geoff Barton said: ""The guidance is silent on what schools should do if staff or pupils want to wear face coverings, or if there are circumstances in which they feel that face coverings might be a useful additional measure."" This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says the government ""is not in a position where we're suggesting"" face masks in secondary schools. But a Downing Street spokesman said no such review was planned for England's schools, adding: ""We are conscious of the fact that [face masks] would obstruct communication between teachers and pupils."" And Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government was not suggesting secondary pupils or teachers should wear face coverings because there was a  system of controls in place that meant it wasn't necessary. Classroom buzz, sanitiser stations and more masks How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How dangerous is coronavirus for children? But he said there were ""elements of discretion"" in guidance for schools provided by Public Health England. Somepupils in Northern Ireland returned to schoolon Monday, while term starts in England and Wales in September. The government's pondering of measures that could see England's secondary schools operating on a rota system if necessary is part of discussions under way on four different levels of schools operating. They aim to keep primary schools operating as normal wherever possible, with localised restrictions on secondary schools where needed to bring the R number down. Updated guidelines for schools for coping with local outbreaks are expected within weeks. Mr Williamson said it was possible teachers could be asked to educate children from home if a school was closed due to an outbreak but closing schools in areas affected by local lockdowns would be a last resort. The education secretary also said every school would have home testing kits for coronavirus by the time they reopened. Mr Johnson thanked school staff for spending the summer ""making classrooms Covid-secure"". Citingcomments from England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty,the prime minister said ""nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school"". In avideo message,external, he added it was the ""best way"" to help children with any mental health problems resulting from or exacerbated by lockdown. Prof Whitty had said children were more likely to be harmed by not returning to school next month than if they caught coronavirus. He said evidence showed they ""much less commonly"" needed hospital treatment or became severely ill with coronavirus than adults. Temperature checks for staff are the new normal for this primary school in Belfast According to the Office for National Statistics' latest data on ages, there were 10 deaths recorded as ""due to Covid-19"" among those aged 19 and under in England and Wales between March and June - and 46,725 deaths among those aged 20 and over. And of the more than one million children who attended pre-school and primary schools in England in June, 70 children and 128 staff caught the virus,according to a Public Health England study published on Sunday.,external It said most of the 30 outbreaks detected in that time had likely been caused by staff members infecting other staff or students, with only two outbreaks thought to have involved students infecting other students. And it suggested children who went to school in June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home than at school. Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, told BBC Breakfast the study should ""reassure"" teachers that transmission from students to teachers was rare. But she said the higher risk of staff-to-staff transmission meant teachers should remember to maintain social distancing and good hand hygiene while on coffee breaks,  ""because that does seem to be a risk factor"". Dr Matthew Snape, associate professor in paediatrics at Oxford University, said the risk to children from Covid-19 appeared to be low but the risk was that pupils could pass the virus to each other on the playground or in the classroom and then go home and ""take that infection into their household"". This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? The NEU, the UK's largest teaching union, said schools were being let down by the lack of a ""plan B"" as they prepared to reopen. It said more staff, extra teaching space and greater clarity on what to do if there was a spike in cases were needed for schools to reopen safely. Paul Jackson, head teacher of a primary school in east London, told the BBC it would have been useful to have clearer guidance from the government for school leaders and additional funding to help to pay for extra cleaning and other resources. ""Whether you are a very small school, with maybe just 70 pupils or whether you are a large school like us with 750 pupils, the guidance issued is exactly the same,"" he said. Kay Mountfield, head teacher at Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her school would reopen with safety measures, such as Perspex screens around teachers' desks, and had hired marquees to provide extra classroom space. She urged the government to set up a dedicated helpline for school leaders to advise on keeping sites safe. Gemma Fraser says when eight-year-old daughter Poppy bounded out of bed on her first day back to primary school in Edinburgh, the children abided by the new rules - and it was the parents who had to be reminded about social distancing. ""The major change is they have to stagger the start times - so my daughter's group is the first in, at 8.40am, and the first to leave,"" Gemma says. ""The idea is that there aren't as many parents in at the same time. But it's actually been the parents who've been struggling with socially distancing the most - we've had several emails from the school reminding us to stand 2m apart. It feels like being back at school yourself."" Gemma says the playground has been segregated for dropping off and pick-up times so parents don't congregate. There are also separate entrance and exit points. ""We've missed seeing each other as well,"" she adds. ""So it's only natural we want to catch up - but we have to behave ourselves."" Read more:What can we learn from schools that have reopened? Shadow education secretary Kate Green accused the government of being ""asleep at the wheel"" on the reopening of schools. She said ministers had spent the past two weeks ""totally pre-occupied with their own exams fiasco when they should've been out supporting schools and reassuring parents"". Exams chaos 'must never happen again' Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, many pupils in years seven, 12 and 14 were back at school on Monday for the first time since March. But at least two schools were not opening as planned because of people testing positive for coronavirus. Education Minister Peter Weir said opening schools was probably the ""top priority"" for the executive. But he said that there would be ""undoubtedly bumps along the road"" and staff and pupils will have to adapt to a new way of working. SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when?

Tel Aviv covers over Peeping Toms beach muralThe Israeli city paints over an old mural amid heightened awareness of sexual violence against women.,"Many had found the mural offensive The Israeli authorities have covered over a mural known as Peeping Toms at a beach in Tel Aviv in response to an outcry over the suspected gang rape of a teenage girl at another beach resort. The mural shows two young men in bathing suits peering inside what is the women's changing room. Almost 20 years old, it commemorates a 1970s film of the same name that was partly filmed at the beach. Women's rights groups had long demanded the mural's removal. Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai tweeted (in Hebrew) that the time had come to cover it over,externalafter the alleged assault in Eilat. The mayor agreed it was time to ""say goodbye to it"" ""Freedom of expression and the arts are important values in our city but because the painting was seen as acceptance of a forbidden and criminal act, we have decided to say goodbye to it,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Police launchedan investigation this month into the alleged gang rape of a 16-year-old girlat a hotel in Eilat. At least three people have been detained so far. One of the suspects said more than 30 men had had sex with the girl but denied rape, according to local media reports. The men are accused of raping the teenager while she was intoxicated. Last year, a 19-year-old British woman claimed she had been gang-raped by 12 Israeli men at a hotel in Cyprus. She was laterfound guilty of lying about being rapedand given a four-month suspended sentence. The case was denounced by women's rights groups.

France is in a ""risky situation"" as coronavirus cases rise again, the country's health minister has said. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Olivier VÃ©ran said the higher numbers were not only due to increased testing. The outbreak in France ""never stopped"", he said, adding: ""It was only controlled during the lockdown and the progressive easing of lockdown measures."" ""It's not a French exception, it's the European dynamic,"" he told the newspaper. He went on to explain that the virus is spreading four times more among those under the age of 40 as the over 65s, but warned that this situation could change if younger people spread the virus to elderly and more vulnerable people. On Saturday, 3,602 new daily cases were reported in France following two days with more than 4,000 new infections. The country has reported more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Japan's official surrender came two weeks after Emperor Hirohito announced an end to the fighting on 15 August 1945 Throughout the pandemic, health experts have warned of the serious health risk that Covid-19 poses to the elderly in particular. But that won't stop dozens of US veterans from gathering in Hawaii next month to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two,according to the Associated Press.,external The former soldiers, who are now in their 90s or older, will gather aboard the USS Missouri, where Japan's official surrender was signed on 2 September 1945 in Tokyo Bay and which is now docked in Pearl Harbour. They will board specially chartered flights and be isolated in hotels when not attending the events, which will mostly be held outdoors and not be open to the public. The commemoration was meant to involve thousands of people and veterans have been looking forward to it for years. âI want to go back because that day, as much as I remember it - what happened, why we were there, the fact that it was the end of the realities of war and killing and all - it was the first day that I had to start answering, âWhat am I going to do with the rest of my life?ââ 95-year-old Jerry Pedersen, who witnessed the surrender in 1945, told the AP. Before lockdown, Chris McLone was looking forward to a good year. In his late 40s, he felt fit and healthy, and was enjoying life with a successful career as a sales manager. Always a very social person, Chris enjoyed nights out with friends and going to the football. Alcohol played a part in his life but he never viewed it as a problem. But within weeks of lockdown, Chris, who lives on Teesside in north-east England, had gone from being someone who enjoyed a drink to someone who needed a drink. Charities say they have seen a marked increase in people in need of help and that Chris's story is far from unique. Read more on this story here. It's something you might have thought about while buying food at the grocery store or supermarket. Is there any chance that the packet of meat or vegetables you're holding has coronavirus on it? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours, or even days, on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiments used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, wrote in The Lancet medical journal: ""In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface, and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze (within one to two hours).""

However, experts have also pointed out that schools do not just bring children together - teachers, parents at school gates and other knock-on effects like more people on public transport or working parents returning to offices could also influence the spread of the virus. And with winter and fears of a resurgence of the virus approaching, there are worries that schools could play a role in spreading coronavirus. Our health correspondent Rachel Schraer has examined the risks. Thirty-three people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending wedding celebrations in the German state of Hesse, local authorities say. Dozens of people attended the wedding in the Gross-Gerau district earlier this month. But as the celebrations were held over two separate days - with 100 guests on 7 August, and 160 others on 14 August - they did not have to be registered, local media report. Most of the 160 guests have already been tested, although not all have received their results, the district said on Sunday. The news comes as a number of German politicians have called for private gatherings to be banned in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Just a day earlier, however,scientists held three pop concerts in a single dayas part of a study to investigate the risks posed by mass indoor events during the pandemic. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a meeting with the heads of the country's federal states to discuss a unified approach to the pandemic, Reuters news agency reports. The latest UK figures have just been released. A further six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days. Department of Health and Social Care figures,externalalso show 1,041 more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, down from 1,288 new infections reported on Saturday. Eighteen new deaths were reported on Saturday. The total number of cases in the UK now stands at 326,086, with 41,429 deaths. You can check the number of confirmed cases in your area here. EU trade commissioner and former Irish minister Phil Hogan has apologised ""fully and unreservedly"" for attending a golf dinner in Ireland with more than 80 people. Mr Hogan said he acknowledged his presence at the event in Galway, which was held a day after the government announced a tightening of lockdown restrictions, had ""touched a nerve"" with Irish people. Ireland's Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, who also attended the parliamentary golf society event, resigned on Friday. The Irish government has agreed to recall the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) early amid the controversy. It was due to return on 15 September. Police are also investigating whether the dinner breached Covid-19 regulations. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Inevitable and necessary differences' with Scotland school return Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks, after months of disrupted education as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. But schools in Scotland have already returned. So what was it like to be back in the classroom? Mike Corbett was happy to return to face-to-face teaching at his secondary school in East Dunbartonshire earlier this month and looked forward to the ""buzz of the classroom"" that's ""completely impossible online. The English teacher said pupils are ""very happy to be back"" too - but there's plenty of pandemic protocols for them to get used to such as regularly using hand sanitiser, not doing group work, and wiping down their desks before leaving the room. Mike also has things to adapt to, like the line marking out two metres to keep a safe distance from pupils. Read more about the experiences of teachers and parents here. Earlier this month, coronavirus deniers held an ""End of the Pandemic"" march in Berlin Several politicians in Germany are calling for a temporary ban on private parties after the country saw its highest rise in new infections since late April. On Saturday the Robert Koch Institute reported 2,034 new confirmed cases, taking the total up to 232,082. ""Unfortunately since the start of summer a certain recklessness has spread,"" Ralph Brinkhaus, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative parliamentary bloc, said. Saskia Esken, co-leader of the Social Democrats, also told local media: ""We must not risk that daycare centres and schools will close again and that children are forced to remain at home for weeks because we have accepted higher infection rates due to lax rules at family parties."" Ursula Nonnemacher, health minister of the state of Brandenburg, described private parties as ""a great danger"". Italy's health minister has said there will be no second lockdown in the country, despite the number of new daily cases rising above 1,000 for the first time since restrictions were eased in May. ""We will not have a new lockdown,"" Roberto Speranza said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper published on Sunday. The minister added that the healthcare system had become ""much stronger"" since the beginning of the pandemic. With more than 35,000 fatalities, Italy has recorded one of Europe's highest death tolls. It was the first European country to be hit badly as the virus spread from Asia. But while the country has experienced a resurgence in cases recently, it has so far avoided an increase on the scale of that seen in Spain and France. The number of coronavirus cases in Scotland has risen by 83 in the last 24 hours. A total of 19,811 people have now tested positive for Covid-19. No deaths linked to the virus were registered since Saturday so the total remains at 2,492. The biggest increase in cases by health board was 37 in NHS Tayside, according toofficial figures,external. The latest rise there comes after it was revealed the number ofcases linked to a food processing plant in Coupar Angushad now reached 90. A total of 79 employees at the 2 Sisters factory have tested positive, plus 11 of their contacts. US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said that if he were elected in November he would be willing to shut down the country again to control the spread of the virus, if scientists recommended it. Biden made the comments in an interview with US broadcaster ABC alongside his running mate Kamala Harris, which is airing tonight at 20:00 ET (01:00 BST). ""I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists,"" he said, adding that he would ""be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus"". President Donald Trump - his rival for the 3 November election - responded by tweeting that Biden ""has no clue!"" Although the US never had a full nationwide lockdown of the kind seen in other countries, many states enforced tough coronavirus restrictions.  Schools, parents and pupils are being ""sorely let down by the government"" over the planned reopening of schools in England, according to the National Education Union. The NEU's Kevin Courtney accused ministers of being ""negligent"", saying there was a ""lack of a Plan B"". He said a reportpublished by Public Health England,,externalwhich suggests children who went to school during June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home, had its ""limitations"" - citing the ""little"" data on secondary schools and the smaller class sizes in the summer. He said: ""Schools and colleges need to know what should happen if an outbreak of the virus occurs in individual schools or more widely with either national, regional or local spikes."" He called on the government to employ more teachers and seek extra teaching spaces to allow education to continue in a Covid-secure manner if infections rise. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News When Moscow announced on 11 August it had registered the first vaccine against Covid-19 and was naming it Sputnik V, the message was hard to miss. Back in 1957, the Soviet Union had launched the Sputnik satellite and won the race for space. Now, Russia was saying it was pushing the boundaries of medical science. But critics claimed it was pushing too hard, and the scepticism with which the announcement was met is a reminder of intense international competition. In this race, there have been accusations of short-cuts, espionage, unethical risk-taking and jealousy, amid talk of ""vaccine nationalism"". There are currently about half a dozen leading vaccine candidates in late-stage trials according to the World Health Organization (WHO), including three in China; one in the UK; one in the US, and a German-US partnership. ""I have never seen the political stakes for a medical product being so intense,"" says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University in the US. ""The reason the Covid-19 vaccine has taken on such political symbolism is that the superpowers have seen the vaccine as projecting their scientific prowess, actually validating their political system as superior."" Read more on this here. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance on children and masks. It admits little is known about how children transmit the virus but cites evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults. Here is the advice: Each of the UK's four nations have their own rules on face coverings. In England,children under the age of 11 do not have have to wear one. The WHO guidance does not mention schools. The official advice across the UK does not recommend that face coverings are worn in schools, with theDepartment for Education saying this is because sufficient controls,externalare in place to reduce the risk of transmission. But a number of UK schools have brought in their own face covering requirements and there are hints that there could be changesin ScotlandandNorthern Irelandin the future. Families visiting beaches in Karachi earlier this week after restrictions were lifted Pakistan has recorded its lowest number of daily deaths since March, the Associated Press news agency reports. On Sunday, the country's National Command and Control Center said there had been four deaths and 591 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to more than 292,000, with 6,235 fatalities. It's a big change from June, when health facilities in Pakistan's major cities appeared to be at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Now, however, life appears to be returning to normal. Read more from our correspondent Secunder Kermani. The general secretary of UK teachers' union NASUWT has made clear that it wants schools to be reopened safely and with ""safe working practices"" to protect students and staff. Dr Patrick Roach said: ""Governments across the UK must take steps to ensure that there are effective systems in place to monitor schoolsâ practices and to provide ongoing reassurance on safety after schools reopen."" Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks. Schools have already reopened in Scotland. The union was responding to a rare joint statement from the top health advisers from all four UK nations saying children faced bigger risks from missing out on education than they did from Covid-19. Dr Roach said: ""The chief medical officersâ statement has reinforced the critical importance of effective risk control measures."" But he added that it was ""regrettable"" that the statement did not address the ""well-known racial disparities linked to Covid-19"". There are two narratives in the US about coronavirus and deaths. President Trump has claimed the country has one of the lowest death rates from the virus in the world. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, his contender in November's presidential election, says: ""More than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst performance of any nation on earth."" Our Reality Check team has looked at three different ways to compare deaths between countries. Two of these measures show that while the US is not the worst affected, it's among those most badly hit.

However, experts have also pointed out that schools do not just bring children together - teachers, parents at school gates and other knock-on effects like more people on public transport or working parents returning to offices could also influence the spread of the virus. And with winter and fears of a resurgence of the virus approaching, there are worries that schools could play a role in spreading coronavirus. Our health correspondent Rachel Schraer has examined the risks. Thirty-three people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending wedding celebrations in the German state of Hesse, local authorities say. Dozens of people attended the wedding in the Gross-Gerau district earlier this month. But as the celebrations were held over two separate days - with 100 guests on 7 August, and 160 others on 14 August - they did not have to be registered, local media report. Most of the 160 guests have already been tested, although not all have received their results, the district said on Sunday. The news comes as a number of German politicians have called for private gatherings to be banned in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Just a day earlier, however,scientists held three pop concerts in a single dayas part of a study to investigate the risks posed by mass indoor events during the pandemic. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a meeting with the heads of the country's federal states to discuss a unified approach to the pandemic, Reuters news agency reports. The latest UK figures have just been released. A further six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days. Department of Health and Social Care figures,externalalso show 1,041 more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, down from 1,288 new infections reported on Saturday. Eighteen new deaths were reported on Saturday. The total number of cases in the UK now stands at 326,086, with 41,429 deaths. You can check the number of confirmed cases in your area here. EU trade commissioner and former Irish minister Phil Hogan has apologised ""fully and unreservedly"" for attending a golf dinner in Ireland with more than 80 people. Mr Hogan said he acknowledged his presence at the event in Galway, which was held a day after the government announced a tightening of lockdown restrictions, had ""touched a nerve"" with Irish people. Ireland's Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, who also attended the parliamentary golf society event, resigned on Friday. The Irish government has agreed to recall the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) early amid the controversy. It was due to return on 15 September. Police are also investigating whether the dinner breached Covid-19 regulations.

But schools in Scotland have already returned. So what was it like to be back in the classroom? Mike Corbett was happy to return to face-to-face teaching at his secondary school in East Dunbartonshire earlier this month and looked forward to the ""buzz of the classroom"" that's ""completely impossible online. The English teacher said pupils are ""very happy to be back"" too - but there's plenty of pandemic protocols for them to get used to such as regularly using hand sanitiser, not doing group work, and wiping down their desks before leaving the room. Mike also has things to adapt to, like the line marking out two metres to keep a safe distance from pupils. Read more about the experiences of teachers and parents here. Earlier this month, coronavirus deniers held an ""End of the Pandemic"" march in Berlin Several politicians in Germany are calling for a temporary ban on private parties after the country saw its highest rise in new infections since late April. On Saturday the Robert Koch Institute reported 2,034 new confirmed cases, taking the total up to 232,082. ""Unfortunately since the start of summer a certain recklessness has spread,"" Ralph Brinkhaus, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative parliamentary bloc, said. Saskia Esken, co-leader of the Social Democrats, also told local media: ""We must not risk that daycare centres and schools will close again and that children are forced to remain at home for weeks because we have accepted higher infection rates due to lax rules at family parties."" Ursula Nonnemacher, health minister of the state of Brandenburg, described private parties as ""a great danger"". Italy's health minister has said there will be no second lockdown in the country, despite the number of new daily cases rising above 1,000 for the first time since restrictions were eased in May. ""We will not have a new lockdown,"" Roberto Speranza said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper published on Sunday. The minister added that the healthcare system had become ""much stronger"" since the beginning of the pandemic. With more than 35,000 fatalities, Italy has recorded one of Europe's highest death tolls. It was the first European country to be hit badly as the virus spread from Asia. But while the country has experienced a resurgence in cases recently, it has so far avoided an increase on the scale of that seen in Spain and France. The number of coronavirus cases in Scotland has risen by 83 in the last 24 hours. A total of 19,811 people have now tested positive for Covid-19. No deaths linked to the virus were registered since Saturday so the total remains at 2,492. The biggest increase in cases by health board was 37 in NHS Tayside, according toofficial figures,external. The latest rise there comes after it was revealed the number ofcases linked to a food processing plant in Coupar Angushad now reached 90. A total of 79 employees at the 2 Sisters factory have tested positive, plus 11 of their contacts. US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said that if he were elected in November he would be willing to shut down the country again to control the spread of the virus, if scientists recommended it. Biden made the comments in an interview with US broadcaster ABC alongside his running mate Kamala Harris, which is airing tonight at 20:00 ET (01:00 BST). ""I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists,"" he said, adding that he would ""be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus"". President Donald Trump - his rival for the 3 November election - responded by tweeting that Biden ""has no clue!"" Although the US never had a full nationwide lockdown of the kind seen in other countries, many states enforced tough coronavirus restrictions.  Schools, parents and pupils are being ""sorely let down by the government"" over the planned reopening of schools in England, according to the National Education Union. The NEU's Kevin Courtney accused ministers of being ""negligent"", saying there was a ""lack of a Plan B"". He said a reportpublished by Public Health England,,externalwhich suggests children who went to school during June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home, had its ""limitations"" - citing the ""little"" data on secondary schools and the smaller class sizes in the summer. He said: ""Schools and colleges need to know what should happen if an outbreak of the virus occurs in individual schools or more widely with either national, regional or local spikes."" He called on the government to employ more teachers and seek extra teaching spaces to allow education to continue in a Covid-secure manner if infections rise. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News When Moscow announced on 11 August it had registered the first vaccine against Covid-19 and was naming it Sputnik V, the message was hard to miss. Back in 1957, the Soviet Union had launched the Sputnik satellite and won the race for space. Now, Russia was saying it was pushing the boundaries of medical science. But critics claimed it was pushing too hard, and the scepticism with which the announcement was met is a reminder of intense international competition. In this race, there have been accusations of short-cuts, espionage, unethical risk-taking and jealousy, amid talk of ""vaccine nationalism"". There are currently about half a dozen leading vaccine candidates in late-stage trials according to the World Health Organization (WHO), including three in China; one in the UK; one in the US, and a German-US partnership. ""I have never seen the political stakes for a medical product being so intense,"" says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University in the US. ""The reason the Covid-19 vaccine has taken on such political symbolism is that the superpowers have seen the vaccine as projecting their scientific prowess, actually validating their political system as superior."" Read more on this here. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance on children and masks. It admits little is known about how children transmit the virus but cites evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults. Here is the advice: Each of the UK's four nations have their own rules on face coverings. In England,children under the age of 11 do not have have to wear one. The WHO guidance does not mention schools. The official advice across the UK does not recommend that face coverings are worn in schools, with theDepartment for Education saying this is because sufficient controls,externalare in place to reduce the risk of transmission. But a number of UK schools have brought in their own face covering requirements and there are hints that there could be changesin ScotlandandNorthern Irelandin the future. Families visiting beaches in Karachi earlier this week after restrictions were lifted Pakistan has recorded its lowest number of daily deaths since March, the Associated Press news agency reports. On Sunday, the country's National Command and Control Center said there had been four deaths and 591 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to more than 292,000, with 6,235 fatalities. It's a big change from June, when health facilities in Pakistan's major cities appeared to be at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Now, however, life appears to be returning to normal. Read more from our correspondent Secunder Kermani. The general secretary of UK teachers' union NASUWT has made clear that it wants schools to be reopened safely and with ""safe working practices"" to protect students and staff. Dr Patrick Roach said: ""Governments across the UK must take steps to ensure that there are effective systems in place to monitor schoolsâ practices and to provide ongoing reassurance on safety after schools reopen."" Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks. Schools have already reopened in Scotland. The union was responding to a rare joint statement from the top health advisers from all four UK nations saying children faced bigger risks from missing out on education than they did from Covid-19. Dr Roach said: ""The chief medical officersâ statement has reinforced the critical importance of effective risk control measures."" But he added that it was ""regrettable"" that the statement did not address the ""well-known racial disparities linked to Covid-19"". There are two narratives in the US about coronavirus and deaths. President Trump has claimed the country has one of the lowest death rates from the virus in the world. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, his contender in November's presidential election, says: ""More than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst performance of any nation on earth."" Our Reality Check team has looked at three different ways to compare deaths between countries. Two of these measures show that while the US is not the worst affected, it's among those most badly hit.

'I became alcoholic during lockdown',"Chris has now been sober for more than two months Before lockdown, Chris McLone was looking forward to a good year. In his late 40s, he felt fit and healthy, enjoying life with a successful career as a sales manager. Always a very social person, Chris enjoyed nights out with friends and going to the football. Alcohol played a part in his life but he never viewed it as a problem. But within weeks of lockdown, Chris, who lives on Teesside, had gone from being someone who enjoyed a drink to someone who needed a drink. ""I suppose I've always been a social drinker - I was never within the limits, the recommended limits, and so yeah, I used to enjoy a drink, sometimes a little bit more than I should, as a lot of people do. ""I was in a good place before lockdown, I was keeping fit, I was swimming five days a week, I was doing well at work and I was in a good mindset to be honest."" His adult daughter, a key worker, moved out during lockdown to protect her dad, but that left Chris living on his own - isolated, anxious, uncertain about the future and growing increasingly depressed. The weeks dragged on and Chris's drinking escalated. Chris says he began experiencing withdrawal symptoms at the very end. ""Although I wanted to cut down and stop at that point, I wasn't in control of that. And that was the frightening part. ""I've never been like that in my life and I had to admit that to myself. So I was drinking very early in the morning to stop withdrawal symptoms. ""I promised myself I wouldn't do it again tomorrow. Of course, the exact same thing happened the next day. And that's when I realised I had to take big steps to get some proper treatment."" With the help and encouragement of his family, Chris turned to the Steps Together drug and alcohol rehabilitation service in Leicestershire. He's been sober now for more than 70 days, determined to lay his demons to rest. ""Where I was before, it was just a horrible dark place I was in and sobriety is just fantastic. I can't explain how good I feel."" One of those who helped Chris get his life back together was GP Dr Rob Hampton, who specialises in addiction services. He says they've seen a marked increase in people in need of help and that Chris's story is far from unique. ""When listening to the stories, these were people who, a few weeks ago, were actually functioning very well, holding down jobs, living normal, day-to-day lives. ""Within three weeks they'd become dependent alcoholic drinkers and needing detoxification rehab. ""If you look at what lockdown meant to people's lives - so first of all, having to get up every day to go to work and take the kids to school - all of that just stopped. ""Somebody described it perfectly to me - 'Every day is Friday night now' - and there's no reason to get up in the morning. ""You add that to the isolation some people were feeling, the job insecurity, all sorts of stresses and strains in relation to the uncertainty for the future. ""But even those who were furloughed and felt more confident about their work, their kids were at home, they were having to get involved in home schooling. ""There was just that need for a stress-buster every day."" All of this is familiar to the British Liver Trust, one of the UK's main charities dealing with the medical consequences of alcohol abuse. Its helpline has seen an increase in calls of 500% since lockdown began, an indication of how many people have found their drinking has escalated out of control. But this comes on the back of an already huge increase - up by 400% - in deaths due to alcohol-related liver disease since 1970. The statistics make for grim reading: every day, more than 40 people die from liver disease in the UK. It is the third biggest cause of premature death in the UK and the biggest cause of death in those aged between 35 and 49. Vanessa Hebditch, policy director at the charity, says lockdown has only accentuated the need for a proper alcohol strategy from government. ""We need to address the public health measures, the population-wide issues. ""So that's about increasing taxation, introducing, for example, a minimum unit price, but it's also addressing advertising, marketing and things like labelling so consumers have a real choice, and understand what alcohol includes. ""It's absolutely crazy that I can buy a bottle of milk and get all sorts of nutritional and calorie information, and yet I can buy a bottle of beer or wine and get nothing."" The governments in both Scotland and Wales have introduced a minimum unit price (MUP) of 50p for alcohol sales. In March of this year, the government in England said there were ""no plans for the introduction of MUP in England"" although it would continue to monitor the progress in Scotland and consider the evidence of its impact. Of course, not everyone found they were drinking more during lockdown. In June, the National Survey for Wales found that 31% of those who took part reported drinking less than before lockdown. Across the UK, health services in all four nations reported that while the number of people trying to access alcohol support services fell during the initial phase of the pandemic, referrals are now getting back to normal levels. And for those who have found themselves in trouble, support is out there. This video can not be played Musician Nick Davis was in alcohol recovery when lockdown started and has had to find new ways to stay sober Nick Davis, who's in his late 50s and from West Yorkshire, is now more than 500 days sober but says he is always only an hour away from a return to alcoholism. Like Chris, he found lockdown and the chaos of the pandemic hard to cope with. But distractions - caring for his dog, playing his guitar - kept him going. And he offers these words to those who might be struggling: ""I think the best advice I could give is, just be honest. Be honest with yourself, be honest with everybody else, tell everybody else what you're going through. ""It's not as much of a stigma now as it was in the past, it's an illness.""

John Lewis to axe 'Never knowingly undersold' vow,"Sharon White became chair of John Lewis in February John Lewis is planning to replace its famous promise to match rivals' prices as its new boss plans radical changes to the business. ""Never knowingly undersold"" has become harder to defend as competition from online retailers has become ever tougher. Group chair Sharon Whitetold the Sunday Times,externalshe expected the price pledge to go. The slogan has been in place since 1925. ""The proposition is important because it signifies being fair to society. We're reviewing it to improve it,"" Ms White told the Sunday Times. The department store chain has already announced the closure of eight stores including its flagship Birmingham site which only opened five years ago as it struggles to adapt to the challenges arising from the pandemic. This year between 60% and 70% of John Lewis's sales are expected to be online, compared to 40% last year. Even before Covid-19 hit, the chain, which is run as a partnership, had warned it might not pay the usual staff dividend as competition ate into profits. John Lewis and Boots to cut 5,300 jobs Ms White told the Sunday Times the chain needed ""more inspiration, surprise, fun"" and that it would compete by ""curating"" items in store better. John Lewis would focus less on women's fashion and get rid of travel and spa services. Instead it would offer more financial, home and garden products, she said. Ms White said she wanted to reaffirm John Lewis's reputation as a socially responsible retailer and ""shout more"" about its values. For nearly a century John Lewis has promised to refund the difference in price, to any shopper who could find an item cheaper elsewhere within 28 days. However, the commitment has never applied to sales from internet-only retailers, which have lower costs and often undercut the High Street on price. John Lewis indicated earlier this year it was reviewing the promise. It said ""fair value"" would still be central to its ethos but ""in a more modernised form""; it hopes to have a new slogan in place by October. ""Never knowingly undersold is from another era,"" said Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of retail marketing agency Savvy. ""She's got to correct the course on that. They'll be out of business if they do that in a world where Amazon change their prices every minute."" The business is also facing challenges in its Waitrose grocery arm. Next month its long-standing link with delivery service Ocado comes to an end at a time when customers are queuing to sign up for online shopping. The scale of the overall challenge should not be underestimated, said Ms Shuttleworth. ""It's the biggest crisis in the history of the partnership... There's got to be some significant changes to make sure it survives for the future.""

Man dies and woman hurt in house roof collapse,"Police, fire and ambulance services were called to the scene in the early hours of the morning A man died and a woman was seriously injured when the roof of a house collapsed. The couple were in a bedroom at their home in Knight's Fold, Bradford, when debris fell on them in the early hours of the morning. The man, 47, died while the woman, 28, was taken to hospital. Her injuries are not thought to be life threatening. Neighbours reported hearing a ""loud bang"" and a woman screaming shortly after 04:30 BST. A family from a neighbouring property, including three children, were taken out of their house unhurt. Paul Wright, 30, of nearby Southfield Lane, said: ""At about half past four this morning I heard a big, loud bang, like an explosion. ""I came out with my partner to see what had gone on and noticed one of the neighbour's roofs had collapsed."" Speaking of the injured woman, Mr Wright said: ""It took them the best part of an hour, over an hour, to get her out the house. ""They had to take the full window out to carry her out."" West Yorkshire Police said it had been a ""tragic incident"" Iqbal Zahir, who also lives on Southfield Lane, which joins on to Knight's Fold, also reported hearing a loud bang at about 04:30. ""It's really sad. It was the chimney, they need repairing, these are old houses,"" he said. Awais Asghar, who works in a nearby corner shop, said: ""A chimney collapsed straight on to their roof and straight through and unfortunately the man passed away. He was a regular customer of mine. They were a nice couple."" The emergency services received at a call at about 05:00 BST on Sunday Det Insp Claudine Binns said work was under way to make the building safe and police had launched an investigation with Bradford council to determine the cause of the collapse. She said the family in the adjoining house would be rehomed with the authorities ""working to support everyone involved in any way we can"". Emergency services were called just after 05:00 BST to reports of a ""structural collapse"". Road closures are now in place in the area while police officers, firefighters and structural engineers carry out work. Officers from West Yorkshire Police are preparing a file for the coroner.

Tel Aviv covers over Peeping Toms beach mural,"Many had found the mural offensive The Israeli authorities have covered over a mural known as Peeping Toms at a beach in Tel Aviv in response to an outcry over the suspected gang rape of a teenage girl at another beach resort. The mural shows two young men in bathing suits peering inside what is the women's changing room. Almost 20 years old, it commemorates a 1970s film of the same name that was partly filmed at the beach. Women's rights groups had long demanded the mural's removal. Tel Aviv Mayor Ron Huldai tweeted (in Hebrew) that the time had come to cover it over,externalafter the alleged assault in Eilat. The mayor agreed it was time to ""say goodbye to it"" ""Freedom of expression and the arts are important values in our city but because the painting was seen as acceptance of a forbidden and criminal act, we have decided to say goodbye to it,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Police launchedan investigation this month into the alleged gang rape of a 16-year-old girlat a hotel in Eilat. At least three people have been detained so far. One of the suspects said more than 30 men had had sex with the girl but denied rape, according to local media reports. The men are accused of raping the teenager while she was intoxicated. Last year, a 19-year-old British woman claimed she had been gang-raped by 12 Israeli men at a hotel in Cyprus. She was laterfound guilty of lying about being rapedand given a four-month suspended sentence. The case was denounced by women's rights groups.

Human chain beach rescue 'saved man's life',"This video can not be played Beachgoers formed a human chain stretching into the surf to try to reach the stricken swimmer Beachgoers have described the moment a human chain was formed and saved a man's life when he got into difficulty in the sea. The swimmer got into trouble in choppy seas off Durdle Door beach in Dorset on Thursday afternoon. More than 20 people linked arms and entered the sea before bringing the stricken swimmer back to shore. Coastguard Matt Leat said: ""Ultimately the public have helped save that chap's life."" Eyewitness Emily Foote said: ""It became apparent that actually he was in trouble - he started waving his arms. ""He wasn't panicking, but he just wasn't able to get back to shore. ""And it was at that point that a lot of people started gathering and sort of forming this chain."" Around 20 people linked arms to bring the swimmer back to shore Ms Foote added: ""Everybody on the beach was clapping at the end, so it just goes to show that it was a whole team effort."" The swimmer""managed to surf a wave and somebody managed to grab him,""witness Jennie Bell said. ""There was a chain of people stretching to the sea as much as they dared."" Lulworth coastguard said the swimmer was unhurt. Warning of the dangers of going in the sea in windy conditions, Mr Leat said: ""The sea is unforgiving, so you need to respect it. ""You need to look out for your friends and family, and don't take inflatables to the beach. ""They may seem like a good idea but very quickly you can be blown off shore and then we're having to deploy lifeboats, helicopters, coastguard rescue teams to rescue people."" The Jurassic Coast beach has been popular since lockdown restrictions eased. A man from London in his20s drowned in Junewhile swimming off the beach, whilethree people suffered serious injuriesafter leaping from the landmark limestone arch the previous month.

Belarus opposition holds mass rally despite ban,"This video can not be played ""We want a new president!"" Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Minsk Opposition supporters in Belarus have held a mass rally in the capital Minsk, two weeks after a disputed election gave President Alexander Lukashenko another term in office. Correspondents in the city said tens of thousands filled the central square despite a heavy police presence. The protesters say Mr Lukashenko stole the election and want him to resign. The president has vowed to crush unrest and blamed the dissent on unnamed ""foreign-backed revolutionaries"". Recent protests were met with a crackdown in which at least four people were killed. Demonstrators said they had been tortured in prisons. According to official results, Mr Lukashenko - who has ruled Belarus for 26 years - won more than 80% of the vote in the 9 August election and opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10%. There were no independent observers and the opposition alleges massive vote rigging. Ms Tikhanovskaya, who was forced to flee to neighbouring Lithuania the day after the election,vowed to ""stand till the end"" in the protests. This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya said she doesn't think she's the next leader of Belarus What's happening in Belarus? 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus 'There's no way back. The people will not forgive this' Tens of thousands of people - from the elderly to those with small children - poured into Independence Square on Sunday. Many were carrying the opposition's red and white flags, and chanted ""freedom"" and anti-government slogans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Pro-opposition media say 100,000 people took part. State television put the crowd at 20,000. After gathering in the square, some demonstrators moved towards the ""Hero City"" war memorial and the presidential palace. They were blocked by a security cordon before dispersing. State television released a video showing Mr Lukashenko arriving at the presidential palace by helicopter, wearing a flak jacket and carrying an automatic weapon. This video can not be played Lukashenko leaves helicopter wearing a flak jacket and carrying an assault rifle Similar demonstrations were held in other Belarusian cities. Meanwhile in Lithuania, thousands of people - including President Gitanas NausÄda - formed a human chain from the capital Vilnius to the Belarusian border in solidarity with those protesting in Minsk. More human chains were planned in the Estonian capital Tallinn and in Prague in the Czech Republic. This weekend's rally in Minsk follows the country's biggest protest in modern history last Sunday, when hundreds of thousands filled the streets. Strike action in key factories across Belarus is also keeping up the pressure on the president. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Minsk This was another massive demonstration carried out under the noses of Alexander Lukashenko's security forces. Belarus's beleaguered president had instructed his interior ministry to end the ""unrest"" and promised to ""solve the problem"". But in the end no serious effort was made to stop protesters gathering. In the back streets leading into Independence Square there were long lines of riot police and army trucks. They looked on as the swelling crowd ignored loudspeaker warnings that this was an illegal gathering and to disperse. These demonstrations are organic and loosely organised, so in the square there is no stage or PA system. That means no place for the few opposition leaders that remain free in Belarus to make speeches. Instead the protesters marched around chanting ""Long live Belarus"" and ""Go Away Lukashenko"" before heading off towards a war memorial. Some told me that they had been scared to come but now felt safe surrounded by so many like-minded Belarusians. The 65-year-old president insists he won the election fairly and has ruled holding another poll. On Saturday he accused Nato of ""trying to topple the authorities"" and install a new president in Minsk. He said he was moving troops to the country's western borders to counter a Nato build-up in Poland and Lithuania, and vowed to ""defend the territorial integrity of our country"". President Alexander Lukashenko told his officials to prepare forces on the border with Poland Nato responded by saying it posed ""no threat to Belarus or any other country"", and had ""no military build-up in the region"". ""The regime is trying to divert attention from Belarus's internal problems at any cost with totally baseless statements about imaginary external threats,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told AFP news agency on Saturday. Mr Lukashenko has also accused an opposition council - set up by Ms Tikhanovskaya to organise peaceful transition - of trying to seize power. Two of its members were questioned by police on Friday. Where is Belarus?It has Russia - the former dominant power - to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko, an ally of Russia, has been referred to as ""Europe's last dictator"". He has been in power for 26 years, keeping much of the economy in state hands, and using censorship and police crackdowns against opponents. What's going on there?Now there is a huge opposition movement, demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. Mr Lukashenko's supporters say his toughness has kept the country stable.

"Illegal rave organisers face Â£10,000 fines","Thousands of people attended an illegal rave in Greater Manchester in June Police in England will be able to fine organisers of illegal gatherings of more than 30 people such as raves up to Â£10,000 from Friday, ministers say. Those who attend gatherings and those who do not wear face coverings where it is mandatory can be given a Â£100 fine, doubling on each offence up to Â£3,200. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can set their own enforcement rules. The government first unveiled plans for tougher penalties for those breaking coronavirus rules earlier this month. Details of the stricter rules come after extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19were introduced in north-west England. Why did raves become illegal? 'Why I want to go to lockdown raves' Overnight, police in Birmingham disruptedmore than 70 unlicensed social gatherings including house and street parties, one of which featured marquees and a DJ. In Huddersfield, officersbroke up an illegal rave involving about 300 people,external. Two police vehicles were damaged and four people arrested after officers broke up a party breaking lockdown rules in Greater Manchester, where restrictions between households continue. About 50 people were at the gathering at a house, which had a gazebo set up with loud speakers, music equipment and party lights, Greater Manchester Police said. And in Blackburn, Lancashire, where extra restrictions are also in force,more than 150 people gathered for a rave at a reservoir. This video can not be played Rave culture in the UK has given us superstar artists and DJs like The Prodigy and Carl Cox Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""These gatherings are dangerous and those who organise them show a blatant disregard for the safety of others."" She added: ""We will continue to crack down on the small minority who think they are above the law."" The tougher rules have been welcomed by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Commander Ade Adelekan, NPCC lead for unlicensed music events, said those who organised such gatherings ""irresponsibly put people's health and safety at risk"". He added: ""To the organisers of this sort of activity, I strongly advise that you seriously consider the risks you're creating for everyone in attendance and the wider community. There is a risk of prosecution for those who organise these events and equipment will be seized."" Insp Andy Berry, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Police Federation said ""definitive powers"" to help ""control these large gatherings"" were helpful, as his colleagues have been seeing an ""incredible surge in demand"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: ""We are a police force, we should be there primarily to deal with crime... what we don't want to do is break up children's birthday parties. ""We are seeing an unprecedented amount of calls coming in where neighbours are reporting these breaches and these demands are really bringing my colleagues and members to fatigue and breaking point,"" Mr Berry said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The tougher penalties will also see those who flout rules around face coverings issued a larger fine - starting at Â£100 and doubling up to Â£3,200 for each repeat offence. In England, face coverings are mandatory in many indoor settings, including public transport, shops and museums, with some exemptions for children or on medical grounds. It comes after a further 18 deaths were recorded in the UK on Saturday, bringing the total number of people to have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus to 41,423. As of 21 August, the UK recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), warned on Saturday that coronaviruswould be present ""forever in some form or another"". His comments come after the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he hoped the pandemic would be over within two years.

Nato rejects Belarusian talk of border threat,"President Alexander Lukashenko told his officials to prepare forces on the border with Poland Allegations by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that ""foreign powers"" are organising a build-up of troops on the country's border are baseless, says Nato. Dressed in military fatigues, the president said he had placed his armed forces on ""high alert"". He is facing growing calls within Belarus for his resignation following a disputed election two weeks ago. Thousands of protesters again marched on the capital Minsk on Sunday. Long lines of people of all ages - from the elderly to those with small children - flowed into Independence Square from all directions, watched by hundreds of riot police, reporters at the scene said. Many of the marchers were carrying red and white flags or white flowers, and chanting anti-government slogans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said troops in Poland and Lithuania were readying themselves, and that he was moving his armed forces to the country's western border.

""They are rocking the situation inside our country, trying to topple the authorities,"" Mr Lukashenko said, adding that he had ordered his security chiefs to ""take the toughest measures to defend the territorial integrity of our country"". Nato said it posed ""no threat to Belarus or any other country"" and had ""no military build-up in the region"". ""Our posture is strictly defensive,"" it said. ""The regime is trying to divert attention from Belarus's internal problems at any cost with totally baseless statements about imaginary external threats,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told AFP news agency. A Polish presidency official called the suggestion that Poland planned any border destabilisation ""regime propaganda"" by the Belarusians, which was ""sad and surprising"". ""Poland... has no such intention,"" the official added. Protests against a brutal police crackdown continued in Minsk on Saturday Nato urged Belarus to respect the fundamental human rights of its citizens. Mr Lukashenko was re-elected president on 9 August but the vote was widely considered to be fraudulent. Protests disputing the result were met with a brutal crackdown that killed at least four people and demonstrators said they had been tortured in prisons and detention centres.

With protests and strike action continuing, including the walking out of state TV staff, Mr Lukashenko said he had flown in Russian broadcast journalists as cover to ""stabilise"" the situation, the Belarus state news agency Belta reports. ""I've asked Russians to lend us two to three groups of reporters just in case. Six to nine people from the most advanced television company,"" he said.

"Illegal rave organisers face Â£10,000 finesIt comes as police forces across England break up dozens of gatherings, including street parties.UK","Thousands of people attended an illegal rave in Greater Manchester in June Police in England will be able to fine organisers of illegal gatherings of more than 30 people such as raves up to Â£10,000 from Friday, ministers say. Those who attend gatherings and those who do not wear face coverings where it is mandatory can be given a Â£100 fine, doubling on each offence up to Â£3,200. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can set their own enforcement rules. The government first unveiled plans for tougher penalties for those breaking coronavirus rules earlier this month. Details of the stricter rules come after extra restrictions to stem the spread of Covid-19were introduced in north-west England. Why did raves become illegal? 'Why I want to go to lockdown raves' Overnight, police in Birmingham disruptedmore than 70 unlicensed social gatherings including house and street parties, one of which featured marquees and a DJ. In Huddersfield, officersbroke up an illegal rave involving about 300 people,external. Two police vehicles were damaged and four people arrested after officers broke up a party breaking lockdown rules in Greater Manchester, where restrictions between households continue. About 50 people were at the gathering at a house, which had a gazebo set up with loud speakers, music equipment and party lights, Greater Manchester Police said. And in Blackburn, Lancashire, where extra restrictions are also in force,more than 150 people gathered for a rave at a reservoir. This video can not be played Rave culture in the UK has given us superstar artists and DJs like The Prodigy and Carl Cox Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""These gatherings are dangerous and those who organise them show a blatant disregard for the safety of others."" She added: ""We will continue to crack down on the small minority who think they are above the law."" The tougher rules have been welcomed by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC). Commander Ade Adelekan, NPCC lead for unlicensed music events, said those who organised such gatherings ""irresponsibly put people's health and safety at risk"". He added: ""To the organisers of this sort of activity, I strongly advise that you seriously consider the risks you're creating for everyone in attendance and the wider community. There is a risk of prosecution for those who organise these events and equipment will be seized."" Insp Andy Berry, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall Police Federation said ""definitive powers"" to help ""control these large gatherings"" were helpful, as his colleagues have been seeing an ""incredible surge in demand"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: ""We are a police force, we should be there primarily to deal with crime... what we don't want to do is break up children's birthday parties. ""We are seeing an unprecedented amount of calls coming in where neighbours are reporting these breaches and these demands are really bringing my colleagues and members to fatigue and breaking point,"" Mr Berry said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? FACE MASKS:When should you wear one? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The tougher penalties will also see those who flout rules around face coverings issued a larger fine - starting at Â£100 and doubling up to Â£3,200 for each repeat offence. In England, face coverings are mandatory in many indoor settings, including public transport, shops and museums, with some exemptions for children or on medical grounds. It comes after a further 18 deaths were recorded in the UK on Saturday, bringing the total number of people to have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus to 41,423. As of 21 August, the UK recorded 21.2 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the last fortnight, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), warned on Saturday that coronaviruswould be present ""forever in some form or another"". His comments come after the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he hoped the pandemic would be over within two years.

Human chain beach rescue 'saved man's life'More than 20 people linked arms to help save a swimmer in difficulty in water off the Dorset coast.Dorset,"This video can not be played Beachgoers formed a human chain stretching into the surf to try to reach the stricken swimmer Beachgoers have described the moment a human chain was formed and saved a man's life when he got into difficulty in the sea. The swimmer got into trouble in choppy seas off Durdle Door beach in Dorset on Thursday afternoon. More than 20 people linked arms and entered the sea before bringing the stricken swimmer back to shore. Coastguard Matt Leat said: ""Ultimately the public have helped save that chap's life."" Eyewitness Emily Foote said: ""It became apparent that actually he was in trouble - he started waving his arms. ""He wasn't panicking, but he just wasn't able to get back to shore. ""And it was at that point that a lot of people started gathering and sort of forming this chain."" Around 20 people linked arms to bring the swimmer back to shore Ms Foote added: ""Everybody on the beach was clapping at the end, so it just goes to show that it was a whole team effort."" The swimmer""managed to surf a wave and somebody managed to grab him,""witness Jennie Bell said. ""There was a chain of people stretching to the sea as much as they dared."" Lulworth coastguard said the swimmer was unhurt. Warning of the dangers of going in the sea in windy conditions, Mr Leat said: ""The sea is unforgiving, so you need to respect it. ""You need to look out for your friends and family, and don't take inflatables to the beach. ""They may seem like a good idea but very quickly you can be blown off shore and then we're having to deploy lifeboats, helicopters, coastguard rescue teams to rescue people."" The Jurassic Coast beach has been popular since lockdown restrictions eased.

"Trump's sister says he's an 'unprincipled phoney'Recordings reveal Maryanne Trump Barry, a former federal judge, saying her brother ""has no principles"".US & Canada","Maryanne Trump Barry said her brother Donald just ""wants to appeal to his base"" US President Donald Trump's eldest sister, a former federal judge, has said her brother is a liar who ""has no principles"", secret recordings reveal. The critical remarks by Maryanne Trump Barry were recorded by her niece, Mary Trump, who last month published a book excoriating the president. ""His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God,"" Ms Barry is heard saying. ""It's the phoniness and this cruelty."" Mary Trump said she had taped her aunt to protect herself from litigation. Mr Trump responded to the latest revelations in a statement issued by the White House, saying: ""Every day it's something else, who cares."" The recordings were first reported by The Washington Post, after which the Associated Press obtained them. In the secret recordings, Ms Barry criticises the Trump administration's immigration policy, which has led to children being held at migrant detention centres at the border. ""All he wants to do is appeal to his base,"" she said. One of the claims made in Mary Trump's memoir - Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man - is that her uncle paid a friend to take a SAT test for him - a standardised exam which determines university placement. Ms Barry refers to this in the recording, even suggesting that she remembers the name of the friend involved. ""He got into University of Pennsylvania because he had somebody take the exams,"" she said. Five shocking passages in Mary Trump's tell-all book Trump's parents and siblings: What do we know of them? Ms Barry has been supportive of her brother Donald and has previously said the two were close. She once told the story of how he had visited her every day she was in hospital following an operation. ""Once would have been enough - the duty call. That's how love shows, when you go that extra yard."" She also said she ""knew better even as a child than to even attempt to compete with Donald"". A Superior Court judge in California has ordered the president to pay $44,100 (Â£34,000) to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The sum was awarded to cover her legal fees relating to a non-disclosure agreement over an alleged affair between the two. Ms Daniels alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. The president denies the affair. Ms Daniels said she had signed an agreement to keep quiet about her claims in exchange for $130,000 in October 2016, days before the presidential election. In a court ruling published online, a judge ruled that despite the case being dismissed,Ms Daniels was ""the prevailing party"" in the dispute,externaland therefore her costs should be covered.

Trump declares California wildfires major disasterOne fire tearing through the state is the third largest California has ever seen.US & Canada,"Fire-fighters are working 72-hour shifts but say it is not enough to contain the blazes US President Donald Trump has declared that wildfires burning through homes and devastating precious forestry in parts of California are a major disaster and has released federal aid. Over 14,000 firefighters are battling 585 fires that have now burnt nearly one million acres (400,000 hectares). Forecast high winds are threatening to drive flames into more populated areas as foul air blankets the state. At least six people have died and thousands have evacuated. Most of the destruction has been caused by three large fire complexes in mountainous and wooded rural areas. On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the SCU Lightning Complex fire south and east of San Francisco was the third-largest in the state's history. Video tweeted by the governor showed burnt tree stumps against the reddened fumes-filled sky and plumes of white smoke rising from ash-laden ground. Anevacuation order on Saturday,externalextended to thousands of people in the Bay area near San Jose and warned others to be prepared to abandon their homes at short notice. Allow Twitter content?

Exhausted firefighters continue to battle the flames, with some working 72-hour shifts in the dangerous, hot conditions,reports AP news agency,external. ""They're scrambling for bodies"" to help fight the fires, an official in the city of Fresno told Reuters news agency. In California's oldest state park, flames scorched redwood trees that began their lives more than 2,000 years ago. The historic visitor centre of Big Basin State Park was burnt to the ground and officials say some trees, which tower as high as 330ft (100 metres), have fallen as the area was ""extensively damaged"". Park officials fear that redwoods, the world's tallest trees, have fallen in the fires The state faces a more acute shortage of personnel than usual - the coronavirus pandemic has depleted a fire-fighting corps made up of prisoners, which has helped the state battle blazes since World War Two, due to early releases from jail. At least 43 people including firefighters have been injured, and hundreds of buildings have burned down and thousands more are threatened. After doubling in size on Friday, the fires continued to grow moderately on Saturday and firefighters made some progress in containing the flames. More than 12,000 dry lightning strikes started the blazes last week during a historic heat wave in which thermometers in Death Valley National Park reachedwhat could be the highest ever temperature reliably recorded. Hundreds of buildings have burnt including this historic 157-year old farmhouse The largest wildfire, called the LNU Lightning complex, is in the prominent wine-growing areas of Napa and Sonoma north of San Francisco and is just 15% contained, CalFire said on Saturday. Further south in Santa Cruz county, 115 homes have been destroyed and some residents evacuated. ""I left with my clothes... two guitars and a dog,"" one evacuee in Santa Cruz told CNN affiliate KGO. Firefighters dug a fireline around the University of California Santa Cruz campus as flames came within a mile of the buildings and surrounding area. Gov Newsom has requested help from as far afield as Australia and Canada. Firefighters, engines and surveillance planes raced in from US states including Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. Although California is used to wildfire, the governor called the fires unlike anything the state had seen before.""If you don't believe in climate change, come to California,"",externalhe tweeted on Saturday. Fires have burned through parts of California's wine-producing regions With more than 650,000 coronavirus cases, California also has the highest number of infections in the US, and some evacuees have said they are afraid to go to emergency shelters. US agencies have updated disaster preparedness and evacuation guidance in light of Covid-19. People who may be required to flee have been to told to carry at least two face masks per person, as well as hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant wipes. Here are some key guidelines for protecting yourself against Covid-19 if you must evacuate to a shelter: Wash your hands often Keep six feet of distance from anyone not among your household Wear a face covering when possible, and if possible, wash it regularly Avoid sharing food and drinks Frequently disinfect your area in the shelter (including toys and electronics) Emergency shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, and have even given individual tents to families to self-isolate. Some counties are seeking to set up separate shelters for sick evacuees or anyone who is found to have a high temperature. Officials say people should consider sheltering with family and friends. Evacuation centres, including at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, must also enforce social distancing rules Officials also advise people to remain indoors due to the poor air quality outside. California is also facing electricity shortages, which have caused rolling blackouts for thousands of customers. Officials have appealed for residents to use less power or risk further cuts.

France is in a ""risky situation"" as coronavirus cases rise again, the country's health minister has said. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Olivier VÃ©ran said the higher numbers were not only due to increased testing. The outbreak in France ""never stopped"", he said, adding: ""It was only controlled during the lockdown and the progressive easing of lockdown measures."" ""It's not a French exception, it's the European dynamic,"" he told the newspaper. He went on to explain that the virus is spreading four times more among those under the age of 40 as the over 65s, but warned that this situation could change if younger people spread the virus to elderly and more vulnerable people. On Saturday, 3,602 new daily cases were reported in France following two days with more than 4,000 new infections. The country has reported more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Japan's official surrender came two weeks after Emperor Hirohito announced an end to the fighting on 15 August 1945 Throughout the pandemic, health experts have warned of the serious health risk that Covid-19 poses to the elderly in particular. But that won't stop dozens of US veterans from gathering in Hawaii next month to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two,according to the Associated Press.,external The former soldiers, who are now in their 90s or older, will gather aboard the USS Missouri, where Japan's official surrender was signed on 2 September 1945 in Tokyo Bay and which is now docked in Pearl Harbour. They will board specially chartered flights and be isolated in hotels when not attending the events, which will mostly be held outdoors and not be open to the public. The commemoration was meant to involve thousands of people and veterans have been looking forward to it for years. âI want to go back because that day, as much as I remember it - what happened, why we were there, the fact that it was the end of the realities of war and killing and all - it was the first day that I had to start answering, âWhat am I going to do with the rest of my life?ââ 95-year-old Jerry Pedersen, who witnessed the surrender in 1945, told the AP. Before lockdown, Chris McLone was looking forward to a good year. In his late 40s, he felt fit and healthy, and was enjoying life with a successful career as a sales manager. Always a very social person, Chris enjoyed nights out with friends and going to the football. Alcohol played a part in his life but he never viewed it as a problem. But within weeks of lockdown, Chris, who lives on Teesside in north-east England, had gone from being someone who enjoyed a drink to someone who needed a drink. Charities say they have seen a marked increase in people in need of help and that Chris's story is far from unique. Read more on this story here. It's something you might have thought about while buying food at the grocery store or supermarket. Is there any chance that the packet of meat or vegetables you're holding has coronavirus on it? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours, or even days, on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiments used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, wrote in The Lancet medical journal: ""In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface, and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze (within one to two hours).""

However, experts have also pointed out that schools do not just bring children together - teachers, parents at school gates and other knock-on effects like more people on public transport or working parents returning to offices could also influence the spread of the virus. And with winter and fears of a resurgence of the virus approaching, there are worries that schools could play a role in spreading coronavirus. Our health correspondent Rachel Schraer has examined the risks. Thirty-three people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending wedding celebrations in the German state of Hesse, local authorities say. Dozens of people attended the wedding in the Gross-Gerau district earlier this month. But as the celebrations were held over two separate days - with 100 guests on 7 August, and 160 others on 14 August - they did not have to be registered, local media report. Most of the 160 guests have already been tested, although not all have received their results, the district said on Sunday. The news comes as a number of German politicians have called for private gatherings to be banned in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Just a day earlier, however,scientists held three pop concerts in a single dayas part of a study to investigate the risks posed by mass indoor events during the pandemic. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a meeting with the heads of the country's federal states to discuss a unified approach to the pandemic, Reuters news agency reports.

Ireland's Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, who also attended the parliamentary golf society event, resigned on Friday.

Mike Corbett was happy to return to face-to-face teaching at his secondary school in East Dunbartonshire earlier this month and looked forward to the ""buzz of the classroom"" that's ""completely impossible online. The English teacher said pupils are ""very happy to be back"" too - but there's plenty of pandemic protocols for them to get used to such as regularly using hand sanitiser, not doing group work, and wiping down their desks before leaving the room.

Earlier this month, coronavirus deniers held an ""End of the Pandemic"" march in Berlin Several politicians in Germany are calling for a temporary ban on private parties after the country saw its highest rise in new infections since late April. On Saturday the Robert Koch Institute reported 2,034 new confirmed cases, taking the total up to 232,082. ""Unfortunately since the start of summer a certain recklessness has spread,"" Ralph Brinkhaus, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative parliamentary bloc, said. Saskia Esken, co-leader of the Social Democrats, also told local media: ""We must not risk that daycare centres and schools will close again and that children are forced to remain at home for weeks because we have accepted higher infection rates due to lax rules at family parties."" Ursula Nonnemacher, health minister of the state of Brandenburg, described private parties as ""a great danger"". Italy's health minister has said there will be no second lockdown in the country, despite the number of new daily cases rising above 1,000 for the first time since restrictions were eased in May. ""We will not have a new lockdown,"" Roberto Speranza said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper published on Sunday. The minister added that the healthcare system had become ""much stronger"" since the beginning of the pandemic. With more than 35,000 fatalities, Italy has recorded one of Europe's highest death tolls. It was the first European country to be hit badly as the virus spread from Asia. But while the country has experienced a resurgence in cases recently, it has so far avoided an increase on the scale of that seen in Spain and France. The number of coronavirus cases in Scotland has risen by 83 in the last 24 hours. A total of 19,811 people have now tested positive for Covid-19. No deaths linked to the virus were registered since Saturday so the total remains at 2,492. The biggest increase in cases by health board was 37 in NHS Tayside, according toofficial figures,external.

US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said that if he were elected in November he would be willing to shut down the country again to control the spread of the virus, if scientists recommended it. Biden made the comments in an interview with US broadcaster ABC alongside his running mate Kamala Harris, which is airing tonight at 20:00 ET (01:00 BST). ""I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists,"" he said, adding that he would ""be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus"". President Donald Trump - his rival for the 3 November election - responded by tweeting that Biden ""has no clue!"" Although the US never had a full nationwide lockdown of the kind seen in other countries, many states enforced tough coronavirus restrictions.  Schools, parents and pupils are being ""sorely let down by the government"" over the planned reopening of schools in England, according to the National Education Union. The NEU's Kevin Courtney accused ministers of being ""negligent"", saying there was a ""lack of a Plan B"".

He said: ""Schools and colleges need to know what should happen if an outbreak of the virus occurs in individual schools or more widely with either national, regional or local spikes."" He called on the government to employ more teachers and seek extra teaching spaces to allow education to continue in a Covid-secure manner if infections rise. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News When Moscow announced on 11 August it had registered the first vaccine against Covid-19 and was naming it Sputnik V, the message was hard to miss. Back in 1957, the Soviet Union had launched the Sputnik satellite and won the race for space. Now, Russia was saying it was pushing the boundaries of medical science. But critics claimed it was pushing too hard, and the scepticism with which the announcement was met is a reminder of intense international competition. In this race, there have been accusations of short-cuts, espionage, unethical risk-taking and jealousy, amid talk of ""vaccine nationalism"". There are currently about half a dozen leading vaccine candidates in late-stage trials according to the World Health Organization (WHO), including three in China; one in the UK; one in the US, and a German-US partnership. ""I have never seen the political stakes for a medical product being so intense,"" says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University in the US. ""The reason the Covid-19 vaccine has taken on such political symbolism is that the superpowers have seen the vaccine as projecting their scientific prowess, actually validating their political system as superior.""

France is in a ""risky situation"" as coronavirus cases rise again, the country's health minister has said. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Olivier VÃ©ran said the higher numbers were not only due to increased testing. The outbreak in France ""never stopped"", he said, adding: ""It was only controlled during the lockdown and the progressive easing of lockdown measures."" ""It's not a French exception, it's the European dynamic,"" he told the newspaper. He went on to explain that the virus is spreading four times more among those under the age of 40 as the over 65s, but warned that this situation could change if younger people spread the virus to elderly and more vulnerable people. On Saturday, 3,602 new daily cases were reported in France following two days with more than 4,000 new infections. The country has reported more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic began.

Fatal crush as Peru police raid banned party,"The crush happened as people were trying to exit the nightclub At least 13 people died in a crush in Peru after trying to escape police who raided a nightclub violating coronavirus restrictions, police say. The crush happened as revellers tried to leave the Thomas Restobar Club in Lima's Los Olivos district. Some eyewitnesses said tear gas was used. President MartÃ­n Vizcarra said 15 of 23 revellers arrested had tested positive for the coronavirus. Peru has been among the Latin American countries hardest hit by Covid-19. It has recorded more than 576,000 cases of coronavirus cases and more than 27,000 fatalities. A night-time curfew has been in place since March, and a ban on large gatherings was reimposed earlier this month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Peru's interior minister said around 120 people had attended the illegal birthday gathering on Saturday. After police raided the club, the partygoers ""tried to escape through the single exit, trampling each other and getting trapped in the stairway"". Eleven men and two women aged in their 20s and 30s died. People grieved outside the nightclub in Lima The ministry says police ""did not use any type of weapon or tear gas"" during the operation but this was disputed by at least one local resident who told RPP radio: ""It appears that police entered and threw tear gas canisters at them, and boxed them in."" The club's owners, a married couple, were among those detained. Six people were injured, including three police officers. President Vizcarra said such large gatherings were common and were posing a serious threat to public health. ""I have sorrow and I have sadness for the people and relatives of the people who have died, but I also have anger and indignation for those who were irresponsible by organising this,"" he said, adding: ""Please reflect, let's not lose more lives due to negligence."" He said all 60 police officers involved in the raid would be tested for Covid-19.

Trump declares California wildfires major disaster,"Fire-fighters are working 72-hour shifts but say it is not enough to contain the blazes US President Donald Trump has declared that wildfires burning through homes and devastating precious forestry in parts of California are a major disaster and has released federal aid. Over 14,000 firefighters are battling 585 fires that have now burnt nearly one million acres (400,000 hectares). Forecast high winds are threatening to drive flames into more populated areas as foul air blankets the state. At least six people have died and thousands have evacuated. Most of the destruction has been caused by three large fire complexes in mountainous and wooded rural areas. On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the SCU Lightning Complex fire south and east of San Francisco was the third-largest in the state's history. Video tweeted by the governor showed burnt tree stumps against the reddened fumes-filled sky and plumes of white smoke rising from ash-laden ground. Anevacuation order on Saturday,externalextended to thousands of people in the Bay area near San Jose and warned others to be prepared to abandon their homes at short notice. Allow Twitter content?

Exhausted firefighters continue to battle the flames, with some working 72-hour shifts in the dangerous, hot conditions,reports AP news agency,external. ""They're scrambling for bodies"" to help fight the fires, an official in the city of Fresno told Reuters news agency. In California's oldest state park, flames scorched redwood trees that began their lives more than 2,000 years ago. The historic visitor centre of Big Basin State Park was burnt to the ground and officials say some trees, which tower as high as 330ft (100 metres), have fallen as the area was ""extensively damaged"". Park officials fear that redwoods, the world's tallest trees, have fallen in the fires The state faces a more acute shortage of personnel than usual - the coronavirus pandemic has depleted a fire-fighting corps made up of prisoners, which has helped the state battle blazes since World War Two, due to early releases from jail. At least 43 people including firefighters have been injured, and hundreds of buildings have burned down and thousands more are threatened. After doubling in size on Friday, the fires continued to grow moderately on Saturday and firefighters made some progress in containing the flames. More than 12,000 dry lightning strikes started the blazes last week during a historic heat wave in which thermometers in Death Valley National Park reachedwhat could be the highest ever temperature reliably recorded. Hundreds of buildings have burnt including this historic 157-year old farmhouse The largest wildfire, called the LNU Lightning complex, is in the prominent wine-growing areas of Napa and Sonoma north of San Francisco and is just 15% contained, CalFire said on Saturday. Further south in Santa Cruz county, 115 homes have been destroyed and some residents evacuated. ""I left with my clothes... two guitars and a dog,"" one evacuee in Santa Cruz told CNN affiliate KGO. Firefighters dug a fireline around the University of California Santa Cruz campus as flames came within a mile of the buildings and surrounding area. Gov Newsom has requested help from as far afield as Australia and Canada. Firefighters, engines and surveillance planes raced in from US states including Oregon, New Mexico and Texas. Although California is used to wildfire, the governor called the fires unlike anything the state had seen before.""If you don't believe in climate change, come to California,"",externalhe tweeted on Saturday. Fires have burned through parts of California's wine-producing regions With more than 650,000 coronavirus cases, California also has the highest number of infections in the US, and some evacuees have said they are afraid to go to emergency shelters. US agencies have updated disaster preparedness and evacuation guidance in light of Covid-19. People who may be required to flee have been to told to carry at least two face masks per person, as well as hand sanitiser, soap and disinfectant wipes. Here are some key guidelines for protecting yourself against Covid-19 if you must evacuate to a shelter: Wash your hands often Keep six feet of distance from anyone not among your household Wear a face covering when possible, and if possible, wash it regularly Avoid sharing food and drinks Frequently disinfect your area in the shelter (including toys and electronics) Emergency shelters are enforcing social distancing rules and mask wearing, and have even given individual tents to families to self-isolate. Some counties are seeking to set up separate shelters for sick evacuees or anyone who is found to have a high temperature. Officials say people should consider sheltering with family and friends. Evacuation centres, including at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, must also enforce social distancing rules Officials also advise people to remain indoors due to the poor air quality outside. California is also facing electricity shortages, which have caused rolling blackouts for thousands of customers. Officials have appealed for residents to use less power or risk further cuts.

Two hurt in pub burger van blast,"The explosion at a pub burger van sent glass flying out, leaving two people hurt A pub burger van exploded near a train station and sent shards of glass into the air, injuring two people. Emergency services received reports of the blast near Stowmarket railway station in Station Road, Suffolk, at about 20:20 BST on Saturday. The victims were struck by flying glass from the catering unit and buildings after a gas cylinder leaked in the van area, Suffolk fire service said. The nearby Kings Arms pub confirmed the van was in its car park. The two people hurt were treated for minor injuries and one was taken to Ipswich Hospital, East of England Ambulance Service said. The Kings Arms, which is next to Stowmarket railway station, confirmed the blast happened in its car park Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service group commander Wil Tel said: ""There was a fair amount of glass that had been blown out from the burger van and nearby area which had affected the two persons who got the injuries. ""There was no fire and ultimately the gas cylinder was made safe."" Mr Tel said despite initial investigations the cause of the blast was unknown, but there was a ""gas leak from a cylinder"". The fire service will be working with the owners and insurance companies, he added. The roof of the burger van can be seen ripped off It is understood the burger van had not been in use recently, with the previous tenants said to have left in June. In a Facebook post, the Kings Arms, which is next to the train station, said the ""gas canister exploded in the old burger van in the car park"". They added that ""no-one was seriously injured... but a good friend did get quite a lot of glass hit him so he was taken to hospital"". The Kings Arms, on Prentice Road, is next to Stowmarket train station Mr Tel urged people to be cautious when using gas cylinders and cooking outside in light of the recent spate of hot weather. ""Anyone who has gas cylinders needs to make sure they are stored in a cool and well-ventilated place,"" he said. ""If you are not using the area since Covid, then make sure you do check it on a regular basis."" Nearby buildings had to be evacuated and people were urged to avoid the area, while the station was closed for two hours.

'Why join a force of people you mistrust?',"""Why would you join a force of people you are taught to inherently mistrust?"" Leena Farhat says she's been stopped by officers in Wales three times in four years - and ""never for a valid reason"". She believes cultural problems need to be overcome to encourage more people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities to join the police. Of 6,999 officers serving in Wales, 128 (1.82%) identify as BAME or mixed race, thelatest Office for National Statistics figures,externalshow. This is below the national proportion for the population which identifies as BAME - 5.9% - although it varies across the country, from 19.8% in Cardiff to 1.7% in Wrexham. Black Lives Matter manifesto urges police changes Black Met Police inspector 'racially harassed' by officers ""In schools, from a young age, people are taught 'if something isn't right, talk to the police', but a BAME child's parents will say not to trust them,"" Ms Farhat, a diversity officer for the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said. ""It's a cultural divide you see in how many are signing up (for the police)."" The figures show there were just two new joiners from BAME backgrounds to three of Wales' four forces in 2019-20, and seven new joiners at South Wales Police. Ms Farhat wants the four Welsh forces to do more to build cultural trust At the country's biggest force, South Wales Police, 0.19% (six officers) identify as black, 2.6% as BAME and 96.6% as white, while North Wales Police has just two female officers who identify as BAME. The figures also show only four female officers from these backgrounds are currently ranked higher than a constable in Wales. Originally from Switzerland, with a father of Arabian descent and mother who is Mauritian, Ms Farhat moved to Aberystwyth to study four years ago. ""I've been stopped three times since I've been in Wales, at random points, and never for a valid reason,"" she said. ""People develop a mistrust for the police, think they're out to sabotage them and don't care about people who look like them."" Ms Farhat said she has been stopped three times since moving to Aberystwyth in 2016 The most recent incident came came in December 2019, after Ms Farhat had been to the S4C studios in Carmarthen for General Election night. She left at 06:00 to get a bus back to Aberystwyth. ""I had a big jacket on and headphones, and a couple of officers came to ask about a burglary,"" said Ms Farhat. ""They looked through my bag and I was asked to go to Carmarthen station. When I said no, they told me to report to Aberystwyth station. ""It was the wrong place, wrong time, but there was another woman not far behind and they didn't stop her."" Black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, according to UK government figures It is incidents like this which she believes many white people are unaware of, but which people of colour face on a daily basis, which destroys trust and stops more signing up. She thinks the implications of ""cultural mistrust"" are far-reaching, from people not reporting racism for fear of not being taken seriously, while Ms Farhat has had friends in ""dangerous situations"" who have been reluctant to call 999. Domestic abuse victims can be less comfortable speaking to someone from a different background, she added. While policing is not devolved to Wales, the issue could be debated in the Senedd While policing is not devolved in Wales, Ms Farhat believes cultural views must change and called for a debate in the Senedd. Equalities commissioner Joyce Watson said the issue should be highlighted, adding: ""I would prefer to see this being discussed with some depth of meaning not just political statements, but examining the reason and gaining improvement."" A spokesman for South Wales Police, which has six officers who are black and 78 who identify as BAME, said: ""We recognise and value individuals' unique differences, and we want South Wales Police to continue to develop as an organisation which represents and reflects our communities. ""Whilst we have made progress during this time, we accept that we still have work to do, but we are moving in the right direction."" The ONS figures are from March but forces have been continuing moves to recruit more people from BAME backgrounds since then The force also has a dedicated team to encourage applications from under-represented groups, with seven new joiners from BAME backgrounds in 2019-20. Gwent Police said it currently has 50 staff members who identify as BAME - 29 officers, 10 police staff, six community support officers and five special constables. ""We have recently taken the opportunity to further engage with those in the organisation who identify as black, Asian and minority ethnic to explore with them what further support and opportunities we could offer to help them progress in their policing career,"" Chief Constable Pam Kelly said. Virtual discussions have also taken place with representatives of different communities about strengthening relationships and providing a better service. In North Wales Police, 17 officers (1.06%) are from BAME backgrounds, with two of these being female - three have been recruited since the ONS figures were compiled. Head of diversity Greg George said: ""We recognise that, although the diversity of our staff is improving, we are not fully representative yet and we are striving to address this imbalance through positive action support.""

The homes from '17th Century squatters' rights',"Llainfadyn cottage was built in 1762 in Rhostryfan, Gwynedd, and rebuilt at a museum in 1962 If you think getting on the property ladder today is tough, spare a thought for early modern Welsh rural labourers. The custom of tÅ· unnos, which translates into English as house in one night, was a commonly-held folklore across Wales between the 17th and 19th centuries. It held that, if a squatter could build a house on common land between dusk and dawn, then the occupier could lay claim to the legal freehold of the property. One academic believes that, in a time when rising house prices in rural Wales are ""causing difficulties"" for young people hoping to remain in their home villages, there's ""renewed interest in values like tÅ· unnos"". Smoke had to be issuing from the chimney before sun-up and some regional variations, in particular in Denbighshire, maintained the builder could also claim all the land within the distance they could hurl an axe from each of the four corners of the house. 19th Century city pub being rebuilt at museum Patrols aim to tackle heritage crime in Wales The Â£3m crime which 'deprived heritage' Although the tradition is widely acknowledged, Dafydd Wiliam, principal curator of historic buildings at St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff, said finding examples of genuine tai unnos (the plural of tÅ· unnos) is virtually impossible. ""As they had to be built overnight, tÅ· unnos cottages were by necessity simple structures built from wattle and daub or turf, and capped with a rudimentary thatched roof. ""They needed to last no more than a year while the family could construct a more permanent dwelling, but once a claim to the land had been established overnight, the tai unnos which came in the following months were sturdier, built from stone and slate, and often had a small mezzanine floor or 'crog loft' as a sleeping space. ""So while there are cottages you could say are part of the tÅ· unnos tradition, there are no surviving original examples."" Among St Fagans' collection is Llainfadyn cottage, an early example of a more permanent tÅ· unnos, built in 1762 in Rhostryfan, Gwynedd, and rebuilt at the Museum in 1962. The last known tÅ· unnos was built in 1882 in Flintshire by four brothers from Lancashire - an adventure which was fictionalised in Oliver Onions' 1914 novel Mushroom Town TÅ· Hyll, (The Ugly House) in Snowdonia is an example of a tÅ· unnos TÅ· Hyll, (The Ugly House) in Snowdonia is sometimes described as an example of a tÅ· unnos cottage, but was likely built in the 19th Century as a romanticised version of the tradition. TÅ· unnos has no basis in either English common law - to which Wales has been subject since 1536 - or medieval Welsh laws, such as those set out by Welsh prince Hywel Dda. Nevertheless there are equivalent customs in Ireland, Italy, France and Turkey. ""Between the 17th and 19th centuries the enclosure of land into large, privately-owned farms and the eviction of those who lived and earned their living from that land, pushed the rural poor to the margins. A theme common to many regions of the world. ""As a folkloric tradition, there were no hard and fast rules and people may have believed different things in different areas. In some areas people believed that throwing an axe from the threshold of the finished cottage would mark the extent of the small holding that went with it,"" Mr Wiliam said. ""However, as an axe would have been a valuable tool to an impoverished family, no-one would risk blunting it by actually hurling it."" What do Wales' medieval carved stones symbolise? Bronze Age rock art found in beacons Dr Juliette Wood, Cardiff University's Welsh Folklore expert, agrees, describing tÅ· unnos as ""analogous to the Rebecca Riots"". What were the Rebecca Riots? She argues that it follows in a broader Welsh tradition of recalling and adapting ancient folklore to meet the needs of the time. ""Long before the 17th Century, there are Welsh legends of wagers between land owners and peasants, over what could be achieved in a night, and most follow a theme of the plucky underdog outwitting their greedy overlords. ""One surrounds a lord agreeing to grant the amount of land which could be encircled by a single ox hide, so the tenant cuts the hide extremely thinly and encompasses the whole farm, whereas another involves an entire village coming together to win a bet of how much land they could plough overnight."" The date Llaindfadyn cottage was completed is carved on the right hand side of its fireplace lintel She added that even the ""smoke from the chimney"" motif echoes the legend of St David and the smoke which is said to have risen from his first monastic foundation, which became Ty Dewi, the cathedral of St David. TÅ· unnos waned in popularity after the industrial revolution, when thousands of rural labourers migrated to Swansea, Cardiff and the valleys to work in coal and metal. However, Dr Wood believes the sentiment behind it has never entirely left us and is again becoming increasingly relevant in the 21st Century. ""There is a homelessness charity in Wrexham called TÅ· Unnos, and in 2009 Coed Cymru built a tÅ· unnos for the Smithsonian Folklore Festival in Washington DC. ""In a time when rising house prices in rural Wales are again causing difficulties for young people to remain in the villages where they were born, there's renewed interest in values like tÅ· unnos.""

TikTok to launch legal action against Trump ban,"President Donald Trump is increasingly hostile towards China Chinese video app TikTok is set to launch legal action to challenge a ban imposed by US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump's executive order prohibits transactions with TikTok's owner ByteDance from mid-September. Officials in Washington are concerned that the company could pass data on American users to the Chinese government, something ByteDance has denied doing. The short video-sharing app has 80 million active US users. TikTok says it has tried to engage with the Mr Trump's administration for nearly a year but has encountered a lack of due process and an administration that pays ""no attention to facts"". ""To ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to challenge the executive order through the judicial system,"" a company spokesperson said. TikTok expects the legal action to begin this week, says BBC Business reporter Vivienne Nunis. On Friday a group of Chinese-Americans filed a separate lawsuit against the president's similar ban on the social media app WeChat, which is owned by the Chinese firm, Tencent. This video can not be played WATCH: What's going on with TikTok? TikTok's users post short video clips on the platform on topics ranging from dance routines to international politics. Its popularity exploded in recent months particularly with teenagers and it has been downloaded more than a billion times around the world. Teen's TikTok video about China's Muslim camps goes viral But Mr Trump claims China is able to use the app to track the locations of federal employees, collect information for use in blackmail, or spy on companies. The growth of mobile apps developed and owned by Chinese firms ""threatens the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States"", Mr Trump says. ""This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information,"" he claims in his executive order. Is the US about to split the internet? Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat TikTok says it has never handed over any US data user to Chinese authorities. Mr Trump's actions against TikTok and WeChat are the latest in a growing campaign against China ahead of the US presidential election in November. Since taking office he has been waging a trade war against China. The US is not the only country to introduce blocks on TikTok. India has banned use of the app, and Australia is also considering taking action. The app is viewed by some as being a key instrument in China's internal surveillance apparatus - requiring local users who have been accused of spreading malicious rumours to register a facial scan and voice print. WeChat is very popular with users who have connections to China, where major social networking platforms - such as WhatsApp and Facebook - are blocked. ""Having it suddenly cut off would be disastrous and frightening for people, especially in the pandemic,"" said lawyer Michael Bien, who's representing those challenging President Trump's ban. He said the executive order is unconstitutional, because it violates users' rights to free speech. This video can not be played What is TikTok? How did TikTok grow to 800 million users?

"Irish government agrees to recall of parliamentIt comes in the wake of a golf dinner attended by more than 80 people, including political figures.Europe","Phil Hogan attended an Irish parliamentary golf society event at a County Galway hotel on Wednesday EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan has apologised ""fully and unreservedly"" for attending a dinner in the west of Ireland with more than 80 people. Mr Hogan said he acknowledged his presence at the golf event had ""touched a nerve"" with Irish people. The Irish government has agreed to recall the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) early amid thecontroversy surrounding the attendance of political figuresat the Galway gathering. It was due to return on 15 September. It has also emerged that the commissioner was stopped by gardaÃ­ (Irish police) for using his mobile phone while driving in County Kildare on 17 August. Thecounty has been under strict restrictions that prevent people from travelling in and outexcept in exceptional circumstances. A spokesperson for Mr Hogan told the Irish national broadcaster RTÃ that the incident happened while he was en route from Kilkenny to Kildare to collect ""personal belongings and essential documents"" at his apartment there before driving on to Galway for the golf event. The spokesperson said: ""The lockdown guidelines for Kildare provide for exceptional travel outside the county 'to travel to work and home again'."" Mr Hogan will not be resigning from his position, his spokesperson also told RTÃ News. As EU trade commissioner, Mr Hogan, a former Irish government minister, would lead free trade negotiations with the UK if and when they commence after Brexit. Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin will make the request for the DÃ¡il to be recalled to the Ceann Comhairle (Speaker) on Monday. The coalition government has agreed the DÃ¡il should be recalled following the reopening of schools. Opposition politicians had called for the recall in the wake of the dinner controversy that has alreadyclaimed the resignation of Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, who had also attended the event. Irish police are investigating if the Oireachtas golf society dinner breached Covid-19 regulations. The event came a day aftertighter lockdown restrictions were announced. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Hogan said he particularly wanted to ""apologise to the wonderful healthcare workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to combat Covid-19 and all people who have lost loved ones during this pandemic"".

The homes from '17th Century squatters' rights'The custom of tÅ· unnos - house in one night - was a commonly-held folklore across Wales.Wales,"Llainfadyn cottage was built in 1762 in Rhostryfan, Gwynedd, and rebuilt at a museum in 1962 If you think getting on the property ladder today is tough, spare a thought for early modern Welsh rural labourers. The custom of tÅ· unnos, which translates into English as house in one night, was a commonly-held folklore across Wales between the 17th and 19th centuries. It held that, if a squatter could build a house on common land between dusk and dawn, then the occupier could lay claim to the legal freehold of the property. One academic believes that, in a time when rising house prices in rural Wales are ""causing difficulties"" for young people hoping to remain in their home villages, there's ""renewed interest in values like tÅ· unnos"". Smoke had to be issuing from the chimney before sun-up and some regional variations, in particular in Denbighshire, maintained the builder could also claim all the land within the distance they could hurl an axe from each of the four corners of the house. 19th Century city pub being rebuilt at museum Patrols aim to tackle heritage crime in Wales The Â£3m crime which 'deprived heritage' Although the tradition is widely acknowledged, Dafydd Wiliam, principal curator of historic buildings at St Fagans National Museum of History in Cardiff, said finding examples of genuine tai unnos (the plural of tÅ· unnos) is virtually impossible. ""As they had to be built overnight, tÅ· unnos cottages were by necessity simple structures built from wattle and daub or turf, and capped with a rudimentary thatched roof. ""They needed to last no more than a year while the family could construct a more permanent dwelling, but once a claim to the land had been established overnight, the tai unnos which came in the following months were sturdier, built from stone and slate, and often had a small mezzanine floor or 'crog loft' as a sleeping space. ""So while there are cottages you could say are part of the tÅ· unnos tradition, there are no surviving original examples."" Among St Fagans' collection is Llainfadyn cottage, an early example of a more permanent tÅ· unnos, built in 1762 in Rhostryfan, Gwynedd, and rebuilt at the Museum in 1962. The last known tÅ· unnos was built in 1882 in Flintshire by four brothers from Lancashire - an adventure which was fictionalised in Oliver Onions' 1914 novel Mushroom Town TÅ· Hyll, (The Ugly House) in Snowdonia is an example of a tÅ· unnos TÅ· Hyll, (The Ugly House) in Snowdonia is sometimes described as an example of a tÅ· unnos cottage, but was likely built in the 19th Century as a romanticised version of the tradition. TÅ· unnos has no basis in either English common law - to which Wales has been subject since 1536 - or medieval Welsh laws, such as those set out by Welsh prince Hywel Dda. Nevertheless there are equivalent customs in Ireland, Italy, France and Turkey. ""Between the 17th and 19th centuries the enclosure of land into large, privately-owned farms and the eviction of those who lived and earned their living from that land, pushed the rural poor to the margins. A theme common to many regions of the world. ""As a folkloric tradition, there were no hard and fast rules and people may have believed different things in different areas. In some areas people believed that throwing an axe from the threshold of the finished cottage would mark the extent of the small holding that went with it,"" Mr Wiliam said. ""However, as an axe would have been a valuable tool to an impoverished family, no-one would risk blunting it by actually hurling it."" What do Wales' medieval carved stones symbolise? Bronze Age rock art found in beacons Dr Juliette Wood, Cardiff University's Welsh Folklore expert, agrees, describing tÅ· unnos as ""analogous to the Rebecca Riots"". What were the Rebecca Riots? She argues that it follows in a broader Welsh tradition of recalling and adapting ancient folklore to meet the needs of the time. ""Long before the 17th Century, there are Welsh legends of wagers between land owners and peasants, over what could be achieved in a night, and most follow a theme of the plucky underdog outwitting their greedy overlords. ""One surrounds a lord agreeing to grant the amount of land which could be encircled by a single ox hide, so the tenant cuts the hide extremely thinly and encompasses the whole farm, whereas another involves an entire village coming together to win a bet of how much land they could plough overnight."" The date Llaindfadyn cottage was completed is carved on the right hand side of its fireplace lintel She added that even the ""smoke from the chimney"" motif echoes the legend of St David and the smoke which is said to have risen from his first monastic foundation, which became Ty Dewi, the cathedral of St David. TÅ· unnos waned in popularity after the industrial revolution, when thousands of rural labourers migrated to Swansea, Cardiff and the valleys to work in coal and metal. However, Dr Wood believes the sentiment behind it has never entirely left us and is again becoming increasingly relevant in the 21st Century. ""There is a homelessness charity in Wrexham called TÅ· Unnos, and in 2009 Coed Cymru built a tÅ· unnos for the Smithsonian Folklore Festival in Washington DC. ""In a time when rising house prices in rural Wales are again causing difficulties for young people to remain in the villages where they were born, there's renewed interest in values like tÅ· unnos.""

Two hurt in train station burger van blast,"The explosion at a pub burger van sent glass flying out, leaving two people hurt A pub burger van exploded near a train station and sent shards of glass into the air, injuring two people. Emergency services received reports of the blast near Stowmarket railway station in Station Road, Suffolk, at about 20:20 BST on Saturday. The victims were struck by flying glass from the catering unit and buildings after a gas cylinder leaked in the van area, Suffolk fire service said. The nearby Kings Arms pub confirmed the van was in its car park. The two people hurt were treated for minor injuries and one was taken to Ipswich Hospital, East of England Ambulance Service said. The Kings Arms, which is next to Stowmarket railway station, confirmed the blast happened in its car park Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service group commander Wil Tel said: ""There was a fair amount of glass that had been blown out from the burger van and nearby area which had affected the two persons who got the injuries. ""There was no fire and ultimately the gas cylinder was made safe."" Mr Tel said despite initial investigations the cause of the blast was unknown, but there was a ""gas leak from a cylinder"". The fire service will be working with the owners and insurance companies, he added. The roof of the burger van can be seen ripped off It is understood the burger van had not been in use recently, with the previous tenants said to have left in June. In a Facebook post, the Kings Arms, which is next to the train station, said the ""gas canister exploded in the old burger van in the car park"". They added that ""no-one was seriously injured... but a good friend did get quite a lot of glass hit him so he was taken to hospital"". The Kings Arms, on Prentice Road, is next to Stowmarket train station Mr Tel urged people to be cautious when using gas cylinders and cooking outside in light of the recent spate of hot weather. ""Anyone who has gas cylinders needs to make sure they are stored in a cool and well-ventilated place,"" he said. ""If you are not using the area since Covid, then make sure you do check it on a regular basis."" Nearby buildings had to be evacuated and people were urged to avoid the area, while the station was closed for two hours.

Will Covid spread when term starts?,"All pupils in England - and many in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - can now be taught face-to-face in school classrooms. What is known about how the virus is transmitted among children and the risk to pupil, teachers and the rest of the community? The risk of children becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny. This hasn't changed even with a new, more contagious variant of coronavirus circulating. Despite a rise in the number of children infected during the winter, there was not a substantial rise in hospital admissions. ""As cases in the community rise there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only,"" says Prof Russell Viner, president of Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Among pupils in primary schools, evidence shows that there is limited spread of coronavirus. But teenagers - particularly older teens - are probably more like adults in the way they transmit the virus. In the second wave of England's epidemic in the autumn and early winter,schoolchildren and young adults experienced a much faster rise in infectionsthan other age groups - most likely because they had more opportunities to mingle. During England's November lockdown, schools remained open and operated normally, when many other places had shut down. This is difficult to say. When schools are open, there is more spread among schoolchildren, particularly those at secondary level. There have also been signs that transmission dips after school holidays, such as half-term. But it's hard to say whether children are catching the virus in the classroom, or on the bus or hanging out with friends after school. Rates of infection in schools tend to reflect rates of infection elsewhere. An ONS survey of 100 schools in England, which tested random pupils and staff without symptoms, found 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for the infection in November, mirroring an estimated 1.2% infection rate in the general population. Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, has said schools are ""not a significant driver"" of cases of Covid in communities, although she said children could definitely transmit the infection in schools and elsewhere. Sage, the government's scientific advisory group, has suggested opening schools could increase the virus'sreproduction rate or R numberby as much as 30%. But this is highly uncertain and depends a lot in factors like testing, masks and ventilation. Teachers do not seem to be at significantly higher risk than other occupations. In December, 15% of teaching and support staff tested positive for antibodies, giving them an average risk for their age. In contrast, between 25% and 50% of hospital staff had antibodies, while in care homes that had at least one Covid outbreak, two-thirds (66%) of staff had antibodies by the end of the first wave. And overall, teaching and education professionals are no more likely to die of Covid than their peers. Teachers 'not at higher risk' from Covid When will I get a Covid vaccine? Nurses, cleaners, social workers, restaurant staff, taxi drivers and security workers are all at greater risk than teachers, according to the Office for National Statistics. That doesn't tell the whole story, of course - your ethnic background, underlying health conditions, where you live and who you live with are all factors too. Teachers tend to be younger and healthier on average than some other occupations and they're also more likely to be female - all factors which put them in lower risk groups. According to Dr Shamez Ladhani, the chief investigator of the ONS schools survey and a consultant at Public Health England, the long-term harm of keeping children out of school is ""enormous"", but adds that ""the risks are not zero"". Sage says policymakers need to weigh up the benefits and harms of closing schools. This includes reducing the direct health risks to staff, and the negative impact on children's mental health, education, development and wellbeing.

"Nato rejects Belarus talk of border threatThe Belarusian president has placed the army on alert, as he talks of an external military build-up.Europe","President Alexander Lukashenko told his officials to prepare forces on the border with Poland Allegations by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko that ""foreign powers"" are organising a build-up of troops on the country's border are baseless, says Nato. Dressed in military fatigues, the president said he had placed his armed forces on ""high alert"". He is facing growing calls within Belarus for his resignation following a disputed election two weeks ago. Thousands of protesters again marched on the capital Minsk on Sunday. Long lines of people of all ages - from the elderly to those with small children - flowed into Independence Square from all directions, watched by hundreds of riot police, reporters at the scene said. Many of the marchers were carrying red and white flags or white flowers, and chanting anti-government slogans. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier, Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus for 26 years, accused Nato of trying to split up Belarus and install a new president in Minsk. He said troops in Poland and Lithuania were readying themselves, and that he was moving his armed forces to the country's western border. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? ""They are rocking the situation inside our country, trying to topple the authorities,"" Mr Lukashenko said, adding that he had ordered his security chiefs to ""take the toughest measures to defend the territorial integrity of our country"". Nato said it posed ""no threat to Belarus or any other country"" and had ""no military build-up in the region"". ""Our posture is strictly defensive,"" it said. ""The regime is trying to divert attention from Belarus's internal problems at any cost with totally baseless statements about imaginary external threats,"" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told AFP news agency. A Polish presidency official called the suggestion that Poland planned any border destabilisation ""regime propaganda"" by the Belarusians, which was ""sad and surprising"". ""Poland... has no such intention,"" the official added. Protests against a brutal police crackdown continued in Minsk on Saturday Nato urged Belarus to respect the fundamental human rights of its citizens. Mr Lukashenko was re-elected president on 9 August but the vote was widely considered to be fraudulent. Protests disputing the result were met with a brutal crackdown that killed at least four people and demonstrators said they had been tortured in prisons and detention centres. Large numbers of demonstrators are expected to rally in Minsk again on Sunday. Where is Belarus?It has Russia - the former dominant power - to the east and Ukraine to the south. To the north and west lie EU and Nato members Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Why does it matter?Like Ukraine, this nation of 9.5 million is caught in rivalry between the West and Russia. President Lukashenko, an ally of Russia, has been nicknamed ""Europe's last dictator"". He has been in power for 26 years, keeping much of the economy in state hands, and using censorship and police crackdowns against opponents. What's going on there?Now there is a huge opposition movement, demanding new, democratic leadership and economic reform. They say Mr Lukashenko rigged the 9 August election - officially he won by a landslide. His supporters say his toughness has kept the country stable. The president has vowed to crush the unrest and has previously blamed the dissent on unnamed ""foreign-backed revolutionaries"". With protests and strike action continuing, including the walking out of state TV staff, Mr Lukashenko said he had flown in Russian broadcast journalists as cover to ""stabilise"" the situation, the Belarus state news agency Belta reports. ""I've asked Russians to lend us two to three groups of reporters just in case. Six to nine people from the most advanced television company,"" he said. On Saturday, crowds of protestors waved bright lights from mobile phones and flew Belarusian flags in the streets of Minsk while chanting ""freedom"". Allow Twitter content?

France is in a ""risky situation"" as coronavirus cases rise again, the country's health minister has said. In an interview with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper, Olivier VÃ©ran said the higher numbers were not only due to increased testing. The outbreak in France ""never stopped"", he said, adding: ""It was only controlled during the lockdown and the progressive easing of lockdown measures."" ""It's not a French exception, it's the European dynamic,"" he told the newspaper. He went on to explain that the virus is spreading four times more among those under the age of 40 as the over 65s, but warned that this situation could change if younger people spread the virus to elderly and more vulnerable people. On Saturday, 3,602 new daily cases were reported in France following two days with more than 4,000 new infections. The country has reported more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic began. Japan's official surrender came two weeks after Emperor Hirohito announced an end to the fighting on 15 August 1945 Throughout the pandemic, health experts have warned of the serious health risk that Covid-19 poses to the elderly in particular. But that won't stop dozens of US veterans from gathering in Hawaii next month to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two,according to the Associated Press.,external The former soldiers, who are now in their 90s or older, will gather aboard the USS Missouri, where Japan's official surrender was signed on 2 September 1945 in Tokyo Bay and which is now docked in Pearl Harbour. They will board specially chartered flights and be isolated in hotels when not attending the events, which will mostly be held outdoors and not be open to the public. The commemoration was meant to involve thousands of people and veterans have been looking forward to it for years. âI want to go back because that day, as much as I remember it - what happened, why we were there, the fact that it was the end of the realities of war and killing and all - it was the first day that I had to start answering, âWhat am I going to do with the rest of my life?ââ 95-year-old Jerry Pedersen, who witnessed the surrender in 1945, told the AP. Before lockdown, Chris McLone was looking forward to a good year. In his late 40s, he felt fit and healthy, and was enjoying life with a successful career as a sales manager. Always a very social person, Chris enjoyed nights out with friends and going to the football. Alcohol played a part in his life but he never viewed it as a problem. But within weeks of lockdown, Chris, who lives on Teesside in north-east England, had gone from being someone who enjoyed a drink to someone who needed a drink. Charities say they have seen a marked increase in people in need of help and that Chris's story is far from unique. Read more on this story here. It's something you might have thought about while buying food at the grocery store or supermarket. Is there any chance that the packet of meat or vegetables you're holding has coronavirus on it? In theory, it may be possible, with lab-based studies showing the virus can survive for hours, or even days, on cardboard and types of plastic. Lower temperatures also help the virus. But scientists say the experiments used a much larger sample of the virus than would occur in the real world, increasing the chances that some would survive. Emanuel Goldman, professor of microbiology at Rutgers University, wrote in The Lancet medical journal: ""In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small, and only in instances where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface, and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze (within one to two hours)."" Interested in finding out more?Read this. The release of a Public Health England study suggesting the risk of outbreaks in schools is low supports the findings of other research. However, experts have also pointed out that schools do not just bring children together - teachers, parents at school gates and other knock-on effects like more people on public transport or working parents returning to offices could also influence the spread of the virus. And with winter and fears of a resurgence of the virus approaching, there are worries that schools could play a role in spreading coronavirus. Our health correspondent Rachel Schraer has examined the risks. Thirty-three people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending wedding celebrations in the German state of Hesse, local authorities say. Dozens of people attended the wedding in the Gross-Gerau district earlier this month. But as the celebrations were held over two separate days - with 100 guests on 7 August, and 160 others on 14 August - they did not have to be registered, local media report. Most of the 160 guests have already been tested, although not all have received their results, the district said on Sunday. The news comes as a number of German politicians have called for private gatherings to be banned in a bid to stop the spread of the virus. Just a day earlier, however,scientists held three pop concerts in a single dayas part of a study to investigate the risks posed by mass indoor events during the pandemic. On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold a meeting with the heads of the country's federal states to discuss a unified approach to the pandemic, Reuters news agency reports. The latest UK figures have just been released. A further six people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days. Department of Health and Social Care figures,externalalso show 1,041 more people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, down from 1,288 new infections reported on Saturday. Eighteen new deaths were reported on Saturday. The total number of cases in the UK now stands at 326,086, with 41,429 deaths. You can check the number of confirmed cases in your area here. EU trade commissioner and former Irish minister Phil Hogan has apologised ""fully and unreservedly"" for attending a golf dinner in Ireland with more than 80 people. Mr Hogan said he acknowledged his presence at the event in Galway, which was held a day after the government announced a tightening of lockdown restrictions, had ""touched a nerve"" with Irish people. Ireland's Agriculture Minister Dara Calleary, who also attended the parliamentary golf society event, resigned on Friday. The Irish government has agreed to recall the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) early amid the controversy. It was due to return on 15 September. Police are also investigating whether the dinner breached Covid-19 regulations. This video can not be played Coronavirus: 'Inevitable and necessary differences' with Scotland school return Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks, after months of disrupted education as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. But schools in Scotland have already returned. So what was it like to be back in the classroom? Mike Corbett was happy to return to face-to-face teaching at his secondary school in East Dunbartonshire earlier this month and looked forward to the ""buzz of the classroom"" that's ""completely impossible online. The English teacher said pupils are ""very happy to be back"" too - but there's plenty of pandemic protocols for them to get used to such as regularly using hand sanitiser, not doing group work, and wiping down their desks before leaving the room. Mike also has things to adapt to, like the line marking out two metres to keep a safe distance from pupils. Read more about the experiences of teachers and parents here. Earlier this month, coronavirus deniers held an ""End of the Pandemic"" march in Berlin Several politicians in Germany are calling for a temporary ban on private parties after the country saw its highest rise in new infections since late April. On Saturday the Robert Koch Institute reported 2,034 new confirmed cases, taking the total up to 232,082. ""Unfortunately since the start of summer a certain recklessness has spread,"" Ralph Brinkhaus, leader of the CDU/CSU conservative parliamentary bloc, said. Saskia Esken, co-leader of the Social Democrats, also told local media: ""We must not risk that daycare centres and schools will close again and that children are forced to remain at home for weeks because we have accepted higher infection rates due to lax rules at family parties."" Ursula Nonnemacher, health minister of the state of Brandenburg, described private parties as ""a great danger"". Italy's health minister has said there will be no second lockdown in the country, despite the number of new daily cases rising above 1,000 for the first time since restrictions were eased in May. ""We will not have a new lockdown,"" Roberto Speranza said in an interview with La Stampa newspaper published on Sunday. The minister added that the healthcare system had become ""much stronger"" since the beginning of the pandemic. With more than 35,000 fatalities, Italy has recorded one of Europe's highest death tolls. It was the first European country to be hit badly as the virus spread from Asia. But while the country has experienced a resurgence in cases recently, it has so far avoided an increase on the scale of that seen in Spain and France. The number of coronavirus cases in Scotland has risen by 83 in the last 24 hours. A total of 19,811 people have now tested positive for Covid-19. No deaths linked to the virus were registered since Saturday so the total remains at 2,492. The biggest increase in cases by health board was 37 in NHS Tayside, according toofficial figures,external. The latest rise there comes after it was revealed the number ofcases linked to a food processing plant in Coupar Angushad now reached 90. A total of 79 employees at the 2 Sisters factory have tested positive, plus 11 of their contacts. US Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has said that if he were elected in November he would be willing to shut down the country again to control the spread of the virus, if scientists recommended it. Biden made the comments in an interview with US broadcaster ABC alongside his running mate Kamala Harris, which is airing tonight at 20:00 ET (01:00 BST). ""I would shut it down, I would listen to the scientists,"" he said, adding that he would ""be prepared to do whatever it takes to save lives, because we cannot get the country moving until we control the virus"". President Donald Trump - his rival for the 3 November election - responded by tweeting that Biden ""has no clue!"" Although the US never had a full nationwide lockdown of the kind seen in other countries, many states enforced tough coronavirus restrictions.  Schools, parents and pupils are being ""sorely let down by the government"" over the planned reopening of schools in England, according to the National Education Union. The NEU's Kevin Courtney accused ministers of being ""negligent"", saying there was a ""lack of a Plan B"". He said a reportpublished by Public Health England,,externalwhich suggests children who went to school during June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home, had its ""limitations"" - citing the ""little"" data on secondary schools and the smaller class sizes in the summer. He said: ""Schools and colleges need to know what should happen if an outbreak of the virus occurs in individual schools or more widely with either national, regional or local spikes."" He called on the government to employ more teachers and seek extra teaching spaces to allow education to continue in a Covid-secure manner if infections rise. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News When Moscow announced on 11 August it had registered the first vaccine against Covid-19 and was naming it Sputnik V, the message was hard to miss. Back in 1957, the Soviet Union had launched the Sputnik satellite and won the race for space. Now, Russia was saying it was pushing the boundaries of medical science. But critics claimed it was pushing too hard, and the scepticism with which the announcement was met is a reminder of intense international competition. In this race, there have been accusations of short-cuts, espionage, unethical risk-taking and jealousy, amid talk of ""vaccine nationalism"". There are currently about half a dozen leading vaccine candidates in late-stage trials according to the World Health Organization (WHO), including three in China; one in the UK; one in the US, and a German-US partnership. ""I have never seen the political stakes for a medical product being so intense,"" says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University in the US. ""The reason the Covid-19 vaccine has taken on such political symbolism is that the superpowers have seen the vaccine as projecting their scientific prowess, actually validating their political system as superior."" Read more on this here. The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidance on children and masks. It admits little is known about how children transmit the virus but cites evidence that teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults. Here is the advice: Each of the UK's four nations have their own rules on face coverings. In England,children under the age of 11 do not have have to wear one. The WHO guidance does not mention schools. The official advice across the UK does not recommend that face coverings are worn in schools, with theDepartment for Education saying this is because sufficient controls,externalare in place to reduce the risk of transmission. But a number of UK schools have brought in their own face covering requirements and there are hints that there could be changesin ScotlandandNorthern Irelandin the future. Families visiting beaches in Karachi earlier this week after restrictions were lifted Pakistan has recorded its lowest number of daily deaths since March, the Associated Press news agency reports. On Sunday, the country's National Command and Control Center said there had been four deaths and 591 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to more than 292,000, with 6,235 fatalities. It's a big change from June, when health facilities in Pakistan's major cities appeared to be at risk of becoming overwhelmed. Now, however, life appears to be returning to normal. Read more from our correspondent Secunder Kermani. The general secretary of UK teachers' union NASUWT has made clear that it wants schools to be reopened safely and with ""safe working practices"" to protect students and staff. Dr Patrick Roach said: ""Governments across the UK must take steps to ensure that there are effective systems in place to monitor schoolsâ practices and to provide ongoing reassurance on safety after schools reopen."" Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks. Schools have already reopened in Scotland. The union was responding to a rare joint statement from the top health advisers from all four UK nations saying children faced bigger risks from missing out on education than they did from Covid-19. Dr Roach said: ""The chief medical officersâ statement has reinforced the critical importance of effective risk control measures."" But he added that it was ""regrettable"" that the statement did not address the ""well-known racial disparities linked to Covid-19"". There are two narratives in the US about coronavirus and deaths. President Trump has claimed the country has one of the lowest death rates from the virus in the world. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, his contender in November's presidential election, says: ""More than 170,000 Americans have died - by far the worst performance of any nation on earth."" Our Reality Check team has looked at three different ways to compare deaths between countries. Two of these measures show that while the US is not the worst affected, it's among those most badly hit.

US House backs postal service election cash boost,"The US Postal Service delivered 142.6 billion pieces of mail in 2019 The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that would inject $25bn (Â£19bn) into the Postal Service (USPS) ahead of November's election. The legislation would also block cuts and changes that critics have said will hamper mail-in voting. Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi recalled lawmakers from the summer recess to vote on the bill, which she said would protect the USPS. After the vote, President Trump tweeted the measure was a Democrat ballot scam. ""Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY, and will not make changes, "" said Donald Trump.  He has threatened to veto the bill, which is in any case unlikely to make progress in the Republican-controlled Senate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would ""absolutely not pass"" the bill. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said earlier that further cost-cutting measures at the postal service would be suspended until after November's vote. A slowdown in mail deliveries amid cost-saving measures at USPS has fuelled fears about how one of the oldest and most trusted institutions in the US can handle an unprecedented influx of mail-in ballots due to the coronavirus pandemic. President Trump strongly opposes mail-in ballots and has repeatedly suggested it could lead to widespread voter fraud despite there being no evidence for this. US postmaster: Mail-in ballots will arrive in time What is US row over postal service about? The ""Delivering for America Act,external"" passed by the House in a rare Saturday sitting includes $25bn of emergency coronavirus funding requested by the USPS's board of governors. More than a dozen Republicans crossed the floor to vote with their Democratic opponents. The bill would require the USPS to treat all official election correspondence as first-class mail. The service would be prohibited until January 2021 from implementing or approving any changes to operations or service levels that would ""impede prompt, reliable, and efficient service"", including closing or reducing the hours of post offices, removing mail sorting machines and mailboxes, or stopping overtime payments. ""This is not a partisan issue,"" Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney, the bill's author, said before the debate. ""It makes absolutely no sense to impose these kinds of dangerous cuts in the middle of a pandemic and just months before the elections in November."" Allow Twitter content?

Ms Pelosi stressed that the USPS was not a business. ""While we always want to subject every federal dollar to the scrutiny of what we're getting for it, let us remember that it is a service. No business that I can think of would ever be saddled with what we've done to the Postal Service,"" she added. Republican political leaders on Friday said Democrats had ""sought to spread baseless conspiracy theories about the USPS for political gain"",externaland had ""manufactured a crisis to undermine President Trump at the expense of America's institutions"". Democrats and their supporters say the cost-cutting measures will hamper mail-in voting They also condemned Democrats for pursuing for what they said was ""an unnecessary bailout plan that does not fix any of the underlying operational issues"". On Friday, the postmaster general told a Senate committee there had been ""no changes to any policies with regard to election mail"" and that the USPS was ""fully capable and committed to delivering the nation's election mail fully and on time"". Mr DeJoy - a top Republican donor and former logistics executive appointed to lead the agency in May - acknowledged that the changes he had instigated had slowed some mail delivery, but insisted that it was ""outrageous"" to suggest they were intended to help President Trump in November.

TikTok launches legal action against Trump ban,"President Donald Trump is increasingly hostile towards China Chinese video app TikTok is set to launch legal action to challenge a ban imposed by US President Donald Trump. Mr Trump's executive order prohibits transactions with TikTok's owner ByteDance from mid-September. Officials in Washington are concerned that the company could pass data on American users to the Chinese government, something ByteDance has denied doing. The short video-sharing app has 80 million active US users. TikTok says it has tried to engage with the Mr Trump's administration for nearly a year but has encountered a lack of due process and an administration that pays ""no attention to facts"". ""To ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and users are treated fairly, we have no choice but to challenge the executive order through the judicial system,"" a company spokesperson said. TikTok expects the legal action to begin this week, says BBC Business reporter Vivienne Nunis. On Friday a group of Chinese-Americans filed a separate lawsuit against the president's similar ban on the social media app WeChat, which is owned by the Chinese firm, Tencent. This video can not be played WATCH: What's going on with TikTok? TikTok's users post short video clips on the platform on topics ranging from dance routines to international politics. Its popularity exploded in recent months particularly with teenagers and it has been downloaded more than a billion times around the world. Teen's TikTok video about China's Muslim camps goes viral But Mr Trump claims China is able to use the app to track the locations of federal employees, collect information for use in blackmail, or spy on companies. The growth of mobile apps developed and owned by Chinese firms ""threatens the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States"", Mr Trump says. ""This data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information,"" he claims in his executive order. Is the US about to split the internet? Beyond TikTok: Who else might Trump ban? What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat TikTok says it has never handed over any US data user to Chinese authorities. Mr Trump's actions against TikTok and WeChat are the latest in a growing campaign against China ahead of the US presidential election in November. Since taking office he has been waging a trade war against China. The US is not the only country to introduce blocks on TikTok. India has banned use of the app, and Australia is also considering taking action. The app is viewed by some as being a key instrument in China's internal surveillance apparatus - requiring local users who have been accused of spreading malicious rumours to register a facial scan and voice print. WeChat is very popular with users who have connections to China, where major social networking platforms - such as WhatsApp and Facebook - are blocked. ""Having it suddenly cut off would be disastrous and frightening for people, especially in the pandemic,"" said lawyer Michael Bien, who's representing those challenging President Trump's ban. He said the executive order is unconstitutional, because it violates users' rights to free speech. This video can not be played What is TikTok? How did TikTok grow to 800 million users?
