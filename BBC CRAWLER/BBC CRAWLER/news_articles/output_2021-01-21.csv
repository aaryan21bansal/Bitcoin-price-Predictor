No more 'easy wins' at Scotland's biggest hospital,"The emergency department at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the biggest and busiest in Scotland. Ambulances keep arriving, bringing more patients. In a curtained cubicle, one man is explaining to the doctor that he's been in pain for days, but he put off coming in ""because of everything that's going on"". Dr Alan Whitelaw, who runs the department, says that while there might be fewer patients coming through his door, there are no longer any ""easy wins"". ""Those that are coming are the sick people,"" he says. ""We are undoubtedly seeing the effects of people not seeking healthcare for six to 10 months. ICU staff are 'physically and emotionally' drained Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Scotland's excess deaths hit 129-year high ""We are seeing disease that we wouldn't always see and we are seeing it further down the road. ""We are making more diagnoses that potentially would be made in primary care or outpatient clinics.  On top of that we've got lots of Covid patients coming through the door. ""So it is those two things together that currently put the NHS under that significant pressure."" All over Scotland, hospitals are under severe pressure, with some treating significantly more coronavirus patients than they did during the first wave of the pandemic. Public visitors are not allowed at the QEUH, but BBC Scotland was given special permission to film to highlight the impact of Covid and the importance of following lockdown rules. On the day of the BBC's visit, there are 244 Covid patients. Critical care is running at capacity, and across the whole hospital it's a constant challenge to find space for new patients. Dr Whitelaw says the level of unpredictability is extreme. His team has run out of spare beds. ""We are ten months into strange and difficult times. It's winter, no-one's had a holiday, no-one's had much downtime. ""Hospitals are fuller in winter, beds are tighter and patients are sick"". Upstairs, one ward that previously treated patients with infectious diseases like flu or norovirus, is now a Covid ward. All 28 beds are full. Some patients here are recently diagnosed, others are coming to the end of their isolation, while some have been stepped down from critical care, but need rehabilitation. Senior charge nurse Karen Paton says it feels like patients are now sicker for longer. ""We've had this going on for more or less a year now and staff are beginning to feel the emotional distress of it,"" she says. ""Having to deal with patients succumbing to coronavirus, and just having the emotions of all the patients not being able to have contact from their families. ""I think it's beginning to take its toll on everybody."" Covid patient Gerry Gilroy says QEUH staff have been ""superb"" In one room on the ward is Gerry Gilroy, who tested positive for Covid in late December. By 8 January, the day of his 66th birthday, he could barely get out of bed and couldn't eat. ""It just hit me and I knew there was something not right,"" he says. ""I know how serious it is. I never thought it would hit me. It's been a bit of an experience but thankfully I'm on the mend. ""The staff here are superb. When I get out of here, if I can do something for the NHS I'm going to. Doctors, cleaners, nurses, all top drawer."" The impact of Covid is being felt across the hospital. The acute receiving area used to be the first stop for people who needed urgent surgery. Now it's where medics like Dr Colin Perry assess Covid patients sent in by their GP or NHS 24. It's another area that's full. ""In the first wave our ICU was busy and it remains very busy, but during that period we had free beds,"" says Dr Perry. ""This time we have much more pressure on the downstream ward areas, so it is harder to manage the wider needs of the hospital and make room for patients to move through the system. ""The numbers are far higher than they were a year ago."" Repurposing so many wards to treat coronavirus patients has meant some routine work had to be postponed, but staff are working to prioritise all different kinds of treatment. Helen Dorrance is a senior surgeon who specialises in bowel cancer at the QEUH. On the day the BBC visits she is operating on patients from another hospital to help relieve pressures there. Demand for critical care makes it difficult to operate some services, but cancer treatment is still running. ""We work together as a team across the region to make sure people who are the highest priority get dealt with,"" she says. ""But everyone gets their fair share and access to the care they need. ""It's not a choice, we do have to provide the best care we can for Covid patients and my critical care colleagues are stepping up to the mark. ""But the rest of us are making sure the rest of the service runs the way it should, so if you have your heart attack or stroke the right people are there to give you the best care."" Coming to hospital for any reason during the pandemic is a different experience, and services are stretched. But the emergency department's Dr Whitelaw adds that no matter what happens, they will cope. ""We don't come to work to worry or be fearful, we come to work to do our best and to help,"" he says. ""I think there's an uncertainty about what the next two to three weeks look like. ""It might be very, very challenging but I have absolute faith that the staff here will continue to do everything that is required. ""I think the public should be reassured that no matter what is thrown at us we will definitely get through it."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

NI lockdown to be extended until 5 March,"Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster were advised restrictions may have to remain in place until after Easter Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said. The executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February. But ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays. A lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas. Family gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons. Schools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting. The lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas. First Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an ""appropriate and necessary response"" to tackle the ""imminent threat"" posed by Covid-19. She said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: ""To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains."" The first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people. But there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals. Their decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. They're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks. Beyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also ""well advanced"" before any restrictions are relaxed. The hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. Until then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important. ""We don't know what will come after [5 March],"" she said. Ms O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible. The executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday. Thereproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number- had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But thelatest estimate from the Department of Health,externalsays it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care. While some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak. Daily case numbers are still significantly higher too. While ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April. Ministers say they understand the extension of the lockdown will be difficult for people It is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month. Ministers were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is ""well advanced"" before any relaxations are agreed. Mrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to ""please seek help"". More than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals. The chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the ""sustained pressure on our health service"" would probably last for three to four weeks. In the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of ""little surprise to most businesses"". Allow Twitter content?

The Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost Â£300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown. A total of Â£100m is going towards theLocal Restrictions Support Scheme,external, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions. There will also be Â£16m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate. In addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened. One aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of Â£26m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible. The other is a Â£4m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation. More money is being made available to help businesses affected by the lockdown Janice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a ""real lifeline for the sector"". ""Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,"" she added. Also among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March. Last week, a scheme was announced to give directors Â£1,000 grants which one director described as a ""kick in the teeth"" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months. But that scheme is to be boosted with another Â£20m so the payments on offer will more than treble to Â£3,500. Local newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief.

"US Covid deaths may top 500,000 next month - BidenThe new president warns it could take months to turn things around.US & Canada","Newly elected US President Joe Biden warned US Covid deaths ""will likely exceed"" 500,000 by next month In his first full day in office, Mr Biden signed a raft of executive orders to tackle the pandemic These include mandatory mask-wearing at airports and some public transport, accelerating vaccinations and increased testing President Biden has already reversed a number of Trump policies - including scrapping plans for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline He is returning the US to the Paris climate accord and restoring ties to the World Health Organization Many world leaders welcomed the new presidency, hoping for a reset in relations after four turbulent years under Donald Trump New figures on jobless claims contain a stark warning on the challenges facing the economy Edited by Jude Sheerin Thank you for joining our live coverage of President Joe Biden's first full day in office. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

French students promised one euro lockdown meals,"""You need to take care of each other,"" President Macron told students in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has promised all university students two meals a day for one euro (88p; $1.21) to help them cope during lockdown. ""We must be able to provide better support,"" he said at a meeting with students in Paris on Thursday. It follows protests in which students called for more help to tackle loneliness and financial problems. France is currently under a 18:00-06:00 curfew, and coronavirus cases have risen steadily in recent weeks. Mr Macron, who addressed students at Paris-Saclay university, also said the government would provide subsidies to pay for counselling and other mental health services. The subsidies would take the form of a voucher which students can redeem if they feel the need to talk to a mental health professional, the president said. French students protest at Covid mental health toll Coronavirus cases, deaths and vaccinations by country Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young? He added that the discounted meals would be available from university canteens and other nearby outlets that are providing takeaways. ""We remain in a period of uncertainty,"" Mr Macron said. ""We will have a second semester that will have the virus and a lot of constraints."" ""You need to take care of each other,"" he added. The president spoke a day after students took to the streets to demand more attention from the government. They sought to raise awareness of the rising mental health problems many say they are suffering as a result of the pandemic. A combination of isolation, inactivity and concerns about the job market has left many students close to breakdown, according to university psychologists. Ryan Kennedy says the French government is failing to take student issues seriously ""I've lived alone in a studio apartment since September - it's the first time I've ever lived alone,"" Ryan Kennedy, a 19-year-old law student in Montpellier, told the BBC.

What Kamala Harris did on her first day,"Kamala Harris spent her first morning as vice-president at a prayer service with the president Kamala Harris has made history, becoming the first woman and first black and South Asian American to serve as US vice-president. So what does the job involve? And what did Ms Harris do first? Historically speaking, not a lot. It has been described as the least understood, most ridiculed and most often ignored constitutional role in the federal government, and for a long time it stayed that way. ""The role of the vice-president was, frankly, to just be that heartbeat away from the president,"" said Barbara Perry, the director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia's Miller Centre. Unless the president died, or was seriously ill, the vice-president's job was largely to sit around and wait. For some vice-presidents, the dynamic meant holding a job you hoped would never be needed. ""One of the vice-presidents in the early 20th Century said, 'Every day I ring the doorbell at the White House and hope the president will answer,'"" Ms Perry said. That's not a role to take lightly. Nine of the country's 45 presidents has left office before the end of their term, eight by death - about one fifth of all presidents - giving their vice-presidents a sudden promotion. At 78 years old, Mr Biden is the oldest president to assume the office, putting added stress on his next-in-line. It wasn't until the 1970s, under President Jimmy Carter, that the vice-president began to assume a bigger role. Mr Carter, a former Georgia governor, had built his candidacy around being a political outsider. ""He knew he didn't know Washington,"" Ms Perry said. So when he won the nomination, he called on Walter Mondale, a long-time US senator, to show him the ropes and be a ""true governing partner"". The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in The first 'second dude' in the White House While their close relationship was new, their strategic match followed a well-worn pattern of vice-presidents offering geographical or ideological balance to the president. The practice has continued on most recent political tickets. Barack Obama, then a relative political newcomer, tapped Joe Biden, a 35-year veteran of the US Senate. Donald Trump went with Mike Pence, whose evangelical bona fides were thought to smooth over Mr Trump's image for the religious right. And Ms Harris offers a counter to Joe Biden's age, gender and race. What's more, this time the ceremonial role held by the vice-president as president of the Senate will prove crucial for Ms Harris' party. There is currently a 50-50 seat split between Democrats and Republicans in the upper chamber, and Ms Harris will cast the deciding ballot in any tie. As she walked along Pennsylvania Avenue with her family in the inauguration parade, Vice-President Harris knew her ceremonial tasks were over. ""I'm just walking to work,"" she said. Moments later she was entering the White House, her new workplace, to join her new boss in tackling some pretty daunting challenges. She has reportedly been in all the key meetings during the transition, helping to shape the Biden agenda, so would have had major input on the 15 executive orders he signed on Wednesday. It wasn't long after arriving at the White House that she was off to the Senate, over which she now presides in her new job. There she swore in three new senators, and gave a chuckle as she read out her own resignation. This video can not be played ""That was very weird"" - Kamala Harris reads her own resignation certificate before swearing in new senators She has not yet moved into the vice-presidential residence, so spent the night in her current address. On Thursday morning she watched the virtual inaugural prayer service and received a daily intelligence briefing. Ms Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff will set up home in a different white house - a 19th Century mansion on the grounds of the US Naval Observatory in north-west Washington. Vice-presidents live in a white house, too The estate is close to the White House grounds, where Ms Harris will have her office, and not far from Georgetown University's law school, where Mr Emhoff, an attorney, is set to teach. To get around, Ms Harris and Mr Emhoff will also have access to Air Force Two, a Boeing 757, and they will have round-the-clock security. While Mr Biden and Mr Obama often put their bromance on display during their time in the White House, close personal relationships between presidents and vice-presidents have not been the norm, Ms Perry said. President Barack Obama and Vice-president Biden shared a famously friendly relationship But since Mr Biden officially brought on Ms Harris this summer, it has seemed to be smooth sailing, Ms Perry said. Mr Biden has said ""there's not a single decision I've made yet"" about his administration that he hasn't consulted with Ms Harris on first. She has also interviewed each of Biden's potential cabinet nominees. A friendly relationship makes sense between the two, considering it was Ms Harris' close relationship with Mr Biden's son, Beau - who died of brain cancer in 2015 - that reportedly sealed the deal for Mr Biden. It's a surprise to some who remember Ms Harris' sharp debate-stage attacks aimed directly at Mr Biden when they were both competing for the Democratic nomination. ""Biden clearly lets bygones be bygones,"" Ms Perry said. Mr Biden is likely to model Ms Harris' role after his own time as vice-president. When he introduced her as his running mate at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, he recalled the time he was chosen for the same job by Barack Obama in 2008. Mr Obama asked what Mr Biden wanted from the role. ""I told him I wanted to be the last person in the room before he made important decisions,"" Mr Biden said. ""That's what I asked Kamala. I asked Kamala to be the last voice in the room. To always tell me the truth."" Ms Harris joined Mr Biden's team as a political star in her own right. Though her own presidential bid failed to find its focus and sputtered to an early halt, it earned her a devoted fan following (they call themselves the #KHive). And despite continued criticism from the left wing of her party, Ms Harris had one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate, pursuing progressive causes like gay rights, immigration, legalisation of marijuana and gun control. She also has an extensive legal rÃ©sumÃ©, having served as California's top lawyer before her Senate bid. Her legal experience and advocacy for police reform will be useful in a White House that has promised to address ""systemic"" misconduct in US police forces. This summer, amid a wave of Black Lives Matters protests, Ms Harris was a vocal supporter of the demonstrations and called for a ""reimagining"" of US policing. But as a vice-presidential ""first"" three times over, she will enter office shouldering heavy expectations. ""While I may be the first woman in this office,"" Ms Harris is fond of saying, ""I will not be the last."" The historic moment for black Americans is worth celebrating, said Jennifer Edwards, senior director at racial justice organisation Color of Change. ""But we learned time and time again that representation alone doesn't lead to transformative change."" ""Hundreds of thousands of black women have fought, organised and voted to reach this moment. Now, Vice-President Kamala Harris has a responsibility to represent demands of the people who ushered her into office,"" she said. Ms Edwards said she will be looking for progress in Covid-19 economic relief, on criminal justice and voting and election reform. As the more left-wing half of the political partnership, Ms Harris may face blame for perceived shortfalls here, and elsewhere in their progressive agenda. And reports that Mr Biden will not seek re-election will mean a balancing act for Ms Harris - how to remain a loyal aide to Mr Biden while also plotting her own run. Firstly, it's crucial that the American public see the vice-president as competent, and able to take the reins as commander-in-chief at any moment. Vice-President Dan Quayle never lived down his spelling mistake This has not always been the case. President George Bush's deputy, Dan Quayle, for example, was ""not viewed as the brightest bulb in the drawer,"" Ms Perry said. The impression was cemented during a visit to an elementary school. A student was called upon to write a word, 'potato', on the chalkboard. ""The student wrote 'potato' as it was correctly spelled,'"" Ms Perry said. But Vice-President Quayle chipped in, saying the word needed an E at the end. A vice-president should also avoid getting on their boss's bad side. Soon after his 1828 election, President Andrew Jackson developed a deep dislike of Vice-President John Calhoun. The two differed on policy and on Washington's social scene. The antipathy between the two grew so intense that Mr Calhoun became the first vice-president in US history to resign. Still, the title for worst vice-presidential mistake probably rests with the country's third, Aaron Burr. While in office, Mr Burr shot and killed his rival, American founding father Alexander Hamilton, in a duel. But while it ruined his reputation, Mr Burr still completed his term, sheltered from prosecution.

Can Biden move US past Trump?,"At 12:01, in the midst of his inaugural address, Joe Biden officially became the 46th president of the United States. He was already well into outlining exactly how daunting a task he - and the nation - have ahead in what he called its ""winter of peril"". America is facing a devastating pandemic which has resulted in massive job losses and business closures, a threatened environment, urgent cries for racial justice and resurgence in ""political extremism, white supremacy and domestic terrorism"". His speech was not a laundry list of proposals and solutions. Those were reserved for his first 17 executive actions as president - on immigration, climate change, transgender rights and public health, among others. The Biden administration has also frozen all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. What will Biden do first? Transcript of the full speech Instead, Biden used his speech to offer hope - and to argue, at times forcefully, that the nation must be united in facing the challenges ahead; that it has to move past its current ""uncivil war"". ""Without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury,"" he said. ""No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos."" ""This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge,"" he continued. ""And unity is the path forward"". At times, Biden's speech seemed a direct rebuttal to his predecessor's administration, although he did not mention Donald Trump by name. Where Trump frequently spoke of American greatness and glorified its founders, Biden noted that the nation's history has been a ""constant struggle"" between its ideals and sometimes harsh realities. Where Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway spoke of ""alternative facts"" almost four years ago, Biden said: ""There is truth and there are lies - lies told for power and for profit."" Americans divided over chances of unity Biden wrapped up his inaugural address by warning that America must not ""turn inward"" - both as individuals retreating into ""competing factions"" and as a nation on the world stage. ""We will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again,"" he said. Rhetorically, Biden turned the page from Trump's days of ""America first"". This video can not be played WATCH: Key moments from President Biden's speech The first 100 days of any administration are always important to a new president. What are his priorities? What will he try to accomplish when his political capital is at its highest? Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office, but executive action is the (relatively) easy part. His speech reflected the reality that he enters office with his top priorities already determined for him. His government will be responsible for distributing the coronavirus vaccine in an efficient and equitable way. After that, he will have to focus on the societal and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. The virus has exacerbated income inequality and pushed many households to the brink of economic ruin. It's devastated the travel and hospitality industries and placed incredible strain on the finances of state and local governments. His pledge to seek unity will be tested early, as he pushes a sharply divided Congress to pass another, massive round of pandemic stimulus aid. If he wants to enact it quickly, he will need Republican support in the Senate, and already there are signs that some on the right may be lining up in opposition to more spending. Then there's Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which will present yet another challenge to national unity. It will keep Trump's name in the news for weeks, as his defenders rally to his side and his detractors call for consequences for his actions. Did Trump's words at rally incite riot? A guide to Trump's second impeachment trial After that, Biden's potential political paths diverge. He has said he wants to improve healthcare in the US, address growing college debt, make new investments in infrastructure and tackle climate change. He's pledged to push immigration reform legislation that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented migrants - a political lightning rod that helped fuel Trump's first presidential run. What he prioritises, and how successful his first efforts are, could determine the overall success of his administration. To make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress. The inauguration ceremony is over. But, as Biden noted in his speech, the American people face one of the most challenging times in their nation's history. ""We will be judged by how we resolve these cascading crises of our era,"" he said. Biden campaigned against Trump for the opportunity to face those crises. Now he has his chance.

"NI lockdown to be extended until 5 MarchThe curbs may even continue until Easter, in an attempt to drive down Covid-19 case numbers.Northern IrelandComments","Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster were advised restrictions may have to remain in place until after Easter Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said. The executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February. But ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays. A lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas. Family gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons. Schools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting. The lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas. First Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an ""appropriate and necessary response"" to tackle the ""imminent threat"" posed by Covid-19. She said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: ""To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains."" The first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people. But there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals. Their decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. They're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks. Beyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also ""well advanced"" before any restrictions are relaxed. The hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. Until then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important. ""We don't know what will come after [5 March],"" she said. Ms O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible. The executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday. Thereproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number- had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But thelatest estimate from the Department of Health,externalsays it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care. While some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak. Daily case numbers are still significantly higher too. While ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April. Ministers say they understand the extension of the lockdown will be difficult for people It is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month. Ministers were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is ""well advanced"" before any relaxations are agreed. Mrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to ""please seek help"". More than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals. The chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the ""sustained pressure on our health service"" would probably last for three to four weeks. In the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of ""little surprise to most businesses"". Allow Twitter content?

The Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost Â£300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown. A total of Â£100m is going towards theLocal Restrictions Support Scheme,external, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions. There will also be Â£16m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate. In addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened. One aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of Â£26m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible. The other is a Â£4m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation. More money is being made available to help businesses affected by the lockdown Janice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a ""real lifeline for the sector"". ""Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,"" she added. Also among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March. Last week, a scheme was announced to give directors Â£1,000 grants which one director described as a ""kick in the teeth"" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months. But that scheme is to be boosted with another Â£20m so the payments on offer will more than treble to Â£3,500. Local newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief.

"Houses collapse as sinkhole opens in streetInvestigations are ongoing into what caused the road surface to give way, United Utilities say.","This video can not be played Houses collapse in Gorton street Two houses have partially collapsed after a sinkhole measuring 10ft (3m) opened up on a Manchester street. Four homes were evacuated on Wednesday evening after the hole appeared on Walmer Street in Abbey Hey, Gorton. Fire crews returned hours later after the front of two of the empty properties crashed to the ground. United Utilities said it was dealing with a collapsed sewer but was investigating all possible causes including the recent heavy rain. The fire service was first called to Walmer Street just after 21:00 GMT on Wednesday to reports an unoccupied car had fallen down a hole in the road. A cordon was put in place and residents evacuated as a precaution, the fire service said. After leaving the scene four hours later, the fire service was alerted to the partial collapse of two houses at 11:00 on Thursday. No-one was injured in either incident. Emergency services remain at the scene on Walmer Street Nearby residents Maureen and Louise Kennedy spoke of their shock after the houses collapsed. ""You're just waiting for your world to crumble. It's not just the bricks and water, said Ms Kennedy. ""I've lived in there since I was three. It's the memories."" Resident Nathaniel OKeleafor said he was ""terrified"" when the sinkhole appeared in the street on Wednesday evening. ""This morning we are out. We are just trying to find somewhere to live,"" he added. United Utilities said it was dealing with a collapsed sewer on Walmer Street The collapse comes as rising levels on the River Mersey in Manchestercame ""within centimetres"" of breaching flood defencesfollowing heavy rain caused by Storm Christoph. Station Manager Andrew O'Brien, from Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, praised firefighters who worked ""at the height of the stormy weather"". ""The safety of the public was our primary concern overnight and again today, and I'm pleased to say no-one has suffered any injuries,"" he said.

Glastonbury Festival 2021 axed 'with great regret',"Glastonbury Festival-goers depart Worthy Farm in 2019 Glastonbury Festival has been cancelled for a second year running due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The news was announced on Thursday on the Worthy Farm event's Twitter page. ""With great regret, we must announce that this year's Glastonbury Festival will not take place,"" said festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis. ""And that this will be another enforced fallow year for us. Tickets for this year will roll over to next year. Michael & Emily."" Allow Twitter content?

It comes in the same week that the future of UK music was up for debate at aDCMS inquiry into streaming, and in Parliament regardingpost-Brexit music touringvisas. Thefull statement,externalon the festival website read: ""In spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the Festival happen this year. We are so sorry to let you all down."" It confirmed that as with last year, anyone with a ticket will now be offered the opportunity to roll their Â£50 deposit over to next year, when the festival will hopefully resume. It had been due to take place in June 2021. ""We are very appreciative of the faith and trust placed in us by those of you with deposits, and we are very confident we can deliver something really special for us all in 2022!"" Culture SecretaryOliver Dowden shared his ""disappointment"",externalat the lack of a Glastonbury 2021, on Twitter. ""This regrettable but understandable decision is recognition that public health comes first"" he posted, ""and that right now, getting 200k fans together in just a few months looks very difficult to make safe"". He added: ""We continue to help the arts on recovery, including looking at problems around getting insurance. I'm Glastonbury will be back bigger and better next year."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said news of this year's cancellation was ""devastating"". Sir Paul McCartney headlined Glastonbury in 2004, and was supposed to do so again in 2020 ""We have repeatedly called for ministers to act to protect our world-renowned festivals like this one with a government-backed insurance scheme. Our plea fell on deaf ears and now the chickens have come home to roost,"" he said. ""The jewel in the crown will be absent but surely the government cannot ignore the message any longer - it must act now to save this vibrant and vital festivals sector."" On 5 January the governmentresponded to a report by UK Music called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running. The government said: ""We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it. ""Our Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than Â£1bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock."" Last year's 50th anniversary Glastonbury was meant to be headlined by Sir Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, but it wascancelled during the initial national lockdown in March 2020. Michael and Emily Eavis previously said that Glastonbury ""lost millions"" after cancelling in 2020 Last month, organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC she hoped this year's festival could go ahead, despite the ""huge uncertainty"" surrounding live music in the pandemic. ""We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare,"" she told the BBC, ""but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead."" Festival season is 'still possible' in 2021 Sir Paul: Glastonbury would be a 'superspreader' Eavis said Glastonbury lost ""millions"" in 2020. Her father, Michael, has previously warned the festival ""would seriously go bankrupt"" if they had to cancel again next year. But that scenario is unlikely ""as long as we can make a firm call either way in advance"", Eavis clarified to the BBC. No line-up details had been confirmed for 2021. But just before Christmas,Sir Paul McCartney told the BBCthe event was not in his calendar, as it would be a ""superspreader"". At the start of January, MPs were told that some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month. The festival normally welcomes 200,000 people to Pilton in Somerset every year Events are ""rapidly approaching the determination point"", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals.

Evacuations amid Storm Christoph floods and snow,"This video can not be played A Didsbury couple tell BBC News they had to evacuate with their children People have been evacuated from a ""large number"" of homes in South Wales, as Storm Christoph brought widespread flooding across England and Wales. About 2,000 homes in theDidsbury and Northenden areas of Manchester,Ruthin and Bangor-on-Dee, North Wales, and Maghull, Merseyside, were also affected overnight. Severe flood warnings remain in place, and further rain is expected next week. People have been told Covid rules let them leave their homes in an emergency. One hundred homesare also being evacuated in Skewen, near Neath, in West Glamorgan, because of flooding related to mine works, authorities say. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Didsbury on Thursday morning to see the flood response there, as the severe flood warning was stood down and people evacuated earlier were allowed to return. Storm Christoph in pictures What's the best way to prevent flooding? How can you protect your home from floods? He said: ""There will be more to come, there will be further rain next week, so it is vital that people who are in potentially affected areas follow the advice."" He said flooding had a ""huge psychological, emotional and financialÂ cost"" for people and said the government was investing Â£5.2bn in flood defences over six years. Heavy rain led to multiple major incidents and flood alerts being declared across England and Wales. Many rivers are at ""dangerously high levels"", the Environment Agency said. Homes near Lymm in Cheshire were among those flooded Pumps and sandbags had to be brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being held in a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales, which was threatened by floods. Homes have also been flooded in Cheshire following heavy rain and snow showers, with roads disrupted and residents warned river levels are still rising. About 40 residents were evacuated from the Weaver Court care home in Northwich, Cheshire, by fire crews with dinghies. Neighbourhood policing inspector for Northwich Jason Murray said residents were taken to a leisure centre before being moved on to alternative accommodation. About 40 residents were evacuated from Weaver Court care home in Northwich Earlier, Cheshire Fire and Rescue said it was in the process of rescuing 21 people by boat from Lea Court nursing home in the town of Warrington. Evacuations have taken also place in Northwich, Chester, Ellesmere Port and Tattenhall, according to Cheshire Constabulary.

She was evacuated with her young children by boat at 11:30 GMT, but she told BBC News her dog was still in the house on the sofa and was ""scared of water"". She is hoping the RSPCA can rescue him. Didsbury resident Fari Iravani told BBC News his family had been told to evacuate but ""during corona where do you evacuate to? You don't want to impose yourself on other people."" He added: ""We are trying to hold on as long as we can, and hopefully it will pass... If there is a continuation of the rain and the storm, that's going to be a problem."" Nelson Vasconcelos, 37, said he could not leave his home in Didsbury with his two small children because he had no family nearby. ""We spent all night moving things to the second floor and trying to keep the kids safe,"" he said. Lee Rawlinson, of the Environment Agency, said flood basins on the River Mersey at Didsbury had protected properties in the area overnight. ""The top of the river came within centimetres of the top of the river bank but our defences there have served their purpose and kept those properties dry. But it was very close,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Residents at retirement homes stranded by floods River 'cms' from breaching Didsbury defences No fines for flooded residents staying with family Check the weather forecast in your area Severe flood warnings - meaning there is a risk to life,external- have been issued by the Environment Agency for the River Bollin at Heatley and Little Bollington, and the River Dee at Farndon, Cheshire.

Certainly nothing that would see emergency services declare a major incident and evacuate more than 2,000 homes in and around this area of south Manchester. But on Wednesday night the River Mersey rose and plunged thousands of residents into new depths of stress and confusion, coming just centimetres from breaching flood defences. And while the defences worked as they should - preventing homes from being deluged - the alert caused widespread bewilderment as residents now accustomed to stay-at-home messaging were suddenly ordered to leave. As the night wore on the driving rain turned to thick snow, coating the streets in white and adding an even more surreal backdrop to the drama. Life-long Didsbury resident Terry Sheldon lives in the house he was born in 69 years ago, in Darley Avenue, just metres from the river. ""The whole thing has been staggering,"" he said. ""I've never seen it like this here in my lifetime."" Read more here. North Wales Police began evacuating residents of Bangor-on-Dee from their properties in the early hours of the morning. People sheltered for a short time in a church hall and some were now staying with relatives, while others had been found accommodation by the local authority, Wrexham council said. Earlier on Wednesday evening, the force had been called to help residents in Ruthin who were being told to leave their homes - but warned resources were being stretched by people who did not live locally driving to witness the floods.

"US Covid deaths may top 500,000 next month - Biden","Newly elected US President Joe Biden warned US Covid deaths ""will likely exceed"" 500,000 by next month In his first full day in office, Mr Biden signed a raft of executive orders to tackle the pandemic These include mandatory mask-wearing at airports and some public transport, accelerating vaccinations and increased testing President Biden has already reversed a number of Trump policies - including scrapping plans for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline He is returning the US to the Paris climate accord and restoring ties to the World Health Organization Many world leaders welcomed the new presidency, hoping for a reset in relations after four turbulent years under Donald Trump New figures on jobless claims contain a stark warning on the challenges facing the economy Edited by Jude Sheerin Thank you for joining our live coverage of President Joe Biden's first full day in office. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying

Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best. Read more about Biden's Covid executive ordershere. Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

French students promised one euro lockdown mealsIt follows nationwide protests in which students called for more help and support in the pandemic.,"""You need to take care of each other,"" President Macron told students in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has promised all university students two meals a day for one euro (88p; $1.21) to help them cope during lockdown. ""We must be able to provide better support,"" he said at a meeting with students in Paris on Thursday. It follows protests in which students called for more help to tackle loneliness and financial problems. France is currently under a 18:00-06:00 curfew, and coronavirus cases have risen steadily in recent weeks. Mr Macron, who addressed students at Paris-Saclay university, also said the government would provide subsidies to pay for counselling and other mental health services. The subsidies would take the form of a voucher which students can redeem if they feel the need to talk to a mental health professional, the president said. French students protest at Covid mental health toll Coronavirus cases, deaths and vaccinations by country Covid: What is the mental health cost to the young? He added that the discounted meals would be available from university canteens and other nearby outlets that are providing takeaways. ""We remain in a period of uncertainty,"" Mr Macron said. ""We will have a second semester that will have the virus and a lot of constraints."" ""You need to take care of each other,"" he added. The president spoke a day after students took to the streets to demand more attention from the government. They sought to raise awareness of the rising mental health problems many say they are suffering as a result of the pandemic. A combination of isolation, inactivity and concerns about the job market has left many students close to breakdown, according to university psychologists. Ryan Kennedy says the French government is failing to take student issues seriously ""I've lived alone in a studio apartment since September - it's the first time I've ever lived alone,"" Ryan Kennedy, a 19-year-old law student in Montpellier, told the BBC. He added: ""Not a day goes by without a friend calling me because they're struggling with their mental health."" HeÃ¯di Soupault, a political science student from Strasbourg, sent a letter to Mr Macron last week. ""I no longer have dreams,"" she said. ""If we have no hope or prospects for the future at 19, what do we have left?"" This video can not be played ""Our mental health goes downhill in situations like this."" Many of the protesting students are calling for a return to face-to-face teaching. Some first-year students will be able to return to the classroom from 25 January. But, on Thursday, Mr Macron said all students should be allowed on campus once a week providing certain measures are in place. ""Given what your generation has already gone through, we cannot but take into account your right to some on-site presence, to exchange with your teachers, and to meet with other students,"" he said. France has had a curfew in place since December, but this was tightened on 16 January to the current hours of 18:00-06:00. Bars, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and ski resorts remain shut. Schools, however, are open with extra testing in place.

University tuition fees frozen for a yearTuition fees in England are being frozen for another year and ministers outline plans to reform post-16 education.,"There is still no long-term decision on whether to cut fees as a review recommended University tuition fees in England will be frozen at a maximum of Â£9,250 for the next academic year. The Department for Education (DfE) said a longer-term decision on cuts to fees would be delayed until the next Comprehensive Spending Review. But education sector groups said the government ""is wasting an opportunity"" to help university students. Ministers also set out plans to improve post-16 vocational education including student loans for adult learners. The DfE also launched a consultation onchanging the timetable for applying to university- to a so-called ""post-qualification admissions"" system. This would mean admissions being based on the grades achieve by students, rather than not relying on predictions. The government outlined its plans for higher education reforms for over-18s in response to alandmark review, commissioned by the government from finance expert Philip Augar. Its recommendations were published in May 2019. Planned reforms include making Â£2.5bn available for technical qualifications for adult learners through the National Skills Fund, a lifelong student loan entitlement for up to four years of higher education and the prioritising of funding for STEM subjects. But the Augar review's recommendations to reduce tuition fees to Â£7,500, alongside implementing reforms to minimum entry standards and foundation years at universities, were not addressed in this latest response. The DfE said given the pandemic ""now is not the right time to conclude the review in full"". Any further reforms are expected to be announced at the next Spending Review. Mr Augar also suggested the return of maintenance grants for poorer university students as part of his review, but there was not mention of this in the interim response. University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said: ""Sadly this interim response confirms that there will not be a radical change to the current system. The Augar review recommended tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500 and maintenance grants reintroduced ""The Westminster government is wasting an opportunity to make a real difference for students and institutions."" Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK , welcomed the prospect of lifelong loans, saying ""it is encouraging to see government's commitment to making lifelong learning opportunities more accessible to all"". However, Prof Buckingham said ""government should provide maintenance grants for those who need them the most, including those considering studying shorter courses on a modular basis"". As part of its Skills for Jobs White Paper, published alongside higher education reforms, the DfE said it wanted to ""put an end to the illusion that a degree is the only route to success and a good job and that further and technical education is the second-class option"". A white paper is a policy document produced by the government to set out their proposals for future legislation. The measures put forward include: business groups working alongside colleges to develop skills plans to meet local training needs a Â£65m development fund to establish new college business centres giving employers a central role in designing almost all technical courses by 2030, ensuring education and training is linked to skills needed boosting the quality and uptake of higher technical qualifications by introducing newly approved qualifications from September 2022 changing the law so that from 2025 people can access flexible student finance to train and retrain throughout their lives In December, the government announced that tens of thousands of adults without an A-level or equivalent would be able to benefit from nearly 400 fully-funded courses from April. It was the first major development in Prime Minister Boris Johnson'sLifetime Skills Guarantee (LSG) scheme, which was launched in September. The government wants to boost the status of vocational education Mr Johnson said it would mean ""everyone will be given the chance to get the skills they need, right from the very start of their career"". Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls' Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditors PM promises 'radical' shake-up of adult education Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""These reforms are at the heart of our plans to build back better, ensuring all technical education and training is based on what employers want and need, whilst providing individuals with the training they need to get a well-paid and secure job."" British Chamber of Commerce director general Adam Marshall welcomed the plans to put the skills needs of businesses at the heart of further education. ""As local business leaders look to rebuild their firms and communities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to ensure that the right skills and training provision is in place to support growth,"" he added.

In November, an the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) saidFE colleges and sixth forms faced significant financial uncertainty.

About 2,000 homes in theDidsbury and Northenden areas of Manchester,Ruthin and Bangor-on-Dee, North Wales, and Maghull, Merseyside, were also affected overnight. Severe flood warnings remain in place, and further rain is expected next week. People have been told Covid rules let them leave their homes in an emergency. One hundred homesare also being evacuated in Skewen, near Neath, in West Glamorgan, because of flooding related to mine works, authorities say.

He said: ""There will be more to come, there will be further rain next week, so it is vital that people who are in potentially affected areas follow the advice."" He said flooding had a ""huge psychological, emotional and financialÂ cost"" for people and said the government was investing Â£5.2bn in flood defences over six years. Heavy rain led to multiple major incidents and flood alerts being declared across England and Wales. Many rivers are at ""dangerously high levels"", the Environment Agency said. Homes near Lymm in Cheshire were among those flooded Pumps and sandbags had to be brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being held in a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales, which was threatened by floods.

London cabbies plan to sue Uber for damagesThousands of the capital's taxi drivers have already signed up to the planned group legal action.,"Thousands of London taxi drivers plan to sue Uber for damages alleging the ride-hailing firm operated unlawfully. The planned group legal action could, if successful, hit Uber with a bill for millions of pounds. The action, part of a planned anti-Uber campaign by black-cab drivers this year, claims it didn't follow private hire rules between 2012 and 2018. Uber said it ""operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded"". The group action, which will be launched by law firm Mishcon de Reya, will allege that for six years Uber operated unlawfully in London. Taxi rules in London mean that people have to contact a centralised office for minicabs, whereas they can hail a black cab on the street. The lawsuit will claim that between 2012 and 2018, Uber let people hail its drivers directly, contravening those rules. Uber spared from London ban despite 'historical failings' Litigation specialist RGL Management, which is also working with the cabbies to bring the case, said more than 4,000 had signed up so far. There are about 5,200 further registrations being processed, with hundreds of enquiries per day, it said. The firm is funding a marketing campaign, and is looking to sign up as many as 30,000 eligible drivers. A full-time driver over those six years could claim about Â£25,000 in lost earnings, it added. The group action is aiming to bring a case to the High Court no later than the first quarter of 2022. This is not the first time that London's black cabs have done battle with Uber, but today's announcement shows neither side have conceded defeat. The proposed claim itself is huge - loss of earnings for up to 30,000 drivers for nearly 6 years -  and comes at a time when London black cabs and private hire vehicle drivers are struggling for work after nearly a year of lockdowns and restrictions. Uber might now have its licence back, but the black cabs aren't willing to give them an easy ride. An Uber spokeswoman said: ""Uber operates lawfully in London and these allegations are completely unfounded. ""We are proud to serve this great global city and the 45,000 drivers in London who rely on the app for earnings opportunities, and are committed to helping people move safely."" Uber has had a torrid history in the UK capital including previous lawsuits. In February 2019 cab driverslost a legal challengewhich argued that Uber's London operating licence was granted by a biased judge. Uber then went on tolose its licence to operate in Londonin November 2019 after safety concerns.

Nearly a quarter of over 80s get vaccine dose,"Vaughan Gething said he made an ""honest mistake"" with his figures The health minister has been accused of ""misleading"" people after claiming the majority of over 80s had been vaccinated against Covid-19. Vaughan Gething said he understood most people in the age group had received their first dose of the vaccine. Figures show there have been 43,879 doses issued - 23.9% of the priority group. The Welsh Conservatives accused him of misleading people, but Mr Gething said he had made an ""innocent mistake"". According to Public Health Wales figures, the total number of first dose vaccinations has reached 190,435 in Wales - 6% of the population. The figures also show 86,717 front-line health workers have also been given a first dose. More than half of care home residents and two thirds of care home workers have also had their first doses. In a virtual session of the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething appeared to contradict the figures, saying it was his ""understanding"" that the vaccine roll out had reached ""the majority"" of Wales' over 80s population. Mr Gething also told the Welsh Parliament that he expected 70% of over 80s in Wales and 70% of care home residents and staff to receive their first jab by the end of this weekend. Welsh Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Gething ofmisleading the Senedd,external, saying: ""We need an urgent statement from the health minister clarifying the situation."" Mr Gething has since admitted making ""an innocent mistake"" and said: ""There was a minor amount of confusion about the difference between care home residents, where we had vaccinated a majority, and over 80s."" He said that vaccination for that cohort is a ""significant priority"" and he was still ""positive"" that the target to vaccinated 70 per cent by the end of the week can be achieved. He added that over 70s would be contacted soon, ""I fully expect that every health board will be inviting people over 70 to come forward for their vaccination over the next week."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said that Mr Gething's aim to have over 70% of over 80s would have the jab by the end of the week, would have been ""quite a task in three days"". ""The health minister should explain if he thinks we're still on track. Communication is key in building public trust,"" he added. In total, 9,364 (56%) of care home residents and 20,087 (67.5%) of care home workers have been given a first dose. The aim is for 70% of the over 80s and care home residents to be given a first dose of vaccine by 24 January. There are another 30,388 people, not designated, who have been given first doses. These include social workers and some in the main priority groups, where the data is not quite ready to be included. Health officials also say there is a time lag - which can be up to five days - between the day a person is vaccinated and when the recorded data is checked and finally published. This week, more than 60,000 doses of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine and 90,000 of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines to hospitals and GP practices would be rolled out. Asked if he shared the same confidence as the health minister that they could meet the 70% target by the weekend, Wales' chief pharmaceutical officer said he expected the roll-out to increase further, particularly as GPs would be prioritising the over 80s and care home residents into the weekend. These include GPs vaccinating into the evening and over the weekend, although it could again be a few more days before those doses finally show up on the officially published data. ""I'm very confident that the numbers will be reflected for the over 80s by the end of the week,"" said Andrew Evans. ""We know that GPs across Wales are very keen to get their hands on the vaccine and, as it has happened, supply hasn't been able to meet their demand so we're confident there's the capacity and the system."" ""We're all very focused on making sure we offer as many people in those [priority] groups get the vaccine as quickly as possible."" Responding to criticism that the Welsh Government was falling behind other nations in administering the vaccine, Mr Evans said that Wales was moving as quickly as possible. He explained that there were challenges around transportation and storage of the Pfizer BioNtech vaccine which has to be kept at ultra-low temperatures in specialist centres. Mr Evans also said that plans for the Oxford AstaZenca vaccine were based on the allotted number that they received by Public Health England each week. ""We get an indication week of what allocation we're getting for next week for the AstraZenca of vaccine,"" he added. Covid: When, where and how will I get my jab?

More people have now had the first dose of the vaccine than the number - 185,035 - who have tested positive for Covid-19. Meanwhile, weekly figures - up to Sunday - show the vaccine roll-out across different parts of Wales, by health board. The rates of first doses to Welsh residents range from 4.4% of the population in north Wales to 5.8% in Powys. Mr Evans said the amount of vaccine a health board might have at any one time reflected the capacity or number of appointments it might have booked for its vaccination centres.

LiveLiveCovid dominates Bidenâs first full day1 minute ago,"Newly elected US President Joe Biden warned US Covid deaths ""will likely exceed"" 500,000 by next month In his first full day in office, Mr Biden signed a raft of executive orders to tackle the pandemic These include mandatory mask-wearing at airports and some public transport, accelerating vaccinations and increased testing President Biden has already reversed a number of Trump policies - including scrapping plans for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline He is returning the US to the Paris climate accord and restoring ties to the World Health Organization Many world leaders welcomed the new presidency, hoping for a reset in relations after four turbulent years under Donald Trump New figures on jobless claims contain a stark warning on the challenges facing the economy Edited by Jude Sheerin Thank you for joining our live coverage of President Joe Biden's first full day in office. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Education Minister Peter Weir says that from an educational point of view, he wants ""to keep the extent to which they [children] are out of school to a minimum"". But Mr Weir said that decisions about schools during the Covid-19 pandemic must ""be weighed up against the wider public health advice"". Speaking on the BBC's Evening Extra programme after it was announced that current restrictions will be extended, Mr Weir said that ""nobody wants to see restrictions last longer than they have to"". He said the decision to extend lockdown was taken ""very reluctantly but there is a broad consensus in the executive that these are necessary measures that have to be taken to ensure we remain on top of the virus"". Mr Weir added that schools have operated on a slightly different timetable to the rest of the restrictions, and that next week's discussions will consider keeping them closed until 5 March, in line with decisions taken by ministers today. As lockdown is extended in NI, the first and deputy first ministers have urged people to continue to follow the public health advice. Here's a reminder of what that guidance is.

Michelle O'Neill went on to say that the Finance Minister, Conor Murphy, has announced further funding to support businesses and other sectors, including education, tourism and transport. There will be an additional Â£100m for the Localised Restrictions Support Scheme (LRSS) which, the minister says, has already helped more than 11,000 businesses. She says there has been ""support for the tourism industry, a further Â£20m for the company directors' scheme and Â£7.5m to meet the challenges of education through Covid, including support for childcare"". The finance minister has also asked other ministers to bring forward proposals to support businesses, particularly those who have not yet received financial assistance. Ms O'Neill says there is a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary, but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about the new variant of coronavirus. The deputy first minister says the health minister had made the request for military assistance, and that Sinn FÃ©in's priority had ""always been to save lives"". ""We would never rule out anything that supports the health service."" She says she hadn't seen remarks from party colleague Pat Sheehan who said military personnel shouldn't get in the way of ""real professionals"". First Minister Arlene Foster says it's necessary for the health minister to call on the resources of the military, and said it was ""wrong"" to imply they won't have that professionalism. Ms O'Neill went on to say that the ""sustained pressure"" on our hospitals has a ""serious impact"" within the capacity in the health service to provide care for other non-Covid patients. ""We have agreed that the current restrictions need to remain, and they are absolutely necessary at this point in time"" added Michelle. ""It's crucial that the health department, in conjunction with the trusts, do all that can be done in order to ensure full resumption of services as soon as it's possible"". She went on to say that based on the advice from health professionals, they have taken the ""difficult decision"" to extend the restrictions by four weeks, until the 5 March, to be reviewed on the 18 February. Ms O'Neill went on to say that the consequences of the ""very high number"" of coronavirus cases in recent weeks are still being felt in NI hospitals. She went on to say that it's an ""extremely challenging time"" for the health service. ""In fact, I believe the health service is facing its toughest week yet, throughout the course of the pandemic."" The deputy first minister added that Covid-19 occupancy is still extremely high, and will remain high for many weeks. There are currently 806 Covid in-patients, and 70 of those people are being cared for in intensive care units. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Everything is on the table. Although the first and deputy first minister didn't want to mention Easter as a date for lifting restrictions, that was discussed. It was in the paper put forward by Health Minister Robin Swann in black and white. Some people may be wondering if the R-number is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 then why are restrictions being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection. But the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in our hospitals than there were in the peak in April and May. Our daily cases are still significantly higher too, and this new variant of the virus is more transmissible. These are big concerns. Mrs Foster says that extending the lockdown restrictions is an ""appropriate and necessary response"" to tackle the ""imminent threat"" posed by Covid-19. She says she appreciates that the news will be disappointing for many. Speaking at a briefing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, she says the issue of schools is to be raised in ""a comprehensive discussion"" at next week's executive. ""We know the sacrifices you are all making to save lives,"" she adds. The first minister says the extension to lockdown in NI comes after the NI Executive received a ""sobering""
briefing from health officials. ""We are asking people to continue to keep going, follow the public health advice,"" adds Mrs Foster. ""Stay at home as much as possible and remember that if we all work together, we will get through it."" The deputy first minister, Michelle O'Neill, says the current situation with the epidemic is a ""very difficult one"" and says some progress has been made with driving down transmission rates, which are decreasing slowly. She confirmed that the R rate is below one. ""This is very welcome evidence that the current restrictions are having a really positive impact."" She went on to say it will take some time for restrictions to have ""maximum impact on the course of the epidemic"". Arlene Foster says ""we have made progress but our war against Covid-19 has not been won and our hospital case numbers remain at extremely high levels"". The first minister urged people to continue to follow the guidance as ""to not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains"". ""We need to keep pressing forward to provide our health service with the full relief and respite it needs from Covid,"" she added. She added that the NHS is facing the peak of Covid demand on the system this week, which is whymembers of the military are to be brought in to help medical staff in Northern Irelandin the fight against Covid-19. Speaking at a press briefing in Dungannon, County Tyrone, First Minister Arlene Foster says people in Northern Ireland ""have halved the number of cases in a fortnight and day by day we are reducing that further"". The first minister says that the Reproduction (R) number is currently estimated to be at 0.65-0.85. Mrs Foster says that 144,212 people in Northern Ireland had received their first Covid-19 vaccine by close of play yesterday. She adds that
all people aged over 80 should be offered their first vaccine by end of this week. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill are at the podium in Dungannon where they'll give us an update on  discussions around the virtual executive table. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Restrictions are going to be extended â we know that for sure
now. The ministers have agreed it and we are expecting a formal announcement shortly
from the first and deputy first ministers. But there has been no detail around strengthening
restrictions. The feeling is that theyâve decided to extend the period of these current measures â which were due to end on 6 February â until 5 March. There was some discussion though that these restrictions may well be extended to the Easter holidays in April. This is being debated among officials across the UK and is something very much in the pipeline but we understand that a decision on this wonât be taken until next month. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland has recorded a further 21 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday, bringing its death toll to 1,692, with 732 more positive cases. There have now been 98,351 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. The Department of Health said that 70 people are being treated in intensive care units - an increase of three in the past 24 hours - of which 58 are on ventilators. Â© 2025 BBC.

Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will

Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

What might a 'tighter' lockdown look like?,"Police checkpoints have seen officers questioning people about whether their travel is essential Northern Ireland has been in lockdown since 26 December, in a bid to control the spread of Covid-19. Restrictions had been eased in the run-up to Christmas, which led to a sharp spike in cases in January, causing severe pressure on the health service. Medically-trained military personnel will be deployed to help, buta union has questioned the moveand said NI should have entered a stricter lockdown sooner. With Stormont ministers extending the current lockdown, could other measures could be on the table? It's worth bearing in mind that NI is already in tight lockdown restrictions and has been for almost a month. Butthe current measuresare now set to remain in place until at least 5 March. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said health officials had not requested any other measures be toughened up at this time, given the duration and extent of the current rules. The initial lockdown began last March, with non-essential retailnot permitted to open againuntil 12 June. By law people are required to stay at home during the lockdown unless they have a reasonable excuse, such as going out for exercise, medical or food needs. People are also required to wear face masks in shops and on public transport, with only a limited number of exemptions. Those who breach the rules can face fines, with businesses that break the law also able to be fined if they do not follow the rules. However, DUP minister Edwin Poots has expressed concern that not enough has been done by the PSNI to enforce the laws. It is a difficult balance for the executive to strike. They previously announced that ""Covid marshals"" would be deployed in the retail sector to ensure social distancing in queues and adherence to the rules. Ministers want to ensure as many people as possible follow the restrictions voluntarily while ensuring the PSNI has enough powers to manage the situation. Health Minister Robin Swann has not ruled out revisiting whether the level of fines people can face should be increased, and said he would raise the matter with his executive colleagues. The 2020 lockdown saw many businesses right across Northern Ireland forced to close, with retail and hospitality among them. There was confusion over whether construction and manufacturing should stop, with the executive later clarifying thatessential work on building sitescould continue. In the latest lockdown, the sector has been permitted to remain fully open. In the Republic of Ireland, all non-essential constructionhas been ordered to stopduring a fresh lockdown there. Like in the previous lockdown, people have again been told to work from home unless they cannot. But it is worth pointing out many companies have had time to prepare since last March, making their workplaces Covid-secure to allow more staff to attend in person. The executive has a defined list of essential businesseshere,external. Face coverings in shops are mandatory in Northern Ireland's shops There has also been confusion about what elements of the retail sector can operate. All but essential retail shops were told to close on 26 December, and click-and-collect is only allowed for those essential retailers. But concerns were later raised that some larger chains were ""gaming"" the regulations by selling non-essential items, with smaller independent shops who had to close arguing they were being treated unfairly. The executivemet with retailers last week to discuss this, but it seems unlikely it will act to define essential items in regulations. A similar situation in Waleslast year led to criticismafter supermarkets were told by law not to sell certain items. The majority of pupils are in an extended period of remote learning until after half-term in February, but some children of key workers and vulnerable children are still permitted to attend the classroom. Last week it emerged thatat least eight times as many pupils in Northern Irelandattended schools in the first week of term in 2021 compared to the first lockdown in 2020. Though part of this is due to special schools remaining open for all pupils, unlike in March to June last year. The executive could potentially revisit the list of services it defines as meeting the ""key worker"" definition for childcare, if it wanted to reduce this further. It is also possible schools could remain closed to most pupils for a longer period, in line with extending the lockdown to 5 March. The executive says workers, builders, tradespeople and other professionals can continue to go into people's houses to carry out work such as repairs, installations and deliveries. But it does not define further what this type of work should include. It is possible ministers could tighten the circumstances in which work can be carried out in someone's home, but theguidance already specifies a limited number of exemptions,externalfor allowing others inside your home during the lockdown. House moves are also allowed under the regulations, although they were paused in the first lockdown. Music lessons and private tutoring are permitted in someone's home, with mitigations. During the first week of lockdown from 26 December, people were told not to leave their homes between 20:00 and 06:00 every day -effectively amounting to a curfew. Ministers could decide to impose the measure again, if they felt that was necessary - but initially it was imposed to stop house parties over New Year's Eve. All but essential travel is not permitted outside of Northern Ireland, and anyone entering Northern Ireland must self-isolate for 10 days on arrival or face a fine. However, there is no formal travel ban on passengers from Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland entering Northern Ireland. The executivehad voted by a majority before Christmasnot to impose such a ban, despite calls from Sinn FÃ©in for it to happen. Other parties argued that the public health advice did not propose a ban in law, and that travel from the Republic of Ireland to NI should be restricted as well due to its rise in cases. Thecurrent guidance states,externalthat anyone coming into NI from within the Common Travel Area who is staying for more than 24 hours should self-isolate for 10 days, but there are exemptions for those who ""cross the border"" regularly for work or other essential reasons. The executive also does not have a formal limit in law for travelling to exercise, unlike in the Republic of Ireland where it is 5km (3 miles). Justice Minister Naomi Long said there is an ""advisory limit"" of 10 miles for exercise in Northern Ireland.

NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered,"The reopening of theatres and concert venues is among the latest moves by Stormont minister to ease lockdown Northern Ireland Executive ministers have agreed to lift more Covid-19 public health restrictions this week, allowing theatre and concert venues to reopen. The rules on live music and the number of people who are allowed to meet in a private home are also being eased. Ministers have been gradually lifting restrictions in the past few months, following the strict lockdown they imposed across Northern Ireland after Christmas 2020. However, a recent surge in infection rates and the resulting pressure on hospital admissions mean some restriction remain in place for now. BBC News NI explains the latest rules on socialising, travel, face coverings and other areas. Yes. On Monday, ministers agreed that a total of 10 people from three households would now be allowed to meet inside a home. Children under 12 do not count towards the total. Previously, the limit was six people from two households (or 10 people if one household was bigger than six people). Overnight stays have been allowed for some time. Yes, and the numbers allowed to enter have been gradually increasing. From Monday 26 July, a maximum of 15 people from an unlimited number of households are able to meet in a private garden. Again, children aged 12 and under do not count towards this limit. Long-awaited holidays abroad are possible without quarantine from 26 July for some travellers Yes, you can. Atraffic light system for international travelcame into force on 24 May, with a limited number of countries on the green list meaning people arriving in Northern Ireland from those areas were exempt from quarantine. With the expanded vaccination rollout, more significant changes took effect on 19 July. New rules came into force on that date which meant travellers arriving in Northern Ireland from amber countries (except France) were able toavoid quarantine if they had received both their Covid-19 vaccinesin the UK. These passengers still need to produce evidence of a negative Covid-19 test before departure and take a PCR test on day two after arrival. There are exemptions for some including children under 18, those medically advised against vaccination and clinical trial participants. On Thursday 29 July, the NI Executive announced thatpeople who have been fully vaccinated in the EU (except France) or the US will not need to isolate when coming to Northern Ireland. The move, from Monday 2 August, brings Northern Ireland in line with England, Scotland and Wales. There are also no limits on travel to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland, known as the Common Travel Area (CTA). On 24 May, the Northern Ireland Executive lifted its guidance on self-isolating after travelling to another part of the CTA. Testing is still advised after arriving back in Northern Ireland from another part of the CTA but it is guidance only. Restrictions on dancing mean nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain shut Yes,live music resumed from 5 July with a number of restrictions, but these rules are in the process of being eased. Stormont ministers have now agreed that concert venues and theatres can reopen from 18:00 BST on Tuesday 27 July. But the venues must sell tickets in advance of performance, they must have allocated seating and ensure social distancing of at least 1m (3ft). Volume restrictions on live indoor music which were in force from 5- 26 July have now been lifted. However, dancing is not permitted and this restriction is not due to be reconsidered by ministers before 12 August. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed at present. Face coverings remain mandatory in many settings AlthoughPrime Minister Boris Johnson removed the legal requirement to use face coverings in England from 19 July, that change did not apply in Northern Ireland. Masks have been mandatory on public transport in Northern Ireland since July 2020 and in shops since August 2020, with a limited number of exemptions. But from 26 July, people attending indoor religious services in Northern Ireland will no longer have to wear a face covering during the service. However, it is still be a legal requirement to wear face masks when entering and exiting the building, and guidance will recommend that worshipers keep their masks on during services. Face coverings remain compulsory in other settings, including: Pubs, restaurants and hotels when customers are not seated at a table Taxis and private buses For staff in retail shops In public areas of civil services offices such as jobs and benefits offices When boarding a plane In banks, building societies, credit unions and post offices For driving instructors and their students It's a more complicated picture. The executive says from 26 July, where it's still the law to socially distance - such as restaurants and workplaces - the limit will be reduced to 1m for indoors activities. The 1m rule was then extended to include retail and shopping centres. It will be removed for all outdoor activities from law but guidance will be that social distancing is recommended at 1m (3ft) where possible. Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan recently said more significant changes were coming and that he hoped the executive could agree on 12 August to put in place a date to end social distancing in law. That meeting could also see ministers discuss lifting the remaining restrictions on hospitality, such as the numbers of people allowed to sit at a table together. Many people postponed their weddings over the past year and a half These ceremonies have been continuing with restrictions through the latest lockdown, but from 24 May, post-wedding and civil partnership receptions were allowed to resume. However, mitigations remain in place including: Tables of up to 10 people only (no household limit) No restriction on numbers of people at the top table Venues must carry out a risk assessment for capacity Dancing is not permitted Vehicle testing has been disrupted since early 2020 by MoT equipment failures and the pandemic From 26 July,normal services resumed at MoT centres. During MoT examinations, a vehicle can be shared by the driver and the examiner for five minutes if both wear a mask. Customers will be permitted to be seated safely for eight minutes and must remaining socially-distanced and wear a mask. The executive said that was to allow customers to be present in testing halls and take their vehicle through the process with examiners. On the same date - 26 July - other close-contact services such as hair and beauty salons do not need clients to book ahead for appointments first and overlapping appointments will also be allowed. Quite possibly, but do not expect Northern Ireland's rules to directly match the timeline in other parts of the UK. The Northern Ireland Executive can change the restrictions regularly in line with new public health advice and said it is conscious of the pace of change in other jurisdictions. It has said its decisions have been taken in a ""local context"". The executive's planned meeting on 12 August will look at the requirements for face coverings and self-isolation as well as its guidance around working from home and relaxing restrictions on meeting at home. That day could see ministers agree a date to end some of the measures that have dominated lives and livelihoods since last March. But as ever, putting that in place requires support from the executive's five parties. Achieving political consensus on how and when to end restrictions remains challenging to navigate.

Homes evacuated as severe flood warnings issued,"This video can not be played Drone footage captures the extent of the damage the bridge over the River Clwyd Financial help has been promised to those affected by serious flooding, the Welsh Government has announced. People have been forced to leave their homes and a major incident declared after Storm Christoph struck. About 80 people were evacuated duringflooding thought to be related to mine works in Skewen, Neath, while 30 were evacuated in Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham. The Welsh Government said it would work with councils to deliver Â£500-Â£1,000 payments to affected households. Environment minister, Lesley Griffiths, said people across Wales were facing the ""twin problems"" of floods and the coronavirus pandemic. She said: ""We will support people in these circumstances just as we did in the aftermath of storms Ciara and Dennis last year, by working with local authorities to make support payments of between Â£500 and Â£1,000 available for each household flooded."" Severeflood warnings,externalremain in place across Wales as river levels remain high. In the Lower Dee Valley a severe flood warning remains in force, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadow, and a major incident was declared in Bangor-on-Dee. Wrexham council leader Mark Pritchard said teams worked to ensure the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, made on Wrexham Industrial Estate, was not lost in the floods. Firefighters in Skewen waded through water up to their thighs amidst reports of evacuated homes About 80 people were evacuated in Skewen, including residents of a care home, after at least eight streets were left under water. Emergency services said there were no injuries and all those evacuated had been found accommodation, but people are asked to avoid the area. In Denbighshire, a bridge linking Trefnant to Tremeirchion over the River Clwyd collapsed in the storm. The council said it would be investigating the cause of the flooding, which forced road closures and evacuations. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the River Dee, which runs through Bangor-on-Dee, was at its highest recorded level since the water gauge became operational in 1996 - 16.45m (54ft). It urged people across Wales to remain vigilant, with river levels not set to have peaked until late Thursday evening, adding they would remain high until Friday morning. This video can not be played People flee homes after Storm Christoph flooding The Met Office said over the past two days Wales had the highest rainfall of the four UK nations. Between 19 and 21 January, Aberllefenni in Gwynedd saw 188mm (7.5in) of rain, more than average rainfall for Wales for the whole of January, which is 156.89mm (63in). That was followed by 180mm (7in) in Crai reservoir, Powys, 169.8mm (6.6in) in Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and 166mm (6.5in) in both Maerdy, RCT, and Capel Curig, Conwy.

Meanwhile, a man's body was recovered from theRiver Taff near Blackweir in Cardiff. Dozens of ducks and chickens, and 12 huskies were rescued by the RSPCA from a flooded farm in Bangor, while they also took hay to two donkeys stranded by flood water in Mold. Some 12 huskies had to be rescued after their kennels flooded Dave Brown said the flooding in his home in Broughton, Flintshire, was horrific and his mother-in-law was rescued by firefighters. ""You don't realise the damage water does and everything that floats - the sheer volume of water. I am 6ft tall and it almost took me out,"" he said. Dave Brown's mother-in-law was rescued from their home in Broughton, Flintshire Wrexham council said some of the people forced to leave their homes were with relatives, while it found others accommodation after having to initially seek refuge in a church hall.

""The whole of Ruthin was on edge,"" he said. ""Some people were accommodated at the leisure centre, and others were offered places to stay by local residents. The community was superb. ""It was the sheer volume of water that came down - there was no stopping it."" Flood warnings across Wales Weather and flood warnings A yellow weatherwarning for ice for Wales,externalhas been issued by the Met Office until 10:00 GMT on Friday, with concerns it could lead to travel disruption, slips and falls. Numerous flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Wales,including two severe flood warnings,external. The agency said flood defences were being used and river levels at Holt, Wrexham, would remain high for some time.""There is therefore a significant risk of localised flooding problems and due to that the severe flood warning will remain in place until the levels drop,"" Keith Iven of NRW said In Monmouthshire roads were closed following flooding, and the council said while water levels at the River Usk were dropping, a ""second peak"" on the River Wye had been expected on Thursday night. The council had warned people living in Riverside Park, Monmouth, may be impacted and council workers were prepared to offer support. River Tywi has burst its banks in Carmarthen, affecting nearby businesses Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended 98 flooding-related incidents It said it deployed swift water rescue teams to rescue 13 people from vehicles in floodwater. It also winched vehicles from water and pumped water from properties. In Cardiff, emergency services attended a crash involving a number of vehicles at about 07:40 on the A4232 between Culverhouse Cross and the M4. No-one was seriously injured, but both carriageways were closed for just over an hour. The road has since reopened.

pandemic. Before we go, hereâs a round-up of todayâs main headlines:  Updates today were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Francesca Gillett, Georgina Rannard, Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright and Lucy Webster. Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best. Read more about Biden's Covid executive ordershere. Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveCovid dominates Bidenâs first full dayLess than a minute ago,"Newly elected US President Joe Biden warned US Covid deaths ""will likely exceed"" 500,000 by next month In his first full day in office, Mr Biden signed a raft of executive orders to tackle the pandemic These include mandatory mask-wearing at airports and some public transport, accelerating vaccinations and increased testing President Biden has already reversed a number of Trump policies - including scrapping plans for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline He is returning the US to the Paris climate accord and restoring ties to the World Health Organization Many world leaders welcomed the new presidency, hoping for a reset in relations after four turbulent years under Donald Trump New figures on jobless claims contain a stark warning on the challenges facing the economy Edited by Jude Sheerin Thank you for joining our live coverage of President Joe Biden's first full day in office. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added.

"Nine million forced to borrow to cope with virusThere is a ""widening financial gap"" between households because of the pandemic, says the ONS.Business","Nearly nine million people had to borrow more money last year because of the impact of coronavirus, government figures show. Since June last year, the proportion of workers borrowing Â£1,000 or more had increased from 35% to 45%, said the Office for National Statistics. Self-employed people were more likely than employees to borrow  money. There was also a large increase in the proportion of disabled people borrowing similar sums, the ONS added. This was adding to a ""widening financial gap"" between households. Overall, young people and low earners have been worst hit by the pandemic, according to the ONS survey. Those aged under 30 and those with household incomes of less than Â£10,000 were about 35% and 60% respectively more likely to be furloughed than the population as a whole. Meanwhile, higher-paid workers were more likely to be on full pay if they were unable to work. There has been much focus on a glut of savings ready to be unleashed into the economy when pandemic restrictions are lifted. This ONS report shines a light on the reality of this for many ordinary Britons, having to borrow more, amid a hit to incomes during the recession. Disproportionately this has hit the low paid and the young, and this would have been far worse without the government's support package. More homeowners and the over-30s by December expected to be able to save for the year ahead. Fewer renters and under 30s expected to be able to save. Though the analysis does not include the latest national lockdown, the economic impact of schools closure is also clear. Employed parents were twice as likely to experience income loss, though that gap closed when schools reopened. The fear is that this trend will have returned over the past month. Gueorguie Vassilev from the ONS said: ""Many people took a financial hit in the first months of the pandemic, either being furloughed or working fewer hours. ""What we are seeing now, though, is a widening financial gap between households, where some people are relying on savings or borrowing to make ends meet. Those hardest hit are people on low pay, young people and parents of dependent children."" Parents living with children were almost twice as likely to report a reduction in income as the rest of the population, the ONS added. This gap gradually narrowed throughout the year as schools reopened.  Parents were less likely to have a reduced income during the November lockdown than in the first lockdown, as schools stayed open.

NI lockdown could remain in place 'until Easter',"Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster were advised restrictions may have to remain in place until after Easter Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said. The executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February. But ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays. A lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas. Family gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons. Schools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting. The lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas. First Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an ""appropriate and necessary response"" to tackle the ""imminent threat"" posed by Covid-19. She said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: ""To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains."" The first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people. But there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals. Their decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. They're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks. Beyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also ""well advanced"" before any restrictions are relaxed. The hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. Until then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important. ""We don't know what will come after [5 March],"" she said. Ms O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible. The executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday. Thereproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number- had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But thelatest estimate from the Department of Health,externalsays it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care. While some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak. Daily case numbers are still significantly higher too. While ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April. Ministers say they understand the extension of the lockdown will be difficult for people It is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month. Ministers were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is ""well advanced"" before any relaxations are agreed. Mrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to ""please seek help"". More than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals. The chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the ""sustained pressure on our health service"" would probably last for three to four weeks. In the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of ""little surprise to most businesses"". Allow Twitter content?

The Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost Â£300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown. A total of Â£100m is going towards theLocal Restrictions Support Scheme,external, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions. There will also be Â£16m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate. In addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened. One aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of Â£26m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible. The other is a Â£4m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation. More money is being made available to help businesses affected by the lockdown Janice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a ""real lifeline for the sector"". ""Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,"" she added. Also among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March. Last week, a scheme was announced to give directors Â£1,000 grants which one director described as a ""kick in the teeth"" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months. But that scheme is to be boosted with another Â£20m so the payments on offer will more than treble to Â£3,500. Local newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief.

Young people asked how pandemic has affected them,"This video can not be played While some young people have found it hard at times, others have learnt new skills Young people have been asked to share their experiences of how they have coped during the coronavirus pandemic. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said her national survey was important because sometimes views of younger people can be ""surprising"". She said the information provided would also help inform the Welsh Government ahead of some tough decisions it will need to make in the future. A similar survey was carried out in the first lockdown last year. A recent Prince's Trust Youth Index survey asked young people across the UK about their thoughts and feelings towards the pandemic. Networks 'should give data to Wales' children' Children 'worried' about education in pandemic More than 2,000 responded including 200 from Wales. It found 63% of 16 to 25-year-olds said the pandemic had left them ""always"" or ""often"" feeling anxious - 64% said they were feeling like they were ""missing out on being young"". BBC Wales spoke to a number of children and young people about their thoughts on a variety of issues including home schooling, loneliness and finding out what they are doing to stay positive. Angel has been learning sign language Angel, 16, from Cardiff, is studying for her GCSEs. ""I've just been confused a lot of the time. All the information out there and it's really hard to process and get to a point where you're in a mindset where you know what's happening. ""There's such a high level of uncertainty you're constantly worried or actually doubting what's going to happen next. ""When you have goals for the future it's something to help you get through this but when you're in the circumstances we're in now, it's really hard to find the motivation and a purpose for what you're doing now."" To try and stay positive Angel has been trying to get out for walks during her school breaks or watch Netflix. She said she has also tried to learn some sign-language during lockdown and attempted yoga. Emrys and Clara have been learning home skills Emrys, 11, from Bridgend, said he misses not having the structure of a school day and seeing his friends. He added: ""I'm a social person. I have friends, I chat with them, I play with them, and it's hard not being with my friends but I mean the family will have to do."" He and his six-year-old sister, Clara, have enjoyed going for walks with their parents and have been learning some new skills including washing dishes, cooking dinner and baking cakes. Meanwhile, 11-year-old Sophie has found it difficult to not get bored during long periods of time in the house. ""I'd say I cope OK with it at some points, but then not okay with it at other points,"" she added. Sophie said it can be hard sometimes to find things to do Alicia is studying for her A-levels and has friends who have dropped out of their studies this year because of the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty about exams and their futures. The 17-year-old also said it was ""heart-breaking"" not being able to see many of her close friends for almost a year. She added: ""My thoughts are, it's less of a luxury now, I need to be able to go out to see them and to work."" LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs Before the pandemic, Sarah, 16, from Swansea enjoyed going to her local youth club and took part in a local drama group but it how now moved online, giving a different experience. ""It's quite sad because I used to enjoy being able to do those things whenever it was on, but I think I'm getting used to do everything online,"" she said. As a person who does not cope very well with not knowing what will happen next, the pandemic has caused anxiety at times for Sarah. ""I am finding it quite scary but hopefully things will change and I'll be able to go back soon,"" she said. ""I think if you're really struggling with something, talking really helps so it would be nice to see people in person."" Children's commissioner Sally Holland conducted a survey of pupils in Wales during the first lockdown Children's helpline MEIC Cymru said it had seen a 10% increase in the number of calls from young people, parents, and carers during the pandemic compared with previous years. Stephanie Hoffman, Head of Social Action at Promo Cymru, the charity which runs the helpline, said: ""We're seeing what I'd say are many more substantive contacts, so a lot more contact dealing with really serious issues to do with social well-being, mental health and relationships, as opposed to what we might have seen more of in the past. ""Now we're dealing with situations which can be quite complicated."" Of the survey, Ms Holland said: ""We've heard a lot from adults showing concern for children at the moment, such as parents, carers and professionals working with children about the potential impact of the lockdown on children. ""Those voices are important to hear, but it's also important we hear directly from children and young people because sometimes they can be surprising."" We know that Covid-19 vaccinations have been on people's minds in Wales - with many wanting to know when they or their loved-ones will receive theirs.

Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best. Read more about Biden's Covid executive ordershere. Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Buyers travelling 'hundreds of miles' to see homesEstate agents call for tougher measures - as buyers race to beat the end of the stamp duty holiday.UKComments,"House hunters are taking advantage of lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say. In-person viewings are allowed in England, but estate agents have raised concerns about their safety and say some buyers are travelling across the country to look at second homes. Firms have said they are also currently facing increased demand before the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March. The government said the housing market is ""a key part of our economy"". It has said the housing market in England will remain open during the national lockdown - but advises that initial viewings should be done virtually ""wherever possible"". What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? Are we going out more than the first lockdown? Stamp duty holiday - when does it end? But firms say many buyers don't want virtual appointments. And many companies report increased demand as buyers rush to beat the end of thestamp duty holiday - applied on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland. One estate agent who works in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said she knows colleagues who are ""ready for a complete nervous breakdown"" because they are being asked to book more in-person viewings and valuations. She said people are travelling hundreds of miles to view properties ""because they can"" and some often ""don't social distance"" when they get there. She said many virtual slots go unused because ""people want physical viewings"". ""I was in one the other day and there's a three-year-old that comes and sits next to meâ¦ bringing me a doll. How can you say 'back off?' You can't,"" she said. ""I just think it's bonkers. I want to earn money, I want to earn commission, but not under these circumstances,"" she added. Roly Matthews says the government faces a ""balancing act"" regarding estate agents Paul Le Bas, regional director of a family-run estate agency in Hayle, Cornwall, said he would like the government to ask people not to travel to estate agents outside their local areas for non-essential purposes. He said he turned down one person who wanted to travel about 400 miles from Bradford to look at a potential second home. ""We've taken the view as an agency that if it's just for a second home we don't deem that as essential travel, you can do that when lockdown's been lifted,"" he added. ""We weren't prepared to put ourselves at risk or our clients at risk. They got a bit shirty with us."" Roly Matthews, director of an independent agency in Elmbridge, Surrey, said most of his clients want in-person viewings and estate agents have had to ""feel their way a bit as to what they think is essential or not"". He knows some agencies are not screening their clients, giving members of the public ""a mixed signal"" and said the government would be ""sensible"" to consider further restrictions. The government says people are allowed to view properties,externalduring the lockdown in England. It encourages buyers to do their initial property searches online and advises that initial viewings should be done virtually wherever possible. For viewings taking place in person, the government says these should be arranged by appointment only and ""open house"" viewings should not take place. It advises people who are viewing properties in person to wear a face mask, avoid touching surfaces wherever possible, wash their hands regularly and/or use hand sanitiser. The government says people should also observe social distancing and stay two metres apart where possible. It does not specify how far prospective buyers can travel to view a property. Mark Hayward, chief policy advisor at NAEA (National Agency of Estate Agents) Propertymark, said estate agents are under additional pressure to complete deals with the stamp duty deadline approaching. ""We've seen levels of sales on a monthly basis not seen since 2004,"" he said. ""We know the volume of sales that has to go through to qualify for that stamp duty holiday is large."" He urged estate agents to follow NAEA guidelines for house viewings, such as sanitising surfaces and limiting time in the property. The organisation also recommends people seeking to view property ""must be in a position to proceed"". ""In other words, they've either got cash or they've sold their own property so they're not having to go and put the house on the market and create huge delays."" Last week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to house viewings when heraised concerns that England's lockdownmay not be tough enough. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the housing market has been allowed to remain open as it creates ""jobs as well as homes"". ""But all parties involved must continue to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus, by following our guidance to be Covid secure,"" a spokesman said. A petition calling for the stamp duty holiday to be extended by six months has gained over 115,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament.

Before we go, hereâs a round-up of todayâs main headlines:  Updates today were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Francesca Gillett, Georgina Rannard, Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright and Lucy Webster. Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best.

Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Evacuations amid Storm Christoph floods and snowPrime Minister Boris Johnson has warned of ""more to come"", with further rain expected next week.","This video can not be played A Didsbury couple tell BBC News they had to evacuate with their children People have been evacuated from a ""large number"" of homes in South Wales, as Storm Christoph brought widespread flooding across England and Wales. About 2,000 homes in theDidsbury and Northenden areas of Manchester,Ruthin and Bangor-on-Dee, North Wales, and Maghull, Merseyside, were also affected overnight. Severe flood warnings remain in place, and further rain is expected next week. People have been told Covid rules let them leave their homes in an emergency. One hundred homesare also being evacuated in Skewen, near Neath, in West Glamorgan, because of flooding related to mine works, authorities say. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited Didsbury on Thursday morning to see the flood response there, as the severe flood warning was stood down and people evacuated earlier were allowed to return. Storm Christoph in pictures What's the best way to prevent flooding? How can you protect your home from floods? He said: ""There will be more to come, there will be further rain next week, so it is vital that people who are in potentially affected areas follow the advice."" He said flooding had a ""huge psychological, emotional and financialÂ cost"" for people and said the government was investing Â£5.2bn in flood defences over six years. Heavy rain led to multiple major incidents and flood alerts being declared across England and Wales. Many rivers are at ""dangerously high levels"", the Environment Agency said. Homes near Lymm in Cheshire were among those flooded Pumps and sandbags had to be brought in to protect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being held in a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales, which was threatened by floods. Homes have also been flooded in Cheshire following heavy rain and snow showers, with roads disrupted and residents warned river levels are still rising. About 40 residents were evacuated from the Weaver Court care home in Northwich, Cheshire, by fire crews with dinghies. Neighbourhood policing inspector for Northwich Jason Murray said residents were taken to a leisure centre before being moved on to alternative accommodation. About 40 residents were evacuated from Weaver Court care home in Northwich Earlier, Cheshire Fire and Rescue said it was in the process of rescuing 21 people by boat from Lea Court nursing home in the town of Warrington.

Didsbury resident Fari Iravani told BBC News his family had been told to evacuate but ""during corona where do you evacuate to? You don't want to impose yourself on other people."" He added: ""We are trying to hold on as long as we can, and hopefully it will pass... If there is a continuation of the rain and the storm, that's going to be a problem."" Nelson Vasconcelos, 37, said he could not leave his home in Didsbury with his two small children because he had no family nearby. ""We spent all night moving things to the second floor and trying to keep the kids safe,"" he said. Lee Rawlinson, of the Environment Agency, said flood basins on the River Mersey at Didsbury had protected properties in the area overnight. ""The top of the river came within centimetres of the top of the river bank but our defences there have served their purpose and kept those properties dry.

Certainly nothing that would see emergency services declare a major incident and evacuate more than 2,000 homes in and around this area of south Manchester. But on Wednesday night the River Mersey rose and plunged thousands of residents into new depths of stress and confusion, coming just centimetres from breaching flood defences. And while the defences worked as they should - preventing homes from being deluged - the alert caused widespread bewilderment as residents now accustomed to stay-at-home messaging were suddenly ordered to leave. As the night wore on the driving rain turned to thick snow, coating the streets in white and adding an even more surreal backdrop to the drama.

Buyers travelling 'hundreds of miles' to see homesEstate agents call for tougher measures - as buyers race to beat the end of the stamp duty holiday.,"House hunters are taking advantage of lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say. In-person viewings are allowed in England, but estate agents have raised concerns about their safety and say some buyers are travelling across the country to look at second homes. Firms have said they are also currently facing increased demand before the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March. The government said the housing market is ""a key part of our economy"". It has said the housing market in England will remain open during the national lockdown - but advises that initial viewings should be done virtually ""wherever possible"". What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? Are we going out more than the first lockdown? Stamp duty holiday - when does it end? But firms say many buyers don't want virtual appointments. And many companies report increased demand as buyers rush to beat the end of thestamp duty holiday - applied on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland. One estate agent who works in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said she knows colleagues who are ""ready for a complete nervous breakdown"" because they are being asked to book more in-person viewings and valuations. She said people are travelling hundreds of miles to view properties ""because they can"" and some often ""don't social distance"" when they get there. She said many virtual slots go unused because ""people want physical viewings"". ""I was in one the other day and there's a three-year-old that comes and sits next to meâ¦ bringing me a doll. How can you say 'back off?' You can't,"" she said. ""I just think it's bonkers. I want to earn money, I want to earn commission, but not under these circumstances,"" she added. Roly Matthews says the government faces a ""balancing act"" regarding estate agents Paul Le Bas, regional director of a family-run estate agency in Hayle, Cornwall, said he would like the government to ask people not to travel to estate agents outside their local areas for non-essential purposes. He said he turned down one person who wanted to travel about 400 miles from Bradford to look at a potential second home. ""We've taken the view as an agency that if it's just for a second home we don't deem that as essential travel, you can do that when lockdown's been lifted,"" he added. ""We weren't prepared to put ourselves at risk or our clients at risk. They got a bit shirty with us."" Roly Matthews, director of an independent agency in Elmbridge, Surrey, said most of his clients want in-person viewings and estate agents have had to ""feel their way a bit as to what they think is essential or not"". He knows some agencies are not screening their clients, giving members of the public ""a mixed signal"" and said the government would be ""sensible"" to consider further restrictions. The government says people are allowed to view properties,externalduring the lockdown in England. It encourages buyers to do their initial property searches online and advises that initial viewings should be done virtually wherever possible. For viewings taking place in person, the government says these should be arranged by appointment only and ""open house"" viewings should not take place. It advises people who are viewing properties in person to wear a face mask, avoid touching surfaces wherever possible, wash their hands regularly and/or use hand sanitiser. The government says people should also observe social distancing and stay two metres apart where possible. It does not specify how far prospective buyers can travel to view a property. Mark Hayward, chief policy advisor at NAEA (National Agency of Estate Agents) Propertymark, said estate agents are under additional pressure to complete deals with the stamp duty deadline approaching. ""We've seen levels of sales on a monthly basis not seen since 2004,"" he said. ""We know the volume of sales that has to go through to qualify for that stamp duty holiday is large."" He urged estate agents to follow NAEA guidelines for house viewings, such as sanitising surfaces and limiting time in the property. The organisation also recommends people seeking to view property ""must be in a position to proceed"". ""In other words, they've either got cash or they've sold their own property so they're not having to go and put the house on the market and create huge delays."" Last week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to house viewings when heraised concerns that England's lockdownmay not be tough enough. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the housing market has been allowed to remain open as it creates ""jobs as well as homes"". ""But all parties involved must continue to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus, by following our guidance to be Covid secure,"" a spokesman said. A petition calling for the stamp duty holiday to be extended by six months has gained over 115,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament.

LiveLiveLeaders look to fresh start with US under Biden1 minute ago,"Newly elected US President Joe Biden warned US Covid deaths ""will likely exceed"" 500,000 by next month In his first full day in office, Mr Biden signed a raft of executive orders to tackle the pandemic These include mandatory mask-wearing at airports and some public transport, accelerating vaccinations and increased testing President Biden has already reversed a number of Trump policies - including scrapping plans for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline He is returning the US to the Paris climate accord and restoring ties to the World Health Organization Many world leaders welcomed the new presidency, hoping for a reset in relations after four turbulent years under Donald Trump New figures on jobless claims contain a stark warning on the challenges facing the economy Edited by Jude Sheerin Thank you for joining our live coverage of President Joe Biden's first full day in office. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Thefull statement,externalon the festival website read: ""In spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the Festival happen this year. We are so sorry to let you all down."" It confirmed that as with last year, anyone with a ticket will now be offered the opportunity to roll their Â£50 deposit over to next year, when the festival will hopefully resume. It had been due to take place in June 2021. ""We are very appreciative of the faith and trust placed in us by those of you with deposits, and we are very confident we can deliver something really special for us all in 2022!"" Culture SecretaryOliver Dowden shared his ""disappointment"",externalat the lack of a Glastonbury 2021, on Twitter. ""This regrettable but understandable decision is recognition that public health comes first"" he posted, ""and that right now, getting 200k fans together in just a few months looks very difficult to make safe"". He added: ""We continue to help the arts on recovery, including looking at problems around getting insurance. I'm Glastonbury will be back bigger and better next year."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said news of this year's cancellation was ""devastating"". Sir Paul McCartney headlined Glastonbury in 2004, and was supposed to do so again in 2020 ""We have repeatedly called for ministers to act to protect our world-renowned festivals like this one with a government-backed insurance scheme. Our plea fell on deaf ears and now the chickens have come home to roost,"" he said. ""The jewel in the crown will be absent but surely the government cannot ignore the message any longer - it must act now to save this vibrant and vital festivals sector."" On 5 January the governmentresponded to a report by UK Music called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running. The government said: ""We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it. ""Our Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than Â£1bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock."" Last year's 50th anniversary Glastonbury was meant to be headlined by Sir Paul McCartney, Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar, but it wascancelled during the initial national lockdown in March 2020. Michael and Emily Eavis previously said that Glastonbury ""lost millions"" after cancelling in 2020 Last month, organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC she hoped this year's festival could go ahead, despite the ""huge uncertainty"" surrounding live music in the pandemic. ""We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare,"" she told the BBC, ""but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead.""

But that scenario is unlikely ""as long as we can make a firm call either way in advance"", Eavis clarified to the BBC. No line-up details had been confirmed for 2021.

'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat'Shoppers buying items from Europe now have to pay customs or VAT charges on those above a certain value.Business,"""I had no idea at all I was going to be charged any more for deliveries after Brexit. The extra costs were definitely a bit of a shock."" Ellie Huddleston, a 26-year-old Londoner, thought she would treat herself to some new work clothes in the January sales. Having spotted a bargain, she placed an order for a coat and a number of blouses from two of her favourite clothes brands based in Europe. But both deliveries were delayed, held up in customs checks for at least a week, she says. She was surprised when she then received a text from courier company DPD, containing a link asking her to pay Â£58 in customs duties, VAT and additional charges for her Â£180 order. On top of that, the UPS courier for the second parcel showed up at her door several days later, asking for an extra payment of Â£82 for her Â£200 coat. These charges, imposed by new government rules, have to be collected by the courier firms on the authorities' behalf. ""I didn't even know when the parcels would be coming - so I sent both back without paying the extra fees and won't be ordering anything from Europe again any time soon,"" Ellie says. Ellie bought the white coat on sale When the UK was part of the European Union's customs union, goods could move freely between the country and other member states without import taxes being charged. But Ellie was one of the shoppers caught unaware of the fact that those rules have changed since the UK's official exit. EU retailers sending packages to the UK now need to fill out customs declaration forms. Shoppers may also have to pay customs or VAT charges, depending on the value of the product and where it came from. However, customs charges are the responsibility of the customer, not the retailer, who often has no idea of how much the eventual extra cost might be. They cannot be paid in advance and are levied only when the item reaches the UK. EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries German freight giant pauses UK deliveries Five surprising consequences of Brexit Another unhappy customer, Graeme from Manchester, paid Â£300 to buy two pairs of suede winter boots from a German firm online. ""You couldn't get them anywhere in the UK, so I had no choice but to order them from Europe,"" he told the BBC. The next thing he knew, courier UPS had sent him a text message saying he had to pay Â£147 extra before the boots could be delivered. He paid up, but is still waiting for the goods to arrive. ""It was virtually impossible to find out what the charges would be beforehand,"" he says, ""so I had to take a shot in the dark. ""I didn't imagine that it would be half as much again."" Courier companies are adding charges to some deliveries from the EU Under the new rules, anyone in the UK receiving a gift from the EU worth more than Â£39 may now face a bill for import VAT - with many items charged at 20%. For goods costing more than Â£135, customs duties may also apply, which can range from 0% to 25% of the product you're buying if they have not been paid by the sender already. The extra charges are usually collected by the courier on behalf of the government, with customers asked to pay before they can pick up their package. Some specialist European retailers, such as bicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits andBelgium-based Beer On Web, recently saidthat they would stop all deliveries to the UK because of the VAT changes, which came into force on 1 January. Some firms have started charging additional ""handling fees"" to shoppers to cover costs associated with extra customs checks and paperwork that must be filled out. Royal Mail, for example, is charging an Â£8 fee it says ""reflects the cost of clearing items through customs and presenting them to Border Force"". Meanwhile, delivery firm DHL says it is charging UK customers 2.5% of the amount paid to clear customs, with a minimum charge of Â£11. Mail and freight company TNT is also adding Â£4.31,externalon all shipments from the UK to the EU and vice versa. It has said this reflects the increased investment it has had to make in adjusting its systems to cope with Brexit. A spokeswoman for Logistics UK told the BBC that the handling fees were ""a commercial decision by individual businesses"". But Michelle Dale, senior manager at accountants UHY Hacker Young, said that new charges could present a major problem for firms in the coming weeks. ""I think what we'll find is that a lot of trade with the EU from a business-to-customer perspective will come to a stop until some of these rules are eased,"" she said. UK consumers' rights when buying online, or receiving gifts, from the EU are now more complicated and could lead to disputes. VAT, customs duties and handling fees may all need to be paid. They could be applied before delivery. Many people may find they need to visit the post office to pay all the relevant charges before the item is released Under the Consumer Rights Act, online shoppers have 14 days to return an unwanted item, but they may find it costs them money to send it back Disputes are likely to arise if buyers think the extra charges are a ""hidden cost"" that they were unaware of, and feel they should not pay. Now the UK has left the EU, this dispute can no longer be settled in UK courts. It falls under the jurisdiction of the country where the seller is located To avoid losing UK consumers' trade, some overseas sellers in other parts of the world have introduced a rebate scheme to refund some of the charges post-delivery Meanwhile, any parcels or gifts sent from England, Wales or Scotland to the EU must have one of a variety of customs forms stuck to it A government spokesperson said: ""The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. ""The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT when they sell goods in the UK. We anticipate this will bring in Â£300m in tax every year, to fund essential UK public services."" There is speculation the rules may change, but until they do, Ellie says she won't be buying from European firms. ""With all that uncertainty around things and whether or not these charges might change, I'd rather just avoid the hassle,"" she says.

pandemic. Before we go, hereâs a round-up of todayâs main headlines:  Updates today were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Francesca Gillett, Georgina Rannard, Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright and Lucy Webster. Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best.

Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best.

Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Buyers travelling 'hundreds of miles' to see homes,"House hunters are taking advantage of lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say. In-person viewings are allowed in England, but estate agents have raised concerns about their safety and say some buyers are travelling across the country to look at second homes. Firms have said they are also currently facing increased demand before the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March. The government said the housing market is ""a key part of our economy"". It has said the housing market in England will remain open during the national lockdown - but advises that initial viewings should be done virtually ""wherever possible"". What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? Are we going out more than the first lockdown? Stamp duty holiday - when does it end? But firms say many buyers don't want virtual appointments. And many companies report increased demand as buyers rush to beat the end of thestamp duty holiday - applied on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland. One estate agent who works in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said she knows colleagues who are ""ready for a complete nervous breakdown"" because they are being asked to book more in-person viewings and valuations. She said people are travelling hundreds of miles to view properties ""because they can"" and some often ""don't social distance"" when they get there. She said many virtual slots go unused because ""people want physical viewings"". ""I was in one the other day and there's a three-year-old that comes and sits next to meâ¦ bringing me a doll. How can you say 'back off?' You can't,"" she said. ""I just think it's bonkers. I want to earn money, I want to earn commission, but not under these circumstances,"" she added. Roly Matthews says the government faces a ""balancing act"" regarding estate agents Paul Le Bas, regional director of a family-run estate agency in Hayle, Cornwall, said he would like the government to ask people not to travel to estate agents outside their local areas for non-essential purposes. He said he turned down one person who wanted to travel about 400 miles from Bradford to look at a potential second home. ""We've taken the view as an agency that if it's just for a second home we don't deem that as essential travel, you can do that when lockdown's been lifted,"" he added. ""We weren't prepared to put ourselves at risk or our clients at risk. They got a bit shirty with us."" Roly Matthews, director of an independent agency in Elmbridge, Surrey, said most of his clients want in-person viewings and estate agents have had to ""feel their way a bit as to what they think is essential or not"". He knows some agencies are not screening their clients, giving members of the public ""a mixed signal"" and said the government would be ""sensible"" to consider further restrictions. The government says people are allowed to view properties,externalduring the lockdown in England. It encourages buyers to do their initial property searches online and advises that initial viewings should be done virtually wherever possible. For viewings taking place in person, the government says these should be arranged by appointment only and ""open house"" viewings should not take place. It advises people who are viewing properties in person to wear a face mask, avoid touching surfaces wherever possible, wash their hands regularly and/or use hand sanitiser. The government says people should also observe social distancing and stay two metres apart where possible. It does not specify how far prospective buyers can travel to view a property. Mark Hayward, chief policy advisor at NAEA (National Agency of Estate Agents) Propertymark, said estate agents are under additional pressure to complete deals with the stamp duty deadline approaching. ""We've seen levels of sales on a monthly basis not seen since 2004,"" he said. ""We know the volume of sales that has to go through to qualify for that stamp duty holiday is large."" He urged estate agents to follow NAEA guidelines for house viewings, such as sanitising surfaces and limiting time in the property. The organisation also recommends people seeking to view property ""must be in a position to proceed"". ""In other words, they've either got cash or they've sold their own property so they're not having to go and put the house on the market and create huge delays."" Last week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to house viewings when heraised concerns that England's lockdownmay not be tough enough. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the housing market has been allowed to remain open as it creates ""jobs as well as homes"". ""But all parties involved must continue to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus, by following our guidance to be Covid secure,"" a spokesman said. A petition calling for the stamp duty holiday to be extended by six months has gained over 115,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament.

'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat'Shoppers buying items from Europe now have to pay customs or VAT charges on those above a certain value.,"""I had no idea at all I was going to be charged any more for deliveries after Brexit. The extra costs were definitely a bit of a shock."" Ellie Huddleston, a 26-year-old Londoner, thought she would treat herself to some new work clothes in the January sales. Having spotted a bargain, she placed an order for a coat and a number of blouses from two of her favourite clothes brands based in Europe. But both deliveries were delayed, held up in customs checks for at least a week, she says. She was surprised when she then received a text from courier company DPD, containing a link asking her to pay Â£58 in customs duties, VAT and additional charges for her Â£180 order. On top of that, the UPS courier for the second parcel showed up at her door several days later, asking for an extra payment of Â£82 for her Â£200 coat. These charges, imposed by new government rules, have to be collected by the courier firms on the authorities' behalf. ""I didn't even know when the parcels would be coming - so I sent both back without paying the extra fees and won't be ordering anything from Europe again any time soon,"" Ellie says. Ellie bought the white coat on sale When the UK was part of the European Union's customs union, goods could move freely between the country and other member states without import taxes being charged. But Ellie was one of the shoppers caught unaware of the fact that those rules have changed since the UK's official exit. EU retailers sending packages to the UK now need to fill out customs declaration forms. Shoppers may also have to pay customs or VAT charges, depending on the value of the product and where it came from. However, customs charges are the responsibility of the customer, not the retailer, who often has no idea of how much the eventual extra cost might be. They cannot be paid in advance and are levied only when the item reaches the UK. EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries German freight giant pauses UK deliveries Five surprising consequences of Brexit Another unhappy customer, Graeme from Manchester, paid Â£300 to buy two pairs of suede winter boots from a German firm online. ""You couldn't get them anywhere in the UK, so I had no choice but to order them from Europe,"" he told the BBC. The next thing he knew, courier UPS had sent him a text message saying he had to pay Â£147 extra before the boots could be delivered. He paid up, but is still waiting for the goods to arrive. ""It was virtually impossible to find out what the charges would be beforehand,"" he says, ""so I had to take a shot in the dark. ""I didn't imagine that it would be half as much again."" Courier companies are adding charges to some deliveries from the EU Under the new rules, anyone in the UK receiving a gift from the EU worth more than Â£39 may now face a bill for import VAT - with many items charged at 20%. For goods costing more than Â£135, customs duties may also apply, which can range from 0% to 25% of the product you're buying if they have not been paid by the sender already. The extra charges are usually collected by the courier on behalf of the government, with customers asked to pay before they can pick up their package. Some specialist European retailers, such as bicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits andBelgium-based Beer On Web, recently saidthat they would stop all deliveries to the UK because of the VAT changes, which came into force on 1 January. Some firms have started charging additional ""handling fees"" to shoppers to cover costs associated with extra customs checks and paperwork that must be filled out. Royal Mail, for example, is charging an Â£8 fee it says ""reflects the cost of clearing items through customs and presenting them to Border Force"". Meanwhile, delivery firm DHL says it is charging UK customers 2.5% of the amount paid to clear customs, with a minimum charge of Â£11. Mail and freight company TNT is also adding Â£4.31,externalon all shipments from the UK to the EU and vice versa. It has said this reflects the increased investment it has had to make in adjusting its systems to cope with Brexit. A spokeswoman for Logistics UK told the BBC that the handling fees were ""a commercial decision by individual businesses"". But Michelle Dale, senior manager at accountants UHY Hacker Young, said that new charges could present a major problem for firms in the coming weeks. ""I think what we'll find is that a lot of trade with the EU from a business-to-customer perspective will come to a stop until some of these rules are eased,"" she said. UK consumers' rights when buying online, or receiving gifts, from the EU are now more complicated and could lead to disputes. VAT, customs duties and handling fees may all need to be paid. They could be applied before delivery. Many people may find they need to visit the post office to pay all the relevant charges before the item is released Under the Consumer Rights Act, online shoppers have 14 days to return an unwanted item, but they may find it costs them money to send it back Disputes are likely to arise if buyers think the extra charges are a ""hidden cost"" that they were unaware of, and feel they should not pay. Now the UK has left the EU, this dispute can no longer be settled in UK courts. It falls under the jurisdiction of the country where the seller is located To avoid losing UK consumers' trade, some overseas sellers in other parts of the world have introduced a rebate scheme to refund some of the charges post-delivery Meanwhile, any parcels or gifts sent from England, Wales or Scotland to the EU must have one of a variety of customs forms stuck to it A government spokesperson said: ""The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. ""The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT when they sell goods in the UK. We anticipate this will bring in Â£300m in tax every year, to fund essential UK public services."" There is speculation the rules may change, but until they do, Ellie says she won't be buying from European firms. ""With all that uncertainty around things and whether or not these charges might change, I'd rather just avoid the hassle,"" she says.

Nearly 2m people in UK had Covid vaccine last week,"Sheila Evans was among those to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at the Al Abbas Mosque in Birmingham Nearly two million people in the UK have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine in the past week, government figures show. By the end of Tuesday 4.61 million people had received their initial jab, up from 2.64 million the week before. Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We're giving 200 vaccinations every minute"". But Boris Johnson warned there were ""unquestionably going to be a tough few weeks"" while the vaccine was rolled out and urged people to observe lockdown. Speaking during a visit to flood-hit Didsbury in Manchester, the prime minister said it was still ""too early"" to say when some lockdown restrictions could be lifted in England. He said figures from an Imperial College London survey showed the new variant of the virus to be ""not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great"". Thestudy suggests there was a rise in infections in the communityat the start of the latest lockdown in England. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Religious beliefs causing 'real fear' over vaccine Meanwhile, NHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week. The UK recorded another all-time high of daily coronavirus deaths on Wednesday. A further 1,820 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test,according to government figures,external- taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 93,290. Sixty-five new vaccination centres have opened in England, including a mosque in Birmingham and a cinema in Aylesbury. Two million jabs a week are needed for the government to achieve its target of offering a vaccine to all over 70s, the extremely clinical vulnerable and health and care workers by mid-February. Giving a statement in the Commons, Health Secretary Mr Hancock said the country had an ""immense infrastructure in place that, day by day, is protecting the vulnerable and giving hope to us all"". Describing this as a ""huge feat"", he said the government was making ""good progress"" towards its target. Asked about difficulties in getting vaccines to rural areas and whether the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be prioritised for these as it is easier to store, Mr Hancock said the challenge was that supply was ""lumpy"", with manufacturers working ""as fast as possible"". Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said new variants of the virus showed vaccination needed to go ""further and faster"". He asked if there was a contingency plan in place in case vaccines needed to be redesigned to contain mutations. Mr Hancock said the early indications were that the new variant was dealt with by the vaccine ""just as much as the old variant"". He also said 63% of residents in elderly care homes had now received a vaccine. Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is now chairman of the Common's Health Select Committee, asked about establishing ""quarantine hotels"" to combat new strains, as well as whether there should be further restrictions on household mixing outside bubbles and mandating FFP2 masks in shops and on public transport. Mr Hancock said the clinical advice was that the current guidelines on personal protective equipment (PPE) were ""right and appropriate"" and said ""very significant measures"" had beenbrought in for international travel. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? InNorthern Irelandmore than 160,000 people have received a first vaccine dose, while in Wales, where more than 175,000 people have received a jab, people waiting for theirs have been urged to show""patience"" and ""perspective"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insistedher country's vaccine programme was not lagging behind, during First Minister's Questions on Wednesday. In England the rollout of the vaccine started with people aged 80 and over. In some regions where the majority of these have been vaccinated, the programmes are now moving on to the over 70s. Home Secretary Priri Patel, who will lead a Downing Street press conference later, said ministers wereworking to ensure police and other front-line workers are moved up the priority list, while Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told BBC Breakfast he hoped teachers and support staff could be moved up the list. Meanwhile, pumps and sandbags were brought in toprotect supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from the risk of flood waterat a warehouse in Wrexham, north-east Wales. Young people in Wales have beenasked to share their experiences of the pandemicin a survey by the nation's Children's Commissioner.

'I was asked to pay an extra Â£82 for my Â£200 coat',"""I had no idea at all I was going to be charged any more for deliveries after Brexit. The extra costs were definitely a bit of a shock."" Ellie Huddleston, a 26-year-old Londoner, thought she would treat herself to some new work clothes in the January sales. Having spotted a bargain, she placed an order for a coat and a number of blouses from two of her favourite clothes brands based in Europe. But both deliveries were delayed, held up in customs checks for at least a week, she says. She was surprised when she then received a text from courier company DPD, containing a link asking her to pay Â£58 in customs duties, VAT and additional charges for her Â£180 order. On top of that, the UPS courier for the second parcel showed up at her door several days later, asking for an extra payment of Â£82 for her Â£200 coat. These charges, imposed by new government rules, have to be collected by the courier firms on the authorities' behalf. ""I didn't even know when the parcels would be coming - so I sent both back without paying the extra fees and won't be ordering anything from Europe again any time soon,"" Ellie says. Ellie bought the white coat on sale When the UK was part of the European Union's customs union, goods could move freely between the country and other member states without import taxes being charged. But Ellie was one of the shoppers caught unaware of the fact that those rules have changed since the UK's official exit. EU retailers sending packages to the UK now need to fill out customs declaration forms. Shoppers may also have to pay customs or VAT charges, depending on the value of the product and where it came from. However, customs charges are the responsibility of the customer, not the retailer, who often has no idea of how much the eventual extra cost might be. They cannot be paid in advance and are levied only when the item reaches the UK. EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries German freight giant pauses UK deliveries Five surprising consequences of Brexit Another unhappy customer, Graeme from Manchester, paid Â£300 to buy two pairs of suede winter boots from a German firm online. ""You couldn't get them anywhere in the UK, so I had no choice but to order them from Europe,"" he told the BBC. The next thing he knew, courier UPS had sent him a text message saying he had to pay Â£147 extra before the boots could be delivered. He paid up, but is still waiting for the goods to arrive. ""It was virtually impossible to find out what the charges would be beforehand,"" he says, ""so I had to take a shot in the dark. ""I didn't imagine that it would be half as much again."" Courier companies are adding charges to some deliveries from the EU Under the new rules, anyone in the UK receiving a gift from the EU worth more than Â£39 may now face a bill for import VAT - with many items charged at 20%. For goods costing more than Â£135, customs duties may also apply, which can range from 0% to 25% of the product you're buying if they have not been paid by the sender already. The extra charges are usually collected by the courier on behalf of the government, with customers asked to pay before they can pick up their package. Some specialist European retailers, such as bicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits andBelgium-based Beer On Web, recently saidthat they would stop all deliveries to the UK because of the VAT changes, which came into force on 1 January. Some firms have started charging additional ""handling fees"" to shoppers to cover costs associated with extra customs checks and paperwork that must be filled out. Royal Mail, for example, is charging an Â£8 fee it says ""reflects the cost of clearing items through customs and presenting them to Border Force"". Meanwhile, delivery firm DHL says it is charging UK customers 2.5% of the amount paid to clear customs, with a minimum charge of Â£11. Mail and freight company TNT is also adding Â£4.31,externalon all shipments from the UK to the EU and vice versa. It has said this reflects the increased investment it has had to make in adjusting its systems to cope with Brexit. A spokeswoman for Logistics UK told the BBC that the handling fees were ""a commercial decision by individual businesses"". But Michelle Dale, senior manager at accountants UHY Hacker Young, said that new charges could present a major problem for firms in the coming weeks. ""I think what we'll find is that a lot of trade with the EU from a business-to-customer perspective will come to a stop until some of these rules are eased,"" she said. UK consumers' rights when buying online, or receiving gifts, from the EU are now more complicated and could lead to disputes. VAT, customs duties and handling fees may all need to be paid. They could be applied before delivery. Many people may find they need to visit the post office to pay all the relevant charges before the item is released Under the Consumer Rights Act, online shoppers have 14 days to return an unwanted item, but they may find it costs them money to send it back Disputes are likely to arise if buyers think the extra charges are a ""hidden cost"" that they were unaware of, and feel they should not pay. Now the UK has left the EU, this dispute can no longer be settled in UK courts. It falls under the jurisdiction of the country where the seller is located To avoid losing UK consumers' trade, some overseas sellers in other parts of the world have introduced a rebate scheme to refund some of the charges post-delivery Meanwhile, any parcels or gifts sent from England, Wales or Scotland to the EU must have one of a variety of customs forms stuck to it A government spokesperson said: ""The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. ""The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT when they sell goods in the UK. We anticipate this will bring in Â£300m in tax every year, to fund essential UK public services."" There is speculation the rules may change, but until they do, Ellie says she won't be buying from European firms. ""With all that uncertainty around things and whether or not these charges might change, I'd rather just avoid the hassle,"" she says.

No more 'easy wins' at Scotland's biggest hospitalMedics at Glasgow's QEUH are seeing the effects of people delaying healthcare during lockdown.Glasgow & West Scotland,"The emergency department at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the biggest and busiest in Scotland. Ambulances keep arriving, bringing more patients. In a curtained cubicle, one man is explaining to the doctor that he's been in pain for days, but he put off coming in ""because of everything that's going on"". Dr Alan Whitelaw, who runs the department, says that while there might be fewer patients coming through his door, there are no longer any ""easy wins"". ""Those that are coming are the sick people,"" he says. ""We are undoubtedly seeing the effects of people not seeking healthcare for six to 10 months. ICU staff are 'physically and emotionally' drained Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Scotland's excess deaths hit 129-year high ""We are seeing disease that we wouldn't always see and we are seeing it further down the road. ""We are making more diagnoses that potentially would be made in primary care or outpatient clinics.  On top of that we've got lots of Covid patients coming through the door. ""So it is those two things together that currently put the NHS under that significant pressure."" All over Scotland, hospitals are under severe pressure, with some treating significantly more coronavirus patients than they did during the first wave of the pandemic. Public visitors are not allowed at the QEUH, but BBC Scotland was given special permission to film to highlight the impact of Covid and the importance of following lockdown rules. On the day of the BBC's visit, there are 244 Covid patients. Critical care is running at capacity, and across the whole hospital it's a constant challenge to find space for new patients. Dr Whitelaw says the level of unpredictability is extreme. His team has run out of spare beds. ""We are ten months into strange and difficult times. It's winter, no-one's had a holiday, no-one's had much downtime. ""Hospitals are fuller in winter, beds are tighter and patients are sick"". Upstairs, one ward that previously treated patients with infectious diseases like flu or norovirus, is now a Covid ward. All 28 beds are full. Some patients here are recently diagnosed, others are coming to the end of their isolation, while some have been stepped down from critical care, but need rehabilitation. Senior charge nurse Karen Paton says it feels like patients are now sicker for longer. ""We've had this going on for more or less a year now and staff are beginning to feel the emotional distress of it,"" she says. ""Having to deal with patients succumbing to coronavirus, and just having the emotions of all the patients not being able to have contact from their families. ""I think it's beginning to take its toll on everybody."" Covid patient Gerry Gilroy says QEUH staff have been ""superb"" In one room on the ward is Gerry Gilroy, who tested positive for Covid in late December. By 8 January, the day of his 66th birthday, he could barely get out of bed and couldn't eat. ""It just hit me and I knew there was something not right,"" he says. ""I know how serious it is. I never thought it would hit me. It's been a bit of an experience but thankfully I'm on the mend. ""The staff here are superb. When I get out of here, if I can do something for the NHS I'm going to. Doctors, cleaners, nurses, all top drawer."" The impact of Covid is being felt across the hospital. The acute receiving area used to be the first stop for people who needed urgent surgery. Now it's where medics like Dr Colin Perry assess Covid patients sent in by their GP or NHS 24. It's another area that's full. ""In the first wave our ICU was busy and it remains very busy, but during that period we had free beds,"" says Dr Perry. ""This time we have much more pressure on the downstream ward areas, so it is harder to manage the wider needs of the hospital and make room for patients to move through the system. ""The numbers are far higher than they were a year ago."" Repurposing so many wards to treat coronavirus patients has meant some routine work had to be postponed, but staff are working to prioritise all different kinds of treatment. Helen Dorrance is a senior surgeon who specialises in bowel cancer at the QEUH. On the day the BBC visits she is operating on patients from another hospital to help relieve pressures there. Demand for critical care makes it difficult to operate some services, but cancer treatment is still running. ""We work together as a team across the region to make sure people who are the highest priority get dealt with,"" she says. ""But everyone gets their fair share and access to the care they need. ""It's not a choice, we do have to provide the best care we can for Covid patients and my critical care colleagues are stepping up to the mark. ""But the rest of us are making sure the rest of the service runs the way it should, so if you have your heart attack or stroke the right people are there to give you the best care."" Coming to hospital for any reason during the pandemic is a different experience, and services are stretched. But the emergency department's Dr Whitelaw adds that no matter what happens, they will cope. ""We don't come to work to worry or be fearful, we come to work to do our best and to help,"" he says. ""I think there's an uncertainty about what the next two to three weeks look like. ""It might be very, very challenging but I have absolute faith that the staff here will continue to do everything that is required. ""I think the public should be reassured that no matter what is thrown at us we will definitely get through it."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Glastonbury Festival 2021 axed due to coronavirusThe Worthy Farm event has been scrapped for a second year running due to the global pandemic.Entertainment & Arts,"Glastonbury Festival-goers depart Worthy Farm in 2019 Glastonbury Festival has been cancelled for a second year running due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The news was announced on Thursday on the Worthy Farm event's Twitter page. ""With great regret, we must announce that this year's Glastonbury Festival will not take place,"" said festival organisers Michael and Emily Eavis. ""And that this will be another enforced fallow year for us. Tickets for this year will roll over to next year. Michael & Emily."" Allow Twitter content?

It comes in the same week that the future of UK music was up for debate at aDCMS inquiry into streaming, and in Parliament regardingpost-Brexit music touringvisas. Thefull statement,externalon the festival website read: ""In spite of our efforts to move heaven and earth, it has become clear that we simply will not be able to make the Festival happen this year. We are so sorry to let you all down."" It confirmed that as with last year, anyone with a ticket will now be offered the opportunity to roll their Â£50 deposit over to next year, when the festival will hopefully resume. It had been due to take place in June 2021. ""We are very appreciative of the faith and trust placed in us by those of you with deposits, and we are very confident we can deliver something really special for us all in 2022!"" Culture SecretaryOliver Dowden shared his ""disappointment"",externalat the lack of a Glastonbury 2021, on Twitter. ""This regrettable but understandable decision is recognition that public health comes first"" he posted, ""and that right now, getting 200k fans together in just a few months looks very difficult to make safe"". He added: ""We continue to help the arts on recovery, including looking at problems around getting insurance. I'm Glastonbury will be back bigger and better next year."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, said news of this year's cancellation was ""devastating"". Sir Paul McCartney headlined Glastonbury in 2004, and was supposed to do so again in 2020 ""We have repeatedly called for ministers to act to protect our world-renowned festivals like this one with a government-backed insurance scheme.

On 5 January the governmentresponded to a report by UK Music called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running. The government said: ""We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it. ""Our Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than Â£1bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock.""

""We're doing everything we can on our end to plan and prepare,"" she told the BBC, ""but I think we're still quite a long way from being able to say we're confident 2021 will go ahead."" Festival season is 'still possible' in 2021 Sir Paul: Glastonbury would be a 'superspreader' Eavis said Glastonbury lost ""millions"" in 2020. Her father, Michael, has previously warned the festival ""would seriously go bankrupt"" if they had to cancel again next year. But that scenario is unlikely ""as long as we can make a firm call either way in advance"", Eavis clarified to the BBC. No line-up details had been confirmed for 2021. But just before Christmas,Sir Paul McCartney told the BBCthe event was not in his calendar, as it would be a ""superspreader"". At the start of January, MPs were told that some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month. The festival normally welcomes 200,000 people to Pilton in Somerset every year Events are ""rapidly approaching the determination point"", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals. Organisers will be in ""absolutely dire straits"" financially if the season is cancelled, added Anna Wade, of Winchester's Boomtown Fair.

Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Young people asked how pandemic has affected themA survey is launched by the children's commissioner for Wales to help assess the impact on them.,"This video can not be played While some young people have found it hard at times, others have learnt new skills Young people have been asked to share their experiences of how they have coped during the coronavirus pandemic. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said her national survey was important because sometimes views of younger people can be ""surprising"". She said the information provided would also help inform the Welsh Government ahead of some tough decisions it will need to make in the future. A similar survey was carried out in the first lockdown last year. A recent Prince's Trust Youth Index survey asked young people across the UK about their thoughts and feelings towards the pandemic. Networks 'should give data to Wales' children' Children 'worried' about education in pandemic More than 2,000 responded including 200 from Wales. It found 63% of 16 to 25-year-olds said the pandemic had left them ""always"" or ""often"" feeling anxious - 64% said they were feeling like they were ""missing out on being young"". BBC Wales spoke to a number of children and young people about their thoughts on a variety of issues including home schooling, loneliness and finding out what they are doing to stay positive. Angel has been learning sign language Angel, 16, from Cardiff, is studying for her GCSEs. ""I've just been confused a lot of the time. All the information out there and it's really hard to process and get to a point where you're in a mindset where you know what's happening. ""There's such a high level of uncertainty you're constantly worried or actually doubting what's going to happen next. ""When you have goals for the future it's something to help you get through this but when you're in the circumstances we're in now, it's really hard to find the motivation and a purpose for what you're doing now."" To try and stay positive Angel has been trying to get out for walks during her school breaks or watch Netflix. She said she has also tried to learn some sign-language during lockdown and attempted yoga. Emrys and Clara have been learning home skills Emrys, 11, from Bridgend, said he misses not having the structure of a school day and seeing his friends. He added: ""I'm a social person. I have friends, I chat with them, I play with them, and it's hard not being with my friends but I mean the family will have to do."" He and his six-year-old sister, Clara, have enjoyed going for walks with their parents and have been learning some new skills including washing dishes, cooking dinner and baking cakes. Meanwhile, 11-year-old Sophie has found it difficult to not get bored during long periods of time in the house. ""I'd say I cope OK with it at some points, but then not okay with it at other points,"" she added. Sophie said it can be hard sometimes to find things to do Alicia is studying for her A-levels and has friends who have dropped out of their studies this year because of the stress and anxiety caused by the uncertainty about exams and their futures. The 17-year-old also said it was ""heart-breaking"" not being able to see many of her close friends for almost a year. She added: ""My thoughts are, it's less of a luxury now, I need to be able to go out to see them and to work."" LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs Before the pandemic, Sarah, 16, from Swansea enjoyed going to her local youth club and took part in a local drama group but it how now moved online, giving a different experience. ""It's quite sad because I used to enjoy being able to do those things whenever it was on, but I think I'm getting used to do everything online,"" she said. As a person who does not cope very well with not knowing what will happen next, the pandemic has caused anxiety at times for Sarah. ""I am finding it quite scary but hopefully things will change and I'll be able to go back soon,"" she said. ""I think if you're really struggling with something, talking really helps so it would be nice to see people in person."" Children's commissioner Sally Holland conducted a survey of pupils in Wales during the first lockdown Children's helpline MEIC Cymru said it had seen a 10% increase in the number of calls from young people, parents, and carers during the pandemic compared with previous years. Stephanie Hoffman, Head of Social Action at Promo Cymru, the charity which runs the helpline, said: ""We're seeing what I'd say are many more substantive contacts, so a lot more contact dealing with really serious issues to do with social well-being, mental health and relationships, as opposed to what we might have seen more of in the past. ""Now we're dealing with situations which can be quite complicated."" Of the survey, Ms Holland said: ""We've heard a lot from adults showing concern for children at the moment, such as parents, carers and professionals working with children about the potential impact of the lockdown on children. ""Those voices are important to hear, but it's also important we hear directly from children and young people because sometimes they can be surprising."" We know that Covid-19 vaccinations have been on people's minds in Wales - with many wanting to know when they or their loved-ones will receive theirs.

"Biden sets to work on reversing Trump policiesThe new president starts dismantling his predecessor's legacy, signing a series of executive orders.US & Canada","President Biden quickly signed executive actions on coronavirus, climate change and racial inequality US President Joe Biden has begun to undo some of Donald Trump's key policies, hours after being sworn in. In his initial acts as the 46th US president, he signed 15 executive orders - the first to boost the federal response to the coronavirus crisis. Other orders reversed the Trump administration's stance on climate change and immigration. President Biden set to work at the Oval Office having been sworn in earlier on Wednesday at the US Capitol. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What will Joe Biden do first? Kamala Harris becomes first female, first black VP Climate change: Biden's first act sets tone for ambitious approach World leaders hope for 'new beginning' under Biden The inauguration was unlike any other due to coronavirus restrictions, with few present to witness the oaths and ceremonies. Donald Trump - who has still not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the event in a departure from longstanding precedent. This video can not be played President Biden: ""Democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed"" ""There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face,"" President Bidentweeted as he headed,externalto the White House following his inauguration. President Biden ""will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving our country forward,"" a statement detailing his executive orders said. Oncoronavirus, a series of measures will be enacted to tackle the pandemic which has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the US. There will be a mandate to wear masks and practise social distancing on all federal government property. A new office will be set up to co-ordinate the response to the pandemic and the US will halt the process - begun by the Trump administration - of withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO). Mr Biden wants to inoculate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office The move tore-engage with the WHOwas welcomed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said it was ""absolutely critical"" for a more co-ordinated global response, his spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric said. Mr Biden has also pledged to make thefight against climate changea top priority of his administration. He signed an executive order beginning the process of rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement, from which Mr Trump formally withdrew the US last year. Why is the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement? Mr Biden's climate envoy, former US Secretary of State John Kerry, tweeted that the commitment set ""a floor, not a ceiling"" for America's climate leadership and urged international co-operation ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) in Glasgow in November.

Mr Biden has also revoked the presidential permit granted to thecontroversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which environmentalists and Native American groups have fought for more than a decade. The move will be discussed when Mr Biden makes his first phone call to a foreign leader - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The Keystone XL Pipeline project has led to years of protests The privately financed pipeline - estimated to cost about $8bn (Â£5.8bn) - would carry about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from the oil sands of Alberta, in Canada, to Nebraska. Barack Obama vetoed a bill approving construction of the pipeline in 2015 but the decision was overturned by President Trump. Why is the Keystone XL pipeline so disputed? OnimmigrationMr Biden has revoked the Trump administration's emergency declaration that helped fund the building of a wall along the Mexican border and also ended a travel ban on some majority-Muslim countries. Other orders coverraceandgender equality. Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office. Donald Trump had used his executive authority broadly, to advance large swaths of his political agenda, so how - and when - Biden would begin undoing those actions would have particular importance. It didn't take long for the newly inaugurated president to show his hand. He targeted, in particular, some of the most controversial portions of Trump's agenda. The Biden administration also will freeze all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. Executive action is the (relatively) easy part, however. For Biden to make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress to pass legislation on issues like pandemic relief, citizenship for undocumented migrants, healthcare reform and voting-rights protections. He also declined, for now, to take other executive actions, like cancelling student loan debt, lifting Mr Trump's trade restrictions or enacting new criminal justice measures. With Democrats in control in the House of Representatives and Senate, Biden has a window for accomplishments, although it will require surmounting Republican procedural obstacles and keeping his party in line. The president's decades of experience as a legislator could come in useful. Biden calls for unity - it won't be easy At the first news conference of the Biden presidency, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked if her priority was to promote the interests of President Biden, or provide ""the unvarnished truth"". She said she had ""deep respect for the role of a free independent press"" and that she would join the president in bringing ""transparency and truth back to government"". President Trump - and his press secretaries - often had a combative relationship with the media. The White House has a new press secretary - Jen Psaki ""Democracy has prevailed,"" President Biden said after taking the oath of office with Chief Justice John Roberts on stage in front of the US Capitol. Delivering a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" - including those who voted against him. Full transcript of Biden inauguration speech Three of his predecessors attended the ceremony: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence. Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role. This video can not be played Kamala Harris was sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor There was extra-tight security for the ceremony after the US Capitol was stormed by violent pro-Trump protesters on 6 January.

This video can not be played The Hill We Climb: Watch 22-year-old Amanda Gorman's poem reading at Joe Biden's inauguration Who is Amanda Gorman, Biden's inauguration poet? A 90-minute televised evening concert entitled ""Celebrating America"" was staged at the Lincoln Memorial in the city. Hosted by Tom Hanks, it featured Bruce Springsteen, John Legend, Jon Bon Jovi, Justin Timberlake, and Demi Lovato and culminated in a spectacular fireworks display. Mr Trump was the first president not to attend his successor's inauguration since 1869. He left the White House early on Wednesday, and flew to the nearby Andrews Air Force base. This video can not be played Trump leaves the White House for the last time as US president In his farewell address at the base, he highlighted what he regarded as the successes of his presidency. ""What we've done has been amazing by any standard,"" Mr Trump said. The 74-year-old then left for his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida, where he arrived later in the morning. In his last hours as president,Mr Trump granted clemency to more than 140 people,external, including his former adviser Steve Bannon, who had been facing fraud charges. Trump pardons Bannon in final acts of clemency How will history remember Trump? The political drama surrounding Mr Trump is far from over. The US Senate is expected to put him on trial soon, following his record second impeachment by the House of Representatives for allegedly inciting the Capitol riot.

LiveLiveLeaders look to fresh start with US under Biden5 minutes ago,"Newly elected US President Joe Biden warned US Covid deaths ""will likely exceed"" 500,000 by next month In his first full day in office, Mr Biden signed a raft of executive orders to tackle the pandemic These include mandatory mask-wearing at airports and some public transport, accelerating vaccinations and increased testing President Biden has already reversed a number of Trump policies - including scrapping plans for the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline He is returning the US to the Paris climate accord and restoring ties to the World Health Organization Many world leaders welcomed the new presidency, hoping for a reset in relations after four turbulent years under Donald Trump New figures on jobless claims contain a stark warning on the challenges facing the economy Edited by Jude Sheerin Thank you for joining our live coverage of President Joe Biden's first full day in office. Here's a reminder of the day's key developments:  Our writers today were Joshua Nevett, Gary Kitchener, Max Matza, Victoria Bisset and Yaroslav Lukov. The page was edited by Sarah Fowler, Helier Cheung and Marianna Brady. Ben HunteBBC LGBT Correspondent Vice-president Harris speaks at San Francisco's 2019 Gay Pride festival The Biden administration has brought LGBT people into a conversation that they have been intentionally excluded from for the past four years. This is only day two, but there have already been some historic moments. On day one, Biden signed executive orders aiming to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Shortly after Trump's inauguration in 2017, all mentions of LGBT people were removed from the White House website. This time around, the website has become more inclusive than ever before, by asking visitors for their pronouns and offering gender-neutral choices. Biden has also hired a record number of LGBT people into his Democratic administration. For LGBT Americans, and their allies, it will be reassuring that Biden is delivering on his election promises so quickly. Leaders of international LGBT organisations have told me they are ""breathing a sigh of relief"", and they expect these changes will be felt beyond the US. Those at Stonewall, Europe's leading LGBT charity, said they hope that this era will ""set a new tone on the world stage that LGBT rights are not something to be debated, but rather protected and progressed. ""However, with the Democratsâ wafer-thin Senate majority, some LGBT people are cautious about celebrating the future ""too soonâ. Many tell me they are ""worried"" that the Biden administration will not be able to secure enough votes to push through all of their intended LGBT policy changes. But if they can, the future looks even brighter for LGBT Americans. According to Republican sources, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to present a proposal to the new Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to delay the start of Trump's impeachment trial until February. This would give impeachment managers and Trump's defence at least one week to prepare, goes the reasoning. McConnell floated the proposal to Republican senators on a conference call on Thursday afternoon local time. It's unclear when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the article of impeachment to the Senate. Earlier this month, Trump becamethe first president in US history to be impeached twice,after being charged with ""incitement of insurrection"" over the deadly storming of Congress. Angelica CasasVideo journalist, BBC News Bidenâs challenge now is to prove that his messaging and policies on coronavirus will be effective. The president reminded the public while outlining his pandemic strategy today that Latino, Native American and black communities are four times more likely to be hospitalised and three times more likely to die than white Americans. When I met Monica MuÃ±oz earlier this summer, it was days after her father and grandfather were both laid to rest. MuÃ±ozâs father got the virus working at a meat-packing plant and unknowingly brought it home to his family. He was saving money to build a home in Mexico, where he and his wife dreamed of retiring. This video can not be played 'Weâre still waiting at home for them to come back' The press secretary is asked about ending the filibuster, a 60-vote threshold for most legislation in the US Senate. Psaki: âThe president has been clear he wants to work with members of both parties and find bipartisan paths forward.â Reporter: âI donât think you specifically answered that unless Iâm not understanding you right."" Psaki: ""I donât think I have more to add to my answer."" Progressive Democrats - and previously Trump - have called for the filibuster to be scrapped, frustrated at obstruction in the upper chamber. But Senate traditionalists from both parties have warned that doing away with the rule would usher in a no-holds-barred approach that would make US politics even more toxic and divisive. Psaki says there will be no political rallies on the South Lawn of the White House, in a reference to alleged super-spreader events hosted by Trump. A Fox reporter asks why Biden and his family were not masked during celebrations at the Lincoln Memorial on the evening of inauguration day. The journalist notes that Biden had just signed an executive order for masks to be worn on all federal property. The press secretary answers: ""I think, Steve, he was celebrating an evening, a historic day in our country and certainly he signed the mask mandate because it's a way to send a message to the American public about the importance of wearing masks."" The Fox reporter asks was that a good example to set. ""I think we have bigger issues to worry about at this moment in time,"" Psaki replies. On his second day in office on Thursday, Biden signed 10 executive orders - in addition to 15 executive orders and two memos he inked on day one. That means Biden has already produced more executive orders in two days than each of the previous four US presidents in two weeks. The practice of presidents from both parties bypassing Congress through the use of such proclamations has provoked much hand-wringing about unchecked executive power from US media in recent years. Angelica CasasBBC News, Texas It's been one year since the first coronavirus case was detected on US soil, and Iâve spent that time talking to families affected by the virus and its economic toll. While some blame the crisis on the Trump administrationâs pandemic response, others focus their attention on Biden and what heâll do to end it. This video can not be played Covid: 'I just wish my parents were still here' Press Secretary Jen Psaki is asked what Biden is actually doing to achieve his stated goal of unity in terms of reaching across the political aisle. The reporter notes that unlike Barack Obama's cabinet, no Republican is set to join Biden's team, and that many of the orders signed by the new president are opposed by Republicans, and why is there nothing on border security in his proposal to grant a path to US citizenship for 11 million undocumented immigrants? Psaki says issues like getting children back to schools and vaccine distribution affect all Americans, regardless of party, and Biden just had the first female director of national intelligence confirmed overwhemingly by a bipartisan Senate vote. âI think if you talk to Republicans on the hill,"" she adds, ""they will say theyâre not looking for something symbolic, theyâre looking for engagement, theyâre looking to have a conversation, theyâre looking to have a dialogue and thatâs exactly what heâs going to do.â Asked in a separate question about Biden's role in reaching out to Republicans, the press secretary says: ""He was involved, even before yesterday,  having conversations with members of both parties, picking up the phone and having those conversations."" Dr Fauci is asked by a reporter about the difference between serving under Biden and Trump. ""Obviously I don't want to be going back over history, but it was very clear that there were things that were said... that really was not comfortable because they were not based on scientific fact,"" he responds. He cites the example of the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that was touted by Trump. ""I can tell you, I take no pleasure at all in being in a situation of contradicting the president... you didn't feel that you could actually say something and there wouldn't be any repercussions."" He contrasts this to his experience with Biden's administration: ""The idea that you can get up here and talk about what you know and what the evidence, what the science is... it is something of a liberating feeling."" Dr Fauci also says: ""One of the new things in this administration is if you don't know the answer, don't guess. Just say you don't know the answer."" This comment leads online critics to note how Dr Fauci said in March last year that ""thereâs no reason to be walking around with a mask"". He now advocates mask wearing. The White House press briefing begins with Press Secretary Jen Psaki inviting infectious diseases specialist Dr Anthony Fauci to speak about the state of the coronoavirus in the country. Speaking about variants, Dr Fauci says ""the mutants in the UK"" are now found in about 20 US states, but there is no sign of the South Africa strain. The UK variant, he says, âappears to have a greater degree of transmissibility, about twice as muchâ as the original Covid-19. ""They say, correctly, on a one-to-one basis it doesnât seem to make the virus more virulent or have a greater chance of making you seriously ill, or killing you. ""However, we shouldnât be lulled into complacency about that because if you have a virus that is more transmissible youâre going to get more cases. When you get more cases, you get more hospitalisations. And when you get more hospitalisations youâre going to get more deaths."" He says it appears the vaccines will still be effective with the variants. The new Biden administration has rejected a move on Monday by former President Trump to lift restrictions on travel into the US from Europe, the UK and Brazil. Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese, Washington DC Bidenâs inauguration was marked by many historic âfirstsâ, and one of
them could be a sign of potential future clashes between Beijing and Washington. Bi-khim Hsiao, Taiwanâs top envoy to the US, was formally invited
to the inauguration - the first time this has happened in more than four decades. A video shared on her social media shows her standing in front of
the US Capitol ahead of the inauguration ceremony. âDemocracy is our common
language and freedom is our common objective,â Taiwanâs de facto ambassador to
the US said. China views the self-ruled island as part of its territory that it
will eventually retake, by force if necessary. And the status of Taiwan has long been a thorny issue in
US-China relations, as the US is by far Taiwanâs most important friend. Hsiaoâs presence at the inauguration signals the US may continue
to demonstrate strong support for Taiwan, despite the fact that many Taiwanese people are
concerned that Biden will take a less confrontational
stance towards Beijing compared with Trump. By contrast, itâs unclear whether Chinaâs ambassador to the
US, Cui Tiankai, attended Bidenâs inauguration. Earlier today, Chinaâs foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying
said Cui had been invited, but did not confirm whether he was present in the ceremony.
Hua reiterated Chinaâs position of opposing official interactions between Taiwan
and the US. Itâs a long-running unspoken rule that Beijing and Taipeiâs top
diplomats in Washington do not attend the same event, because sharing a stage
could be seen as Beijing acknowledging Taiwan as an independent sovereign country. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Vincent NiBBC World Service In the last fortnight, while the world was fixated on the last
dramatic days of the ex-President Donald Trump, Joe Biden was gathering pace in
forming his key foreign policy team. In a move that signals to Asian allies that the US is
back in the region, Joe Biden appointed a former Obama administration official,
Kurt Campbell, as the Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator. He has been dubbed Biden's ""Asia Tzar"" and is an appointment
particularly worth watching. Mr Campbell, a veteran US diplomat and a former Pentagon official, has had a long track record of dealing with Asia. He was widely associated with
Obama-era ""pivot to Asia"" policy - a move that was once understood by Beijing as
a containment policy. Washington later replaced ""pivot"" with
""rebalance"".  Biden's 'Asia Tzar' Kurt Campbell Last year, shortly after the Covid pandemic started, he warnedin an article in Foreign Affairs magazine,externalthat China was ""manoeuvring for international leadership"" through the Covid crisis as the US faltered. Before his appointment, Mr Campbell on various occasions urged the US to work with allies to compete with China, but not at all costs. ""Competition without catastrophe"" was the term he used inin another article,externalwith Bidenâs National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. The phrase itself might suggest a more nuanced China policy under Biden.  After signing a series of executive orders, Biden is asked by a reporter whether his goal of 100 million vaccinations in his first 100 days is ""too low"". To be clear, that would be enough vaccine for 50 million people, out of a total US population of about 330 million. ""When I announced it you all said that it's not possible. Come on. Give me a break, man,"" he responds. ""It's a good start - 100 million."" The New York Times points out that at the current rate of production, about twice that amount of vaccine should be available in that time period. The event then ends, without Biden taking any further questions from the press. Following his speech, Biden signed a range of new executive orders on Covid covering:  Find out more about the ordershere. ""I look forward to working with members of Congress,"" says Biden. ""We're in a national emergency. It's time we treated it like one."" To remind you, many of the executive orders he will now sign require nearly $1.9tr (Â£1.4tr) in yet-to-be-approved congressional funding. ""Americans have given so much already, but I believe they are ready to set big goals,"" he adds. ""History's going to measure whether we're up for the task. I believe we are."" Biden reiterated his appeal to Americans to ""mask up for the next 99 days"". ""It's become a partisan issue, unfortunately, but it's a patriotic act."" He also said wearing a face mask would be a requirement for any inter-state travel. All international air passengers would have to quarantine on arrival in the US, the president added. ""For the past year we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and co-ordination that we needed,"" says Biden, criticising the Trump administration's handling of the Covid pandemic. ""And we have seen the tragic cost of that failure,"" he continues, noting that the US has seen 3,000 to 4,000 deaths per day in recent weeks. He called the Trump administration's vaccine rollout ""a dismal failure so far"" and adds that 20% of global Covid-19 deaths have been in the US, despite the US only having 4% of the Earth's population. Biden adds that the virus has ""disproportionately"" affected patients who are black, Latino and Native American. He says that these minority groups are four times more likely to require hospital treatment, and three times more likely to die from the coronavirus. A doctor in Chicago receives his vaccine Biden warned that the country's Covid-related death toll ""will likely"" exceed 500,000 by next month. ""Itâs going to take months for us to turn things around. Let me be clear, we will get through this, we will get through this pandemic. Help is on the way,"" the president said. ""Today, I am unveiling a national strategy on Covid-19 and executive actions to beat this pandemic. Our national strategy is comprehensive, based on science, not politics.""  Biden starts by saying that he and his wife Jill had prayed together to remember America's 400,000 Covid victims. ""To heal we must remember,"" the president says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Biden sets to work on reversing Trump policiesThe new president starts dismantling his predecessor's legacy, signing a series of executive orders.","President Biden quickly signed executive actions on coronavirus, climate change and racial inequality US President Joe Biden has begun to undo some of Donald Trump's key policies, hours after being sworn in.

The move will be discussed when Mr Biden makes his first phone call to a foreign leader - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The Keystone XL Pipeline project has led to years of protests The privately financed pipeline - estimated to cost about $8bn (Â£5.8bn) - would carry about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from the oil sands of Alberta, in Canada, to Nebraska. Barack Obama vetoed a bill approving construction of the pipeline in 2015 but the decision was overturned by President Trump. Why is the Keystone XL pipeline so disputed? OnimmigrationMr Biden has revoked the Trump administration's emergency declaration that helped fund the building of a wall along the Mexican border and also ended a travel ban on some majority-Muslim countries. Other orders coverraceandgender equality. Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office. Donald Trump had used his executive authority broadly, to advance large swaths of his political agenda, so how - and when - Biden would begin undoing those actions would have particular importance. It didn't take long for the newly inaugurated president to show his hand. He targeted, in particular, some of the most controversial portions of Trump's agenda. The Biden administration also will freeze all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. Executive action is the (relatively) easy part, however. For Biden to make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress to pass legislation on issues like pandemic relief, citizenship for undocumented migrants, healthcare reform and voting-rights protections. He also declined, for now, to take other executive actions, like cancelling student loan debt, lifting Mr Trump's trade restrictions or enacting new criminal justice measures. With Democrats in control in the House of Representatives and Senate, Biden has a window for accomplishments, although it will require surmounting Republican procedural obstacles and keeping his party in line. The president's decades of experience as a legislator could come in useful. Biden calls for unity - it won't be easy At the first news conference of the Biden presidency, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked if her priority was to promote the interests of President Biden, or provide ""the unvarnished truth"". She said she had ""deep respect for the role of a free independent press"" and that she would join the president in bringing ""transparency and truth back to government"". President Trump - and his press secretaries - often had a combative relationship with the media. The White House has a new press secretary - Jen Psaki ""Democracy has prevailed,"" President Biden said after taking the oath of office with Chief Justice John Roberts on stage in front of the US Capitol.

No more 'easy wins' at Scotland's biggest hospitalMedics at Glasgow's QEUH are seeing the effects of people delaying healthcare during lockdown.Glasgow & West ScotlandBiden to sign 10 executive orders to tackle CovidHe will order the increase of vaccinations along with testing and the production of essential equipment.US & Canada,"The emergency department at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the biggest and busiest in Scotland. Ambulances keep arriving, bringing more patients. In a curtained cubicle, one man is explaining to the doctor that he's been in pain for days, but he put off coming in ""because of everything that's going on"". Dr Alan Whitelaw, who runs the department, says that while there might be fewer patients coming through his door, there are no longer any ""easy wins"". ""Those that are coming are the sick people,"" he says. ""We are undoubtedly seeing the effects of people not seeking healthcare for six to 10 months. ICU staff are 'physically and emotionally' drained Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Scotland's excess deaths hit 129-year high ""We are seeing disease that we wouldn't always see and we are seeing it further down the road. ""We are making more diagnoses that potentially would be made in primary care or outpatient clinics.  On top of that we've got lots of Covid patients coming through the door. ""So it is those two things together that currently put the NHS under that significant pressure."" All over Scotland, hospitals are under severe pressure, with some treating significantly more coronavirus patients than they did during the first wave of the pandemic. Public visitors are not allowed at the QEUH, but BBC Scotland was given special permission to film to highlight the impact of Covid and the importance of following lockdown rules. On the day of the BBC's visit, there are 244 Covid patients. Critical care is running at capacity, and across the whole hospital it's a constant challenge to find space for new patients. Dr Whitelaw says the level of unpredictability is extreme. His team has run out of spare beds. ""We are ten months into strange and difficult times. It's winter, no-one's had a holiday, no-one's had much downtime. ""Hospitals are fuller in winter, beds are tighter and patients are sick"". Upstairs, one ward that previously treated patients with infectious diseases like flu or norovirus, is now a Covid ward. All 28 beds are full. Some patients here are recently diagnosed, others are coming to the end of their isolation, while some have been stepped down from critical care, but need rehabilitation. Senior charge nurse Karen Paton says it feels like patients are now sicker for longer. ""We've had this going on for more or less a year now and staff are beginning to feel the emotional distress of it,"" she says. ""Having to deal with patients succumbing to coronavirus, and just having the emotions of all the patients not being able to have contact from their families. ""I think it's beginning to take its toll on everybody."" Covid patient Gerry Gilroy says QEUH staff have been ""superb"" In one room on the ward is Gerry Gilroy, who tested positive for Covid in late December. By 8 January, the day of his 66th birthday, he could barely get out of bed and couldn't eat. ""It just hit me and I knew there was something not right,"" he says. ""I know how serious it is. I never thought it would hit me. It's been a bit of an experience but thankfully I'm on the mend. ""The staff here are superb. When I get out of here, if I can do something for the NHS I'm going to. Doctors, cleaners, nurses, all top drawer."" The impact of Covid is being felt across the hospital. The acute receiving area used to be the first stop for people who needed urgent surgery. Now it's where medics like Dr Colin Perry assess Covid patients sent in by their GP or NHS 24. It's another area that's full. ""In the first wave our ICU was busy and it remains very busy, but during that period we had free beds,"" says Dr Perry. ""This time we have much more pressure on the downstream ward areas, so it is harder to manage the wider needs of the hospital and make room for patients to move through the system. ""The numbers are far higher than they were a year ago."" Repurposing so many wards to treat coronavirus patients has meant some routine work had to be postponed, but staff are working to prioritise all different kinds of treatment. Helen Dorrance is a senior surgeon who specialises in bowel cancer at the QEUH. On the day the BBC visits she is operating on patients from another hospital to help relieve pressures there. Demand for critical care makes it difficult to operate some services, but cancer treatment is still running. ""We work together as a team across the region to make sure people who are the highest priority get dealt with,"" she says. ""But everyone gets their fair share and access to the care they need. ""It's not a choice, we do have to provide the best care we can for Covid patients and my critical care colleagues are stepping up to the mark. ""But the rest of us are making sure the rest of the service runs the way it should, so if you have your heart attack or stroke the right people are there to give you the best care."" Coming to hospital for any reason during the pandemic is a different experience, and services are stretched. But the emergency department's Dr Whitelaw adds that no matter what happens, they will cope. ""We don't come to work to worry or be fearful, we come to work to do our best and to help,"" he says. ""I think there's an uncertainty about what the next two to three weeks look like. ""It might be very, very challenging but I have absolute faith that the staff here will continue to do everything that is required. ""I think the public should be reassured that no matter what is thrown at us we will definitely get through it."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Protecting your home from flooding,"People, on average, have to wait up to nine months before they can return to their flood-damaged homes More than five-and-a-half million properties in England and Wales are deemed to be at risk from flooding. This year has seen most parts of the UK being affected, with thousands of properties being flooded. Despite efforts to improve and strengthen community flood defence schemes, many homes and businesses remain vulnerable. The Environment Agency acknowledges that it is impossible to completely flood-proof a property, but there are a number of measures to prevent flood-water getting in and limit the damage. There are a number of routes in which floodwater can enter a property. As well as coming through doors and patios, water can find its way in through air bricks on exposed walls and through gaps in the floor. Another way is via through drains and pipes as the pressure created by flooding can reverse the flow, causing water to back-up and enter a home through sinks, toilets, washing machines etc. The Environment Agency lists two ways that homes and businesses can protect properties: ""flood resistance"" measures, and making a building ""flood resilient"". This video can not be played The BBC's Bob Walker visits a research centre to see how flood protection products are tested Flood resistance refers to preventing water from entering in the first place. The traditional methods of using sandbags can help for short periods when used in conjunction with plastic sheeting, and they can prevent contaminated mud and silt from entering a property. But they do allow water to seep through and are not as effective as purpose-designed flood products. There are a range of products on the market that are designed to offer protection. These include: Guards that can be quickly fitted when flooding is imminent. These can stop water from seeping through gaps in external doors, such as front and patio doors Covers that can be fitted over ventilation bricks ""Non-return"" values fitted to drain-pipes and other pipes that could allow water to back-up during a flood Raising damp-proof courses and sealing floors More than one million people have signed up to the Environment Agency's flood warning service Flood protection experts recommend that people buy products that have been awarded a kitemark, as this means that the product has undergone a series of tests to ensure it is fit for purpose. If a product is awarded a kitemark, it means that it meets the requirements outlined in PAS-1188 - a quality benchmark developed by the British Standards Institution (BSI), the Environment Agency and other partners. The benchmark covers a range of product types, including removable products that act as barriers across vulnerable points, such as doors and airbricks; temporary, freestanding barriers which are assembled close to, but not in contact with, a building; and property flood skirt systems. As well as fitting flood protection measures to your home, another measure is landscaping your garden in a way that helps divert water away from your property. It is impossible to guarantee that flood-water will not enter your property, even if you have taken steps to protect your property. The Environment Agency lists a number of ways to make your home ""flood resilient"", which will limit the damage and allow residents to return to their property quickly (on average, people are unable to live in their homes for nine months after being flooded). These include: Raising electrical sockets, fuse boxes and wiring to at least 1.5m (5ft) above floor level In kitchens and bathrooms, use water-resistant materials, such as stainless steel, plastic or solid wood rather than chipboard Use tiled flooring with rugs, rather than fitted carpets Fix TVs and other electrical entertainment devices to the wall at least 1.5m off the floor Put valuable or irreplaceable items on high-mounted shelves This will depend on the size of your property and the level of flood resistance and resilience  you require. Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) estimate that protecting a property against shallow flash floods will cost in the region of Â£2,000-Â£6,000. However, protection against prolonged flooding requires bigger changes and could cost up to Â£40,000. But the Environment Agency says taking measures to protect your property will limit the distress and damage caused by flooding, reduce the level of repairs and will allow you to return to your home or business more quickly. As an estimated one-in-six homes are located within at-risk areas, more than one million people have signed up to theEnvironment Agency's flood warning service,external.

Biden sets to work on reversing Trump policies,"President Biden quickly signed executive actions on coronavirus, climate change and racial inequality US President Joe Biden has begun to undo some of Donald Trump's key policies, hours after being sworn in. In his initial acts as the 46th US president, he signed 15 executive orders - the first to boost the federal response to the coronavirus crisis. Other orders reversed the Trump administration's stance on climate change and immigration. President Biden set to work at the Oval Office having been sworn in earlier on Wednesday at the US Capitol. Americans' hopes and fears for Biden's presidency What will Joe Biden do first? Kamala Harris becomes first female, first black VP Climate change: Biden's first act sets tone for ambitious approach World leaders hope for 'new beginning' under Biden The inauguration was unlike any other due to coronavirus restrictions, with few present to witness the oaths and ceremonies. Donald Trump - who has still not formally conceded the presidency to Mr Biden - snubbed the event in a departure from longstanding precedent. This video can not be played President Biden: ""Democracy is fragile, and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed"" ""There is no time to waste when it comes to tackling the crises we face,"" President Bidentweeted as he headed,externalto the White House following his inauguration. President Biden ""will take action - not just to reverse the gravest damages of the Trump administration - but also to start moving our country forward,"" a statement detailing his executive orders said. Oncoronavirus, a series of measures will be enacted to tackle the pandemic which has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the US. There will be a mandate to wear masks and practise social distancing on all federal government property. A new office will be set up to co-ordinate the response to the pandemic and the US will halt the process - begun by the Trump administration - of withdrawing from the World Health Organization (WHO). Mr Biden wants to inoculate 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office The move tore-engage with the WHOwas welcomed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres who said it was ""absolutely critical"" for a more co-ordinated global response, his spokesman StÃ©phane Dujarric said. Mr Biden has also pledged to make thefight against climate changea top priority of his administration. He signed an executive order beginning the process of rejoining the 2015 Paris climate agreement, from which Mr Trump formally withdrew the US last year. Why is the US rejoining the Paris climate agreement? Mr Biden's climate envoy, former US Secretary of State John Kerry, tweeted that the commitment set ""a floor, not a ceiling"" for America's climate leadership and urged international co-operation ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (Cop26) in Glasgow in November.

Mr Biden has also revoked the presidential permit granted to thecontroversial Keystone XL Pipeline, which environmentalists and Native American groups have fought for more than a decade. The move will be discussed when Mr Biden makes his first phone call to a foreign leader - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - on Friday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. The Keystone XL Pipeline project has led to years of protests The privately financed pipeline - estimated to cost about $8bn (Â£5.8bn) - would carry about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude a day from the oil sands of Alberta, in Canada, to Nebraska. Barack Obama vetoed a bill approving construction of the pipeline in 2015 but the decision was overturned by President Trump. Why is the Keystone XL pipeline so disputed? OnimmigrationMr Biden has revoked the Trump administration's emergency declaration that helped fund the building of a wall along the Mexican border and also ended a travel ban on some majority-Muslim countries. Other orders coverraceandgender equality. Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office. Donald Trump had used his executive authority broadly, to advance large swaths of his political agenda, so how - and when - Biden would begin undoing those actions would have particular importance. It didn't take long for the newly inaugurated president to show his hand. He targeted, in particular, some of the most controversial portions of Trump's agenda. The Biden administration also will freeze all of Trump's last-minute regulations pending further review. Executive action is the (relatively) easy part, however. For Biden to make lasting change - policies that can't be undone by future presidents - he will have to work with Congress to pass legislation on issues like pandemic relief, citizenship for undocumented migrants, healthcare reform and voting-rights protections. He also declined, for now, to take other executive actions, like cancelling student loan debt, lifting Mr Trump's trade restrictions or enacting new criminal justice measures. With Democrats in control in the House of Representatives and Senate, Biden has a window for accomplishments, although it will require surmounting Republican procedural obstacles and keeping his party in line. The president's decades of experience as a legislator could come in useful. Biden calls for unity - it won't be easy At the first news conference of the Biden presidency, press secretary Jen Psaki was asked if her priority was to promote the interests of President Biden, or provide ""the unvarnished truth"". She said she had ""deep respect for the role of a free independent press"" and that she would join the president in bringing ""transparency and truth back to government"". President Trump - and his press secretaries - often had a combative relationship with the media. The White House has a new press secretary - Jen Psaki ""Democracy has prevailed,"" President Biden said after taking the oath of office with Chief Justice John Roberts on stage in front of the US Capitol. Delivering a message of unity after the turbulent Trump years, he promised to be a president ""for all Americans"" - including those who voted against him. Full transcript of Biden inauguration speech Three of his predecessors attended the ceremony: Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served for eight years as vice-president - Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Mr Trump's vice-president, Mike Pence. Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice-president ahead of Mr Biden. She is the first woman - and the first black and Asian-American person - to serve in the role.

Nearly 2m people had Covid vaccine in last week,"Sheila Evans was among those to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at the Al Abbas Mosque in Birmingham Nearly two million people in the UK have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine in the past week, government figures show. By the end of Tuesday 4.61 million people had received their initial jab, up from 2.64 million the week before. Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We're giving 200 vaccinations every minute"". But Boris Johnson warned there were ""unquestionably going to be a tough few weeks"" while the vaccine was rolled out and urged people to observe lockdown. Speaking during a visit to flood-hit Didsbury in Manchester, the prime minister said it was still ""too early"" to say when some lockdown restrictions could be lifted in England. He said figures from an Imperial College London survey showed the new variant of the virus to be ""not more deadly but it is much more contagious and the numbers are very great"". Thestudy suggests there was a rise in infections in the communityat the start of the latest lockdown in England. How will the UK vaccinate millions of people? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Religious beliefs causing 'real fear' over vaccine Meanwhile, NHS England figures show one in 10 major hospital trusts had no spare adult critical care beds last week.

Giving a statement in the Commons, Health Secretary Mr Hancock said the country had an ""immense infrastructure in place that, day by day, is protecting the vulnerable and giving hope to us all"". Describing this as a ""huge feat"", he said the government was making ""good progress"" towards its target. Asked about difficulties in getting vaccines to rural areas and whether the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine could be prioritised for these as it is easier to store, Mr Hancock said the challenge was that supply was ""lumpy"", with manufacturers working ""as fast as possible"". Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said new variants of the virus showed vaccination needed to go ""further and faster"". He asked if there was a contingency plan in place in case vaccines needed to be redesigned to contain mutations. Mr Hancock said the early indications were that the new variant was dealt with by the vaccine ""just as much as the old variant"". He also said 63% of residents in elderly care homes had now received a vaccine. Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is now chairman of the Common's Health Select Committee, asked about establishing ""quarantine hotels"" to combat new strains, as well as whether there should be further restrictions on household mixing outside bubbles and mandating FFP2 masks in shops and on public transport.

University degree 'not the only route to success',"There is still no long-term decision on whether to cut fees as a review recommended University tuition fees in England will be frozen at a maximum of Â£9,250 for the next academic year. The Department for Education (DfE) said a longer-term decision on cuts to fees would be delayed until the next Comprehensive Spending Review. But education sector groups said the government ""is wasting an opportunity"" to help university students. Ministers also set out plans to improve post-16 vocational education including student loans for adult learners. The DfE also launched a consultation onchanging the timetable for applying to university- to a so-called ""post-qualification admissions"" system. This would mean admissions being based on the grades achieve by students, rather than not relying on predictions. The government outlined its plans for higher education reforms for over-18s in response to alandmark review, commissioned by the government from finance expert Philip Augar. Its recommendations were published in May 2019. Planned reforms include making Â£2.5bn available for technical qualifications for adult learners through the National Skills Fund, a lifelong student loan entitlement for up to four years of higher education and the prioritising of funding for STEM subjects. But the Augar review's recommendations to reduce tuition fees to Â£7,500, alongside implementing reforms to minimum entry standards and foundation years at universities, were not addressed in this latest response. The DfE said given the pandemic ""now is not the right time to conclude the review in full"". Any further reforms are expected to be announced at the next Spending Review. Mr Augar also suggested the return of maintenance grants for poorer university students as part of his review, but there was not mention of this in the interim response. University and College Union general secretary Jo Grady said: ""Sadly this interim response confirms that there will not be a radical change to the current system. The Augar review recommended tuition fees should be cut to Â£7,500 and maintenance grants reintroduced ""The Westminster government is wasting an opportunity to make a real difference for students and institutions."" Prof Julia Buckingham, president of Universities UK , welcomed the prospect of lifelong loans, saying ""it is encouraging to see government's commitment to making lifelong learning opportunities more accessible to all"". However, Prof Buckingham said ""government should provide maintenance grants for those who need them the most, including those considering studying shorter courses on a modular basis"". As part of its Skills for Jobs White Paper, published alongside higher education reforms, the DfE said it wanted to ""put an end to the illusion that a degree is the only route to success and a good job and that further and technical education is the second-class option"". A white paper is a policy document produced by the government to set out their proposals for future legislation. The measures put forward include: business groups working alongside colleges to develop skills plans to meet local training needs a Â£65m development fund to establish new college business centres giving employers a central role in designing almost all technical courses by 2030, ensuring education and training is linked to skills needed boosting the quality and uptake of higher technical qualifications by introducing newly approved qualifications from September 2022 changing the law so that from 2025 people can access flexible student finance to train and retrain throughout their lives In December, the government announced that tens of thousands of adults without an A-level or equivalent would be able to benefit from nearly 400 fully-funded courses from April. It was the first major development in Prime Minister Boris Johnson'sLifetime Skills Guarantee (LSG) scheme, which was launched in September. The government wants to boost the status of vocational education Mr Johnson said it would mean ""everyone will be given the chance to get the skills they need, right from the very start of their career"". Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls' Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditors PM promises 'radical' shake-up of adult education Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""These reforms are at the heart of our plans to build back better, ensuring all technical education and training is based on what employers want and need, whilst providing individuals with the training they need to get a well-paid and secure job."" British Chamber of Commerce director general Adam Marshall welcomed the plans to put the skills needs of businesses at the heart of further education. ""As local business leaders look to rebuild their firms and communities in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, it is essential to ensure that the right skills and training provision is in place to support growth,"" he added. But organisations representing school and college leaders are also sceptical that there is enough funding for the further education sector to deliver on the proposals. In November, an the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) saidFE colleges and sixth forms faced significant financial uncertainty. Chief executive of the Association of Colleges David Hughes said: ""Colleges have been calling for this, after years of being overlooked and underutilised, but government has to not only recognise the vital college role, it also needs to increase funding.""

Buyers travelling 'hundreds of miles' to see homesEstate agents call for tougher measures - as buyers race to beat the end of the stamp duty holiday.UK,"House hunters are taking advantage of lockdown rules to travel hundreds of miles to view homes, estate agents say. In-person viewings are allowed in England, but estate agents have raised concerns about their safety and say some buyers are travelling across the country to look at second homes. Firms have said they are also currently facing increased demand before the stamp duty holiday ends on 31 March. The government said the housing market is ""a key part of our economy"". It has said the housing market in England will remain open during the national lockdown - but advises that initial viewings should be done virtually ""wherever possible"". What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? Are we going out more than the first lockdown? Stamp duty holiday - when does it end? But firms say many buyers don't want virtual appointments. And many companies report increased demand as buyers rush to beat the end of thestamp duty holiday - applied on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland. One estate agent who works in Yorkshire, who asked not to be named, said she knows colleagues who are ""ready for a complete nervous breakdown"" because they are being asked to book more in-person viewings and valuations. She said people are travelling hundreds of miles to view properties ""because they can"" and some often ""don't social distance"" when they get there. She said many virtual slots go unused because ""people want physical viewings"". ""I was in one the other day and there's a three-year-old that comes and sits next to meâ¦ bringing me a doll. How can you say 'back off?' You can't,"" she said. ""I just think it's bonkers. I want to earn money, I want to earn commission, but not under these circumstances,"" she added. Roly Matthews says the government faces a ""balancing act"" regarding estate agents Paul Le Bas, regional director of a family-run estate agency in Hayle, Cornwall, said he would like the government to ask people not to travel to estate agents outside their local areas for non-essential purposes. He said he turned down one person who wanted to travel about 400 miles from Bradford to look at a potential second home. ""We've taken the view as an agency that if it's just for a second home we don't deem that as essential travel, you can do that when lockdown's been lifted,"" he added. ""We weren't prepared to put ourselves at risk or our clients at risk. They got a bit shirty with us."" Roly Matthews, director of an independent agency in Elmbridge, Surrey, said most of his clients want in-person viewings and estate agents have had to ""feel their way a bit as to what they think is essential or not"". He knows some agencies are not screening their clients, giving members of the public ""a mixed signal"" and said the government would be ""sensible"" to consider further restrictions. The government says people are allowed to view properties,externalduring the lockdown in England. It encourages buyers to do their initial property searches online and advises that initial viewings should be done virtually wherever possible. For viewings taking place in person, the government says these should be arranged by appointment only and ""open house"" viewings should not take place. It advises people who are viewing properties in person to wear a face mask, avoid touching surfaces wherever possible, wash their hands regularly and/or use hand sanitiser. The government says people should also observe social distancing and stay two metres apart where possible. It does not specify how far prospective buyers can travel to view a property. Mark Hayward, chief policy advisor at NAEA (National Agency of Estate Agents) Propertymark, said estate agents are under additional pressure to complete deals with the stamp duty deadline approaching. ""We've seen levels of sales on a monthly basis not seen since 2004,"" he said. ""We know the volume of sales that has to go through to qualify for that stamp duty holiday is large."" He urged estate agents to follow NAEA guidelines for house viewings, such as sanitising surfaces and limiting time in the property. The organisation also recommends people seeking to view property ""must be in a position to proceed"". ""In other words, they've either got cash or they've sold their own property so they're not having to go and put the house on the market and create huge delays."" Last week, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer referred to house viewings when heraised concerns that England's lockdownmay not be tough enough. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the housing market has been allowed to remain open as it creates ""jobs as well as homes"". ""But all parties involved must continue to play their part in reducing the spread of the virus, by following our guidance to be Covid secure,"" a spokesman said. A petition calling for the stamp duty holiday to be extended by six months has gained over 115,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for debate in Parliament.

Military to assist NI hospitals in Covid-19 fight,"More than 100 medically-trained military personnel will be deployed Members of the military are to be brought in to help medical staff in Northern Ireland in the fight against Covid-19. Health Minister Robin Swann has asked the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to help out, primarily at a number of hospitals across NI. More than 100 medically-trained military personnel will be deployed. Those brought in will assist nursing staff and help on the wards in a move designed to ease the pressure on staff. In the past, the use of the military in Northern Ireland has provoked controversy. While military help has already been used during the pandemic to transport equipment and patients, this is the first time military staff will be used in hospitals. It is thought the first military staff will be made available as early as next week. Mr Swann said it would have been an abdication of responsibility if he did not avail of help from the military. He said while coronavirus cases were lower than two weeks ago, the challenge posed remained ""intense"" and intensive care pressures were expected to increase further in the next eight to 10 days.

He confirmed that a request for military assistance for NI's health service had been accepted by the MoD. The health minister thanked the MoD for the Military Aid to the Civil Authorities agreement, which is being provided in other UK regions. ""The armed forces have provided invaluable support in this pandemic, including aeromedical evacuation, real-estate and ongoing logistical planning,"" he said. ""Our hospitals are under immense pressure and an additional staffing complement will be very welcome on the front line. ""This is a health decision and I am confident it will be supported on that basis."" NI Secretary Brandon Lewistweeted,external: ""Battling #COVID19 is a national effort. I'm pleased that 110 medically-trained personnel from our Armed Forces will support health and social care teams across Northern Ireland in their vital work on the frontline against coronavirus."" The move has been welcomed by the Democratic Unionist Party. When it was announcedlast April that the health minster had made requests for military help,Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said Mr Swann had taken that decision unilaterally. However, she later said her party would not rule out any measure necessary to save lives. Reacting to the latest request for help, Sinn FÃ©in said its priority throughout the pandemic had been to save lives, keep people safe and protect the health service. ""The Minister of Health has made a request for staffing support from the British Ministry of Defence,"" the party said. ""We do not rule out any measures to do so, and any effort to make the threat posed by Covid-19 into a green and orange issue is divisive and a distraction."" As of Wednesday, there were 832 people in hospital in Northern Ireland with coronavirus, of whom 67 were in intensive care, with 57 ventilated. A further 22 people with coronavirus died, bringing the Department of Health's total to 1,671 while there were 905 new cases. In the Republic of Ireland, 61 new Covid-19-related deaths were recorded on Wednesday, bringing the country's death toll to 2,768. A further 2,488 new cases of the virus were also confirmed by the Irish Department for Health. Speaking at Stormont's press briefing on Wednesday, Mr Swann confirmed the executive would review the current lockdown regulations on Thursday. Northern Ireland began a six-week lockdown on 26 December, in a bid to bring the virus under control. Ministers promised to review the regulations after four weeks. Mr Swann said he would not pre-empt the outcome of Thursday's meeting but confirmed he would bring recommendations from his officials to the meeting. ""This is not the time to open floodgates or take premature decisions that would lead to another spike in cases,"" he added. ""We must stay the course."" What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? Is Northern Ireland winning the Covid-19 battle? The minister also provided the latest update on the number of vaccinations - 160,396 doses have now been administered in NI, with 21,690 of those second doses. He said he understood the frustration of some people that they were still waiting to hear when their elderly or vulnerable relatives would receive their vaccine, but he urged patience. ""We cannot go faster than supplies allow,"" he said.

Edwin Poots reveals cancer diagnosis,"This video can not be played Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots spoke to the Nolan Show Stormont minister Edwin Poots has been diagnosed with a cancerous growth on his kidney and fears it could spread because of surgery delays. He told the BBC's Stephen Nolan the prognosis is good but he needs surgery. The cancer was discovered whenhe was in hospital in December for emergency surgeryto remove his appendix. He said the announcement that all urgent cancer surgery was being cancelled due to coronavirus pressures ""came as an awful blow"". ""It is absolutely doubtless that there were will be excess deaths,"" the DUP agriculture minister said. Mr Poots, who is currently on a waiting list for cancer surgery, said his political ideology had always been against private healthcare, but he is now contemplating having a private operation. ""I would never have taken out private health insurance because I have always believed that what is good enough for the public is good enough for me as a public representative,"" he told the Nolan Show. ""But whenever I need it, it is not here to help me because it is totally absorbed in dealing with Covid-19 and that's hugely disappointing at a personal level."" Mr Poots added he had not yet made a decision on paying for his surgery, but would give it ""serious consideration"". ""If I have to spend Â£10,000 or Â£15,000 - I don't know how much it would be to be honest - if I have to spent that, I will do, because it is better to have something out of you that has the potential to take your life than carry on,"" he told the programme. ""Some people may criticise me for that but I'm not going to give up my life for a political ideology."" The 55-year-old added: ""Why would you let it spread to another organ, or let it grow, if you know the problem exists? ""My prognosis is good. I don't need chemotherapy. I don't need radio therapy. I need an operation."" Edwin Poots recovering after emergency surgery Poots opposes restrictions in email I did not link Covid spread to religion - Poots The former health minister said he did not regret previously calling for some of the coronavirus restrictions to be lifted, despite health chiefs warning they were needed to protect the NHS. He said he argued strongly that the executive needed to get tough on people who he described as ""superspreaders"" who ignored the law. Mr Poots said his Christian faith was helping him deal with his diagnosis The assembly member for Lagan Valley said doctors believed he would need six weeks' recovery time. Mr Poots, who had emergency surgery to remove his appendix in December, said he would be keen to get back to work as soon as possible. ""After my previous surgery, I got my iPad sent down to my hospital bed and got straight into my work again. I would get bored laying about,"" he said. ""I'll make that call with my party leader as to whether it is wise for me to carry on at that stage or whether I need to step back for a period of time. That's a judgment call I will make closer to the time."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said on Twitter that she had spoken to Mr Poots after he received his diagnosis. The first minister added she was reassured by the support for her party colleague from across the political spectrum. ""He has great determination & is sustained by a loving wife, family & great faith,"" she tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

NI lockdown measures to be reviewed by ministers,"Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster were advised restrictions may have to remain in place until after Easter Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said. The executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February. But ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays. A lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas. Family gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons. Schools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting. The lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas. First Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an ""appropriate and necessary response"" to tackle the ""imminent threat"" posed by Covid-19. She said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: ""To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains."" The first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people. But there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals. Their decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. They're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks. Beyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also ""well advanced"" before any restrictions are relaxed. The hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. Until then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important. ""We don't know what will come after [5 March],"" she said. Ms O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible. The executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday. Thereproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number- had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But thelatest estimate from the Department of Health,externalsays it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care. While some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak. Daily case numbers are still significantly higher too. While ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April. Ministers say they understand the extension of the lockdown will be difficult for people It is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month. Ministers were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is ""well advanced"" before any relaxations are agreed. Mrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to ""please seek help"". More than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals. The chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the ""sustained pressure on our health service"" would probably last for three to four weeks. In the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of ""little surprise to most businesses"". Allow Twitter content?

The Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost Â£300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown. A total of Â£100m is going towards theLocal Restrictions Support Scheme,external, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions. There will also be Â£16m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate. In addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened. One aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of Â£26m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible. The other is a Â£4m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation. More money is being made available to help businesses affected by the lockdown Janice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a ""real lifeline for the sector"". ""Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,"" she added. Also among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March. Last week, a scheme was announced to give directors Â£1,000 grants which one director described as a ""kick in the teeth"" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months. But that scheme is to be boosted with another Â£20m so the payments on offer will more than treble to Â£3,500. Local newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief.

Harris becomes first female VP,"This video can not be played Kamala Harris was sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Kamala Harris has made history as the first female, first black and first Asian-American US vice-president. She was sworn in just before Joe Biden took the oath of office to become the 46th US president. Ms Harris, who is of Indian-Jamaican heritage, initially ran for the Democratic nomination. But Mr Biden won the race and chose Ms Harris as his running mate, describing her as ""a fearless fighter for the little guy"". Prior to taking the oath at the US Capitol, Ms Harris paid tribute to the women who she says came before her. ""I stand on their shoulders,"" she said in a video. Allow Twitter content?

Eugene Goodman,the Capitol police officer who was hailed as a herofor steering a pro-Trump mob away from Senate chambers during the 6 January riot, escorted Ms Harris at the inauguration. Ms Harris, 56, was born in Oakland, California, to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father. Kamala, left, as child with her mother and younger sister Maya She went on to attend Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities. She has described her time there as among the most formative experiences of her life. Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as ""an American"". Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Kamala Harris and a 1986 snapshot of that Howard generation After four years at Howard, Ms Harris went on to earn her law degree at the University of California, Hastings, and began her career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. She became the district attorney - the top prosecutor - for San Francisco in 2003, the first black woman and the first Asian American woman to hold the office. In 2010 she won election as California's attorney general, the top lawyer and law enforcement official in America's most populous state. In her nearly two terms in office as attorney general, Ms Harris gained a reputation as one of the Democratic party's rising stars, using this momentum to propel her to election as California's junior US senator in 2017. She was only the second black woman ever elected to the US senate. She launched her candidacy for president to a crowd of more than 20,000 in Oakland at the beginning of 2019. But Ms Harris failed to articulate a clear rationale for her campaign, and gave muddled answers to questions in key policy areas like healthcare. She was also unable to capitalise on the clear high point of her candidacy: debate performances that showed off her prosecutorial skills, often placing Mr Biden in the line of attack, most notably criticising his praise for the ""civil"" working relationship he had with former senators who favoured racial segregation. She dropped out of the presidential race in December 2019. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? But Mr Biden chose her as his number two in August, calling her ""one of the country's finest public servants"".

Numerous flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Wales,including two severe flood warnings,external. The agency said flood defences were being used and river levels at Holt, Wrexham, would remain high for some time.""There is therefore a significant risk of localised flooding problems and due to that the severe flood warning will remain in place until the levels drop,"" Keith Iven of NRW said In Monmouthshire roads were closed following flooding, and the council said while water levels at the River Usk were dropping, a ""second peak"" on the River Wye had been expected on Thursday night. The council had warned people living in Riverside Park, Monmouth, may be impacted and council workers were prepared to offer support. River Tywi has burst its banks in Carmarthen, affecting nearby businesses Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended 98 flooding-related incidents It said it deployed swift water rescue teams to rescue 13 people from vehicles in floodwater. It also winched vehicles from water and pumped water from properties. In Cardiff, emergency services attended a crash involving a number of vehicles at about 07:40 on the A4232 between Culverhouse Cross and the M4. No-one was seriously injured, but both carriageways were closed for just over an hour. The road has since reopened. In Carmarthen, people were treated for the effects of fumes after using a generator to pump water from their homes. In Knighton and Crickhowell in Powys, crews spent Wednesday night pumping out a number of properties. In Borth, Ceredigion, floodwater hit the water treatment plant, an electrical substation and eight properties. Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team had to rescue a man from the roof of his car.

Bangor-on-Dee has been badly hit by Storm Cristoph Dozens of roads have been closed across Wales, and while Covid rules are in place stopping people from travelling apart from for essential reasons, people are being warned not to travel in affected areas due to widespread flooding. Chris Lloyd from North Wales Mountain Rescue Association warned people to not visit flood-hit areas to view the damage. He told BBC Radio Wales: ""People who are going out to look at the floods are not only putting themselves at risk, but putting additional people on the roads which professional emergency services don't want - we don't want any more incidents.""

pandemic. Before we go, hereâs a round-up of todayâs main headlines:  Updates today were brought to you by Becky Morton, Claire Heald, Francesca Gillett, Georgina Rannard, Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright and Lucy Webster. Join us again tomorrow. US President Joe Biden is now
speaking from the White House about how his administration will tackle the
coronavirus pandemic. He says he has been
meeting with his Covid response team, and it will âtake monthsâ to
turn around the situation in the country. Today he is going to unveil a ânational
strategyâ on Covid-19, he says, which is âcomprehensiveâ and is based on âscience
and not politicsâ. The plan, which consists of 198 pages, will start with an âaggressive,
safe and effectiveâ vaccination campaign. But it will take months to protect everyone, he says, so in the meantime, ""mask up"", he tells the American people. Wearing a mask, he says, is ""a patriotic act"". To follow our coverage of his first day, headhere. This video can not be played The BBC's Adam McClean reports on flooding in Wrexham Flooding has dominated many peoples lives in the UK today - and briefly threatened the effort to fight the pandemic. Emergency teams were called out to protect supplies of the Oxford University and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine following flooding at a manufacturing site in Wales overnight. Excess water surrounded buildings at Wockhardt's pharmaceutical manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate during heavy rainfall caused by Storm Christoph. The leader of Wrexham County Borough said that authorities worked ""through the night"" to ensure that the site was not overwhelmed by flood water. Mark Pritchard said resources such as gullies had been put in place to protect the vaccine storage facility on the industrial estate. Kerry AllenChinese Media Analyst The number of giant pandas is finally rebounding after years of decline There are concerns in China today about the
health of Ya Ya, a giant panda that is currently on loan to Memphis Zoo in
Tennessee, in the US. Thenational Global Times says,externalthat fears about
the pandaâs health span from a video that appeared on Chinese social media
showing the panda appearing to be âskinnyâ. Chinese netizens are now urging the zoo
to send the pandas âback homeâ. Giant pandas are a vulnerable species.  They need
to eat 12kg (26 lbs) to 38kg (84lbs) worth of bamboo each day to maintain their energy needs. However, the Covid-19
pandemic has made it logistically difficult to ship bamboo to the pandas
worldwide. This has already madeCanadianandJapanese,externalzoos arrange for the animals to be sent back to China. This is not the first time Chinese social media
users have expressed concerns about the health of a giant panda in the US. In November, social media users also voiced concern about whether Mei Xiang, a
panda at Washington Zoo, was receiving enough food. The practise of sending pandas to other
countries, known as âpanda diplomacyâ is an important way of showing a
countryâs close ties with China. Any maltreatment of one can seriously rupture
a countryâs relationship with China. Covid-19 vaccine supplies in Yorkshire and the North Eastare to be reduced and diverted to other parts of England. The Health Service Journal has reported that the number of doses sent to GPs in both areas - which have the highest vaccination rates among over-80s - could be halved from next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the move would allow vulnerable groups around the country to get their jabs. But some regional leaders branded the move an ""absolute disgrace"". It comes after figures showed the proportion of the population of over-80s vaccinated in London and the east of England was lower than in other areas. Japanese car maker Nissan will
pause work on one of the production lines at its Sunderland plant on Friday due
to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. Global shipping issues caused by
the crisis have left UK manufacturers faces a shortage of parts in recent
months, as containers and goods get stuck in the wrong ports. Nissanâs rival Honda has paused
production at its Swindon plant several times since December due to the
disruption. Nissan, which produces Qashqai
and Leaf cars in Sunderland, said: ""Production on Line One at the plant
has been paused due to supply chain disruption caused
by the Covid-19 pandemic,"" ""We anticipate that
production will resume on Monday next week."" President Biden is due to give more details about his action plan to boost the fight against Covid-19, which has ravaged America. Earlier, he said he would sign 10 executive orders, and the administration has alreadyunveiled a seven-point plan which included efforts to facilitate effective distribution of vaccines and reliable access to testing,external. In a break with his predecessor, Trump, Biden is stressing the need to have a federal strategy rather than relying on individual US states to decide what is best. Read more about Biden's Covid executive ordershere. Eleanor LawrieBBC News Everyone entering the UK now has go into quarantine, after the government suspended its travel corridors with other specific destinations. Travel is only permitted for essential reasons and people entering the UK must show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before boarding their flight. The country has also extended a travel ban to South America, Portugal and many African countries, amid concerns about new, potentially more infectious variants of coronavirus. But it has never banned international travel altogether. Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, says that by far the best time for the UK to have introduced a travel ban would have been back in January 2020, when the virus was first identified in China. But he warns closing the borders is ""not a silver bullet"". You can read more about the arguments for and against travel banshere. Production on a North Sea platform has been shut down because of a Covid-19 outbreak. Four crew members from Ithaca Energy's FPF-1 floating production facility in the North Sea, about 150 miles (240km) east of Aberdeen, have tested positive for the virus. They have been taken off the platform, while close contacts are in quarantine and are also being taken onshore. Ithaca Energy said production on the FPF-1 had been shut to ensure the safety of all those onboard. Read more. Away from the party-goers and the fines, Irish novelist Marian Keyes has been sharing some of her tips on coping with lockdown withBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme. She said being an ""acute introvert"" who is used to working from home meant she found it easier to manage without human contact than others might. Keyes said she found breaking down time into ""manageable"" chunks and focusing on small tasks was ""the best way to survive something
uncomfortable or grim or bleak"" without becoming overwhelmed. The author has also been running writing workshops on Instagram Live, setting daily challenges to help people fill their time during lockdown. âIt has been so rewarding for
me to do it,"" she said. ""People have talked about
the fact that they are unemployed and they are at home and they donât know how
to pass the time. But when they see my writing prompt in the morning it gives
them something to do.â The Isle of Man will begin easing its lockdown restrictions this weekend. From Saturday, socially distanced outdoor meetings will be permitted and trades will be allowed to return to work under certain rules. The island entered a second lockdownon 7 January following a rise in cases. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said the island had to ""tread carefully"" as restrictions were relaxed but the changes were the start of the ""path back to normality"". He added that, âsubject to no further community casesâ, the remaining restrictions could be lifted ""as early as 1 February"". There have been no new cases of Covid-19 on the island for three days and the number of active cases has fallen to 48. You can read the full story here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Public Health Englandâs weekly data has some positive news. Flu vaccinations are at record levels â up by about 10% in over-65s, young children and higher-risk under-65s compared with last year. Amid all the talk of vaccine scepticism, itâs a reminder of how many people are keen on vaccines. Last week, PHE reported a rise in coronavirus outbreaks in care homes and in case numbers in the over-80s. These havenât been sustained in this weekâs figures, covering the week up to 17 January. PHE reports that case numbers are falling across regions and age groups. But the cloud to the silver lining is that hospitalisation rates are still high and rising in most parts of the country. And with studies reporting that infections might not be falling as quickly as the case numbers suggest, this pressure will continue for some time to come. This video can not be played Covid-19: Birmingham mosque opens doors for vaccinations A mosque in Birmingham has been welcoming in people for jabs, after opening as a vaccination clinic. It is thought that Al-Abbas Islamic Centre is the first mosque in the country to do so. The mosque's Imam Sheikh Nuru Mohammed urged people to be immunised saying ""there is nothing to worry about"". It follows concern about scepticism towards the vaccine in some Muslim communities. Some fake news about the vaccineseen by the BBCis also religiously targeted. Messages falsely claim the vaccines contain animal produce - eating pork goes against the religious beliefs of Muslims. Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Portugal's government has announced the closure of all schools and other educational institutions for 15 days from tomorrow, with no provision for remote learning to replace face-to-face classes, as part of attempts to limit the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. The whole of mainland Portugal has been under lockdown since Friday, with still tighter restrictions having come into force yesterday, but all schools, colleges and universities remained open. Announcing the decision, which was taken at today's regular weekly cabinet meeting, the prime minister, AntÃ³nio Costa, said that although schools ""were not and are not the main focus of transmission"" of the virus, the government had decided to apply the ""precautionary principle"". He also cited the rapid spread of the ""UK strain"" of the virus - which hesaid this week accounted for 20% of new cases and could ""in the coming weeks"" account for 60% - as a factor in the decision. The prime minister warned that a move aimed above all at protecting pupils and staff should not prompt people to flout lockdown rules - such as the obligation to wear masks in public places where physical distancing is not possible. Classes that do not take place over the next two weeks will be compensated for later in the school year, in ways to be agreed with headteachers, he said. Portugal has today reported the highest number of deaths associated with Covid-19 in the previous 24 hours, and 13,544 new confirmed cases - the second-highest daily figure, after yesterday's 14,647. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent A few more thoughts on the communications balance the government faces on enforcing Covid rules and the practicalities the police face doing exactly the same. There were just under130,000 police officers in England and Wales,externalat the end of March last year. The population of England and Wales is about 60 million. Clearly, there aren't enough officers to police whether you or me are nipping around to the neighbours' for a glass of wine. And is it a glass of wine or is it a legitimate and legal support bubble? No one actually knows from an enforcement point of view - because what happens inside a private home is private. Except, of course, when it's so loud the whole street can hear it and the police are called. These breaches - which most would regard as outrageous - are easier
to spot, to police and easier to secure the backing of the majority for the
toughest policing. Hence, these new measures: tough new measures likely to be
supported by the vast majority. The government keeps the vast majority on side with this
particular measure and they tool the police with greater powers to deal with
the problem. But, how we all behave, hour by hour, day by day, with
potentially minor breaches here and there, has the potential - cumulatively -
to be much more significant when it comes to transmission of the virus. But the government and the police only realistically have one
tool there: persuasion; the hope we will be responsible. Ministers will also hope that by being seen to be tough on the
worst rule breakers, it won't leave the rest of us feeling like mugs for doing
our bit. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel said the police had her ""absolute backing"" to enforce coronavirus restrictions, as she announced a new fine for people attending house parties. The Â£800 fine, for people attending illegal gatherings of more than 15 people, will double with each repeat offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400. Today's government press conference was led by Home Secretary Priti Patel. She was joined by the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council, Martin Hewitt, and NHS England's Regional Director for London Dr Vin Diwakar. Here's what they told us: Reality Check Home Secretary Priti Patel
reiterated the governmentâs message that people should âstay at homeâ as much
as possible. Mobility data from Google, Apple
and the Department for Transport suggests that people are leaving the home more
than during the first lockdown. On 8
January, the first Friday of this lockdown, people were driving at twice
the rate they were on the first Friday of the March 2020 lockdown. Similar
data from Google shows that a higher proportion of people were in workplaces,
parks and grocery stores last Friday compared with the first lockdown. However, comparing the
two lockdowns is difficult because more things are open this time, including
nurseries, garden centres and estate agents. This could explain why people are
outside more than before. BBC Reality Check has looked at the numbers. The final question is
about figures from Oxford University earlier this week which suggested the UK had the worst daily coronavirus death rate in
the world. The home secretary is asked whether it was a mistake to relax rules over Christmas? Priti Patel says the number of people that have died with Covid is an âabsolute
tragedyâ but the government approach has always been to be guided by the advice from
scientists. Asked whether people who jump the queue for the
vaccine should be fined, she says people who do that are ""morally reprehensibleâ as they are
putting the lives of vulnerable people at risk. She says all the governmentâs measures are under review but âour
focus is getting that vaccine to the most vulnerable to make sure we can
protect them and obviously protect others in the communityâ. On reticence, The Times's Steve Swinford asks if police officers should be vaccinated ahead of those in their 50s and if there is data about which groups are more likely to refuse a vaccination. Mr Hewitt says he wants police officers to be vaccinated ""at the earliest opportunity"" and that he has raised this with the prime minister. Dr Vin Diwakar says some communities have ""entirely legitimate concerns"" about the vaccines. He says there are ""long-standing concerns"" in some Asian and black communities that go back generations, dating back to ""unethical experiments"" done in the early part of the last century. However seeking to reassure those who are reluctant, he says he is convinced that ""this is a safe and effective vaccine"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"NI lockdown measures to be reviewed by ministersRestrictions are unlikely to be eased by the executive, due to pressures on the health service.","Michelle O'Neill and Arlene Foster were advised restrictions may have to remain in place until after Easter Coronavirus lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will be extended until 5 March, the first and deputy first ministers have said. The executive backed the health minister's proposal on Thursday and will review the move on 18 February. But ministers were also told that restrictions may have to remain in place until after the Easter holidays. A lockdown closing non-essential retailers and encouraging employees to work from home began after Christmas. Family gatherings are prohibited and people have been ordered to stay at home for all but essential reasons. Schools are closed to most pupils until after February's half-term but a paper looking at reopening will be put to ministers at next week's executive meeting. The lockdown came in response to a spike in the number of cases of coronavirus, which followed a relaxation of some rules in the run-up to Christmas. First Minister Arlene Foster said extending the restrictions was an ""appropriate and necessary response"" to tackle the ""imminent threat"" posed by Covid-19. She said she understood it would be difficult for many people to accept, given the uncertainty facing families and businesses, but added: ""To not press forward would risk all of the hard-won gains."" The first and deputy first ministers were right to state just how tough this decision will be for many people. But there's an acceptance among the public that restrictions would have to be extended, given how bad things are in our hospitals. Their decision also suggests politicians have perhaps learned from the last wave of the pandemic, when restrictions were turned on and off sporadically, and the impact that had both on cases and the messaging. They're not alone in sustaining tough lockdown measures, with other UK nations and the Republic of Ireland also keeping their restrictions in place for several more weeks. Beyond that, it is thought health officials also want to ensure the vaccination programme is also ""well advanced"" before any restrictions are relaxed. The hope is that, by spring, the picture will have improved significantly. Until then the price we are paying for relaxations before Christmas looks likely to keep rising. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the executive was asking a lot of everybody but insisted the measures were important. ""We don't know what will come after [5 March],"" she said. Ms O'Neill said there was a commitment not to keep restrictions in place longer than necessary but decisions would have to be taken in line with the health advice and concerns about a new variant of the virus which is more transmissible. The executive's decision comes as another 21 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health on Thursday. Thereproductive rate of the virus - known as the R-number- had risen to about 1.8 due to Christmas relaxations. But thelatest estimate from the Department of Health,externalsays it is sitting between 0.65 and 0.85 for cases within the community but is still above one for hospital admissions and intensive care. While some may wonder why are restrictions are being extended when the executive's policy has always been based on this rate of infection, the difference is that this time around there are three times as many people in Northern Ireland's hospitals than there were in last April's peak. Daily case numbers are still significantly higher too. While ministers have agreed to keep the current restrictions in place until March, Health Minister Robin Swann said it was possible they could be needed until Easter, which this year falls in the first week of April. Ministers say they understand the extension of the lockdown will be difficult for people It is understood this plan is being discussed across the four UK nations but ministers will have to consider that in the review next month. Ministers were also warned that restrictions would be eased on a step-by-step basis in line with reducing pressures on the health service and ensuring the vaccination programme is ""well advanced"" before any relaxations are agreed. Mrs Foster pleaded with people struggling with their mental health during the lockdown to ""please seek help"". More than 100 medically-trained military personnel are to be deployed to help health staff deal with the pressure the latest phase of the pandemic is placing on hospitals. The chief medical officer Dr Michael McBride said the ""sustained pressure on our health service"" would probably last for three to four weeks. In the Republic of Ireland, 51 Covid-19 related deaths and 2,608 new cases of the virus were recorded on Thursday. Simon Hamilton, the chief executive of the Belfast Chamber of Trade and Commerce, said the extension of the lockdown would be of ""little surprise to most businesses"". Allow Twitter content?

The Stormont executive has agreed how to allocate almost Â£300m to help businesses, education, tourism and transport during the next phase of the lockdown. A total of Â£100m is going towards theLocal Restrictions Support Scheme,external, the grant for business premises forced to closed due to the restrictions. There will also be Â£16m for tourism and hospitality, two sectors which have largely been unable to operate. In addition, two more support schemes for the sector have been opened. One aimed at large tourism and hospitality businesses is offering a pot of Â£26m, with the Department for Economy having identified 250 businesses that will be eligible. The other is a Â£4m scheme to support those who provide bed-and-breakfast accommodation. More money is being made available to help businesses affected by the lockdown Janice Gault from the trade body the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the schemes were a ""real lifeline for the sector"". ""Trading over the last year has been limited with reserves now severely depleted and businesses operating in survival mode,"" she added. Also among those to receive the extra cash will be limited company directors, who had not received support since March. Last week, a scheme was announced to give directors Â£1,000 grants which one director described as a ""kick in the teeth"" given that he had little to no income for the past 10 months. But that scheme is to be boosted with another Â£20m so the payments on offer will more than treble to Â£3,500. Local newspapers will also benefit from 12 months of rates relief.

"Food supply clearly a Brexit issue, says Coveney","Food supply problems into Northern Ireland from Great Britain are ""clearly a Brexit issue"", Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said. Simon Coveney said the shortages were ""part of the reality"" of the UK leaving the EU. ""Let's not pretend Brexit doesn't force that kind of change,"" he said, speaking on ITV's Peston programme On Tuesday, the NI secretary said images of empty supermarket shelves had ""nothing to do with the protocol"". Rather, Brandon Lewis argued the disruption caused by coronavirus before Christmas was responsible for the shortages of some food products. The Northern Ireland Protocol between the UK and the EU requires health certifications on animal-based food products entering NI from the rest of the UK. Mr Coveney said it meant ""very real change"" for some businesses, as there now had to be a ""certain number of checks"" on goods from Britain into Northern Ireland. He said that some companies were not ready for this. Mr Coveney said the Republic of Ireland would work with the UK and EU to ""make sure"" supermarket shelves were not empty in the future. Shipping organic food is a 'nightmare' post-Brexit Supply problems for supermarkets being 'overcome' Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? He said the Brexit divorce deal agreed with the EU by then-prime minister Theresa May would have caused less separation from Northern Ireland from the UK. Asked about Mr Coveney's comments, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the disruption had been ""down to both"" Covid and Brexit - but defended the situation. Speaking on the Peston programme she said ""there was always going to be a period of adjustment for businesses"" and ""we are now seeing a more rapid flow of goods into Northern Ireland those supermarket shelves are being stocked"". Ms Truss said the government would continue to support businesses, and that ""predictions of Armageddon haven't happened"".

Viral moments you missed,"Joe and Jill Biden catch the fireworks from the White House balcony Joe Biden is officially president, Kamala Harris is the country's first Madam Vice-President and Donald Trump flew off to play golf - all of that we expected. But here's a look at those inauguration day moments you might have missed, some solemn, some emotional, but also the podium wipe guy. It was hard to find any downbeat comments after the white-clad Katy fired off her epic anthem to close out the day in front of the Washington Monument - as the Bidens stood watching from their balcony. Although Firework as a song has drawn many interpretations, from sex to firework safety to LGBT rights, it seemed a pretty good fit here. The exploding background didn't do any harm, but the lyrics weren't too off track either. ""Do you ever feel like a plastic bag/Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?"" Well-known Twitch streamer hasanabi tweeted ""katy perry is right, trump DID make me feel like plastic bag!"" Oh, and the song swept back into the US iTunes chart of course. That's how it all ended but let's go back to the start... Before Joe took over, Donald first had to leave. Perhaps not all of the Trump administration could be called carefully choreographed, but the strains of Frank Sinatra's My Way ringing out as Air Force One swept Mr Trump out of the presidency and off to Florida is hard to fault.

We can't say for sure he planned it himself and the other tunes banging out at Andrews base - like Elton John's Funeral for a Friend - were hard to parse for some. Mr Trump's a big fan of Sinatra apparently. Though it's not reciprocated - Sinatra's daughter, Nancy, said her father loathed the then real estate mogul. The other Trumpism drawing attention was Melania's outfit change. It was quickly pointed out that Mrs Trump had used her flight from Andrews to Florida to quickly update her wardrobe to suit her new, post-first lady life. Melania looked somewhat funereal as she left the White House... ... but landed in Florida with a colourful, chic and pricey Gucci dress Some noted her relaxed smile after touching down in Florida - an apparent contrast to her demeanour at her husband's inauguration four years ago. And on to the inauguration ceremony... The first sensation came from Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders with his sensible choices for Washington's near-freezing weather - an outdoorsy jacket with woollen mittens accoutred with a brown manila envelope. Channelling a grumpy uncle at a February wedding or a man in an unheated waiting room, he brought new glory to the timeworn philosophy of bringing yourself and nothing else to an occasion.

The colour purple - well hues of it at least - hit the small screen in a big way. Inauguration fashion: Purple, pearls, and mittens Kamala Harris in purple, Hillary Clinton in amethyst, Michelle Obama in a plum-coloured turtleneck and trouser design. Laura Bush (C) breaks the purple trend at the inauguration Why purple? Well it has a long history with the suffragette movement, and has been promoted by some as an intertwining of Republican red and Democrat blue. It's a unity thing. Lady Gaga appeared with a gold Schiaparelli gilded dove of peace brooch so large it threatened to fly her off the stage as she sang the national anthem. Suffice it to say she was on less controversial ground with an ancient symbol of love and peace than a dress made of meat (like the one she wore back in 2010). One - in fact two - of the sweetest outfits were worn by Amara and Leela Ajagu, the four- and two-year-old great nieces of Kamala Harris.

He's the partner of Kamala's niece, Meena, and was also the subject of a social media trawl after an eagle-eyed screen-shotter spied a pair of jaunty Dior Air Jordan 1 sneakers on the stairs during  Senator Amy Klobuchar's speech. He did get some stick, with tongue-in-cheek praise for ""making black history"" and ""daring to drip"" at a presidential inauguration. The shoes are limited edition and could get $10,000 on resale.

Kamala Harris also had a special security escort: Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman. Mr Goodman has been hailed as a hero after his actions during the storming of Capitol Hill earlier this month. Footage from inside the deadly insurrection shows the officer singlehandedly steering a mob away from the Senate chamber, while the lawmakers hid inside. The 'hero' Capitol police officer Mr Goodman accompanied Ms Harris in his new role as deputy Senate sergeant-at-arms. She took her oath with her trademark smile about to burst through the historic moment, and as President Biden took his the emotion was also evident on his wife Jill's face. And as the podium was handed from one storied speaker to another - from senators to longtime advisers of President Biden - one man made sure to jostle them to the side before they took the microphone, for their own protection of course. Podium wipe guy, as he became known, disinfected the stand between each speaker and was lauded (online) as one of the unsung heroes of the day.

Joe Biden and his presidential team have had nearly three months to plan out his first actions upon taking the oath of office, but executive action is the (relatively) easy part. His speech reflected the reality that he enters office with his top priorities already determined for him. His government will be responsible for distributing the coronavirus vaccine in an efficient and equitable way. After that, he will have to focus on the societal and economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. The virus has exacerbated income inequality and pushed many households to the brink of economic ruin. It's devastated the travel and hospitality industries and placed incredible strain on the finances of state and local governments. His pledge to seek unity will be tested early, as he pushes a sharply divided Congress to pass another, massive round of pandemic stimulus aid. If he wants to enact it quickly, he will need Republican support in the Senate, and already there are signs that some on the right may be lining up in opposition to more spending. Then there's Trump's Senate impeachment trial, which will present yet another challenge to national unity.

"Terry Pratchett's 'inspiring' house for saleHis most famous Discworld novels were written in the house in Somerset, the estate agent says.","The former Western Daily Press journalist lived in the property from 1970 until 1994 An ""inspiring"" house previously owned by fantasy writer Sir Terry Pratchett has been put on the market. The creator of the Discworld series lived in the 18th Century property, called Gaze Cottage, in the village of Rowberrow, Somerset, from 1970 until 1994. Sir Terry died aged 66in 2015, eight years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He wrote more than 70 books during his career and completed his final book in 2014. The property is a detached country cottage At the turn of the century, Sir Terry was Britain's second most-read author, beaten only by JK Rowling. In August 2007, it was reported he had suffered a stroke, but the following December he announced that he had been diagnosed with a very rare form of early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The fitted kitchen is in the older half of the house Ruth Treasure-Smith, from Robin King Estate Agent, said: ""He wrote most of his most famous novels in that house in the 80s. ""The house must have been inspiring. The current owner purchased the property from Terry Pratchett and has lived at the house since."" She said he had received letters to the house addressed to the ""Hogfather"", a quirky and satirical character from the Death collection in the Discworld series.

Can you catch coronavirus outside?,"This video can not be played Lockdown easing: The BBCâs science editor David Shukman explains the risks and what to watch for in different locations. More of us are now able to meet up outside with friends and family. ""The evidence is very clear that outdoor spaces are safer than indoors,"" Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical officer, has said. Researchers say infections can happen outdoors, but thechances are massively reduced.,external Fresh air disperses and dilutes the virus. It also helps to evaporate the liquid droplets in which it is carried. On top of that, ultraviolet light from the Sunshould kill any virus that's out in the open.,external Lockdown rules are changing again - what's happening? Even so, there are a handful of cases where it's believed that infections did happen outside. One study found that two men in China talking face-to-face for at least 15 minuteswas enough to spread the virus.,external If someone's infected - maybe without realising it because they have no symptoms - they'll be releasing the virus as they breathe, especially if they cough. Some of that will be carried in droplets, most of which will quickly fall to the ground but could reach your eyes, nose or mouth if you're within 2m (6ft) of them. So the advice is to avoid being face-to-face if you're that close. The infected person will also release smaller particles called aerosols. Indoors, these can accumulate in the air and be a hazard. Outside they should rapidly disperse. Walking past someone in the street or having a jogger run by you, means you're close together for a few seconds at most. Fleeting encounters are highly unlikely to be long enough for enough virus to reach you. Prof Cath Noakes, an airborne infection expert from the University of Leeds, says someone would have to cough right at you, at the moment you're inhaling, for an infection to happen. But she also warns of friends spending a long time together outdoors and assuming they're completely safe. Going for a run with someone and following close behind them for 20 minutes or more, breathing in their slipstream, might be a problem, she says. ""The sad fact is that your greatest risk is from the people you know."" What are the rules for meeting up with friends? What are the rules for pubs and restaurants? Scientists have found that the risks arelow in fully open spaces.,external But they worry about areas that are not just crowded but also partly enclosed, such as market stalls or bus shelters. Whenever the air is still, it can become stagnant and contaminated. It's in environments like narrow pathways or busy queues that government advisers say face coverings may be needed. If an infected person coughs into their hand and then wipes it on a surface, the virus may survive there for hours. Researchers in the US found virus on the handles of rubbish bins and the buttons at pedestrian crossings. They reckon this may have led to infections in the area, though at a relatively low level compared with other ways of spreading the virus. In colder weather, the virus may last longer in the open - it thrives in low temperatures. Added to that, your nose runs in the cold, and a common reaction is to wipe it with your hand. That might raise the chances of surfaces becoming contaminated. However, many scientists now think that the amount of virus likely to be left on a surface in this way would be minimal, and would disperse within an hour or two. ""The chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small,"" saysProf Emmanuel Goldman of Rutgers University.,external All the evidence points to the vast majority of Covid infections happening indoors. The virus is transmitted through human interaction, especially when people are together for a long period of time. That means the virus can spread in several different ways. Either infected droplets can land on people close by, or contaminate surfaces that others touch. And if rooms are stuffy, tiny virus particles can accumulate in the air and get inhaled. It's in householdswhere all of this is most likely to happen.,external Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean? What are the social distancing rules?

How will mass testing help fight Covid?,"Extra Covid tests are taking place across England and Scotland in areas where new variants have been found. This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes. Wherever you are in the UK, if you havesymptomsyou should book afree test online,external. You will be sent to a testing site or have a testing kit sent to your home. If you have problems booking, call 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0300 303 2713 in Scotland. Anyone in England can now get free lateral flow tests each week - even if they do not have symptoms. These can be orderedonline,external, by calling 119, or can be collected from test centres and pharmacies. Anyone in Scotland can alsoorder free lateral flow tests online,external, or collect them from test centres. How do I get my two free tests a week? Anyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days.NHS Test and Tracewill tell their contacts to isolate if necessary.

When will schools reopen?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

Will the vaccine stop you spreading Covid? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?
