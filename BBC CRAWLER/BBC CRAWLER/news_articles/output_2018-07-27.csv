Christine Lampard's stalker sentenced,"Christine Lampard said the ""disturbing"" tweets caused her so much concern she showed them to her husband A stalker has been sentenced for bombarding TV presenter Christine Lampard with tweets which referred to her ""gravestone"" and ""crucifixion"". Christof King, 39, also sent letters and turned up at the house the presenter shares with footballer husband Frank Lampard more than once. At Isleworth Crown Court King, of Mowbray Road, Brent, received a nine-month sentence suspended for two years. King had pleaded guilty to stalking, but denied sending the tweets. He was found to have sent the online messages after a Newton hearing on 5 June. Christof King pleaded guilty to stalking last week but denied he sent the tweets Mrs Lampard previously told the court she had to hide in a bedroom with the housekeeper after King appeared at the house. King, who changed his name by deed poll from Jon Dunningham in April 2016, harassed Ms Lampard between January 2015 and October 2017. In one tweet he said he could ""hear the scratch of nails as I sharpen them ahead of your crucifixion"" while another read: ""I am planning the words that will go on your gravestone."" Prosecutor Warwick Tatford told the court King had even written to the Lampard's dog Minnie where he said he was so pleased to meet the animal ""after all these years"", and how he felt they ""developed some kind of special bond in that moment."" Neither Christine or Frank Lampard were in court to hear the sentencing Defending, John Oliver said King had ""received the message loud and clear"" that the Lampards did not want contact from him. He said King, who had initially contacted the TV presenter for career advice, had a delusional disorder ""which has over the year raised its head, but has without treatment or intervention gone into remission on a number of occasions"". As well as his suspended sentence, King was given an indefinite restraining order that bans him from contacting both Christine and Frank Lampard, and prevents him from going within 100 yards of their home or entering their street. He was also handed a 15-day community order for rehabilitation activity, as well as 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Robin Johnson warned King that if he breaches the restraining order, he could face up to five years in prison. ""Those in the public eye are used to receiving contact from strangers. But they, like anyone else, are entitled to protection from the law when some contact moves from simply irritation to being criminal,"" he said.

Boys jailed for teen's torture murder,"Kai Fisher-Dixon, Shuayb Mahomud, Tremayne Gray, Omarion Stephens and Abdulqaliq Mohamed were jailed for murder Five teenagers who ""tortured"" a 15-year-old boy to death have been sentenced to life in prison. Kai Fisher-Dixon, Shuayb Mahomud, Tremayne Gray, Omarion Stephens and Abdulqaliq Mohamed attacked Jacob Abraham in Waltham Cross in December. The boys, all aged 15 and from Enfield, north London, denied murder but were found guilty by a jury after a five-week trial at St Albans Crown Court. They can be named after the judge Mr Justice Edis lifted anonymity orders. Gray and Stephens were sentenced to serve at least 14 years, Mohamed was sentenced to at least 13 years, and Fisher-Dixon and Mahomud handed 12-year terms. The judge said: ""The purpose was to punish him [Jacob] by the deliberate infliction of serious pain and humiliation, but to leave him alive. ""That was what I meant when I used the word torture in the course of the hearing and I do not shrink from it."" Jacob Abraham died 10 days before his 16th birthday Jurors heard how Stephens and Gray wielded the knives but the prosecution said all of the boys were responsible for Jacob's death, having lured him to the scene to suffer ""at least really serious harm"". During the trial, the court heard that Jacob had been involved in a number of fights and got into an argument with the AP gang. After posting an online challenge, he was stabbed eight times in an alleyway behind his home on 7 December. Three of the teenagers, who were just 14 at the time, had to change out of their school uniforms before carrying out the ""punishment mission"". The court heard they wanted to teach Jacob a lesson because he was a rival to their ""county lines"" drug operation. The boys were caught on CCTV at Waltham Cross bus station on the night of the murder In a victim impact statement, Jacob's mother said his death had left ""a large hole"". Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said: ""This was a tragic and upsetting case due to the young age of both the victim and the offenders, who are just children. ""If those boys had chosen not to carry knives that night, I truly believe Jacob would still be alive today.""

CBS investigates claims of misconduct,"Moonves and his wife, CBS host Julie Chen US television network CBS says it is investigating reports detailing allegations of sexual misconduct by its top executive Les Moonves. The claims of unwanted kissing and touching have been published in the New Yorker magazine. In a statement, CBS said it was looking into the allegations and would ""take appropriate action"". Mr Moonves, 68, told the magazine that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable"" in the past. ""Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely,"" he said. ""But I always understood and respected... that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career."" CBS' stock price dropped by 6% on Friday as reports of the New Yorker article trickled out. How can businesses tackle sexual harassment?,external What has #MeToo actually changed?,external Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo,external The exposÃ© is by Ronan Farrow, who this year won a Pulitzer Prize for detailingassault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.,external Some of the alleged incidents are said to have occurred more than 20 years ago. In a statement, CBS said: ""All allegations of personal misconduct are to be taken seriously. CBS news presenter Charlie Rose (right) was fired for sexual misconduct earlier this year ""The Independent Directors of CBS have committed to investigating claims that violate the Company's clear policies in that regard. ""Upon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the Board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action."" Mr Moonves, who is chairman and chief executive of CBS, has yet to respond to BBC requests for comment. Six women have made allegations against him, including the actress Illeana Douglas who told the New Yorker that he violently kissed her. ""The physicality of it was horrendous,"" she said. ""You think, how long is this going to go on? I couldn't get him off me."" All of the women say they believe their careers suffered because they rejected his advances.

Mr Moonves has long been considered one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, helping steer the network broadcaster into the digital age. Analysis by James Cook, BBC Los Angeles He started out as a TV actor before developing Friends and ER with Warner Bros and then reviving an ailing CBS with hits including CSI, Everybody Loves Raymond and, most recently, The Big Bang Theory. For a decade under his leadership, CBS has been the most-watched network in the US, narrowly retaining its crown ahead of NBC in the 2017-18 season. Mr Moonves earned $69.3m (Â£53m) in 2017 making him one of the highest paid chief executives in the world. But his tenure at the top of the network, which he joined in 1995, has been marked by a power struggle with Shari Redstone who, through her family's business National Amusements, is the controlling shareholder in both CBS and the media conglomerate, Viacom. Ms Redstone and Mr Moonves are currently battling in the courts as he tries to thwart her plan to merge the two companies. He has been married to Julie Chen - host of CBS' Big Brother - since 2004.

Force offers 'poor service' says chief,"This video can not be played West Midlands Police chief Dave Thompson says he is ""sorry"" about poor service The chief constable of England's second largest police force has admitted it sometimes provides a poor service that fails to meet public expectations. Dave Thompson apologised and said budget cuts and fewer officers policing a ""wider spread of crime"" had left West Midlands Police at a point where it was not sustainable to tackle everything. He said he was ""drawing the bar higher"" as to what would be investigated. But the Home Office said every crime and allegation should be investigated. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Thompson said it was very challenging to balance ""all things at once"". ""The level of calls we're receiving this summer are very challenging [and] sometimes that service that we're providing [at] those peak times doesn't meet what the public expect. ""I get that. Sometimes that service will be a poor service, sometimes actually the service is what we can and say we will offer, and sometimes that might not always be what the public want to see."" Taxi driver Talal Hassan said he did not hear from police for six days after he was assaulted by passengers He said cuts across all public services had seen more vulnerable people coming into contact with police while ""the list"" of crimes, such as modern-day slavery and gun and gang crime, that must be investigated had grown. ""We may be dealing with it over the phone where they would like to see us and I'm sorry about that but that is the reality of where policing is now,"" he said. ""And on some occasions yes, you are right, the service will not meet what I want it to do and it will not meet the response that the public absolutely will want when they're at a time of vulnerability. ""We are drawing the bar higher than we used to as to what we will investigate."" Mr Thompson said he accepted ""drawing the bar higher"" - and perhaps no longer investigating offences such as criminal damage, car thefts and shoplifting - could undermine public confidence, but it was ""simply because of the resource available."" He stressed he was not talking about offences such as serious assaults. Taxi driver Talal Hassan was attacked by passengers in Kingstanding, Birmingham, in May. He said they threw ""a pile of bricks"" on him, hit his elbow and repeatedly hit his side causing severe bruising. He informed police after the incident but said he was not visited by officers for six days. ""I don't feel safe because if I work and someone attacks me - this is the police response? ""The funny thing is the guys who attack people always say that they're not scared of the police because they feel they will not get caught. ""That's what they tell you... they don't have any respect of law."" Mr Hassan said he was attacked with bricks and left badly bruised In November, leaked documents revealedWest Midlands Police was smaller than it had ever been in its historyafter losing almost 2,300 officers since 2010. Overall, forces in England and Wales have hada 20% funding cut over seven years. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said the force had been ""inundated by violent crime"" and that the homicide team was at ""breaking point"". ""It's extremely difficult to see how we can sustain what the public would call an acceptable level of policing,"" he said, adding that the pressures on the force meant ""things that frankly the public expect from the police are just not being done in the quality that people would expect"". ""It's a deadly equation,"" he said. Such is the pressure on officers, Mr Thompson went out on the front line himselfto help deal with a ""very high call demand"" across the force. The force had deployed many staff to help clear a ""backlog"" and he followed up three calls. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? What's happened to police numbers? West Midlands Police force 'smallest in its history' But Birmingham Edgbaston MP Preet Gill said Mr Thompson's comments overall meant ""basic policing"" was being overlooked. ""What the police ought to be doing is making sure they are absolutely taking the concerns of victims very, very seriously and responding to crime and clearly it's not happening."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""Police have the resources they need to carry out this vital work and we have provided a strong and comprehensive settlement that is increasing total investment in the police system by over Â£460m in 2018-19. ""West Midlands Police will receive Â£534.3m in direct resource funding in 2018-19, including council tax precept - a cash increase of Â£9.9m compared with 2017-18."" Because the nature of crime is changing, the spokesman added, the policing minister had spoken to all forces to understand the demands they were facing. He said the home secretary had committed to prioritising police funding in next year's Spending Review.

Bear attacks family car in Bedfordshire safari park,"The North American black bears at Woburn Safari Park live on a 13 acre reserve A safari park has said it is not a ""petting zoo"" after a family were left ""terrified"" when a bear attacked their car. Sophie Mallaney, from Leighton Buzzard, was visiting Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire on Monday when a 6ft black bear climbed on the bonnet and began ""chewing away"" at the car. Ms Mallaney said no help came from wardens after they beeped their horn. But the park said: ""No horns were heard."" The car Sophie Mallaney was in suffered ""minor damage"" and the family is paying for the repairs, she said Ms Mallaney told the BBC that as her family drove through the park, the bear came towards them and started biting around the windscreen. She said they started beeping their horn when the bear climbed on to the bonnet. ""We were unhappy that no-one came to help,"" said Ms Mallaney, who added that visitors were told to sound their horn if they felt in danger. ""We did, and no-one came."" A spokesman for the park said the deputy head of the carnivore section was on patrol at the time, but that nothing was heard. ""He would have attended,"" the spokesman said. Woburn has 10 bears, four males and six females, and they live outside 365 days a year Ms Mallaney, who was in the car with her mother, sister and nephew, said the bear eventually left her family's car and approached another vehicle. A park spokesman apologised for the bear ""worrying the family"" and said the incident had been investigated. ""We would like to issue a reminder to visitors that we are a safari park as opposed to a petting zoo,"" he added. The park says black bears are opportunistic eaters and most of their diet consists of grasses, roots, berries, insects and fish He said that during ""road safari experiences"" the animals could come close to vehicles, so a strict safety policy was in place, which guests were instructed to follow. The park has offered Ms Mallaney's family a VIP meet and greet at the park, but she said: ""I don't think we will be going back to the safari park any time soon.""

Ed Westwick will not be prosecuted in US,"British actor Ed Westwick will not be prosecuted over three sexual assault allegations he faced in the US. The Los Angeles District Attorney said it would not pursue the cases against the star of Gossip Girl and White Gold. There was ""insufficient evidence"" for a prosecution to go ahead, the investigators said. The 30-year-old star vehemently denied the ""unverified and provably untrue"" allegations when two women accused him of rape last November. Prosecutors said witnesses identified by the first two alleged victims were ""not able to provide information that would enable the prosecution to prove either incident beyond a reasonable doubt"". They said they were unable to contact the third alleged victim. Prosecutors said other women had alleged unwanted touching against the actor, but that these claims would not be pursued because they fell outside the statute of limitations. After the allegations emerged last year, the BBC cut Westwick out of its Agatha Christie drama Ordeal by Innocence and ""paused"" filming on the second series of BBC Two comedy White Gold.

"Boy, 6, dead after pellet gun shooting","Stanley was visiting the house at the time of the incident on Thursday A six-year-old boy has died after being shot with a pellet gun at a house in East Yorkshire. Stanley Metcalf was injured at a house in Church Lane in the village of Sproatley, at 16:00 BST on Thursday. He was taken to hospital where he died. Police said he had been visiting a family member and his death appeared to have been a ""tragic accident"". Stanley's great-grandmother said he had a twin sister who ""loved him to bits"" and they ""did everything together"". The 84-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: ""I don't know how you're supposed to explain things like that to a six-year-old girl."" Yorkshire breaking news: Lightning strikes cause rail chaos; Three homes struck by lightning She described Stanley as a ""brainy, kind little boy"" and said the family were devastated. ""I've just been in floods of tears ever since it happened,"" she said. ""I couldn't even sleep last night, just thinking about him and how tragic it is."" Police remain at the scene in the village of Sproatley Det Ch Insp Mark Goulding of Humberside Police said: ""We're still investigating the circumstances of exactly what happened, but initial indications are that this was a tragic accident involving a pellet gun. ""We haven't made any arrests in connection with the incident, but we are speaking to a number of family members to assist us with our enquiries. ""Our thoughts are with Stanley's family, who have asked that they be given privacy at this very difficult time."" Det Ch Insp Goulding said other family members were in the house at the time of the incident and officers were ""still trying to piece it together and work out what happened"". Responding to suggestions that the boy had been visiting his great-grandfather, he said: ""I can't comment at this stage of the investigation on that."" He added that officers were looking into whether the pellet gun involved required a licence, and, if so, whether its owner had one. Sproatley is a village to the east of Hull and incidents where the police are called are rare. It's very quiet here, with just over 1,000 residents. News quickly spread of the tragic incident and neighbours expressed to me their shock and sadness at what had happened. The house belongs to a member of Stanley's family, police said One man who lives nearby said: ""What can you say? It goes out to the family. You can't even guess how they are feeling.

Prince Charles 'misled' by abuse bishop,"Prince Charles was photographed with the then Bishop of Gloucester Peter Ball in 1993 The Prince of Wales has told an inquiry he did not seek to influence a police investigation into a paedophile bishop. A written submission from the prince was read to an inquiry into the abuse inflicted by former Bishop Peter Ball. Prince Charles said he felt ""deep personal regret"" for trusting Ball when initial reports of abuse emerged, years before he was jailed in 2015. In a 1997 letter, the prince said of a critic of Ball: ""I'll see this horrid man off if he tries anything."" In a series of letters between Prince Charles and the Bishop, read to theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,external(IICSA), Ball spoke of a ""malicious campaign"" against him and ""harassment"" by ""fraudulent"" accusers. In a letter to Ball in 1995, the prince said: ""I wish I could do more. I feel so desperately strong about the monstrous wrongs that have been done to you."" In 1997, the prince wrote a letter in which he described an apparent accuser as a ""ghastly man... up to his dastardly tricks again"". The Prince of Wales said he was ""misled"" and his ""heart goes out to the victims"" In 2015 Ball, 86, was jailed for 32 monthsfor offences against 18 teenagers and men. In the written submission, read by the counsel to the inquiry Fiona Scolding, the prince said he had been ""misled"" and at the time ""there was on my part a presumption of good faith"" in relation to Ball. He added: ""I first became aware of Peter Ball during the 1980s. He was later appointed Bishop of Gloucester when he became my local diocesan bishop. ""Peter Ball told me he had been involved in some sort of 'indiscretion' which prompted his resignation as my local bishop. ""He emphasised that one individual that I now understand to be Mr Neil Todd had made a complaint to the police, that the police had investigated the matter, and the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to take no action. ""That sequence of events seemed to support Mr Ball's claim that the complaint emanated from one individual and that individual bore a grudge against him and was persecuting him, that the complaint was false, but that the individual had nonetheless profited from the complaint by selling his story. ""Events later demonstrated beyond any doubt, to my deep regret, that I, along with many others, has been misled."" Peter Ball was jailed for sex offences against teenagers and young men which were carried out over 30 years The prince said in the 1980s and 1990s there was ""a presumption that people such as Bishops could be taken at their word and, as a result of the high office they held, were worthy of trust and confidence"". He said: ""Throughout my life my position has occasionally brought me into contact with prominent people who have subsequently been accused of serious wrong doing. ""Rather than rushing to private judgement I have always taken the view that the judicial process should take its course."" Knowing what we know now, there's no doubt the prince's letters to Bishop Ball in the 1990s - in particular his expression of sympathy for the ""monstrous wrongs"" supposedly done to him - are embarrassing. Looking back at them they reveal a degree of naivety on the part of the prince. But it must be said Charles wasn't alone around that time in demonstrating a disinclination to doubt the bona fides of a supposedly charismatic figure. As we now know, major institutions like the Church, NHS, BBC, were notably reluctant to ask uncomfortable questions and to make proper inquiries. In the prince's case there is a sense, as his statement says, of ""deep personal regret"" that he was one of the many deceived by the bishop. The fact the prince has opened his personal correspondence for scrutiny is a recognition, his officials say, of the importance the prince attaches to the inquiry's work. Above all, there's a sense of frustration and anger that what Charles calls his ""presumption of good faith"" was so grievously betrayed. The prince added that that the ""true context and details"" of complaints against Ball ""did not come to my attention until the time of Mr Ball's trial and conviction in 2015"". ""I ceased contact with Mr Ball once the judicial process had concluded, and he was found guilty of serious offences against young people,"" he said. ""My heart goes out to the victims of abuse and I applaud their courage as they rebuild their lives and so often offer invaluable support to others who have suffered. ""It remains a source of deep personal regret that I was one of many who were deceived over a long period of time, about the true nature of Mr Ball's activities."" The inquiry continues.

"Man arrested over murder of girl, 13","Lucy McHugh's body was found near Southampton's Sports Centre on Thursday morning A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl whose body was found in woodland in Southampton. Lucy McHugh's body was found by a member of the public near Southampton Sports Centre at 07:45 BST on Thursday. Police said post-mortem tests were carried out earlier and some of Lucy's injuries were ""unexplained"". The arrested man, who is 24 and from Southampton, is also being held on suspicion of having sexual activity with a child. He remains in custody. Det Supt Paul Barton said Lucy had left her home in Mansel Road East at 09:30 BST on Wednesday 25 July and did not return home that evening as expected. He said she was reported missing to police that night. Mr Barton added: ""We're really keen to know what she did after leaving her house and would ask that anyone who saw her, had contact with her or knows of her movements on Wednesday contacts the incident room."" Police say Lucy was last seen wearing a black jacket with white sleeves, with the logo for the band Falling in Reverse on the front and RADKE 01 in red on the back. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts go out to Lucy's family and friends at this terrible time,"" said Mr Barton.

Why does rain smell so good?,"It turns out it's not just gratitude that makes rain smell so appealing after a long period of dry weather. There's actually some chemistry involved too. Bacteria, plants and even lightning can all play a role in the pleasant smell we experience after a thunderstorm; that of clean air and wet earth. Known as petrichor, the scent has long been chased by scientists and even perfumers for its enduring appeal. First named bytwo Australian researchers,externalin the 1960s, the warm, earthy fragrance we experience when rain hits dry ground is produced by bacteria. ""These critters are abundant in soil,"" explained Prof Mark Buttner, head of molecular microbiology at the John Innes Centre. ""So when you're saying you smell damp soil, actually what you're smelling is a molecule being made by a certain type of bacteria,"" he told the BBC. That molecule, geosmin, is produced by Streptomyces. Present in most healthy soils, these bacteria are also used to create commercial antibiotics. Drops of water hitting the groundcause geosmin to be released into the air, making it much more abundant after a rain shower. ""Lots of animals are sensitive but human beings are extremely sensitive to it,"" added Prof Buttner. Isabel Bear and RG Thomas, the researchers who first named the scent petrichor, found that as early as the 1960s it was being captured to sell as a scent called ""matti ka attar"" in Uttar Pradesh, India. Now, geosmin is becoming more common as a perfume ingredient. ""It's a really potent material and it smells just like the concrete when the rain hits it,"" said perfumer Marina Barcenilla. ""There's something very primitive and very primal about the smell."" ""Even when you dilute it down to the parts per billion range, [humans] can still detect it,"" she added. Yet we also have an odd relationship with geosmin - while we are drawn to its scent, many of us dislike its taste. Geosmin also gives beets their distinctive earthy flavour Even though it is not toxic to humans, the tiniest amount can put people off mineral water or wine when it is present. ""We do not know why we dislike geosmin,"" commented Prof Jeppe Lund Nielsen from Aalborg University in Denmark. ""It is not toxic to humans in typical found ranges, but somehow we associate it with something negative,"" he added. Petrichor: The term: Coined by scientists Isabel Joy Bear and Richard Thomas in their 1964 article ""Nature of Argillaceous Odour"", published in the journal Nature. The word was coined from Greek petros, meaning ""stone"", and ichor, meaning ""the fluid that flows in the veins of the gods"" According to Prof Nielsen, research also indicates that geosmin could be related to terpenes - the source of scent in many plants. Terpenes are commonly produced by conifers like pine Rain could bring these fragrances out, says Prof Philip Stevenson, a research leader at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""Often the plant chemicals that smell pleasant are produced in leaf hairs... and the rain may damage these, releasing the compounds. ""Rain may also break dry plant material releasing chemicals in a similar way to when you crush dried herbs - the smell becomes stronger,"" he told the BBC. Very dry periods may also slow down plant metabolism, with renewed rainfall giving it a kick start and causing plants to release a pleasant scent. Thunderstorms have their role to play too, creating the clean, sharp scent of ozone - caused by lightning and other electrical discharges in the atmosphere. Prof Maribeth Stolzenburg of the University of Mississippi explains: ""Besides the lightning, the thunderstorm and especially the rain will improve the air quality. Much of the dust, aerosols, and other particulates are rained out and the air clears."" Follow Maryon Twitter,external.

CBS investigates claims of misconductShares in the TV network drop on allegations of sexual harassment by chairman Les Moonves.US & Canada,"Moonves and his wife, CBS host Julie Chen US television network CBS says it is investigating reports detailing allegations of sexual misconduct by its top executive Les Moonves. The claims of unwanted kissing and touching have been published in the New Yorker magazine. In a statement, CBS said it was looking into the allegations and would ""take appropriate action"". Mr Moonves, 68, told the magazine that he ""may have made some women uncomfortable"" in the past. ""Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely,"" he said. ""But I always understood and respected... that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career."" CBS' stock price dropped by 6% on Friday as reports of the New Yorker article trickled out. How can businesses tackle sexual harassment?,external What has #MeToo actually changed?,external Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo,external The exposÃ© is by Ronan Farrow, who this year won a Pulitzer Prize for detailingassault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.,external Some of the alleged incidents are said to have occurred more than 20 years ago. In a statement, CBS said: ""All allegations of personal misconduct are to be taken seriously. CBS news presenter Charlie Rose (right) was fired for sexual misconduct earlier this year ""The Independent Directors of CBS have committed to investigating claims that violate the Company's clear policies in that regard. ""Upon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the Board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action."" Mr Moonves, who is chairman and chief executive of CBS, has yet to respond to BBC requests for comment. Six women have made allegations against him, including the actress Illeana Douglas who told the New Yorker that he violently kissed her. ""The physicality of it was horrendous,"" she said. ""You think, how long is this going to go on? I couldn't get him off me."" All of the women say they believe their careers suffered because they rejected his advances. A CBS statement on behalf of Mr Moonves said he acknowledged trying to kiss Ms Douglas but denied sexual assault and intimidation.

Mr Moonves has long been considered one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, helping steer the network broadcaster into the digital age. Analysis by James Cook, BBC Los Angeles He started out as a TV actor before developing Friends and ER with Warner Bros and then reviving an ailing CBS with hits including CSI, Everybody Loves Raymond and, most recently, The Big Bang Theory. For a decade under his leadership, CBS has been the most-watched network in the US, narrowly retaining its crown ahead of NBC in the 2017-18 season. Mr Moonves earned $69.3m (Â£53m) in 2017 making him one of the highest paid chief executives in the world. But his tenure at the top of the network, which he joined in 1995, has been marked by a power struggle with Shari Redstone who, through her family's business National Amusements, is the controlling shareholder in both CBS and the media conglomerate, Viacom. Ms Redstone and Mr Moonves are currently battling in the courts as he tries to thwart her plan to merge the two companies. He has been married to Julie Chen - host of CBS' Big Brother - since 2004. The two wed less than two weeks after he finalised his divorce from Nancy Wiesenfeld, to whom he had been married since 1978, according to the Hollywood Reporter. From left: Actor Bryan Cranston, host James Corden, LA Bafta CEO Chantal Rickards, and Mr Moonves During the 2016 presidential election, he was criticised for saying Donald Trump's candidacy ""may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS"".

Drill music video stopped by armed policeThe Metropolitan Police says it was responding to reports of a firearm.Newsbeat,"This video can not be played The group was said to be between the ages of 16 and 19 Armed police have stopped the filming of a drill music video to carry out a stop and search. The Metropolitan Police says it was called to London Fields in east London after reports of a firearm being seen. Part of the stop and search was filmed, with a group said to be aged between 16 and 19 told to put their hands above their heads by police holding guns. The Met described the searches as ""satisfactory"" and said there were no arrests. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

The 25-year-old told Newsbeat he was filming a video for drill artist Balistik, but had only managed to get one shot before being approached by armed police. Pacman says that they spotted a police helicopter circling overhead, but at first didn't take any notice.

""I said to him 'Hold on, I'm a company director - I'm here hired on a job."" Pacman, who hadn't obtained permission from Hackney Council to film in the park, alleges multiple people approached the police to accuse them of racially profiling the group during the search.

Drill music has been linked to violence in the capital by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. YouTube deleted content which she says glamorises violence at Ms Dick's request. Pacman, who's shot videos for Lady Leshurr and Paigey Cakey, as well as prominent drill acts like Loski, says he doesn't see the link between the music and violence. ""When you're making music you can't be in two places at once - you can't be touring or in the studio and out committing crime as well,"" he says. ""The only side of drill music I'd say possibly incites violence would be diss tracks, and that's like anything in life. If you diss somebody on social media, if you diss somebody in real life, if you diss them through music - it's gonna cause problems.""

Many say that people can't wear balaclavas in public places and expect not to be stopped by the police - while others have said that the police profiled the group. Pacman thinks that they should have been treated as though they were shooting a film - and that the Met's response was out of proportion. ""For them to bring the police helicopter, so many armed police and aim at these kids when nothing's happened? That's where the problem lies. ""If they were normal officers who came over and didn't aim any firearms at them and spoke to them with reason, and explained what was happening in a way that everyone could understand, it would've been fine.

The drug causing chaos in prisons," Warning: Contains offensive language Rob was often the last prisoner into the visitors’ room. On one of Alison’s previous attempts to see her son, he hadn’t turned up at all. The officers simply said they couldn’t find him. Now she was here again on one of the hottest days of summer 2016. The room - big enough to hold 40 tables - was sweltering. Alison and her husband Chris sat down in the middle of the room - waiting and watching intently. A single file of inmates queued - each was methodically patted down before coming in. Alison didn’t look away for a second - she wanted to see Rob the moment he arrived. Despite his distinctive close-cropped red hair, it was sometimes hard to make him out among the identical blue and white check shirts worn by the other prisoners. But this time he was unmissable. Every visitor turned to see Rob enter the room. “He was walking like a zombie with his back arched, completely out of it. I was absolutely shocked,” his mother recalls. Alison leapt up and ran to Rob. Chris, who was queueing for coffee, also rushed to his son. Rob looked on the verge of collapse. Chris called his son’s name, says Alison. “Rob said, ‘Is that you, Dad?’” They brought their son over to where they were sitting. “I was shouting, ‘Can somebody come and help us?’” says Alison. As Rob sat down, she noticed that he had a T-shirt on underneath his prison-issue top - two layers despite the heat. Alison wanted to cool him down. “As I pulled the T-shirt down I noticed that he had ‘twat’ drawn across his chest in Biro.” Alison shouted again for help from nearby prison officers. The medical team escorted Rob out of the visitors’ room and checked him over. They denied he was under the influence of Spice, but his mother was convinced. “It was obvious he’d taken it, we know he had. I was scared for him and I felt that he was humiliated.” Also in the visitors’ room that day was Ben, an inmate who had served time in six prisons and was then inside after a fraud conviction. He was talking to his girlfriend when Rob entered the room. “I’d seen Robert about, always dazed, high all the time.” Rob and Ben were being held on the same wing. But it was only after seeing the episode in the visitors’ room that Ben got to know Rob. “He came in doubled over backwards as if he was going to fall over, sweating. “When the parents sat down I told them, ‘I’ve seen him on my wing, I will keep an eye on him.’” Rob had been transferred to The Mount prison on 11 May 2016 at the age of 24, after serving a large part of his sentence in HMP Peterborough. It marked one of the final stages of a sad decline. He had been someone that people loved. One friend would later describe his “wildly engaging smile and his eccentric sense of humour”. Another wrote: “Swimming in the park on boiling hot days will always stay with me, as will making dens and climbing trees - always in places we shouldn’t.” But Alison had seen a big change in Rob in his penultimate year at secondary school. Previously a sporty child, playing rugby and cricket at county level, he and his friends then started to smoke cannabis. The drug was supplied by one friend in particular. “He was able to supply them with whatever they wanted and they were impressionable. “A lot of his friends got through that stage but for Rob, I realise now, from the age of 18 it affected his mental health. That’s when his behaviour became quite unpredictable.” There is evidence that cannabis can have an effect on teenagers’ mental health. A 2015 study by King’s College London found that the risk of psychosis was five times higher for those who smoked potent cannabis every day compared with non-users. Rob didn’t seem built to cope with addiction. In his early 20s he travelled to India three times.  He had always been interested in the spirituality of India - but his mother thinks he was really just trying to escape from his addiction. On one of his trips he had to be picked up from Dubai airport by his father. Rob had experienced a drug-induced breakdown and was in custody after stealing alcohol from an airport shop. In the year before being sent to prison in the UK, his alcohol and drug addiction led to a string of shoplifting offences and then robbery. One evening in November 2015 he demanded money from a man leaving a supermarket. When the man refused, he punched him in the face. Rob was arrested and pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and theft. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison for those offences, with another three months added from a previous suspended sentence. Alison says Rob was drunk at the time of the robbery and on anti-psychotic medication. He was full of remorse although he had little memory of exactly what he had done. Rob was classed as a vulnerable person on entering prison because he had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis. “He finally was sent to prison after he had been diagnosed with a mental illness,” Alison says. “As his family, we were relieved, thinking the prison system will sort this out now.” Warning: Contains offensive language Rob was often the last prisoner into the visitors’ room. On one of Alison’s previous attempts to see her son, he hadn’t turned up at all. The officers simply said they couldn’t find him. Now she was here again on one of the hottest days of summer 2016. The room - big enough to hold 40 tables - was sweltering. Alison and her husband Chris sat down in the middle of the room - waiting and watching intently. A single file of inmates queued - each was methodically patted down before coming in. Alison didn’t look away for a second - she wanted to see Rob the moment he arrived. Despite his distinctive close-cropped red hair, it was sometimes hard to make him out among the identical blue and white check shirts worn by the other prisoners. But this time he was unmissable. Every visitor turned to see Rob enter the room. “He was walking like a zombie with his back arched, completely out of it. I was absolutely shocked,” his mother recalls. Alison leapt up and ran to Rob. Chris, who was queueing for coffee, also rushed to his son. Rob looked on the verge of collapse. Chris called his son’s name, says Alison. “Rob said, ‘Is that you, Dad?’” They brought their son over to where they were sitting. “I was shouting, ‘Can somebody come and help us?’” says Alison. As Rob sat down, she noticed that he had a T-shirt on underneath his prison-issue top - two layers despite the heat.Alison wanted to cool him down. “As I pulled the T-shirt down I noticed that he had ‘twat’ drawn across his chest in Biro.” Alison shouted again for help from nearby prison officers. The medical team escorted Rob out of the visitors’ room and checked him over. They denied he was under the influence of Spice, but his mother was convinced. “It was obvious he’d taken it, we know he had. I was scared for him and I felt that he was humiliated.” Also in the visitors’ room that day was Ben, an inmate who had served time in six prisons and was then inside after a fraud conviction. He was talking to his girlfriend when Rob entered the room. “I’d seen Robert about, always dazed, high all the time.” Rob and Ben were being held on the same wing. But it was only after seeing the episode in the visitors’ room that Ben got to know Rob. “He came in doubled over backwards as if he was going to fall over, sweating. “When the parents sat down I told them, ‘I’ve seen him on my wing, I will keep an eye on him.’” Rob had been transferred to The Mount prison on 11 May 2016 at the age of 24, after serving a large part of his sentence in HMP Peterborough. It marked one of the final stages of a sad decline. He had been someone that people loved. One friend would later describe his “wildly engaging smile and his eccentric sense of humour”. Another wrote: “Swimming in the park on boiling hot days will always stay with me, as will making dens and climbing trees - always in places we shouldn’t.” But Alison had seen a big change in Rob in his penultimate year at secondary school. Previously a sporty child, playing rugby and cricket at county level, he and his friends then started to smoke cannabis. The drug was supplied by one friend in particular. “He was able to supply them with whatever they wanted and they were impressionable. “A lot of his friends got through that stage but for Rob, I realise now, from the age of 18 it affected his mental health. That’s when his behaviour became quite unpredictable.” There is evidence that cannabis can have an effect on teenagers’ mental health. A 2015 study by King’s College London found that the risk of psychosis was five times higher for those who smoked potent cannabis every day compared with non-users. Rob didn’t seem built to cope with addiction. In his early 20s he travelled to India three times. He had always been interested in the spirituality of India - but his mother thinks he was really just trying to escape from his addiction. On one of his trips he had to be picked up from Dubai airport by his father. Rob had experienced a drug-induced breakdown and was in custody after stealing alcohol from an airport shop. In the year before being sent to prison in the UK, his alcohol and drug addiction led to a string of shoplifting offences and then robbery. One evening in November 2015 he demanded money from a man leaving a supermarket. When the man refused, he punched him in the face. Rob was arrested and pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and theft. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison for those offences, with another three months added from a previous suspended sentence. Alison says Rob was drunk at the time of the robbery and on anti-psychotic medication. He was full of remorse although he had little memory of exactly what he had done. Rob was classed as a vulnerable person on entering prison because he had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis. “He finally was sent to prison after he had been diagnosed with a mental illness,” Alison says. “As his family, we were relieved, thinking the prison system will sort this out now.” The Mount is built on the site of a former RAF station in the village of Bovingdon in Hertfordshire. You can still see the remains of the control tower. Another part of the old RAF base holds an outdoor market where you can get everything from cheap trainers to Chinese food. Once a tiny medieval village, Bovingdon expanded rapidly after World War Two and is now a 9,000-strong community, firmly ensconced in the London commuter belt. The prison is home to just under 1,000 men. The names of its wings mostly refer to WW2 bomber pilots - Lakes, Ellis, Fowler, Brister. It’s category C - a closed prison but one where inmates typically serve shorter sentences for more minor crimes. But being the nearest category C prison to London, it has a lot of prisoners from the capital. A lot of inner-city mentality lands in rural Hertfordshire, says Michael (not his real name), a prison officer with two decades of experience who has worked in The Mount. Short-staffing always causes problems. Experienced staff left and were not fully replaced. A high proportion of officers and managers had less than two years’ experience. Many other prisons have also been struggling. In November 2016, the then Justice Secretary Liz Truss announced plans for more funding and for 2,500 extra officers across the system in England and Wales. Up until then officer numbers had fallen from about 25,000 in 2010 to just 18,000. “A lot of problems are caused by staff shortages,” says Michael. But while staff shortages have caused many prisons to struggle, another factor has pushed some to the brink - Spice. Spice was originally a brand name but has come to be used generically for a number of synthetic replacements for cannabis created from the 1980s onwards. These substances were designed to mimic cannabis, but some experts say they can be up to 100 times more potent. Soon after their invention they were being used recreationally, marketed as “legal highs”. A rapid spread was to follow. By 2012, the drug was beginning to have a foothold in British prisons and by 2015 it was everywhere. Spice became illegal in May 2016, under the Psychoactive Substances Act. There was some progress, but the change in the law did not stop the drugs getting into prison. Ministry of Justice figures obtained by the BBC show Spice seizures in the six months after the ban were 20% down in prisons in England and Wales. But not a single month passed without Spice being seized in The Mount between October 2015 and June 2017. Every night, drones would fly in to deliver the drug, taking advantage of the absence of netting, a report by the prison's independent monitoring board noted. That was addressed and drone deliveries were declining, its report suggested last year, but drugs were still getting in. In February this year, 50 prisoners were randomly tested - 24 had taken a drug of some kind. Lots of prisons have problems with Spice, and the effect of this drug on prison life is chilling. “Spice is the worst drug I’ve ever seen,” says Michael, whose duties included administering drug tests. “Unless you see a full-on Spice attack you can’t imagine. It’s like they’re absolutely paralytically drunk but can also speak. “If you didn’t know better you would say they were fitting. It’s extreme.” As well as these dramatic zombie-like “attacks”, Spice has also been linked to a wave of self-inflicted deaths in prison. Figures from the Prison Ombudsman show that 79 prisoners died in England and Wales between June 2013 and September 2016 who were either known to use synthetic cannabinoids, or were strongly suspected to have taken them before death. In 42 concluded inquests from this period, 27 of the deaths were deemed to be self-inflicted. Michael says problems connected with Spice exacerbate short-staffing. He remembers three or four ambulances attending The Mount in a single day for separate Spice attacks. Officers have to accompany inmates to hospital. “The impact on staff is demoralising. For each person in hospital, that takes four staff out of the system for 24 hours.” In November 2016 alone there were 70 emergency service call outs, mainly for drug-related problems. More than half of those occurred in a single week. And the popularity of the drug in prisons creates a dangerous Spice economy.

More than half of those occurred in a single week. And the popularity of the drug in prisons creates a dangerous Spice economy. Like many other prisons, Spice was easy to get hold of in The Mount. But there were reports of a particularly virulent strain. It was known simply as Death. This type of Spice was widely available and led to a number of hospital visits, the prison’s Independent Monitoring Board said. Ben says cannabis was everywhere too. “When you come into my wing you smell so much weed, more than I’ve ever smelt outside. “Even an idiot officer comes to the wing, which they do every hour, and knows somebody’s smoking it there.” Once the drugs were in, many prisoners would do anything to get hold of them. The debt culture was so acute in The Mount, Michael says, that prisoners who owed money and goods to others were deliberately offending so they could get into the prison’s segregation unit, or be transferred to another prison. Ben remembers one particularly vicious assault in The Mount. “I went down to the laundry and four or five guys started on someone, punching and kicking him in the face. “It was so ferocious. His face was so mashed up he looked like he’d been hit by a car.” Ben was told the inmate was attacked because he had not settled a debt. While Rob was in The Mount, Alison received phone calls as regularly as once a week from her son on different prisoners’ mobile phones. Each time he was asking her to transfer money. “He told me it was for tobacco and if he didn’t get the money he would be beaten up. “I think what had happened was Robert has been given Spice on tick [credit] and then he had to pay it back.” Alison says she typically paid £25 each time. “I was scared for him. It’s very difficult.” Like many other prisons, Spice was easy to get hold of in The Mount. But there were reports of a particularly virulent strain. It was known simply as Death.

It’s very difficult.” Ben says addicts like Rob are especially vulnerable to bullying in prison. In Rob’s case he would buy things from “canteen” and then give them to other prisoners. Canteen is in effect a shop where each prisoner has a set allowance to spend and the goods are collected on Fridays. “Rob never spent any money from his canteen [on things for himself],” says Ben. “I told the officers, ‘Stop his canteen, let’s see who’s taking this from him because he’s got nothing in his room.’ “Who is it taking it from him? If he’s got money where’s the money going to? Why is nobody checking the bullying?” Other prisoners would stand alongside Rob, ready to take his items as soon as they were handed to him. This happened in plain sight in front of officers, says Ben, but they dismissed his concerns. “They’d say he’s an addict - he can deal with it. I said you can see he’s not capable of dealing with it.” Robert was an easy target for drug dealers inside prison, says Alison. On one occasion he was held hostage by another inmate for two hours. Alison obtained prison records of Rob’s mental and physical health inside The Mount. They said “staff could hear Mr Morris being punched and crying out in pain”. The records said: “When the hostage situation was resolved, Mr Morris denied that he was being punched, which was challenged by staff.” Rob told officers that he did not want to press charges and did not want to get other prisoners in trouble. Staff on Rob’s wing told mental health services that he was a regular Spice user and “allows other prisoners to punch [him] as payment”. “That’s what they do, they completely and utterly bully a vulnerable person,” says Alison. The Spice trade has cultivated bullying in many prisons, says Mike Trace, chief executive of the Forward Trust. The charity helps prisoners with drug and alcohol dependence and ran a centre in The Mount. Last year the trust stopped running rehabilitation courses because drugs were too readily available across the prison. “The scale of the consumption of Spice was also creating violence and intimidation problems because it was gang-led.” Prisoners undergo “Spice dares” - ridiculous challenges either while high on Spice or in return for more of the drug, says Ben. Their behaviour is erratic enough without being goaded or forced into worse. “I’ve seen people being dragged [around the floor] banging their heads into walls,” says Ben. “People watch people on Spice and they just see it as entertainment. This is what keeps them happy in prison.” Sexual violence was driven by the drug trade, Ben believes. “I’ve heard of inmates being offered spice for sexual favours. It’s a bit rampant actually.” Alison understands that Rob was subjected to sexual abuse inside the prison, recorded in his medical records as a “suspected assault”. She says her son’s release papers also showed he had received rape counselling. “I never asked Robert about that because it could humiliate him more.” She says on release that information was not passed on to his probation officer, psychiatrist or his mental health team. “And so when he came out he had to live with all of those things that had happened to him.” Ben says addicts like Rob are especially vulnerable to bullying in prison. In Rob’s case he would buy things from “canteen” and then give them to other prisoners. Canteen is in effect a shop where each prisoner has a set allowance to spend and the goods are collected on Fridays. “Rob never spent any money from his canteen [on things for himself],” says Ben. “I told the officers, ‘Stop his canteen, let’s see who’s taking this from him because he’s got nothing in his room.’ “Who is it taking it from him?

They can’t get a beer out the fridge after a bad day. I come home and watch a film. That’s my escapism.” He says the general mental health of prisoners has been in decline for years. “When I joined the service two decades ago, there were very few mental health problems. Now it seems only one in three hasn’t got a mental health issue. It’s that prevalent. “I’ve had people walk up to me and slice their own stomach open.” More than one in three (37%) prisoners report having mental health or well-being issues at any one time, according to surveys carried out by HM Inspectorate of Prisons for England and Wales. The number of health emergencies and mental health interventions is rising throughout the prison system, says Mike Trace. Forward Trust tries to track them. Spice is causing both cardiac and respiratory problems as well as psychosis. “The level of use of cannabis in prisons has been high for decades and what we’ve seen is a partial replacement of cannabis and tobacco with Spice. That’s the explanation for the much higher rates of hospitalisation and psychosis,” says Mr Trace. In April 2015, an unannounced inspection of The Mount by the Chief Inspector of Prisons found that while secondary mental health care provision was deemed good, primary mental health services - the first port of call for inmates - were inadequate. Michael has seen everything there is to see in prison. He says he’s witnessed 16 riots, cut down 12 inmates who had attempted suicide, and dealt with six deaths. He believes more sheltered accommodation needs to be provided for low-level offenders with mental health problems. “There is still a view from judges that for people with diagnosed mental health illness, prisons are a place of safety,” says the President of the Prison Governors Association, Andrea Albutt. “They are not a place of safety. Someone with mental health illness is very vulnerable.” Just before he was released from The Mount in September 2016 Rob wrote a letter, in effect for himself, setting out what he hoped to achieve when he got out. It started: “My main aim on my release from prison is to make my parents proud.” The letter was an assessment of the flaws in his character and what he needed to do to make things better and restore his relationships with his family. He talked of his severe depression. And of giving up smoking Spice. He finished by writing: “I wonder when it was that I chose to get off the ride - one too many trips and an unstable mind makes for a complete mess.” Robert Morris died on 3 March 2017 at the age of 25. It was just six months after he left The Mount, although he had also spent a stint back at HMP Peterborough in that time after being arrested for being drunk and disorderly. He was found slumped in a chair in his room in a supported living accommodation unit, having inhaled his own vomit after drinking heavily. The coroner’s report into Rob’s death recorded a verdict of misadventure. But it criticised a failure to rehabilitate him and the lack of attention paid to his mental illness. “During his time in prison he suffered significant abuse but his severe mental illness does not seem to have been fully recognised or addressed and an opportunity for beneficial treatment that this period of detainment afforded was missed,” the coroner said. (Below: Alison, Rob's mother) From early 2015 it had been clearly established that Rob “suffered from paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by his alcohol and illicit drug abuse”. There’s no doubt Rob Morris must have been a complex prisoner to deal with. His prison records show he refused or failed to take medication on five occasions. But it's clear he suffered a lot during his time in prison. In the first few months the records state that he was held hostage, as well as suffering bruises and abrasions on his body, a number of Spice incidents, suspected relapses of schizophrenia and a suspected sexual assault. After nearly three and a half months he was moved to a different wing. Ben believes the prison was responsible for his death. “The Mount killed him 100%. I’ll stand anywhere in the world and say that. “If he’d had 1% of the right help he’d be here now. The system did not care about Rob. “If I had a headache you’d tell me to go to the hospital. He had mental issues - they put him in a prison with a thousand people from the general population who are messed up anyway.” Alison says the prison can’t be blamed wholly for her son’s death. “Robert was leading a risky life. Rob was sent to prison because he had committed crime, low-level crime. “[But] he was sent into a den of drug taking, abuse, bullying and was not kept safe. So what was the point of it all?” Alison doesn’t dispute that her son should have been sent to prison - she just wishes there was some way that people like Rob could be looked after once inside. “When a young person with complex needs such as Rob is sent to prison [they should be] rehabilitated. “In fact, prison was less safe than the environment he’d come from. There were not enough staff there to deal with specific issues people may have.” People like Rob are often going to have difficulties in prison, says Andrea Albutt. “Prisoners with mental health problems are vulnerable so are ripe to be abused by the stronger prisoners. “We have a lot of people who drop between mental health and segregation units.... It’s really difficult to manage them - they disrupt wings and that further adds to what’s going on and it’s destabilising. If you have one or two people who are unwell it can have a massive impact.” The BBC’s request for an interview with the governor of The Mount was declined. But in a statement, the Ministry of Justice said its “sincere condolences are with the family and friends of Mr Morris”. “The safety and welfare of people within our custody is our priority and all prisons, including The Mount, have procedures to identify, manage and support people with mental health issues,” it added. The POA, which represents rank-and-file officers, has for some time been raising the issue of psychoactive substances and the potential personality changes and cognitive function damage caused to inmates. It is well known that prisoners bully other prisoners to take a drug in order to establish the strength of a batch, says Andy Baxter, from the POA’s National Executive Committee. “Unfortunately, despite government claims to have addressed the recruitment emergency, our members are simply rushed off their feet in the chaos that is a Prison Service in crisis, perpetuated in part by the availability of psychoactive substances. “Prison officers want to do a good job, but staffing levels of five or six officers to 190 prisoners make it impossible for staff to be all places at all times. “The chaos within our prisons needs to slow down - things need to go back to being controlled and safe.” In July 2018, new figures showed that almost a third of prisoners randomly tested in The Mount over 12 months had taken drugs. Across the prison system, the figure was one in five. Alison is sure that it was The Mount where Rob’s condition deteriorated most, rather than in Peterborough where he spent more of his sentence. 2017: Dozens of prisoners rioted at the Mount But it would be wrong to suggest that The Mount is a particularly bad prison. The problems it has are common to varying degrees across the prison system in England and Wales. When it was last inspected in 2015, The Mount was deemed to be “reasonably safe” and several aspects of the prison were praised or deemed better than comparable prisons. But the then chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick identified problems in key areas. “Too many victims of bullying sought sanctuary in the segregation unit and most were then moved out to prisons with insufficient effort to resolve their concerns and reintegrate them back on the wings where appropriate. “Prisoners told us drugs and alcohol were easily available, despite determined efforts by the prison to prevent this.” On 31 July 2017, almost a year after Rob left The Mount, there was an illustration of the pressures that can build up in a prison. For two days armed inmates took control of all of one wing and half of another. Specialist “tornado” riot-trained staff were called in. As many as 30 prisoners were involved - threatening prison officers and smashing windows. In the middle of the chaos, a report was published warning of “severe” staff shortages at the jail. A year afterwards, the Independent Monitoring Board said the prison had been “locked into a vicious spiral of decline”. The current Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, has said that jails have become ""unacceptably violent and dangerous places"" with attempted reforms undermined by the presence of Spice and similar drugs among inmates. In a recent report he criticised “the shockingly high numbers who acquire a drug habit while they are detained”. But the Ministry of Justice says it has tackled the rise in Spice by “bringing in 300 specialist drug dogs, new body scanners and making it a criminal offence to possess NPS [synthetic drugs such as Spice] in prison”. Ms Albutt does not think these changes have had an effect yet and says drug use and mental health problems remain ubiquitous across the prison system. The effect of funding cuts, and the loss of experienced staff, was exacerbated by other changes. “A lot of prisons are in dire straits. We lost years and years of knowledge and at the same time the demographics of prisoners started to change so we had younger, more violent, less respectful men in prison. “Organised crime gangs managed to get a hold of our prisons. Staff are scared. Self-harm, violence, prisoner on prisoner - every stat has gone up. “We need more technology. We need body scanners. We need to have really well-resourced security departments joined up with the police. We are recruiting 2,500 officers but they’re brand new and coming into a prison service that has been in crisis for a long time. Once we get experienced officers and trust with prisoners - it will take time.” The death of a former prisoner isn’t the kind of thing that normally makes headlines. But Rob’s family and friends will always remember that prison was a place where he couldn’t find the help to be who he wanted to be. “I am not ashamed of my son,” says Alison. “I’m actually quite proud of Rob because he suffered an awful lot in his life. “At his funeral we had 200 people. They remembered the Robert that was well.” Author:  Noel TitheradgeIllustrations: Rebecca HendinOnline production: Ben MilneEditor: Finlo Rohrer Photography: Press Association; Shutterstock; Getty Images; Science Photo Library All images subject to copyright Built with Shorthand"

"Fake news a democratic crisis, MPs warn","The UK faces a ""democratic crisis"" with voters being targeted with ""pernicious views"" and data being manipulated, a parliamentary committee is set to warn. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee has been investigating disinformation and fake news following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. In its first report, MPs will suggest social media companies should face tougher regulation or a new tax. It also proposes measures to combat election interference. The MPs' report comes after months of investigating the impact of technology giants and how people are affected by the rise in fake news on social media. It also probed whether Russia had a role in influencing voters in the EU referendum. Vote Leave broke electoral law, says Electoral Commission Vote Leave's targeted adverts revealed Cambridge Analytica 'planted fake news' The not so brief history of fake news The committee's report was due to be officially published on Sunday. Buta copy was leaked on Friday,externalby Dominic Cummings, the director of the official Brexit campaign group Vote Leave, who published it on his own blog. Mr Cummingswas askedand officially summoned to take part in the inquiry - to respond to allegations made against the Vote Leave campaign - but he refused. Mr Cummings called the report ""fake news"". According to the leaked report, MPs say ""our democracy is at risk and now is the time to act"". The committee highlights the ""relentless targeting of hyper-partisan views, which play to the fears and prejudices of people, in order to influence their voting plans"". This video can not be played A brief history of fake news The report is expected to be very critical of Facebook, which has been under increased scrutiny following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far ""Facebook has hampered our efforts to get information about their company throughout this inquiry. It is as if it thinks that the problem will go away if it does not share information about the problem, and reacts only when it is pressed,"" it will say. ""It provided witnesses who have been unwilling or unable to give full answers to the committee's questions."" It will repeat its call for Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence. The committee said they were unsatisfied with evidence by Mr Zuckerberg's chief technology officer The committee's report will also say it had received ""disturbing evidence"" - some of which it had not published - of hacking, disinformation and voter suppression in elections since 2010. ""We urge the government to ensure that the National Crime Agency thoroughly investigates these allegations."" Social media sites should be held responsible for 'harmful' content on their services Companies such as Facebook and YouTube have repeatedly said they are just a ""platform"", rather than a ""publisher"". They have argued that they are not responsible for the content people post on their services. The committee's report is expected to say social media companies ""cannot hide behind"" this claim. A ""new category of tech company"" which is something in between a platform or publisher should be created, the committee will suggest. This should establish ""clear legal liability for the tech companies to act against harmful and illegal content on their platforms"". The rules on political campaigns should be made fit for the digital age The committee will say that electoral law needs to be ""updated to reflect changes in campaigning techniques"". Vote Leave's Facebook advertisements have been released It will suggest: creating a public register for political advertising so that anybody can see what messages are being distributed online political advertisements should have a digital imprint stating who was responsible, as is required with printed leaflets and advertisements social media sites should be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors electoral fraud fines should be increased from a maximum of Â£20,000 to a percentage of an organisations' annual turnover Social network security should be audited The report will suggest that an independent body such as the Competition and Markets Authority should audit the social networks. It will say that security mechanisms and algorithms used by social networks should be available for audit by a government regulator, to ensure they are ""operating responsibly"". The committee will also warn that fake accounts on sites such as Facebook and Twitter ""not only damage the user experience, but potentially defraud advertisers"" who could be paying to advertise to accounts not run by real people. Fake followers defraud advertisers, the committee said Tech companies should be taxed to fund education and regulation Tighter regulation of social media sites would mean more work for organisations such as the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The committee will suggest a tax on tech companies. Some of the money should fund the extra responsibilities of the regulators. The rest of the money should be spent on digital education in schools and a public awareness campaign, to help people identify disinformation and fake news. ""Digital literacy should be the fourth pillar of education, alongside reading, writing and maths,"" the report will say. The report will also summarise the evidence collected during the committee's inquiry, which was launched in September last year. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie and Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix were among the 61 witnesses that gave evidence. Whistleblower Christopher Wylie exposed data misuse Tom Baldwin, who has written a book on the relationship between politics and media, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the report's recommendations did not go far enough. ""The social media ads that were seen used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented,"" Mr Baldwin said. Will Moy, the head of fact checking charity Full Fact, told the BBC that the same conversation about fake news is going on around the world - and the reaction of some governments had been ""quite scary"". He said MPs should acknowledge that it is important to also ""stand proudly on being an open society and valuing free speech"". Rules for political advertising have become out of date because they do not work for online, and the transparency of where adverts come from should be available immediately, he added. Children's self-esteem 'harmed by fake news' Fake news 'travels faster', study finds Meanwhile, Jamie Bartlett, the head of think tank Demos, said the report is about the ""long-term integrity of elections"" so people ""trust they are getting accurate information"". He said he fears the Brexit debate could distract the focus of the issue. ""So those who are pro-Brexit will dismiss a lot of it, those who are anti-Brexit will say 'this is why we should have another referendum, and then we miss what is essentially far more important: The long-term health of democracy."" The committee's final report is expected before the end of the year. Facebook and Twitter have yet to respond to a request for comment.

Heatwave 'sign' of climate change,"The current UK heat wave has dried out some reservoirs Climate change resulting from human activities made the current Europe-wide heatwave more than twice as likely to occur, say scientists. Researchers compared the current high temperatures with historical records from seven weather stations, in different parts of Europe. Their preliminary report found that the ""signal of climate change is unambiguous,"" in this summer's heat. They also say the scale of the heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented. 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves How long will it last? Your heatwave questions Regular heatwaves 'will kill thousands' The scale and breadth of the current heat being experienced across Europe has prompted many questions about the influence of global warming on extreme events. To try and see if there is a connection, researchers looked at data from seven weather stations, in Finland, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. They chose these locations because they all had digitised records dating back to the early 1900s, unlike the UK. The team also used computer models to assess the scale of human-influenced climate change. The researchers found that in the weather stations in the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark, climate change has generally increased the odds of the current heatwave by more than two-fold. This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 There are several different definitions of what exactly makes a heatwave but the researchers in this study have gone with the hottest consecutive three-day period in a year. This has allowed them to  compare the data from the seven different locations over the past 100 years or so. ""In many parts of Europe three day heat is not very exceptional and you could argue that it would be better to look at longer,"" said Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford, one of the study's authors. ""But we've looked at longer periods and it doesn't change the result very much."" The researchers also say the warmest three days in succession this year may not yet have happened but they believe that even if next week is warmer, it won't change the overall impact. Scientists are loath to say a specific event was ""caused"" by climate change - however they believe that this new study joins a growing list of solid links between rising temperatures and extreme events. One thing the researchers can't say right now is whether the high pressure system that has been blocked over Europe for almost two months was caused by climate change. The scientists, from theWorld Weather Attribution,externalgroup say they will address this question when they formally publish their findings in a scientific journal later this year. They can't be that definite. However the study does give figures for what are termed ""return periods"" or the chances of something happening again. Hippos in a zoo in Italy were given frozen watermelon to cope with the heat They estimate that in southern Scandinavia it's likely there will be a similar heatwave every 10 years, while further south, in the Netherlands, it's likely to be once every five years. This ties in with projections from several scientists that the type of heatwave we've had this summer could occur every second year by the 2040s. ""The logic that climate change will do this is inescapable - the world is becoming warmer, and so heatwaves like this are becoming more common,"" said Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford. ""What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace - in some cases, it already has,"" she added. While acknowledging that the current heatwave in the Arctic is unprecedented in the historical record, the researchers were not able to clearly resolve the impact of human influence. That's because summer temperatures there vary a good deal from year to year so the trend was impossible to estimate from the observations, the authors said. Despite their reservations about the Arctic they argue that their initial findings should prompt more action on cutting carbon from governments. ""We are not taking the right measures,"" said Dr Robert Vautard, from the CNRS in France. ""We are discovering climate change rather than doing something against it."" It involves some serious number crunching! This new research is called an attribution study - the researchers work out how often these type of extreme heat events have happened at each of the weather stations they looked at. The heatwave has been linked to extensive forest fires in Sweden They compare those findings to modelled results of the climate without the influence of human emissions of carbon dioxide. This way they can work out how much climate change has tipped the odds of a rare event happening. The list continues to grow. The major European heatwave of 2003 was among the first events to be linked though it took scientists several years to do it - eventually they concluded that human induced climate change had made the event 500% more likely! These days the attributions studies are much faster - just last year scientists concluded that the flooding in Houston, Texas was made 38% more likely by climate change while the so-called ""Lucifer"" heatwave in Eastern Europe was made 10 times more likely.  This new study was completed in less than a week.

How long will heatwave last?,"People at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, on Thursday After a brief burst of heavy rain last weekend, the summer heatwave is returning to some parts of the UK. Temperatures are forecast to rise again across southern England, with the hot weather set to continue into the first half of next week. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. As many struggle to stay cool this summer, here are some of the questions you've been asking Google. People sunbathe on Boscombe beach in Bournemouth, Dorset on Thursday The hot weather is set to persist in the south of the UK throughout the weekend, says BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne. Temperatures are expected to reach highs of 33C in London on Friday before dropping back slightly to 29-30C on Saturday and Sunday. ""The weekend as a whole across the UK will be largely fine and warm with spells of sunshine,"" he says - although the exception will be the north-west of Scotland which will see showers. BBC Weather: UK forecast The heatwave in the south-east is forecast to continue into the start of next week with highs of up to 32C - although the Met Office said it is unlikely to be record-breaking. But from Wednesday, the weather will become fresher as an area of low pressure develops and for the rest of the week temperatures look set to return to more ""normal levels"" of mid to low 20s. For the middle weeks in August, Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell predicts a return to the ""typical British summer"" with some more unsettled weather and a risk of showers. Temperatures will be closer to 20-22C in southern areas and 16-18C in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Hotter temperatures could return at the end of August as the weather becomes less changeable, Ms Mitchell said, although the outlook is still uncertain.

But it still did not top the UK's highest ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham in Kent in August 2003. Provisional figures from the Met Office had suggested that Scotland experienced its hottest ever temperature in June, when 33.2C degrees was measured in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Butthe Met Office later rejected this figure,externalbecause a stationary vehicle with the engine running was parked near to the thermometers that measured this temperature, potentially contaminating the result. So Scotland's high of 32.9C recorded in August 2003 at Greycrook in the Borders still stands. In Seville, southern Spain, temperatures could reach 43C over the weekend Forecasters say the all-time temperature record in Europe could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Hot air sweeping in from Africa is causing temperatures to rise in Spain and Portugal andtemperatures are forecastto rise to up to 47C in parts. Warning as Europe's heat nears record Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Swiss police urge dogs to wear shoes The Association of British Travel Agents urged holidaymakers visiting the areas to ""copy the locals"". ""Avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day, drink lots of water and apply plenty of sun cream,"" a spokesman said. ""If you go to the beach, go early and when it feels like it's getting too hot leave, just as the locals do, and go and have a nice lunch in the shade."" You can't fail to notice how brown the UK landscape has become this summer. But, says the Royal Horticultural Society, brown lawns look a lot worse than they are and they should recover rapidly with renewed rainfall. When mowing dry lawns, the RHS advises gardeners to raise the height of cut on mowers to avoid weakening the grasses. Allow the clippings fall back onto the lawn - this will slow down the evaporation of water from the soil surface. The RHS also suggests watering the lawn (provided there are no hosepipe restrictions in force) in early morning, evening or even at night to reduce water wastage from evaporation. Find some more RHS advice here,external In pictures: The dried parks and parched lawns of Britain When there's warm weather, a false social media story about petrol tanks exploding in hot conditions tends to resurface. This is a complete myth, says the AA's head of road safety, Ian Crowder. ""Cars operate perfectly well in temperature extremes across the world - whether inside the Arctic Circle or in equatorial countries,"" he says. ""Cars fuel tanks are designed with a venting system that allows for the relatively small expansion and contraction of the fuel between temperature extremes. ""There is absolutely no risk that simply filling the tank will increase the risk of an explosion."" The NHS suggests keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows - or light-coloured curtains which are closed. ""The most sensible option is to use a [electric] fan,"" says Mary Morrell, professor of sleep and respiratory physiology at Imperial College London. ""It will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating."" Thin cotton sheets rather than nylon bedding are also recommended. Prof Kevin Morgan, director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, says a lukewarm shower before bed is preferable to a cold shower. Read the BBC Magazine article on sleeping during hot weather This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight and older infants out of the sun as much as possible, particularly in the summer and between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. Sun cream with a high sun-protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids. The NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. Rachel Frost, from Birmingham Dogs Home, has some advice for keeping canines cool this summer.

But if it turns into heatstroke it needs to be treated as an emergency. Signs of heat exhaustion include dizziness and confusion, loss of appetite, feeling sick and intense thirst.

Unfortunately for those seeking a day off there are no laws in the UK about when it is too hot to work (or too cold). Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. Londonderry-based employment law specialist Martina McAuley says: ""Employers do need to consider the impact of workplace temperature and have a general duty to ensure the safety, health and welfare of all employees."" But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. Read more: When is it too hot to work?

MPs demand Vote Leave boss gives evidence,"Dominic Cummings has answered MPs' questions before - in April 2016 MPs have backed a motion demanding Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings appears before a select committee by 20 June. Damian Collins, who chairs the committee, said efforts to invite Mr Cummings to appear had been ""unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion"". And there was now ""no alternative"" but to ask all MPs to support a motion ordering him to appear, he said. Mr Cummings has said he cannot appear while other inquiries continue and has accused the committee of grandstanding. The Commons unanimously approved a motion demanding Mr Cummings agree to appear before the Digital, Culture Media and Sport Committee on or before 20 June, as part of its inquiry into ""fake news"". Cambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs Vote Leave director reported to Commons Could Dominic Cummings really be forced to appear? Mr Cummings has argued that there are ""legal issues"" about him answering questions, because of a separate inquiry by the Electoral Commission. But Mr Collins said there was ""a certain irony"" that someone who had run a successful campaign to restore powers to Parliament ""seems to hold that institution in such contempt"". He said there were ""important questions"" for Mr Cummings to answer about the EU referendum campaign and, in reference to Mr Cummings's complaints about other investigations by the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner, said the matter was not ""sub judice"" and Mr Cummings was not before the courts. The committee questioned Cambridge Analytica's Alexander Nix on Wednesday ""His decision not to come, whatever he says, is one of his own making. It's a deliberate attempt to deny Parliament its right to question witnesses on matters of importance,"" Mr Collins said. He added it was ""the first time since 1920 that a motion of this kind has been put before this House"". Hilary Benn, who chairs another select committee said if potential witnesses began to think ""'I don't have to turn up,' then how can we continue to do our job .... in holding the powerful to account?"" and suggested legislation be drafted to deal with people who refused to attend. The motion was backed by Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom. And Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who also chairs a select committee, called Mr Cummings's actions ""a disgrace"" and agreed with Mr Benn that it was time to consider introducing a penalty for witnesses refusing to appear. It had been reported that Mr Cummings had intended to come to the Commons while the issue was being debated, but he was not in the public gallery for the debate. Allow Twitter content?

He has accused the DCMS committee of ""grandstanding"" and wrote in response to a letter from Mr Collins: ""I'm calling your bluff. Your threats are as empty as those from [Prime Minister Theresa May, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis] to the EU. Say what you like, I will not come to your committee regardless of how many letters you send or whether you send characters in fancy dress to hand me papers. ""If another committee behaves reasonably and I can give evidence without compromising various legal actions, then I will consider it. Once these legal actions have finished, presumably this year, it will be easy to arrange if someone else wants to do it."" BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy saysit could become an interesting test case for the Commons- about Parliament's ability to summon witnesses. The MPs are looking at how consulting company Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users worldwide. The London-based company - which announced it was closing in May - is accused of acquiring data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles for use in political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing. There have also been questions about links between Cambridge Analytica and the Vote Leave campaign. Vote Leave spent Â£2.7m on the services of Canadian digital agency AIQ in the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum and AIQ has admitted it also conducted work for Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL. The leaders of the other main Leave campaign, Leave.EU, are due to give evidence to the committee on 12 June. Former Cambridge Analytica chief Alexander Nix appeared before it on Wednesday.

Your heatwave questions Climate change made heatwave 'twice as likely' Forecasters had predicted the UK's all-time record of 38.5C could be topped on what some people were calling ""Furnace Friday"" - but those estimates were toned down following overnight storms. The Met Office said 34.7C was recorded in Tibenham, Norfolk, on Friday but the early development of thunderstorms had suppressed temperatures and kept them below Thursday's high of 35.3C. A Met Office yellow warning,externalfor thunderstorms remains in place for the east of England until 02:00 BST and the east of Scotland until Saturday afternoon.

"UK and Ecuador in talks on Assange's fateEcuador's President Lenin Moreno says he has ""never been in favour of Mr Assange's activity"".Europe","Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for six years The UK and Ecuador are holding ongoing talks over the fate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, the British government has confirmed. Mr Assange, 47, has been living in Ecuador's London embassy since 2012 when he was granted political asylum. Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno said on Friday that he was never ""in favour"" of Mr Assange's activities, and that both sides were in permanent contact. Mr Moreno has previously referred to Mr Assange as a ""stone in our shoe"". The Ecuadorean president was in London this week for a global disabilities summit, but a UK government spokesperson said Mr Assange was not discussed during his visit. Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? Timeline: Julian Assange case Previous efforts to negotiate Mr Assange's departure have failed, but a recent report in the Sunday Times newspaper stated that talks were back on. Mr Moreno confirmed the accuracy of the Sunday Times article on Friday, at an event in Madrid. President Moreno, left, confirmed the reports during a visit to Spain where he met Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, right Any eviction of Mr Assange from the embassy must be carried out properly through dialogue, he said. The Australian will be arrested by UK police if he leaves the embassy for breaching bail conditions. The bail relates to sexual assault allegations he faced in Sweden.His six-year-old arrest warrant was upheld in February. AlthoughSweden has dropped its rape investigation, Mr Assange believes his arrest for breach of bail would lead to an extradition to the US for publishing US secrets on the Wikileaks website. Wikileaks made global headlines in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. August 2010- Sweden issues an arrest warrant for Mr Assange on allegations of rape and molestation December 2010- Mr Assange is arrested in London and bailed at the second attempt May 2012- The UK's Supreme Court rules he should be extradited to Sweden to face questioning over the allegations June 2012- Mr Assange enters the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he is later granted asylum February 2016- A UN panel rules that Mr Assange has been ""arbitrarily detained"" by UK and Swedish authorities since 2010 May 2017- Sweden drops its rape investigation into Julian Assange February 2018- UK court upholds Mr Assange's arrest warrant for breaching bail conditions WhileMr Assange became an Ecuadorean citizen in December 2017, recent months have seenhis hosts cut his internet connectionand accuse him of interfering in other countries' affairs. Ecuador removed extra security at its London embassyin May after reports that the operation cost tens of thousands of dollars a month. The British government is said to be increasingly concerned about Mr Assange's welfare. ""It is our wish that this is brought to an end, and we would like to make the assurance that if he were to step out of the embassy, he would be treated humanely and properly,"" UK Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan told parliament last month.

Drill music video stopped by armed police,"This video can not be played The group was said to be between the ages of 16 and 19 Armed police have stopped the filming of a drill music video to carry out a stop and search. The Metropolitan Police says it was called to London Fields in east London after reports of a firearm being seen.

Pacman says that they spotted a police helicopter circling overhead, but at first didn't take any notice.

""I said to him 'Hold on, I'm a company director - I'm here hired on a job.""

Drill music has been linked to violence in the capital by Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. YouTube deleted content which she says glamorises violence at Ms Dick's request. Pacman, who's shot videos for Lady Leshurr and Paigey Cakey, as well as prominent drill acts like Loski, says he doesn't see the link between the music and violence. ""When you're making music you can't be in two places at once - you can't be touring or in the studio and out committing crime as well,"" he says. ""The only side of drill music I'd say possibly incites violence would be diss tracks, and that's like anything in life. If you diss somebody on social media, if you diss somebody in real life, if you diss them through music - it's gonna cause problems."" Reality Check: is London's murder rate still higher than New York's? Reality Check: Are England and Wales experiencing a crime wave? People in the video's comments are divided. Many say that people can't wear balaclavas in public places and expect not to be stopped by the police - while others have said that the police profiled the group. Pacman thinks that they should have been treated as though they were shooting a film - and that the Met's response was out of proportion. ""For them to bring the police helicopter, so many armed police and aim at these kids when nothing's happened? That's where the problem lies. ""If they were normal officers who came over and didn't aim any firearms at them and spoke to them with reason, and explained what was happening in a way that everyone could understand, it would've been fine.

Spanish mother jailed for child abduction,"Ms Rivas turned herself in after hiding with her two boys A Spanish court has jailed a woman for five years for going into hiding with her two sons rather than hand them to the father, whom she accused of abuse. Juana Rivas has also been stripped of custody rights for six years and told to pay hefty legal costs. Spanish politicians and women's groups have criticised the verdict. The long-running custody battle for the boys - now aged 12 and four - has become a rallying point in Spain's battle against gender violence. She took the boys from the family home in Italy in 2016, and travelled to Spain under the pretext of visiting family. Instead of returning, she lodged a complaint in Spain alleging domestic abuse and later defied Spanish court orders to return the boys to their father. ""A woman running away from terror to protect her children can't be deemed abduction,"" she said last year. Mr Arcuri has denied any allegations of abuse - including the circumstances surrounding his previous conviction Her actions became a social media sensation in Spain, where #JuanaEstÃ¡EnMiCasa (Juana is in my house) was a major trend as she avoided authorities. She eventually turned herself in and the children were reunited with their father. The court in the southern city of Granada said Rivas had no proof of domestic violence and had illegally taken her children from their father. She had ""exploited the argument of abuse"" and had carried out ""child abduction"", the judgement said. Her former partner, Italian Francesco Arcuri has a previous conviction for violence against Ms Rivas. But despite this the court said there was no evidence of mistreatment since then and an assessment of the oldest child showed no signs of psychological trauma consistent with abuse. Rivas's lawyer has called the judgement a ""failure of the judicial system"" and indicated she would appeal against the verdict. Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo has said that Rivas will not be jailed until the sentence is confirmed. ""The interests of the two children must be protected, even in these moments,"" she said. Antonio MaÃ­llo, head of a left-wing federation of parties in the southern Andalucia region, said the verdict was ""barbaric"" and set a worrying precedent. The case divided public opinion in Spain, with some supporters on both sides ""This country has changed but the judiciary is carrying on with outmoded parameters,"" he said. The president of the Progressive Women's Foundation, Yolanda Besteiro, told Spain's Efe news agency that the ruling was disproportionate ""because the situation of mistreatment was not taken into account"". She said the ruling ""demonstrates the lack of empathy and ignorance of what gender violence is and how abusers behave"". Some groups are preparing demonstrations, in a move reminiscent of thewidespread protests over the infamous ""wolf pack"" sexual assault case in Pamplona. Mr Arcuri denies any abuse of either Rivas or the children and says he has been the victim of a media campaign. He has a previous conviction for violence against Rivas on one occasion in 2009 - but he now says he only admitted to the charge to avoid a lengthy legal battle and retain visiting rights with his son. The couple reunited after that incident and had a second son. Mr Arcuri's former partner of 10 years also came to his defence last year, telling Spanish media she did not believe the abuse allegations.

Skygazers watch century's longest 'blood moon',"This video can not be played The century's longest 'blood moon', or lunar eclipse, delighted many, if not all, skygazers Skywatchers around the world have witnessed the longest ""blood moon"" eclipse of the 21st Century. As it rose, during this total eclipse, Earth's natural satellite turned a striking shade of red or ruddy brown. The ""totality"" period, where light from the Moon was totally obscured, lasted for one hour, 43 minutes. At least part of the eclipse was visible from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, most of Asia and South America. In pictures: Blood moon seen around the world The blood moon as seen in the Swiss Alps... ... and in Kuala Lumpur In the UK, where the weather allowed, the Moon could be seen to turn red - fully eclipsed by Earth - from when it rose at 21:00 until 22:15 BST. Over the coming days, Mars will be at its closest point to Earth since 2003 - visible as a ""bright red star"" where skies are clear. The Moon passed right through the centre of the Earth's shadow, at the shadow's widest point. This video can not be played Science behind the blood moon ""This is actually almost as long as a lunar eclipse could be,"" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist at University of Manchester, explained. It coincided not only with Mars's close approach, but with what he described as a ""procession of planets"" - a line-up of our celestial neighbours that gave skywatchers a particularly good view of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. The blood moon beside a statue of ancient Greek goddess Hera and god Apollo in Athens The blood moon rises behind the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi Umbra:The darker, central part of the Earth's shadow Penumbra:The lighter, outer part of the shadow cast by our planet Because the Moon is far away from Earth relatively speaking - its orbit is an ellipse, so it moves closer and further and looks larger and smaller from Earth. Mars could also be seen as a bright red star just below the Moon. Mars (bottom right) could also be viewed in the sky ""Every couple of years or so, the Earth overtakes Mars on the inside as it orbits the Sun, so Mars is closest to us,"" said Prof O'Brien. ""And because of the elliptical shape of the orbit, it's even closer than normal."" Where skies were free of cloud, the spectacle was visible almost everywhere around the world, with the exception of North America. The eclipse had already started by the time the Moon rose over the UK and Western Europe. People in the UK needed a clear south-eastern horizon as the Moon came up in order to see it. The blood moon over Sydney, Australia The best views - where the weather permitted - were across Eastern Europe, Central and East Africa and South East Asia, from where the entire eclipse was visible. So, from the UK and Europe, the south-east was the place to look for the rising, eclipsing Moon with a bright red Mars below. Jupiter could also be seen in the southern sky and Venus in the west. Dr Emily Brunsden, director of the University of York's Astrocampus, added that this eclipse was a ""micro blood moon"". ""This is a total eclipse at a time in its orbit when it is close to being the farthest from Earth, or at apogee,"" she said. ""Hence the Moon was fractionally smaller than usual.""

Lightning strikes cause rail chaosHeatwave leaves dozens of gulls with burnsHow long will it last? Your hot weather questionsVideoVideoWhy is it so hot at the moment?,"British Transport Police have been holding back passengers from platforms at Leeds station Rail passengers on the East Coast mainline faced disruption chaos after lightning strikes damaged signalling. London North Eastern Railway (LNER) advised passengers not to travel on Friday ""due to the extreme weather conditions and signalling failure"". Trains are now running but some are delayed, with others being cancelled. British Transport Police said officers had to hold back passengers trying to get on platforms at Leeds station. Dan Wales, 26, was stuck at the station for more than three hours trying to get home to Newcastle. He said he had ""been told by staff that unless you're going to London or Manchester, don't expect anything"". Information boards showed serious disruption on the rail services running through Yorkshire A number of trainee teachers attending a Teach First conference in Leeds were also stranded by the disruption. About 1,300 people were due to leave on Friday, with many planning on taking the train. Teach First said people were being urged to remain at Leeds University and check before travelling to the station. A spokesman said: ""The Student's Union and Refectory at Leeds University are open and we are working with the university on contingency plans if anyone is unable to travel today.""

More than 270 birds have been taken to Somerset's Secret World Wildlife Rescue with ""severe"" burns on their feet. The charity said it had been inundated with juvenile gulls - nesting on industrial buildings - that fell off after the roofs became ""scalding hot"". A spokeswoman for the centre said the young birds had been placed in buckets of water to ""cool their feet down"". ""Gulls have been arriving at the centre almost by the hour over the last fortnight,"" the spokeswoman said. The centre said many of the birds had been nesting on industrial buildings which got too hot for them More than twice the number of gulls has been admitted to the centre this year compared to last, the charity said.

How long will it last? Your hot weather questionsVideoVideoWhy is it so hot at the moment?,"People at Blenheim Palace, near Oxford, on Thursday After a brief burst of heavy rain last weekend, the summer heatwave is returning to some parts of the UK. Temperatures are forecast to rise again across southern England, with the hot weather set to continue into the first half of next week. Meanwhile, Europe is bracing itself for the hottest-ever temperatures with Spain and Portugal predicted to break the 48C (118.4F) record set in Athens in July 1977. As many struggle to stay cool this summer, here are some of the questions you've been asking Google. People sunbathe on Boscombe beach in Bournemouth, Dorset on Thursday The hot weather is set to persist in the south of the UK throughout the weekend, says BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne. Temperatures are expected to reach highs of 33C in London on Friday before dropping back slightly to 29-30C on Saturday and Sunday. ""The weekend as a whole across the UK will be largely fine and warm with spells of sunshine,"" he says - although the exception will be the north-west of Scotland which will see showers. BBC Weather: UK forecast The heatwave in the south-east is forecast to continue into the start of next week with highs of up to 32C - although the Met Office said it is unlikely to be record-breaking. But from Wednesday, the weather will become fresher as an area of low pressure develops and for the rest of the week temperatures look set to return to more ""normal levels"" of mid to low 20s. For the middle weeks in August, Met Office forecaster Becky Mitchell predicts a return to the ""typical British summer"" with some more unsettled weather and a risk of showers. Temperatures will be closer to 20-22C in southern areas and 16-18C in the north of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Hotter temperatures could return at the end of August as the weather becomes less changeable, Ms Mitchell said, although the outlook is still uncertain.

Enter your location or postcode in the search box to see your result.   The hottest day so far of 2018 was Thursday 26 July, when temperatures reached 35.3C in Faversham, Kent. But it still did not top the UK's highest ever recorded temperature of 38.5C (101F), also in Faversham in Kent in August 2003. Provisional figures from the Met Office had suggested that Scotland experienced its hottest ever temperature in June, when 33.2C degrees was measured in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Butthe Met Office later rejected this figure,externalbecause a stationary vehicle with the engine running was parked near to the thermometers that measured this temperature, potentially contaminating the result. So Scotland's high of 32.9C recorded in August 2003 at Greycrook in the Borders still stands. In Seville, southern Spain, temperatures could reach 43C over the weekend Forecasters say the all-time temperature record in Europe could be broken in the coming days. The current European record is 48C (118.4F) set in Athens in July 1977. Hot air sweeping in from Africa is causing temperatures to rise in Spain and Portugal andtemperatures are forecastto rise to up to 47C in parts. Warning as Europe's heat nears record Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Swiss police urge dogs to wear shoes The Association of British Travel Agents urged holidaymakers visiting the areas to ""copy the locals"". ""Avoid spending time in the sun during the hottest part of the day, drink lots of water and apply plenty of sun cream,"" a spokesman said. ""If you go to the beach, go early and when it feels like it's getting too hot leave, just as the locals do, and go and have a nice lunch in the shade."" You can't fail to notice how brown the UK landscape has become this summer. But, says the Royal Horticultural Society, brown lawns look a lot worse than they are and they should recover rapidly with renewed rainfall. When mowing dry lawns, the RHS advises gardeners to raise the height of cut on mowers to avoid weakening the grasses. Allow the clippings fall back onto the lawn - this will slow down the evaporation of water from the soil surface. The RHS also suggests watering the lawn (provided there are no hosepipe restrictions in force) in early morning, evening or even at night to reduce water wastage from evaporation. Find some more RHS advice here,external In pictures: The dried parks and parched lawns of Britain When there's warm weather, a false social media story about petrol tanks exploding in hot conditions tends to resurface. This is a complete myth, says the AA's head of road safety, Ian Crowder. ""Cars operate perfectly well in temperature extremes across the world - whether inside the Arctic Circle or in equatorial countries,"" he says. ""Cars fuel tanks are designed with a venting system that allows for the relatively small expansion and contraction of the fuel between temperature extremes. ""There is absolutely no risk that simply filling the tank will increase the risk of an explosion."" The NHS suggests keeping rooms cool by using shades or reflective material outside the windows - or light-coloured curtains which are closed. ""The most sensible option is to use a [electric] fan,"" says Mary Morrell, professor of sleep and respiratory physiology at Imperial College London. ""It will help move the air around your body and increase the chance of sweat evaporating."" Thin cotton sheets rather than nylon bedding are also recommended. Prof Kevin Morgan, director of the Clinical Sleep Research Unit at Loughborough University, says a lukewarm shower before bed is preferable to a cold shower. Read the BBC Magazine article on sleeping during hot weather This video can not be played How to keep your baby safe in hot weather The NHS recommends,externalkeeping all babies under six months out of direct sunlight and older infants out of the sun as much as possible, particularly in the summer and between 11:00 and 15:00. They should be kept in the shade or under a sunshade if they're in a buggy or pushchair. Sun cream with a high sun-protection factor should be applied regularly - particularly if children are in water. All children should be given plenty of fluids. The NHS says babies who are being breastfed may want to feed more than usual but will not need water as well as breast milk. If they are bottle feeding, babies can be given cooled boiled water as well as their usual milk feeds. Rachel Frost, from Birmingham Dogs Home, has some advice for keeping canines cool this summer. This video can not be played Five ways to keep your dog cool this summer And the RSPCA has released aseries of tips for keeping animals safe and comfortable during the heatwave.,external Read more: Keeping animals cool in the heatwave The NHS says heat exhaustion is not serious and usually gets better when you cool down. But if it turns into heatstroke it needs to be treated as an emergency. Signs of heat exhaustion include dizziness and confusion, loss of appetite, feeling sick and intense thirst. Children may become floppy and sleepy. Signs of heatstroke include temperature of 40C or above, shortness of breath and seizures. This video can not be played Are you applying sun cream properly? The NHS website has the full list of symptoms - and most importantlyadvice on how to prevent both conditions,external. Unfortunately for those seeking a day off there are no laws in the UK about when it is too hot to work (or too cold). Employers should provide a ""reasonable"" temperature in the workplace. Londonderry-based employment law specialist Martina McAuley says: ""Employers do need to consider the impact of workplace temperature and have a general duty to ensure the safety, health and welfare of all employees."" But the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says a limit cannot be introduced because some industries have to work in high temperatures. Read more: When is it too hot to work?

There was ""insufficient evidence"" for a prosecution to go ahead, the investigators said. The 30-year-old star vehemently denied the ""unverified and provably untrue"" allegations when two women accused him of rape last November. Prosecutors said witnesses identified by the first two alleged victims were ""not able to provide information that would enable the prosecution to prove either incident beyond a reasonable doubt"". They said they were unable to contact the third alleged victim. Prosecutors said other women had alleged unwanted touching against the actor, but that these claims would not be pursued because they fell outside the statute of limitations. After the allegations emerged last year, the BBC cut Westwick out of its Agatha Christie drama Ordeal by Innocence and ""paused"" filming on the second series of BBC Two comedy White Gold.

UK and Ecuador in talks on Assange's fate,"Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorean embassy in London for six years The UK and Ecuador are holding ongoing talks over the fate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, the British government has confirmed. Mr Assange, 47, has been living in Ecuador's London embassy since 2012 when he was granted political asylum. Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno said on Friday that he was never ""in favour"" of Mr Assange's activities, and that both sides were in permanent contact. Mr Moreno has previously referred to Mr Assange as a ""stone in our shoe"". The Ecuadorean president was in London this week for a global disabilities summit, but a UK government spokesperson said Mr Assange was not discussed during his visit. Julian Assange: Campaigner or attention-seeker? Timeline: Julian Assange case Previous efforts to negotiate Mr Assange's departure have failed, but a recent report in the Sunday Times newspaper stated that talks were back on. Mr Moreno confirmed the accuracy of the Sunday Times article on Friday, at an event in Madrid. President Moreno, left, confirmed the reports during a visit to Spain where he met Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, right Any eviction of Mr Assange from the embassy must be carried out properly through dialogue, he said. The Australian will be arrested by UK police if he leaves the embassy for breaching bail conditions. The bail relates to sexual assault allegations he faced in Sweden.His six-year-old arrest warrant was upheld in February. AlthoughSweden has dropped its rape investigation, Mr Assange believes his arrest for breach of bail would lead to an extradition to the US for publishing US secrets on the Wikileaks website. Wikileaks made global headlines in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. August 2010- Sweden issues an arrest warrant for Mr Assange on allegations of rape and molestation December 2010- Mr Assange is arrested in London and bailed at the second attempt May 2012- The UK's Supreme Court rules he should be extradited to Sweden to face questioning over the allegations June 2012- Mr Assange enters the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he is later granted asylum February 2016- A UN panel rules that Mr Assange has been ""arbitrarily detained"" by UK and Swedish authorities since 2010 May 2017- Sweden drops its rape investigation into Julian Assange February 2018- UK court upholds Mr Assange's arrest warrant for breaching bail conditions WhileMr Assange became an Ecuadorean citizen in December 2017, recent months have seenhis hosts cut his internet connectionand accuse him of interfering in other countries' affairs. Ecuador removed extra security at its London embassyin May after reports that the operation cost tens of thousands of dollars a month. The British government is said to be increasingly concerned about Mr Assange's welfare. ""It is our wish that this is brought to an end, and we would like to make the assurance that if he were to step out of the embassy, he would be treated humanely and properly,"" UK Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan told parliament last month. ""The first priority would be to look after his health, which we think is deteriorating.""

From box office worker to stage star,"Jennifer Caldwell stepped in to play Emily in musical Knights of Rose Jennifer Caldwell was working in the box office at the Arts Theatre in London when a show's producer asked for her help. The theatre's current show - jukebox musical Knights of the Rose - needed a role filled as the understudy was already covering someone else. Jennifer agreed to help at lunchtime and by 19:00 BST she was on stage playing the role of Emily. The actress told the BBC that it was an ""amazing experience"" to be involved. Jennifer says the producers were ""aware"" that a lot of the staff at the theatre were actors. ""I work all over the theatre front of house, box office, cafe and in the bar - wherever they put me basically."" ""One of the producers saw me on the box office and said 'I've had an idea' about getting me to fill in. ""I said maybe, so he said 'what if we cut parts of the show - can you do a reduced version of the track?' and I said why not!"" ""We rehearsed from 3.30pm until 5pm and were on stage at 7pm.""

Jennifer's role had to be cut a bit so she didn't have too much to learn, but thankfully ""there weren't many lines"". ""I think there were two songs with dance routines and one extra scene as well just to help the plot along."" She hadn't yet seen the production in its entirety too - so was really pushed in at the deep end. ""I had seen about two thirds because of working front of house, but had only done two shifts sitting and watching the show,"" she says. ""The rest of the company did an amazing job covering the holes I didn't have time to even attempt to learn, and they were super supportive."" ""It was so quick so I didn't have time to stress about it, and just focused on getting it right. I didn't have time to sit and stew what went wrong."" Allow Twitter content?

"Boy, 4, among five killed in crash","This video can not be played The crash happened on the A96 shortly before midnight Five people, including a four-year-old boy, have died and several others were injured when a minibus and 4x4 crashed in Moray. The collision happened on the A96, three miles from Keith, on the road to Huntly, at about 23:40 on Thursday. Three local people in a Nissan X-Trail - two women aged 69 and 70 and a man aged 63 - died in the crash. The young boy and a woman, who also died, were in the minibus, which was carrying Italian tourists. A three-year-old boy and four other adults were being treated in hospital, police said, with one woman in a critical condition. It was believed the people in the Nissan were all friends and coming from a social occasion. Potential witnesses who were in the area at the time were urged to contact police. This video can not be played Supt Louise Blakelock gave more details about the crash victims Supt Louise Blakelock, of Police Scotland, said: ""It is with deep regret that I can confirm that three adult passengers - two women aged 69 and 70 and a 63-year-old man - who were travelling within an orange Nissan X-Trail all sadly died from their injuries. ""The 39-year-old female driver sustained serious injuries. Everyone in this car was local to this area. ""A white Fiat Talento minibus which had been carrying Italian tourists was also involved in the collision. ""Tragically two people who were passengers within this vehicle - a woman and a four-year-old boy - have also died. ""The male driver, a male passenger, female passenger and a three-year-old boy, who were also within the minibus, were taken to hospital with a variety of injuries. The woman is considered to be in a critical condition. The little boy sustained minor injuries and is being well cared for."" The officer said: ""The dreadful scene faced by the emergency responders from police, fire and ambulance and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency was both distressing and extremely challenging for everyone involved. ""I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who made valiant attempts to save the casualties lives - their efforts cannot be underestimated. I would also like to thank members of the public who came upon this terrible incident, who phoned the emergency services and provided first aid and comfort."" Supt Blakelock added: ""Every loss of life on our roads is a tragedy however when so many are killed in one incident the impact on their families, their friends and our entire community is massive. ""Our thoughts are with everyone who has been involved or affected. ""An investigation is ongoing into the exact circumstances so it would wrong for me to speculate further at this time and I am unable to answer questions regarding details of what may have happened. ""I would however ask anyone who was in the area last night and saw either vehicle involved in the lead-up to this incident to please contact the Police on 101. Likewise, if you have dashcam footage that may assist please get in touch with us."" The Italian Counsul General for Scotland Carlo Perrotta said relatives of the Italian holidaymakers were travelling to Scotland. He said: ""It is absolutely distressing. Words cannot tell how sad we are to hear these stories, and to have to report to the authorities in Italy and to the families, especially in summer time when people come to Scotland to enjoy this wonderful land and to enjoy the holiday they have been looking forward to the whole year."" The road remained closed overnight. The vehicles were removed on Friday morning and the A96 re-opened shortly before 13:00.

For the first time in more than a quarter of a century, a British singer has topped the US R&B chart. Ella Mai, a 23-year-old from south London, is currently at number one with Boo'd Up, a soulful infatuation anthem she first released last year. It makes her the first Brit to reach the summit since Lisa Stansfield hit number one with All Woman in 1992. ""1992, before I was born,""she tweeted,externalafter being told the news. ""First in my lifetime. INSANE!"" Fellow Brits Charli XCX, Paul McCartney and Kyla have recently appeared as featured artists on US R&B number ones, but Ella Mai is the first to reach the peak as a lead artist for 26 years.

Boo'd Up, which originally featured on Ella Mai's six-song Ready EP last February, has had a slow rise to the top - receiving a recent boost when Nicki Minaj and Quavo jumped on a remix. But its success really started in San Francisco last December, when someone asked Bay Area DJ Big Von to play it in a club set. He hadn't heard the song before, but downloaded it and cued it up. What happened next took him by surprise. Ella Mai: The Brit whose song is taking the US by storm K-pop stars BTS top US album charts The golden oldies we can't stop streaming ""I've never seen a reaction like this,""he later told Rolling Stone,external. ""When I played it, the whole place went, 'Woo!' ""I saw a fat dude do a cartwheel - a solid cartwheel, he didn't even fall."" The next day, Big Von played the song five times on his radio show, and it took off from there. It first reached number one in May, and returns for a second run at the top this week. The singer is set to release her debut album later this year Ella Mai wasn't prepared for Boo'd Up's success, but says she understands why people latched on to it. ""It has quite nostalgic feel to it,""she told The Fader,external. ""There's no cursing, it's super innocent, and everyone's been through that puppy-love sort of thing."" However, the song, which recalls the smooth 1990s R&B of Mariah Carey, SWV and Erykah Badu, has not found similar success in the singer's home country. It's currently at number 62 in the official charts, prompting Vice to publish an article headlined: ""The UK is sleeping on Ella Mai and it's embarrassing,external"". ""I think R&B is way bigger in America. It's not really that mainstream in the UK,""the singer explained to Newsbeat last month. ""It's on the up here and I think we'll get there eventually. I'm proud to be from England and doing so well in America so I can fly the flag."" Although Mai isn't a star in the UK just yet, eagle-eyed fans might recognise her as a member of girl group Arize, who auditioned for The X Factor in 2014. After being kicked out of the competition, the band broke up and Ella Mai began posting cover versions on Instagram. Her version of Tupac's Keep Your Head Up,externalcaught the attention of US producer DJ Mustard (Rihanna, Cardi B, Ty Dolla $ign), who signed her to his label. Since then, she's released three EPs, toured with US R&B star Kehlani and is currently finishing her debut album. UK fans will get to see her when she plays1Xtra Livealongside Chance The Rapper, Jorja Smith and Pusha T at the O2 Arena in London on 22 September.

IT fiasco pushes TSB into a loss,"The technology meltdown at TSB earlier this year has cost the bank Â£176.4m, pushing it into a half-year loss. In April, almost two million customers lost access to online banking services after the bungled introduction of a new IT system. TSB says only 37% of more than 130,000 complaints have been resolved so far, and some IT issues are continuing. It reported a loss of Â£107.4m,externalin the six months to 30 June compared with a profit of Â£108.3m last year. ""I know how frustrated many customers have been by what's happened,"" said TSB chief executive Paul Pester. ""It was not acceptable, and was not the level of service that we pride ourselves on - nor was it what our customers have come to expect from TSB."" The bank said that, as of 25 July, 135,403 complaints had been recorded and it had a team of more than 260 people looking into them. While most of TSB's services have been reinstated, issues remain with online banking. Customers are not able to apply for banking products on TSB's website, or to switch products if they hold a TSB mortgage. TSB 'did not test IT systems properly' How it all went so wrong for TSB ""We are working as hard as we can to reinstate this, and no customer will be left out of pocket as a result,"" a spokesperson said. The bank said that about 26,000 customers closed their TSB account in the second quarter of the year. However, it added that more than 20,000 customers opened a new bank account or switched their account to TSB in the same period. Chief executive Paul Pester has faced calls to resign When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to use Lloyds' computer system while a new one was developed. In April, it carried out a planned migration of customer data, which involved moving customer records from the old system to one managed by its new Spanish owner, Sabadell. However, the move left many customers struggling to make transactions and see their balances, with the problems continuing for several weeks. TSB came under fierce criticism for the IT failings, and MPs on the Treasury Committee called on Mr Pester to resign. But Mr Pester has remained in his post, and he told the Reuters news agency on Friday that he planned to stay with the bank. ""I'm focused 100% on putting things right for our customers,"" he said. In June, the Financial Conduct Authority launched a formal investigation into the meltdown. Its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, took the unusual step ofmaking the probe public,external, ""given the level of public interest"". TSB's loss was large enough to have dragged TSB's parent company, Spanish banking group Banco Sabadell, into the red. It reported a loss of â¬138.7m (Â£123m) in the three months to 30 June, due to costs stemming from TSB's IT problems.

Skygazers await century's longest 'blood moon',"This video can not be played The century's longest 'blood moon', or lunar eclipse, delighted many, if not all, skygazers Skywatchers around the world have witnessed the longest ""blood moon"" eclipse of the 21st Century. As it rose, during this total eclipse, Earth's natural satellite turned a striking shade of red or ruddy brown. The ""totality"" period, where light from the Moon was totally obscured, lasted for one hour, 43 minutes. At least part of the eclipse was visible from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, most of Asia and South America. In pictures: Blood moon seen around the world The blood moon as seen in the Swiss Alps... ... and in Kuala Lumpur In the UK, where the weather allowed, the Moon could be seen to turn red - fully eclipsed by Earth - from when it rose at 21:00 until 22:15 BST. Over the coming days, Mars will be at its closest point to Earth since 2003 - visible as a ""bright red star"" where skies are clear. The Moon passed right through the centre of the Earth's shadow, at the shadow's widest point. This video can not be played Science behind the blood moon ""This is actually almost as long as a lunar eclipse could be,"" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist at University of Manchester, explained. It coincided not only with Mars's close approach, but with what he described as a ""procession of planets"" - a line-up of our celestial neighbours that gave skywatchers a particularly good view of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. The blood moon beside a statue of ancient Greek goddess Hera and god Apollo in Athens The blood moon rises behind the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi Umbra:The darker, central part of the Earth's shadow Penumbra:The lighter, outer part of the shadow cast by our planet Because the Moon is far away from Earth relatively speaking - its orbit is an ellipse, so it moves closer and further and looks larger and smaller from Earth. Mars could also be seen as a bright red star just below the Moon. Mars (bottom right) could also be viewed in the sky ""Every couple of years or so, the Earth overtakes Mars on the inside as it orbits the Sun, so Mars is closest to us,"" said Prof O'Brien. ""And because of the elliptical shape of the orbit, it's even closer than normal."" Where skies were free of cloud, the spectacle was visible almost everywhere around the world, with the exception of North America. The eclipse had already started by the time the Moon rose over the UK and Western Europe. People in the UK needed a clear south-eastern horizon as the Moon came up in order to see it. The blood moon over Sydney, Australia The best views - where the weather permitted - were across Eastern Europe, Central and East Africa and South East Asia, from where the entire eclipse was visible. So, from the UK and Europe, the south-east was the place to look for the rising, eclipsing Moon with a bright red Mars below. Jupiter could also be seen in the southern sky and Venus in the west. Dr Emily Brunsden, director of the University of York's Astrocampus, added that this eclipse was a ""micro blood moon"". ""This is a total eclipse at a time in its orbit when it is close to being the farthest from Earth, or at apogee,"" she said. ""Hence the Moon was fractionally smaller than usual."" Penumbral eclipse begins:This starts when the outer (and lighter) part of the Earth's shadow begins moving across the Moon Partial eclipse begins:This stage takes hold when the darker, inner part of the Earth's shadow (umbra) begins covering the Moon Total eclipse begins:Also called totality, this occurs when the umbra completely covers the Moon, turning it a reddish brown colour Maximum eclipse:The mid-point of totality Total eclipse ends:The umbra starts moving away from the Moon's face after totality Partial eclipse ends:Earth's umbra completely leaves the surface of the Moon Penumbral eclipse ends:The outer part of the shadow (penumbra) completely moves away from the Moon Source: timeanddate.com Did you see the ""blood moon""?

Five dead as minibus and 4x4 crash,"This video can not be played The crash happened on the A96 shortly before midnight Five people, including a four-year-old boy, have died and several others were injured when a minibus and 4x4 crashed in Moray. The collision happened on the A96, three miles from Keith, on the road to Huntly, at about 23:40 on Thursday. Three local people in a Nissan X-Trail - two women aged 69 and 70 and a man aged 63 - died in the crash. The young boy and a woman, who also died, were in the minibus, which was carrying Italian tourists. A three-year-old boy and four other adults were being treated in hospital, police said, with one woman in a critical condition. It was believed the people in the Nissan were all friends and coming from a social occasion. Potential witnesses who were in the area at the time were urged to contact police. This video can not be played Supt Louise Blakelock gave more details about the crash victims Supt Louise Blakelock, of Police Scotland, said: ""It is with deep regret that I can confirm that three adult passengers - two women aged 69 and 70 and a 63-year-old man - who were travelling within an orange Nissan X-Trail all sadly died from their injuries. ""The 39-year-old female driver sustained serious injuries. Everyone in this car was local to this area. ""A white Fiat Talento minibus which had been carrying Italian tourists was also involved in the collision. ""Tragically two people who were passengers within this vehicle - a woman and a four-year-old boy - have also died. ""The male driver, a male passenger, female passenger and a three-year-old boy, who were also within the minibus, were taken to hospital with a variety of injuries. The woman is considered to be in a critical condition. The little boy sustained minor injuries and is being well cared for."" The officer said: ""The dreadful scene faced by the emergency responders from police, fire and ambulance and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency was both distressing and extremely challenging for everyone involved. ""I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who made valiant attempts to save the casualties lives - their efforts cannot be underestimated. I would also like to thank members of the public who came upon this terrible incident, who phoned the emergency services and provided first aid and comfort."" Supt Blakelock added: ""Every loss of life on our roads is a tragedy however when so many are killed in one incident the impact on their families, their friends and our entire community is massive. ""Our thoughts are with everyone who has been involved or affected. ""An investigation is ongoing into the exact circumstances so it would wrong for me to speculate further at this time and I am unable to answer questions regarding details of what may have happened. ""I would however ask anyone who was in the area last night and saw either vehicle involved in the lead-up to this incident to please contact the Police on 101. Likewise, if you have dashcam footage that may assist please get in touch with us."" The Italian Counsul General for Scotland Carlo Perrotta said relatives of the Italian holidaymakers were travelling to Scotland. He said: ""It is absolutely distressing. Words cannot tell how sad we are to hear these stories, and to have to report to the authorities in Italy and to the families, especially in summer time when people come to Scotland to enjoy this wonderful land and to enjoy the holiday they have been looking forward to the whole year."" The road remained closed overnight. The vehicles were removed on Friday morning and the A96 re-opened shortly before 13:00.

Private probation contracts to end early,"Private companies that run probation services are to have their government contracts ended early - after MPs said the system for supervising criminals was in a ""mess"". The contracts began in 2015 to manage low-risk offenders in England and Wales, under a partial privatisation by then-Justice Secretary Chris Grayling. Ministers are proposing further changes and private firms will remain involved. But Labour said the costly contracts had created an  ""unprecedented crisis"". It comes afterthe Commons justice committee said in July,externalthat changes to probation had failed, and it was unconvinced private sector firms could ever deliver an effective service. Probation system 'a mess', say MPs Prisoners 'lack support after release' Offenders 'remotely supervised' by phone BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the government had hoped that shaking up probation would result in less reoffending. The number of people reoffending has reduced slightly, but those that do are committing crimes more frequently. The arrangements for managing offenders were overhauled in 2014, with the probation service split in two. A new state body, the National Probation Service (NPS), was set up to supervise high-risk offenders, with 21 privately run Community Rehabilitation Companies (CRCs) supervising low and medium-risk offenders. But David Gauke, who became justice secretary in January, said that while the Â£3.7bn Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) programme had been ambitious and innovative, several CRCs had made ""very substantial losses"". David Gauke became justice secretary in January Mr Gauke said the amount of work available for the CRCs had been ""lower than anticipated and that has had an impact in terms of their income and the services they are able to provide"". He also said he was determined to have a service that reduced reoffending, and could oversee ""tough"" community sentences with less reliance on ""ineffective"" short prison terms. Existing contracts will now end two years early, in 2020 - and will be replaced with 10 new ones under changes that will cost the government Â£170m. This includes Â£110m that the CRCs owe the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) in fines for failing to meet performance targets - but which they will be allowed to reinvest in services to keep them going for the last two years of their agreements. The MoJ will also pay Â£46m over the next two years for services that help offenders immediately after they are released from prison. The MoJ said it had budgeted to pay firms Â£2.5bn by 2020 but had only paid out Â£2.2bn - a saving of Â£300m - because less work than anticipated was allocated to the CRCs. This was because there was an increase in the proportion of serious offences which they were ineligible to work on. Mr Gauke said new contracts would make better use of offending data and would move towards ""payment for services delivered"", but he ruled out allowing CRCs to take on high-risk cases. This video can not be played ""People under probation supervision need help to change"" says Dame Glenys Stacey Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon said: ""This decision to throw more good money after bad and the government's re-commitment to a privately-run probation service shows that the Conservatives have run out of all ideas on how to fix their broken system."" And the GMB union said the probation officers it represented were overworked and demoralised. GMB national officer George Georgiou said: ""Fragmenting the service has moved us away from a coherent national workforce strategy for the entire probation service."" But the government'sproposals,externalwere welcomed by the chief probation inspector, Dame Glenys Stacey. Dame Glenys, who was critical of probation services in her report in December, said: ""There is much to welcome in these proposals, and we are pleased to see that our inspection evidence and findings and our wider advice have had significant influence and impact.""

Travel disruption as temperatures rise,"Heavy thunderstorms are sweeping across the UK, leading to travel problems in parts of the country. Rail passengers on the East Coast mainline faced major disruption after lightning strikes damaged signalling. Temperatures have cooled compared with recent days after downpours, hail and strong winds hit areas of the UK. Storms are expected to continue overnight, with a yellow weather warning in place for the east of England and Scotland. Lightning strikes cause rail chaos Channel Tunnel heat delays continue How long will it last? Your heatwave questions Climate change made heatwave 'twice as likely' Forecasters had predicted the UK's all-time record of 38.5C could be topped on what some people were calling ""Furnace Friday"" - but those estimates were toned down following overnight storms.

"Skygazers await century's longest 'blood moon'During this total eclipse, Earth's natural satellite will turn a striking shade of red or ruddy brown.Science & Environment","This video can not be played The century's longest 'blood moon', or lunar eclipse, delighted many, if not all, skygazers Skywatchers around the world have witnessed the longest ""blood moon"" eclipse of the 21st Century. As it rose, during this total eclipse, Earth's natural satellite turned a striking shade of red or ruddy brown. The ""totality"" period, where light from the Moon was totally obscured, lasted for one hour, 43 minutes. At least part of the eclipse was visible from Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, most of Asia and South America. In pictures: Blood moon seen around the world The blood moon as seen in the Swiss Alps... ... and in Kuala Lumpur In the UK, where the weather allowed, the Moon could be seen to turn red - fully eclipsed by Earth - from when it rose at 21:00 until 22:15 BST. Over the coming days, Mars will be at its closest point to Earth since 2003 - visible as a ""bright red star"" where skies are clear. The Moon passed right through the centre of the Earth's shadow, at the shadow's widest point. This video can not be played Science behind the blood moon ""This is actually almost as long as a lunar eclipse could be,"" Prof Tim O'Brien, an astrophysicist at University of Manchester, explained. It coincided not only with Mars's close approach, but with what he described as a ""procession of planets"" - a line-up of our celestial neighbours that gave skywatchers a particularly good view of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn and Mars. The blood moon beside a statue of ancient Greek goddess Hera and god Apollo in Athens The blood moon rises behind the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi Umbra:The darker, central part of the Earth's shadow Penumbra:The lighter, outer part of the shadow cast by our planet Because the Moon is far away from Earth relatively speaking - its orbit is an ellipse, so it moves closer and further and looks larger and smaller from Earth. Mars could also be seen as a bright red star just below the Moon. Mars (bottom right) could also be viewed in the sky ""Every couple of years or so, the Earth overtakes Mars on the inside as it orbits the Sun, so Mars is closest to us,"" said Prof O'Brien. ""And because of the elliptical shape of the orbit, it's even closer than normal."" Where skies were free of cloud, the spectacle was visible almost everywhere around the world, with the exception of North America. The eclipse had already started by the time the Moon rose over the UK and Western Europe. People in the UK needed a clear south-eastern horizon as the Moon came up in order to see it. The blood moon over Sydney, Australia The best views - where the weather permitted - were across Eastern Europe, Central and East Africa and South East Asia, from where the entire eclipse was visible. So, from the UK and Europe, the south-east was the place to look for the rising, eclipsing Moon with a bright red Mars below. Jupiter could also be seen in the southern sky and Venus in the west. Dr Emily Brunsden, director of the University of York's Astrocampus, added that this eclipse was a ""micro blood moon"". ""This is a total eclipse at a time in its orbit when it is close to being the farthest from Earth, or at apogee,"" she said. ""Hence the Moon was fractionally smaller than usual."" Penumbral eclipse begins:This starts when the outer (and lighter) part of the Earth's shadow begins moving across the Moon Partial eclipse begins:This stage takes hold when the darker, inner part of the Earth's shadow (umbra) begins covering the Moon Total eclipse begins:Also called totality, this occurs when the umbra completely covers the Moon, turning it a reddish brown colour Maximum eclipse:The mid-point of totality Total eclipse ends:The umbra starts moving away from the Moon's face after totality Partial eclipse ends:Earth's umbra completely leaves the surface of the Moon Penumbral eclipse ends:The outer part of the shadow (penumbra) completely moves away from the Moon Source: timeanddate.com Did you see the ""blood moon""?

Lightning strikes cause rail chaos,"British Transport Police have been holding back passengers from platforms at Leeds station Rail passengers on the East Coast mainline faced disruption chaos after lightning strikes damaged signalling. London North Eastern Railway (LNER) advised passengers not to travel on Friday ""due to the extreme weather conditions and signalling failure"". Trains are now running but some are delayed, with others being cancelled. British Transport Police said officers had to hold back passengers trying to get on platforms at Leeds station. Dan Wales, 26, was stuck at the station for more than three hours trying to get home to Newcastle. He said he had ""been told by staff that unless you're going to London or Manchester, don't expect anything"". Information boards showed serious disruption on the rail services running through Yorkshire A number of trainee teachers attending a Teach First conference in Leeds were also stranded by the disruption. About 1,300 people were due to leave on Friday, with many planning on taking the train. Teach First said people were being urged to remain at Leeds University and check before travelling to the station. A spokesman said: ""The Student's Union and Refectory at Leeds University are open and we are working with the university on contingency plans if anyone is unable to travel today.""

However, the operator said services were still ""subject to change and delay"" and disruption would continue until the end of the day. LNER said ticket restrictions had been lifted so passengers could travel on alternative routes or at a later date. Yorkshire breaking news: Latest updates as lightning causes rail chaos Network Rail said although services were running from Leeds, schedules had been significantly affected and passengers should check before travelling. It said it did not have the figures for how many people were affected by the disruption but said it was a ""significant number"". Passengers have been queuing for replacement bus services at York station Train operator Northern, who operate a majority of local services in Yorkshire, said: ""Customers are asked to check carefully before travelling later in the afternoon as services are likely to be subject to further delays and cancellations."" Other operators TransPennine Express and Cross Country services have also been affected, with passengers being urged to check before they travel. Cross Country warned customers of delays and alterations to its services after ""a fault with the signalling system"" at March, near Peterborough, which had left train lines blocked in both directions. The signalling centre in York was also hit by lightning strikes. Lightning strikes flashed across York during a storm on Friday morning Commuter Helen King had her journey to Leeds from Apperley Bridge halted, saying she was ""back where she started after an hour and 25 minutes"". She added: ""The train staff kept us as updated as they could, after half an hour they informed us of our right to compensation which didn't do much to placate those who just wanted to get into Leeds. ""Finally after an hour of standstill the driver announced that he had been told to turn the train around and head back to Bradford."" Helen King was travelling from Apperley Bridge to Leeds Another passenger Barry Lee was travelling from Newcastle to York when people were told to leave the train at Darlington ""due to a lightning strike at York station which had a severe affect on signalling"".

"Boy, six, dies after 'incident' at house","Stanley was visiting the house at the time of the incident on Thursday A six-year-old boy has died after being shot with a pellet gun at a house in East Yorkshire. Stanley Metcalf was injured at a house in Church Lane in the village of Sproatley, at 16:00 BST on Thursday. He was taken to hospital where he died. Police said he had been visiting a family member and his death appeared to have been a ""tragic accident"". Stanley's great-grandmother said he had a twin sister who ""loved him to bits"" and they ""did everything together"". The 84-year-old, who did not want to be named, said: ""I don't know how you're supposed to explain things like that to a six-year-old girl."" Yorkshire breaking news: Lightning strikes cause rail chaos; Three homes struck by lightning She described Stanley as a ""brainy, kind little boy"" and said the family were devastated. ""I've just been in floods of tears ever since it happened,"" she said. ""I couldn't even sleep last night, just thinking about him and how tragic it is."" Police remain at the scene in the village of Sproatley Det Ch Insp Mark Goulding of Humberside Police said: ""We're still investigating the circumstances of exactly what happened, but initial indications are that this was a tragic accident involving a pellet gun. ""We haven't made any arrests in connection with the incident, but we are speaking to a number of family members to assist us with our enquiries. ""Our thoughts are with Stanley's family, who have asked that they be given privacy at this very difficult time."" Det Ch Insp Goulding said other family members were in the house at the time of the incident and officers were ""still trying to piece it together and work out what happened"". Responding to suggestions that the boy had been visiting his great-grandfather, he said: ""I can't comment at this stage of the investigation on that."" He added that officers were looking into whether the pellet gun involved required a licence, and, if so, whether its owner had one. Sproatley is a village to the east of Hull and incidents where the police are called are rare. It's very quiet here, with just over 1,000 residents. News quickly spread of the tragic incident and neighbours expressed to me their shock and sadness at what had happened. The house belongs to a member of Stanley's family, police said One man who lives nearby said: ""What can you say? It goes out to the family. You can't even guess how they are feeling. ""It's just so tragic - especially a six year old."" Another neighbour added: ""It's so sad, for a six year old, with a pellet gun. You think of your own children don't you, your grandchildren."" A resident who did want to be identified, described the news as ""surreal"". He said: ""I knew the lad's dad pretty well. He had invited me in for a drink just the other day and was always very friendly. ""They are a very nice, genuine family, so your heart just goes out to them because this is such a tragedy, especially given how young the kid is.""

The return of the remains, brought to a US base in South Korea, is the latest move in the cautious diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang. The repatriation was agreed at the June summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. It is hoped more will follow. ""It's hard to live your life not knowing what happened to your loved one,"" the daughter of one missing serviceman told the BBC ahead of Friday's news. How will the remains be identified? Reality Check: How many dead US soldiers in North Korea? Searching for the father they barely knew The Singapore summit, where Mr Trump and Mr Kim agreed to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"", has been criticised for a lack of detail on when or how Pyongyang would renounce nuclear weapons. This video can not be played Trump thanks Kim Jong-un for repatriation of fallen troops But the return of US remains was one of four points actually listed in that June declaration, and comes on the 65th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War. It is believed that 55 soldiers have been returned this time, but their remains will need to be forensically tested to ensure they are indeed slain US troops - and it's possible the identification process could take years. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US John Zimmerlee, the son of a US serviceman who is among the missing, told the BBC there was no guarantee these were the remains of American soldiers. Mr Zimmerlee, the founder of the Korean War Prisoners Of War and Missing In Action Network, said: ""Keep in mind that these 55 remains that are coming back, these are people that they [North Korea] suspected were their enemy during the (Korean) war - not necessarily Americans. ""They could be British, they could be Australians, Belgians - could be a lot of different people."" By Laura Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent, Osan air base The small wooden caskets were draped in the UN flag and carried carefully one by one from the aircraft onto US soil. Hundreds of US soldiers and some of their families from the Osan base came to salute and line the route of their final journey. Before the ceremony they'd been told they would be watching a key moment in history. They stood silently and watched. Earlier I'd asked Korean War veterans from the US and the UK what this meant to them. Amazing news, they told me. ""This is an emotional and symbolic gesture,"" said another. More than 326,000 Americans fought alongside soldiers from South Korea and a UN coalition during the war to support the South against the Communist North. Thousands of US military personnel from the Korean war remain unaccounted for and most of them - about 5,300 - were lost in what is now North Korea. The missing US soldiers are among around 33,000 coalition troops still unaccounted for. There are thought to be around 5,300 remains of US soldiers in North Korea The remains are believed to be located at: prisoner of war camps - many perished during the winter of 1950 the sites of major battles, such as the areas around Unsan and Chongchon in the north-west of the country - said to contain approximately 1,600 dead temporary UN military cemeteries - China and North Korea returned about 3,000 dead Americans in an effort called Operation Glory in 1954, but others remain the demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea - said to contain 1,000 bodies Between 1990 and 2005, 229 sets were returned, but this halted as relations deteriorated with the development of North Korea's nuclear ambitions. A US military aircraft took the remains to the US base at Osan in South Korea where, according to the White House, a repatriation ceremony will be held on 1 August after some initial testing. The remains will then be brought to the US to undergo thorough forensic testing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US government said it was ""encouraged by North Korea's actions and the momentum for positive change"".

The repatriation will be welcomed by relatives who have waited decades for progress. But Bill Richardson, a former UN ambassador who secured the return of six bodies in 2007, remains sceptical. He told the Washington Post: ""They'll give a certain amount of remains for free,externalright away, but then they'll say, 'The next ones, we need to find them, locate them, restore them.' And then they'll start charging."" It is thought North Korea has about 200 sets of remains collected already. The 12 June summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un saw both sides speak with ambition about concrete steps to improve relations but experts have cast doubt on whether Pyongyang is genuine in its apparent commitment to ""denuclearise"". Last weekNorth Korea appeared to begin dismantling part of a key rocket launch sitebut there have been reports it secretly continues its weapons programme. Meanwhile, Pyongyang has accused the US of ""gangster-like"" tactics. There's also been little clarity  about what exactly the two sides mean by ""complete denuclearisation"" and no details on a timeline for this to take place. Nevertheless, Friday's repatriation will likely be seen as a concrete goodwill gesture after years of efforts by relatives and US authorities to retrieve the remains.

May heads to Austria for Brexit talks,"Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz has told Theresa May it is ""important to avoid a hard Brexit"", after talks with the UK prime minister. Mrs May is in Salzburg as part of a mission by UK ministers to sell their post-Brexit trade proposals. Mr Kurz said he viewed Brexit ""negatively"" but felt negotiations were going ""quite well"". Mrs May then held talks with Czech PM Andrej Babis before heading off on her summer holidays. Barnier rules out key UK customs proposal Laura Kuenssberg: What now for the government? Speaking at a brief joint press conference, Mr Kurz, who has just assumed the EU presidency for six months, said: ""The Brexit decision is a decision we see very negatively. ""But, of course, it has been taken by the British people so now we have to find a way to deal with it, and from our point of view it is important to avoid a hard Brexit."" He said he hoped the UK's talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier would be successful and a ""solution"" could be found by October. The BBC understands that Mr Kurz has indicated he supports the idea of EU leaders holding formal Brexit talks at a summit in Salzburg in September. Mrs May hailed the strength of the UK's relationship with Austria, adding: ""We are delivering on a vote of the British people, they chose to leave the EU and we will deliver that."" Later, Mrs May pitched her idea for a post-Brexit free trade area to her Czech counterpart Andrej Babis. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""She highlighted that a UK-EU free trade area would maintain frictionless trade that would enable businesses across Europe to maintain their vital integrated supply chains. ""They agreed it was important to find a solution and that negotiations should continue at pace."" Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier met for talks on Thursday Both the EU and UK say a deal can be done by October - five months before the UK is due to leave the European Union - but have also said preparations are being made in case negotiations end in no deal. Mr Barnier has already rejected a key element of her proposal for post-Brexit trade with the EU. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has accused the EU of pushing the UK towards a ""no deal"" scenario because they ""keep saying no to everything"". Mr Fox, who is on a trade mission to San Francisco,told Business Insider,externalthe UK should leave without a deal if talks break down, rather than requesting an extension of the Article 50 process to continue negotiations, as some have suggested. ""To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right,"" he added. Mrs May's trip to Austria is one of several being made to Europe by British government ministers over the summer to promote her plan, detailed in the Brexit White Paper, to European leaders. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met his German counterpart in Berlin on Monday and the UK chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office are also meeting counterparts across Europe over the summer. Following talks in Austria, Mrs May will head to Italy with her husband, Philip, for a week before returning to the UK to work. She is also due to attend a World War One memorial event marking the centenary of the battle of Amiens, which began on 8 August 1918, before heading off for two weeks' holiday in Switzerland. Dress rehearsals for The Magic Flute in Salzburg Analysis by BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James Robbins Salzburg in high summer is packed with tourists and music lovers enjoying the annual festival. Theresa May went to the opera on Friday night, but only after her talks with Mr Kurz and Mr Babis. The prime minister is hoping to persuade them to urge others in the EU27 to relax their common position - particularly by accepting her proposals for continuing free movement of products after Brexit. But there's no sign either Austria or the Czech Republic is willing to budge. Eurosceptic feeling may be strong among their populations, but neither leader is contemplating following Britain out of the Union. Instead, both governments believe Mrs May is still cherry-picking and that Britain must blink first to avoid what they call a catastrophic crash-out they are convinced would hurt the UK far more than the EU. Mozart's The Magic Flute, in the city of his birth, should have been something of a relief for Mrs May. The UK's Brexit White Paper, drawn up after agreement with the cabinet at Chequers, proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. It would involve the UK collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - under its proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The plan sparked two UK cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? Mr Barnier said on Thursday that the EU ""will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures"". Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said.

Trump 'knew of Russia meeting' says Cohen,"Michael Cohen has claimed he was in the room when Mr Trump was told about the meeting President Donald Trump's former lawyer has said his client knew in advance of a June 2016 meeting between his aides and a Russian delegation that offered to help his campaign, US media report. Michael Cohen says he was present when Mr Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, informed his father of the meeting. He is reportedly willing to state this tothe special counsel investigation,externalinto alleged Russian election meddling. On Friday, Mr Trump again denied that he knew about the meeting. Who is Michael Cohen? All you need to know about Trump and Russia,external What Trump Tower documents tell us,external The meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involved Mr Trump's son, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. It was set up after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate in the 2016 presidential election. The president lashed out at the accusations on Friday, tweeting: ""Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam"". Allow Twitter content?

The meeting in New York is a part of an investigation into alleged Russia meddling in 2016 According to CNN and NBC, Mr Cohen does not have any audio recordings to support his account but is willing to assert it as part of the ongoing investigations into Russian election interference. By Jon Sopel, North America Editor, BBC News Michael Cohen is turning into a dangerous adversary for the US president. Donald Trump Jr and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have both testified - one to Congress, the other to the special counsel - that the president knew nothing about the meeting until details of it emerged a year later. What's unclear is whether Michael Cohen has anything to corroborate his claim. That's led President Trump's new lawyer Rudy Giuliani to launch a scathing attack on Mr Cohen's character, describing him as a ""pathological liar"". Until very recently Michael Cohen had said he would take a bullet for the president. He now seems to be pointing a gun at Mr Trump's head. In response to the allegation, Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told NBC that Mr Cohen ""is not credible"". ""It's not true,"" he said. ""Why would you expect it would be true from someone like Cohen? A lawyer who would tape their own client is a lawyer without any character."" His comments refer toreports that Mr Cohen secretly recorded the president,externaldiscussing payments to a former Playboy model. The tapes were reportedly discovered during an FBI raid on Mr Cohen's property earlier this year in New York. Mr Trump insists he has done nothing wrong and says such a recording would be ""totally unheard of and perhaps illegal"". But things changed after the FBI raided his office and home in April. About a dozen audio recordings were seized and passed to federal prosecutors. Mr Cohen told ABC News this month that his loyalty to his family and country came before his old boss. His comments stoked speculation that he might co-operate with investigators against Mr Trump, although there has been no confirmation so far that he has done so. Mr Cohen is reportedly under investigation for possible bank and tax fraud, as well as potential violation of election law, though he has so far not been charged with anything.

How many dead US soldiers in North Korea?,"The two leaders signed the agreement at their historic summit in Singapore During the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the US and North Korea committed to recovering the remains of American troops missing in action during the Korean War. Thousands of US military personnel remain unaccounted for. The number varies fromstate-to-state,external. For example 431 Texans and 593 Californians are unaccounted for, while there is one man from Alaska on the list of missing. Most of them - about 5,300 - were lost in what is now North Korea, according to theUS defence agency,externalthat oversees the process of recovering the remains of American troops. And the US Army says it knows exactly where many are buried. Fighting stopped in 1953 - but technically the two Koreas remain at war. The conflict ended with an armistice agreement not a peace treaty. American-led UN forces, including troops from the UK, supported the South, while Chinese forces joined the war on the North's side. Estimates vary, but at least two million Korean civilians, up to 1.5 million communist and about 400,000 South Korean, 30,000 US and 1,000 UK service personnel are believed to have died. The 187th Infantry Regiment regimental combat team in May 1951 For years, teams of American researchers and scientists, with the help of North Koreans, uncovered and returned the remains of US troops found in North and South Korea. Between 1996 and 2005, 33 recovery operations were conducted in North Korea and 200 sets of remains were returned. And the US government paid compensation to North Koreans involved in the relief effort, $15m (Â£11m) according to theCongressional Research Service,external. Another six sets of remains were returned in a one-off operation in 2007. But joint operations have stalled for more than a decade because the US government said it could not guarantee the safety of the investigators. And in 2012,the US Army,externalsaid it had suspended efforts to find the remains of US servicemen due to North Korean threats to launch a ballistic missile. South Koreans marking the 64th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement The remains of soldiers are believed to be in: prisoner of war camps - many perished during the winter of 1950 the sites of major battles, such as the areas around Unsan and Chongchon in the north-west of the country - said to contain approximately 1,600 dead temporary UN military cemeteries - China and North Korea returned about 3,000 dead Americans in an effort called Operation Glory in 1954, but others remain the demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea - said to contain 1,000 bodies In the past, North Korean defectors have been screened for information concerning Americans who might be alive in the North. But since 1995, and after interviews with 25,000 North Korean defectors, no ""useful information"" has been revealed, according to the US.

Searching for the father they barely knew,"For many children it's been a lifelong search for their fathers Many families of US soldiers who fought - and never returned - from the Korean War are hoping their decades-long search for answers will soon be over. Thousands of American servicemen are still classified as missing in action (MIA) and at the US-North Korea summit earlier this year, Pyongyang promised to return the remains of 200 US troops from the conflict. The daughters of three missing servicemen shared their stories with the BBC's Cindy Sui. Gail Embery was about three years old when her father, US Army Sgt. Coleman Edwards, joined the war and was declared missing within a few months. Her mother remarried soon after and did not talk about him, so she grew up not knowing she had another father. She found out when she was 10 years old and since then has been trying to find him. ""It's because I feel him,"" Ms Embery says. ""He was only 18 when he went to fight for his country and he lost his life. It's important to me that he knows that somebody loved him, that what he did to sacrifice his life was not in vain."" Later, she attended meetings in Washington DC for the families of soldiers taken prisoner in war or classified as MIA. ""What I know is his company was captured in North Korea and they had to march to a prison camp. My father helped a lot of men who were not strong enough to make the march. They said he died of malnutrition. He was buried in a mound, outside the camp near a lake,"" she says. She later served on the board of directors for a group in Washington DC that lobbies for the search and identification of war remains. ""It's been very difficult and very frustrating."" Gail Embery says she's been waiting long enough More than 326,000 Americans fought alongside soldiers from South Korea and a UN coalition during the Korean War from 1950-53 to support the South against the Communist North. The missing US soldiers are among around 33,000 coalition troops still unaccounted for. Over the years, North Korea has handed over only a few hundred sets of American remains. Ms Embery and other families are hopeful President Trump's and Mr Kim's recent summit will lead to more remains being repatriated. ""I'm 73 years old; I don't feel I can wait that much longer,"" she says. ""I want them to know and feel it's very important to my father. He wants to come home."" Reality Check: How many dead US soldiers in North Korea? Korea war veteran's question for the US president Trump-Kim summit: What did it actually achieve? Almost 8,000 US soldiers are still 'missing in action' Diana Sanfilippo's father, 1st Lt. Frank Salazar, was a fighter pilot whose unit was stationed in the US, but he volunteered to go to Korea when he was 29 years old. ""He wanted to do his patriotic duty and he cared about people in trouble,"" she says. ""I have a few memories of him playing with me, dancing with me, throwing me up in the air and catching me, and letting me bounce on the bed,"" recalls Ms Sanfilippo, who was four when he left. ""I also remember the last time I saw him. I had this sense he was going to someplace dangerous and I didn't want him to go."" ""I remember him hugging me when we dropped him off at the airbase, and telling me he loved me and to be good to my mommy."" After he was declared missing in action, her mother remarried and didn't want to look back. ""When I asked questions, my mom would just get upset at me."" The agony of not knowing led her to try to find answers. She later learned from other pilots that he was on a reconnaissance mission north of Pyongyang when his plane was likely hit by ground fire. ""My father radioed that there was heavy artillery fire. When the wingman radioed my father, my dad didn't answer. He never saw my dad's plane go down; my dad was never confirmed dead."" After suffering with depression, Ms Sanfilippo became a family therapist. The psychology training helped her realize she had to reconnect with her dad and come to terms with her loss. ""I refer to it as my own search and rescue mission. Just as the US Air Force sent out a search and rescue mission to find my dad after he went missing; I too was lost and needed to find myself. It took me almost 20 years, but I did it."" Later she became a pilot to know her dad through what he loved: flying. She even flew a P-51 Mustang - the type of plane her father flew on his last mission. Ms Sanfilippo even learned to fly the plane her father flew Ms Sanfilippo has also written a book about coming to terms with losing her father. She doesn't think her father is still alive, but she's not sure; some prisoners of war never returned even after the armistice. He would be 95. Koreas set dates for new family reunions Is North Korea sticking with its nukes? An estimated 30,000 US soldiers died in the 1950-53 Korean war The only picture Janis Curran has of herself with her father, Lt. Charles Garrison, is one taken just before he left for the Korean War. He was a Navy fighter pilot and his plane was shot down as he tried to protect ground troops from the advancing North Korean soldiers. He parachuted out of the plane and waited for a helicopter to rescue them. But the helicopter had another mission and when it returned, her dad was no longer there. It's believed that he was taken prisoner by North Korea. He had just turned 31 and she was three years old. ""It's hard to live your life not knowing what happened to your loved one,"" Ms Curran says. Janis Curran only has this one photograph of her father The saddest times were ironically the happy moments - her wedding, and the births of her daughter and sister's children. ""You feel that person is missing. It's like a dark cloud is over your head all the time."" Her grandparents died thinking he may still be alive, and her mother died in 2004. Janis Curran (right) with her sister Karen Malan at the DMZ, the site for talks between North and South ""I wish the remains could've been returned when my mom was still alive. She could've remarried after the government declared him dead in 1954. She was so beautiful. But she said she was a one-man woman,"" Ms Curran says.

North Korea in no hurry to please the US,"Meeting in Singapore last month, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un captured the world's attention and promised to work towards ""new relations"". Why have mixed messages followed? At the end of a summit billed as an ""epochal event"", ambitions were set high. North Korea reaffirmed its commitment to the ""denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"", while the US said it would stop ""provocative"" war games with South Korea. Things have since taken a rockier path. Although Pyongyang appears to have begundismantling a rocket site, there have been reports that it issecretly continuing its weapons programme. Meanwhile, Pyongyang hasaccused the US of ""gangster-like"" tactics. So, why has there been a lack of clear progress? North Korea's notoriety and ability to capture global headlines may have led to its power being overestimated. It appears Pyongyang has sought to disguise a position of relative weakness as one of unqualified strength. It framed the summit as one between equal nuclear powers. In fact, theLowy Institute ranks North Korea 17th out of 25 countries in its Asia Power Index,external- an in-depth assessment of the regional distribution of power, using measures including military, economic and cultural influence. North Korea is a misfit power. Despite its new-found confidence as a nuclear-armed country, it remains a weak state preoccupied by its very survival. That its influence is disproportionately dependent on its military strength may, ironically, make it less willing to make serious concessions than the US and others have hoped. North Korea has used the Sohae station to launch rockets North Korea may be one of the top military powers in Asia, but its emphasis is on quantity over quality. The country's 1.4m military and paramilitary personnel account for about 8% of its working-age population. Only China, Russia and India have larger standing armies. By comparison, South Korea - which has more than twice the North's population, and compulsory military service - has less than half the armed forces. Pyongyang has large numbers of battle tanks and even its navymaintains a fleet of about 70 ageing submarines. But it is its development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons that enables the regime to make threats far beyond its immediate region. However, to actually use this capability would be to provoke retaliation that would end the regime. Pyongyang's permanent war footing has come at an enormous cost. The countryspends upwards of 24% of its GDP on the military,external, the US Bureau of Arms Control, Verification and Compliance estimates. This extreme military burden has been justified by invoking a siege mentality among its population, with chronic impoverishment explained away as the result of the actions of foreign aggressors. The consequence is that, on all non-military measures of resources and influence, North Korea is flatlining. A coal power station in Pyongyang In a dynamic and rapidly growing part of the world, North Korea is falling behind. North Korea's economy, when local prices are taken into account, is roughly the same size as that of Laos, one of the poorest countries in south-east Asia, which has just a quarter of the population. Theproductivity of North Korea's workers is the lowest in Asia,externaland it suffers from an unusually low share of natural resources. The country relies substantially on imports of food, refined metals and fuel, while itsmain export to the outside world is coal briquettes,external. More like this Are North and South Korea friends again? North Korea's surprising number of friends How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? How a killer disease was stopped in its tracks Pyongyang's diplomatic and economic relationships are similarly stunted. Its trade with the region in 2015 amounted to about $6bn, less than 1% of South Korea's total,Lowy Institute research suggests,external. And yet it does have links with a surprising number of countries. Pyongyang maintains a network of 46 embassies worldwide,external, just behind New Zealand, and ahead of many other countries, including Singapore. These outposts have often beenaccused of operating as fronts for illicit activities. North Korea also makes the best of the few friends it has. Simply existing next to China benefits North Korea.A mutual defence treatycommits each country to providing military assistance to the other should it be attacked. Economically, Beijing is a lifeline, with trade between the two countries accounting for 87% of North Korea's total trade, according to research by the Lowy Institute. That gives Beijing tremendous power to impose costs on Pyongyang if it so wishes. Yet North Korea knows that while China has supported UN sanctions, it is likely to steer clear of more punishing measures. That would risk the collapse of the regime and cause instability on its border. North Korea is a wily survivor, but that is not the same as having broad-based international power. Indeed, it suffers from what has beendescribed as a ""legitimacy deficit"",external, particularly when compared with larger, more democratic and more prosperous South Korea. Like its southern counterpart, North Korea claims to be the legitimate government of the entire peninsula. But it has much less power than its neighbour. Is North Korea broke? Did Trump and Kim really achieve anything in Singapore? Did the summit rhetoric match reality? How many dead US soldiers in North Korea? How does North Korea do business under sanctions? South Korea also has a formidable military and itstreaty alliance with the US includes extended nuclear deterrence. It wields widespread influence in Asia, with well-developed trade and investment ties. And it has cultural power to match - partly through a voracious regional appetite for K-pop and South Korean soap operas. South Korea attracts 15.7 million tourists annually from across Asia, compared with the estimated 1.4 million Chinese tourists that visit North Korea each year. North Korea receives only a fraction of the tourists welcomed by South Korea each year By drawing the US president into talks - and partially normalising ties - Mr Kim appears to have played a weak hand well. He praised Singapore's economic success and promised to bring home lessons for North Korea's progress. But he did not agree to a timeframe for denuclearisation. The US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons upfront and reap largely economic rewards in return. Yet it is far from clear that Pyongyang sees economic development as being incompatible with keeping some form of nuclear power. And its willingness to give up its signature weapons capabilities is likely to depend on whether it thinks reforming into a benign state would risk the collapse of the regime. Even if it felt it could survive, North Korea might well have to submit to being South Korea's junior partner. It would be decades before income reaches levels seen in South Korea and with only half the population, it would be likely to remain in its shadow. Is that too steep a price for the Kim dynasty to pay? About this piece This analysis piece wascommissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.

The Met Office said 34.7C was recorded in Tibenham, Norfolk, on Friday but the early development of thunderstorms had suppressed temperatures and kept them below Thursday's high of 35.3C. A Met Office yellow warning,externalfor thunderstorms remains in place for the east of England until 02:00 BST and the east of Scotland until Saturday afternoon. Damage to signalling equipment meant trains between York and Leeds were unable to run for several hours, causing dozens of cancellations.

North Korea returns US war remainsRelatives of the slain soldiers have waited years to be reunited with the remains of their loved ones.Asia,"The remains arrived at a US airbase in South Korea North Korea has returned remains believed to be of 55 US troops killed during the Korean War, bringing renewed hope to families who have waited decades for closure. The return of the remains, brought to a US base in South Korea, is the latest move in the cautious diplomacy between Washington and Pyongyang. The repatriation was agreed at the June summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. It is hoped more will follow. ""It's hard to live your life not knowing what happened to your loved one,"" the daughter of one missing serviceman told the BBC ahead of Friday's news. How will the remains be identified? Reality Check: How many dead US soldiers in North Korea? Searching for the father they barely knew The Singapore summit, where Mr Trump and Mr Kim agreed to work towards the ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula"", has been criticised for a lack of detail on when or how Pyongyang would renounce nuclear weapons. This video can not be played Trump thanks Kim Jong-un for repatriation of fallen troops But the return of US remains was one of four points actually listed in that June declaration, and comes on the 65th anniversary of the signing of the armistice that ended the 1950-1953 Korean War. It is believed that 55 soldiers have been returned this time, but their remains will need to be forensically tested to ensure they are indeed slain US troops - and it's possible the identification process could take years. Why North Korea is in no hurry to please the US John Zimmerlee, the son of a US serviceman who is among the missing, told the BBC there was no guarantee these were the remains of American soldiers. Mr Zimmerlee, the founder of the Korean War Prisoners Of War and Missing In Action Network, said: ""Keep in mind that these 55 remains that are coming back, these are people that they [North Korea] suspected were their enemy during the (Korean) war - not necessarily Americans. ""They could be British, they could be Australians, Belgians - could be a lot of different people."" By Laura Bicker, BBC Seoul correspondent, Osan air base The small wooden caskets were draped in the UN flag and carried carefully one by one from the aircraft onto US soil. Hundreds of US soldiers and some of their families from the Osan base came to salute and line the route of their final journey. Before the ceremony they'd been told they would be watching a key moment in history. They stood silently and watched. Earlier I'd asked Korean War veterans from the US and the UK what this meant to them. Amazing news, they told me. ""This is an emotional and symbolic gesture,"" said another. More than 326,000 Americans fought alongside soldiers from South Korea and a UN coalition during the war to support the South against the Communist North. Thousands of US military personnel from the Korean war remain unaccounted for and most of them - about 5,300 - were lost in what is now North Korea. The missing US soldiers are among around 33,000 coalition troops still unaccounted for. There are thought to be around 5,300 remains of US soldiers in North Korea The remains are believed to be located at: prisoner of war camps - many perished during the winter of 1950 the sites of major battles, such as the areas around Unsan and Chongchon in the north-west of the country - said to contain approximately 1,600 dead temporary UN military cemeteries - China and North Korea returned about 3,000 dead Americans in an effort called Operation Glory in 1954, but others remain the demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea - said to contain 1,000 bodies Between 1990 and 2005, 229 sets were returned, but this halted as relations deteriorated with the development of North Korea's nuclear ambitions. A US military aircraft took the remains to the US base at Osan in South Korea where, according to the White House, a repatriation ceremony will be held on 1 August after some initial testing. The remains will then be brought to the US to undergo thorough forensic testing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House said it was ""a solemn obligation of the United States Government to ensure that the remains are handled with dignity and properly accounted for so their families receive them in an honorable manner"". The US government said it was ""encouraged by North Korea's actions and the momentum for positive change"". The return of the dead soldiers was ""a significant first step to recommence the repatriation of remains from North Korea and to resume field operations in North Korea to search for the estimated 5,300 Americans who have not yet returned home"".

The repatriation will be welcomed by relatives who have waited decades for progress. But Bill Richardson, a former UN ambassador who secured the return of six bodies in 2007, remains sceptical. He told the Washington Post: ""They'll give a certain amount of remains for free,externalright away, but then they'll say, 'The next ones, we need to find them, locate them, restore them.' And then they'll start charging."" It is thought North Korea has about 200 sets of remains collected already. The 12 June summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un saw both sides speak with ambition about concrete steps to improve relations but experts have cast doubt on whether Pyongyang is genuine in its apparent commitment to ""denuclearise"". Last weekNorth Korea appeared to begin dismantling part of a key rocket launch sitebut there have been reports it secretly continues its weapons programme. Meanwhile, Pyongyang has accused the US of ""gangster-like"" tactics. There's also been little clarity  about what exactly the two sides mean by ""complete denuclearisation"" and no details on a timeline for this to take place. Nevertheless, Friday's repatriation will likely be seen as a concrete goodwill gesture after years of efforts by relatives and US authorities to retrieve the remains.

Google executive warns of face ID bias,"Google's Diane Greene spoke to the BBC on the sidelines of the company's annual cloud conference in San Francisco Facial recognition technology does not yet have ""the diversity it needsâ and has âinherent biasesâ, a top Google executive has warned. The remarks, from the firmâs director of cloud computing, Diane Greene, came after rival Amazonâs softwarewrongly identified 28 members of Congress, disproportionately people of colour, as police suspects. Google, which has not opened its facial recognition technology to public use, was working on gathering vast sums of data to improve reliability, Ms Greene said. However, she refused to discuss the companyâs controversial work with the military. âBad things happen when I talk about Maven,â Ms Greene said, referring to a soon-to-be abandoned project with the US military to develop artificial intelligence technology for drones. After considerable employee pressure, including resignations, Google said itwould not renew its contract with the Pentagon after it lapses some time in 2019. The firm has not commented on the deal since, only to release a set of âAI principlesâ that stated it would not use artificial intelligence or machine learning to create weapons. 'Thinking really deeply' On face recognition, there has been considerable concern among Silicon Valley workers, and civil rights groups, about the application of the emerging technology - particularly when it comes to law enforcement. Amazonâs Rekognition software, which allows clients to use Amazon AI tech to power facial recognition, was being used by at least two police forces in the US. There are major misgivings about the accuracy and readiness of the technology which has seen widespread, controversial use in China. In the US, the misidentification of members of Congress was discovered by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), whichpublished its findings on Thursday,external. Amazon disputed the ACLUâs conclusions about its technology, saying the group had used the wrong settings. Ms Greene said that while Google does use facial recognition to help users identify friends in pictures, its underlying technology was not open for public use. ""We need to be really careful about how we use this kind of technology,â she told the BBC. ""We're thinking really deeply. The humanistic side of AI - it doesn't have the diversity it needs and the data itself will have some inherent biases, so everybody's working to understand that."" She added: ""I think everybody wants to do the right thing. I'm sure Amazon wants to do the right thing too. But it's a new technology, it's a very powerful technology.â Googleâs image recognition software has been offensively inaccurate in the past. In 2015,it identified a black couple as being âgorillasâ. The firm apologised. Two members of Congress have written to Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos to talk about the alleged issue with his companyâs system. Speaking of facial recognition more widely, the ACLU said: ""Congress should enact a federal moratorium on law enforcement use of this technology until there can be a full debate on what - if any - uses should be permitted."" ________ Follow Dave Lee onTwitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Papa John's founder sues pizza chain,"Mr Schnatter will no longer appear on Papa John's pizza boxes and other marketing material The founder and former chairman of Papa John's has taken the company to court seeking access to documents related to his exit from the pizza chain. John Schnatter resigned earlier this month after apologising for using the N-word in a conference call. Lawyers for Mr Schnatter said they wanted to see the documents because of the ""unexplained and heavy-handed way"" that Papa John's had treated him. Papa John's said it was ""saddened and disappointed"" by the lawsuit. Mr Schnatter filed the complaint on Thursday in Delaware Chancery Court. Papa John's founder resigns over N-word Papa John's founder to go from branding His attorneys said they were ""seeking to inspect Company documents because of the unexplained and heavy-handed way in which the Company has treated him since the publication of a story that falsely accused him of using a racial slur"". ""Rather than address the real issues like the health of the business, the company is hiding documents that, we believe, will disclose the actual facts as to what is occurring here, including using Mr Schnatter as a scapegoat to cover up their own shortcomings and failures,"" they added. In a statement Papa John's said the company was ""saddened and disappointed"" that Mr Schnatter had filed a ""needless and wasteful lawsuit in an attempt to distract from his own words and actions"". ""We are providing Mr Schnatter all of the materials he is entitled to as a director. ""We will not let his numerous mis-statements in the complaint and elsewhere distract us from the important work we are doing to move the business forward for our 120,000 corporate and franchise team members, and our franchisees, customers and stakeholders,"" the company said. After Mr Schnatter's resignation the company said it would remove his image from its  branding. Mr Schnatter's resignation as chairman was announced earlier this month Papa John's is the world's third-largest pizza chain, with more than 350 outlets in the UK and 4,900 restaurants worldwide. The incident occurred during a media training conference call in May between top staff at Papa John's and a marketing agency called Laundry Service. According to Forbes,external, the call involved a role-playing exercise that was supposed to give Mr Schnatter experience in dealing with difficult issues. When discussing how he would distance himself from racist groups, Mr Schnatter said that Colonel Sanders, the founder of KFC, had never faced criticism for using the N-word, Forbes reported. It was not the first controversy involving Mr Schnatter. He resigned as chief executive last year aftercriticising the NFLover players' national anthem protests.

Iran general warns Trump: 'We are ready',"An Iranian special forces commander has warned President Donald Trump if the US attacks Iran it ""will destroy all your capabilities"". Major General Qassem Soleimani vowed that if Mr Trump started a war, the Islamic Republic would end it, Iranian news agency Tasnim reported. It follows Mr Trump's all-caps-lock tweet warning Iran's president to ""never, ever"" threaten the US. Tensions have risen since the US withdrew from the 2015 Iran deal. Maj Gen Soleimani - who leads the Quds Force of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards - was quoted on Thursday as saying: ""As a soldier, it is my duty to respond to your threats. Angry Trump Iran threat becomes meme ""Talk to me, not to the president [Hassan Rouhani]. It is not in our president's dignity to respond to you. This video can not be played Iranian Americans on Trump's policies ""We are near you, where you can't even imagine. Come. We are ready. ""If you begin the war, we will end the war. You know that this war will destroy all your capabilities."" He also accused the US president of using the language of ""night clubs and gambling halls"".

But two days later, while speaking to a veterans' group, the president said the US was ""ready to make a real deal"" with Iran. Three reasons behind Trump ditching Iran deal Mr Trump's angry tweet was a response to a warning by Mr Rouhani to the US. ""America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,"" he said earlier, according to Iran's state news agency Irna. This video can not be played People in the Iran-aligned suburbs of Beirut give their reaction to US withdrawal from the nuclear deal In May, Mr Trump announced that the US was withdrawing from the Obama-era nuclear agreement with Iran, going against advice from European allies. Mr Trump had said the Iran deal was ""defective to its core"". In response, Iran had said it was preparing to restart uranium enrichment, key for making both nuclear energy and weapons. Washington is now re-imposing sanctions on Iran's oil, aircraft exports to Iran, and precious metals trade among other sectors, despite objections from the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, who all signed the 2015 agreement. But there are other flashpoints too. The US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East and is aligned with Israel and Saudi Arabia, two of Iran's foes. Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and its compliance with the 2015 deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

'One in 12 workers' miss out on holiday,"One worker in 12 does not take the time off work they should, according to Trades Union Congress (TUC) analysis. In the UK there are 1.2 million workers who receive no annual leave at all, and 2.2 million who get less than the legal minimum holiday of five and a half weeks a year, the organisation said. Those missing out were ""at risk of burn-out"", said the TUC. The government said employers were expected to treat workers fairly and abide by employment law. In the UK most workers who work a five-day week are legally entitled to 28 days' paid leave per year. An employer can include bank holidays as part of that statutory leave entitlement. Workers missed out on holiday either because they were set unrealistic workloads that could not be completed on time, or because employers were deliberately denying holiday requests and ""managing out"" people's leave, the TUC said. But not granting leave caused stress and mental and physical ill-health, which had knock-on effects on co-workers, friends and families, the union body said. The TUC suggests the tax authority, HMRC, should be given new powers to clamp down on employers who aren't giving staff the leave owed them. A spokesman from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said employers should make sure workers got the holiday pay and leave they were legally entitled to. He said it was providing new rights to millions of workers, with holiday pay to be enforced for vulnerable workers and that these new plans would be outlined in due course. People working in agriculture, mining and quarrying, and accommodation and food were the most likely to be missing out, according to the TUC's analysis. It also showed: Workers are losing out on nearly Â£3bn worth of paid leave a year 9.2% of female workers and 7.2% of male workers are losing out The sectors with the highest numbers of staff losing out are retail (348,000), education (342,000) and health and social care workers (291,000) ""We're now in peak holiday season. But while many workers are away enjoying time off with friends and family, millions are missing out,"" Frances O'Grady, the TUC general secretary, said. ""Employers have no excuse for robbing staff of their well-earned leave. UK workers put in billions of hours of unpaid overtime as it is."" The analysis was based on unpublished data from the ONS Labour Force Survey from 2017. Why are more people working nights?

May heads to Austria for Brexit talksThe prime minister will meet the Austrian chancellor and Czech PM before heading off on holiday.UK Politics,"Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz has told Theresa May it is ""important to avoid a hard Brexit"", after talks with the UK prime minister. Mrs May is in Salzburg as part of a mission by UK ministers to sell their post-Brexit trade proposals. Mr Kurz said he viewed Brexit ""negatively"" but felt negotiations were going ""quite well"". Mrs May then held talks with Czech PM Andrej Babis before heading off on her summer holidays. Barnier rules out key UK customs proposal Laura Kuenssberg: What now for the government? Speaking at a brief joint press conference, Mr Kurz, who has just assumed the EU presidency for six months, said: ""The Brexit decision is a decision we see very negatively. ""But, of course, it has been taken by the British people so now we have to find a way to deal with it, and from our point of view it is important to avoid a hard Brexit."" He said he hoped the UK's talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier would be successful and a ""solution"" could be found by October. The BBC understands that Mr Kurz has indicated he supports the idea of EU leaders holding formal Brexit talks at a summit in Salzburg in September. Mrs May hailed the strength of the UK's relationship with Austria, adding: ""We are delivering on a vote of the British people, they chose to leave the EU and we will deliver that."" Later, Mrs May pitched her idea for a post-Brexit free trade area to her Czech counterpart Andrej Babis. A Downing Street spokesman said: ""She highlighted that a UK-EU free trade area would maintain frictionless trade that would enable businesses across Europe to maintain their vital integrated supply chains. ""They agreed it was important to find a solution and that negotiations should continue at pace."" Dominic Raab and Michel Barnier met for talks on Thursday Both the EU and UK say a deal can be done by October - five months before the UK is due to leave the European Union - but have also said preparations are being made in case negotiations end in no deal. Mr Barnier has already rejected a key element of her proposal for post-Brexit trade with the EU. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has accused the EU of pushing the UK towards a ""no deal"" scenario because they ""keep saying no to everything"". Mr Fox, who is on a trade mission to San Francisco,told Business Insider,externalthe UK should leave without a deal if talks break down, rather than requesting an extension of the Article 50 process to continue negotiations, as some have suggested. ""To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right,"" he added. Mrs May's trip to Austria is one of several being made to Europe by British government ministers over the summer to promote her plan, detailed in the Brexit White Paper, to European leaders. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met his German counterpart in Berlin on Monday and the UK chancellor, home secretary, business secretary and the minister for the Cabinet Office are also meeting counterparts across Europe over the summer. Following talks in Austria, Mrs May will head to Italy with her husband, Philip, for a week before returning to the UK to work. She is also due to attend a World War One memorial event marking the centenary of the battle of Amiens, which began on 8 August 1918, before heading off for two weeks' holiday in Switzerland. Dress rehearsals for The Magic Flute in Salzburg Analysis by BBC Diplomatic Correspondent James Robbins Salzburg in high summer is packed with tourists and music lovers enjoying the annual festival. Theresa May went to the opera on Friday night, but only after her talks with Mr Kurz and Mr Babis. The prime minister is hoping to persuade them to urge others in the EU27 to relax their common position - particularly by accepting her proposals for continuing free movement of products after Brexit. But there's no sign either Austria or the Czech Republic is willing to budge. Eurosceptic feeling may be strong among their populations, but neither leader is contemplating following Britain out of the Union. Instead, both governments believe Mrs May is still cherry-picking and that Britain must blink first to avoid what they call a catastrophic crash-out they are convinced would hurt the UK far more than the EU. Mozart's The Magic Flute, in the city of his birth, should have been something of a relief for Mrs May. The UK's Brexit White Paper, drawn up after agreement with the cabinet at Chequers, proposes close ties in some areas, such as the trade in goods, but Mrs May says it will end free movement of people and the jurisdiction of the European Court, and allow the UK to strike trade deals with other nations. It would involve the UK collecting some EU tariffs - in a bid to ensure frictionless trade in goods and to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland - under its proposed Facilitated Customs Arrangement for goods and agri-foods. The plan sparked two UK cabinet resignations - former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. This video can not be played Hard Brexit. Soft Brexit. No Deal.  What does Brexit mean? Mr Barnier said on Thursday that the EU ""will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules and VAT and excises duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU's governance structures"". Any customs arrangement or union ""must respect this principle"", he said.

"Over 1,800 US child migrants reunitedThe US government meets a deadline to reunite children separated from parents at the Mexican border.US & Canada","This video can not be played The moment a migrant mother is reunited with her son Some 711 migrant children taken from their parents at the US-Mexico border have not yet been returned to them, despite a court-ordered deadline. US government lawyers said the children were not eligible to be reunited with their parents. The reasons given included a lack of confirmed family ties, or a parent having a criminal record or a communicable disease. In 431 cases the parents were no longer in the US, a court filing said. US officials separated more than 2,500 children from undocumented adults at the border with Mexico earlier this year, in a ""zero tolerance"" crackdown on illegal immigration. But it was suspended by President Donald Trump last month after a fierce backlash. Inside the chaotic effort to reunite separated families Why the US separated children from their parents,external The Trump administration says it has reunited more than 1,800 migrant children with family members. Its lawyers argue that it met the legal deadline, as the 711 remaining children are not ""eligible"" to be given back. This video can not be played Fox v MSNBC on immigration: How the news divides America The majority of the children were reunified with their parents in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, and 378 others were released in ""appropriate circumstances"". This covers those reunited with parents who were already out of government custody, those sent to another relative or family friend, and those who are now over the age of 18. Of the 711 deemed ineligible, 120 children's parents had ""waived reunification"", the government said on Thursday evening. Dozens more remain separated because of ""adult red flag"", referring to situations in which the child might be at risk. A court order imposed a deadline on the Trump administration to release all children aged between five and 17. San Diego federal judge Dana Sabraw ruled last month that all the detained minors separated under the policy should be brought back to their families by 26 July. ""By the court deadline this evening we are on track to reunite all eligible parents within ICE custody,"" said Chris Meekins of the Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday. This video can not be played Trump supporters talk family separations and border security But the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which has sued the government over the policy, said US officials had only met ""a self-defined deadline"". ACLU lawyer Lee Gelernt told reporters: ""The government shouldn't be proud of the work they're doing in separation. This is a disaster that they created."" The court filing says hundreds of children are ineligible to be reunited because their parents have left the country. The ACLU said it would try to trace the missing parents, but a former acting director of ICE, the agency that rounds up undocumented migrants, said he fears many families will never be reunited. ""There is a very high likelihood that those parents are not going to see their children again,"" John Sandweg told CBS News. The Trump administration earlier this month reunited more than 100 migrant children under five years old with their parents, though it missed a court-ordered deadline to do so. It said 57 of these youngsters were back with their families, though 46 others were deemed ineligible because of safety concerns, parental deportations, or other issues. US President Donald Trump halted the family separations in late June after pictures of locked-up children and audio of them crying in distress triggered uproar. But the reunions process has proved chaotic, with some children transported to see their parents only to end up back in their shelters after discovering their loved ones were not at the location. The families were held after entering the US illegally, while others claimed asylum at border crossings, citing violence in their home countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. The children were being sent to various care facilities across the country, while the adults were held in detention centres or prisons.

Rescuers found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, while many more people are still missing. Giannis Labropoulos was driving from Patras to Athens. ""We could not see more than 20m [65ft] ahead but all of a sudden we could feel the heat and see the fire. I just thought this cannot be happening,"" he told the BBC. ""We were pretty scared. We didn't know if we would make it through, we just did not know what to expect. ""Branches and debris were hitting the car. ""The power of the fire and the intense heat made it something we would not want to experience ever again."" A forest fire rages in Neo Voutsa, a northeast suburb of Athens Argyro Moustaka Brettou was 3km (1.8 miles) away - but her two young children were at her home, in the village of Mati, 29km (18 miles) to the east of Athens, which they share with her mother, 65, and aunt, 75. ""I could see a new fire had begun in the mountain above where we live - so I called my mother to let her know. ""Within five minutes of this call, the fire had spread everywhere - the whole area of Mati was on fire. ""It was like something in a Hollywood movie. I've never witnessed anything like that. ""Whilst I was on the phone, my mother said she couldn't breathe because of the smoke - so another grandparent came to pick up my babies, as a precaution. ""My mother then called again and said our garden was on fire. ""She and my aunt were screaming that they were going to be burned alive. ""They were afraid to go out through the garden because whole area was on fire. ""Whilst trying to drive back home, I was yelling, 'My mother is being burned alive, please let me back!' ""But the roads were jammed. Nothing could get in - so I told them to get out of the house and scream for help. ""Out of the blue, a young man whose house was also in flames came by in a car. They got inside and he drove them away. ""I had no battery on my phone after a while and didn't know if my mother had made it or if my children were safe. ""The several hours of waiting were a living hell. I got to see them the next morning. ""Our beautiful small town is completely destroyed. We find victims every day. Everybody lost their fortune. These were our houses. ""Most of us have no place to go. We don't have any money to move to another place - we have to start all over again. ""But we are the lucky ones - we are alive and our children are healthy."" Olivia Exarchakou, 19,  is a student in central Athens. Two of her family friends have died in the fires. ""All day we could see the smoke from the rooftops. We saw it billowing past the Acropolis. ""Yesterday it was very hot and dark because of the smoke. ""There was a lot of wind as well, the winds were so strong cushions and mops were blown from balconies onto the street below. ""A close friend of my mother lost her summer house in the Voutsa area. ""I know two people who have died as a result of the fire. ""One died at home. She didn't have time to get out of her house because of the speed at which the fire spread.

Deadly forest fires rage across Greece In pictures: wildfires devastate Greek region Greece wildfires: 60 dead in holiday area The fire broke out in forested land in the Penteli area Catherine Hooper from Bristol travels to Greece regularly and is close to the affected area. ""I am about 20km away on the other side of the Pentelicus mountain range where the fire took hold. ""Even here, the air is acrid. A thick smog hangs over Athens and supermarkets are giving out truck loads of water. ""I have lost count of the number of fire planes and helicopters that have passed and continue to pass overhead, there is a constant drone from planes overhead. ""Yesterday afternoon strong winds meant the fire spread down the mountainside fast. Reports here said roads were jammed and that many people ran to the beach to try and out-run the fire. ""Hundreds went into the sea, but the hot ash and flying debris forced many to swim far out. ""The waves were large and currents pushed people out towards Evia Island. ""This morning I heard that three women and a child drowned. Many more are missing at sea. ""Some swimmers were in the water for four hours before being rescued. ""This morning 26 people were found dead in a taverna. I hear that they have found a mother dead with her child in her arms. ""They have counted 25 people dead on the roads towards the beach.
