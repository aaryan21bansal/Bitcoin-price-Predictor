A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims,"The Campaign Against anti-Semitism stages a protest in 2018 The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has dragged on for several years. Here's a guide to what's been going on. In October 2020, a report bythe UK's human rights watchdog found Labourto be responsible for ""unlawful"" acts of harassment and discrimination during Jeremy Corbyn's four-and a-half years as party leader. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigation identified serious failings in leadership and an inadequate process of handling anti-Semitism complaints. Its report said the party was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political interference in anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints and harassment. In a statement, it said: ""The equality body's analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it."" The commission served an unlawful act notice on the party, meaning it has to produce an action plan within six weeks, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not acted upon. The inquiry was launched in May 2019 after ""receiving a number of complaints about allegations of anti-Semitism in the party"". Responding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a day of shame for the Labour Party"" and apologised to the Jewish community. He said the party would implement all the report's recommendations in full and promised a ""culture change"" in Labour. He added: ""Under my leadership, zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism will mean precisely that. If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this Party. And we'll make sure you're not. ""And if - after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there's no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, that it's all exaggerated, or a factional attack, then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either."" Sir Keir's predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not accept all of the report's findings but expressed the hope that the recommendations would be ""swiftly implemented"". He said ""anyone claiming there is no anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is wrong"" but added that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media"". Labour suspended Mr Corbyn from the party and removed the whip, meaning he would no longer be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party. In a statement, the party said: ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation."" Three weeks later, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive Committee (NEC) - decided to readmit Mr Corbyn as a party member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and Sir Keir decided not to restore the whip to his predecessor - meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review, but allies of Mr Corbyn have urged him to change his mind immediately, saying the former leader is being ""persecuted"". Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand Jewish people have faced prejudice and hostility for centuries. During World War II, six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis or their accomplices in what is known as the Holocaust. Modern-day anti-Semitism can take many forms including, but not limited to, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the global financial system and the media, to attacks on synagogues, verbal abuse or hate speech and abusive memes on social media. In 2018, anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK reached a record high,according to the Community Security Trust,external, which monitors them. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopteda working definition of anti-Semitism,externalwhich described it as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The UK and a number of other IHRA members haveadopted or endorsed the working definition,external, as well as a series of accompanying ""contemporary"" examples of how anti-Semitism manifests itself in public life. These include Holocaust denial, denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (through the existence of a State of Israel), and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of that state. Labour got itself into trouble over the definition - as we'll explain later. Debates about anti-Semitism in Labour often involve Israel and the term ""Zionism"". In its modern sense, Zionism refers to support for Israel's existence and prosperity. It began as a political movement in Europe in the late 19th Century which sought to develop Jewish nationhood in the land known as Palestine - also known to Jews as the ancient Land of Israel. The movement evolved and eventually led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jewish people, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Attitudes to Israel in the UK, and on the left in particular, are influenced by its troubled relationship with its Arab neighbours and its long conflict with the Palestinians. A 2016 report by the Home Affairs Committee of MPs backed the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism but said it should include an additional statement to maintain freedom of speech ""in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine"". This, it said, should read ""it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent"" or to hold Israel ""to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest ant-Semitic intent"". Read more about the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The anti-Semitism row was a constant backdrop to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015. Mr Corbyn and his allies on the left had spent decades campaigning for Palestinian statehood, in contrast with the more nuanced position taken by many of his predecessors. Under his leadership, there was an influx of new members, many of whom were vocal critics of Israel and who believed the UK, along with the US, should be tougher towards Israel, especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. As the balance of power within Labour changed after Mr Corbyn's election as leader, attention quickly focused on what activists and elected representatives were saying - and had said in the past - on social media and elsewhere about Israel and Jewish people. There were claims that anti-Semitic tropes were being widely propagated and a number of incidents attracted a great deal of attention. There were a string of high-profile suspensions over alleged anti-Semitic comments - and constant accusations, from Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, that Mr Corbyn and his team were failing to take the issue seriously enough. The row threatened to the tear the party apart, with several high-profile MPs walking out over abuse they received. Mr Corbyn repeatedly insisted that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated in the party, but critics said he was not doing enough to root out the problem. In April 2018, Jennie Formby, an ally of Mr Corbyn, took over as Labour's general secretary and set about tightening up the party's disciplinary procedures and recruiting more staff to deal with anti-Semitism cases. The full story of the controversies over Mr Corbyn's position on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are set out below. But let's now look at efforts by the man elected to replace him as leader in March 2020, Sir Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the issue. When Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April, he made tackling anti-Semitism a top priority, promising to ""tear out this poison by its roots"" in his acceptance speech. In a video conference with Jewish leaders, the new Labour leader and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said they would set up an independent complaints procedure and review all outstanding cases. This was welcomed by Jewish leaders, whosaid in a joint statementthat Sir Keir had ""achieved more in four days"" than Mr Corbyn did ""in four years"". Shortly afterwards, an internal report into the party's handling of anti-Semitism cases, written in the final month of Mr Corbyn's tenure, was leaked. The 860 page dossiersaid that factional hostilitytowards Mr Corbyn's leadership among senior party staff had led to a ""litany of mistakes"" that hindered the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Opponents of Mr Corbyn claimed the report was leaked in an attempt to ""smear whistleblowers"", who had spoken to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation. But supporters of the former leader are incensed about alleged evidence that senior former staff members ""openly worked against the aims and objectives"" of the party leadership. The report included thousands of emails and private WhatsApp messages, by named individuals, which allegedly show hostility towards Mr Corbyn, party members and policies. Sir Keir has ordered an inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked to the media, which is still ongoing. In July this year, the Labour Partyagreed to pay ""substantial"" damagesto seven former employees who spoke out about anti-Semitism, in a BBC Panorama programme. The party issued an unreserved apology in the High Court for making ""false and defamatory"" comments about the seven whistleblowers. Labour to report on anti-Semitism leak in July Labour names head of leaked report investigation Sir Keirsacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey had retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake, later saying she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, saying: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Ms Peake later tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". Allegations of anti-Semitism against party members and supporters dogged Jeremy Corbyn's four-and-half years as Labour leader. Among those suspended by the party for alleged anti-Semitism were MP Naz Shah, the ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Chris Williamson, an ally and friend of Mr Corbyn. Chris Williamson was one of a number of prominent figures to be suspended Ms Shah apologisedfor a string of comments on Facebook, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States, although she was subsequently re-instated. She has since gone on to play a leading role in the fight against anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Livingstone quit the partyafter a long-running row over claims Adolf Hitler had once supported Zionism while Mr Williamson was stripped of his membership for saying the problem of anti-Semitism had been over-stated and Labourhad been ""too apologetic""over the issue. Mr Williamsonwas allowed back into the partyseveral months after his suspension, but wassuspended again two days later.pending further consideration of his future. In October 2019, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated and was unable to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Derby North, He stood as an independent but lost his seat. In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn asked the barrister and human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti - who was appointed a Labour peer soon after her report was published - to look into the extent of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party. The report concluded that while Labour was not ""overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism"", there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". It made a series of recommendations to tackle what it said was the ""clear evidence of ignorant attitudes"" within sections of the party. The report's launch was marred, though, by averbal confrontation which led to the expulsion of activist Marc Wadsworthfrom the party after he criticised a Jewish MP. The time it has taken to implement the Chakrabarti report has been criticised Labour's former general secretary Jennie Formbysaid she had strengthened and speeded up,externalthe party's disciplinary procedures, with more staff to handle investigations but Baroness Chakrabarti - then Labour's shadow attorney general - criticised the pace of progress. A 2016 Home Affairs Committee report said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic"". In early 2019, Labour approachedformer Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who replaced Baroness Chakrabarti as the shadow attorney general, about leading a review into its complaints process, which critics said had become politicised. This, in turn, led to complaints from prominent Jewish MPs that he was too close to the party for any review to be independent. But in a politically damaging move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced its own investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. It is only the second time the EHRC has investigated a political party - in 2010, it ordered the BNP to re-write its constitution to comply with race relation laws. A Labour spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle ant-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' The party faced further criticism following a BBC Panorama calledIs Labour Anti-Semitic? The programme spoke to a number of party officials who alleged that senior Labour figures - namely Ms Formby and communications chief Seumas Milne, who stood down when Mr Corbyn departed -had interfered in the processof dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. The disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. The whistleblowers also claimed they had faced a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were accused of interfering in Labour's disciplinary process Labour strenuously disputed the claims, insisting there was no interference and the former staff were ""disaffected"" individuals with ""personal and political axes to grind"". It also said the programme was ""heavily slanted and inaccurate"" - a suggestion Panorama has rejected. The party's then deputy leader, Tom Watson, saidhe ""deplored"" the official responseto the documentary, and other senior figures joined him tocall on the leadership to listen to the concerns it raised. MPs and peers are nowpushing for a fully independent complaints process. In July 2018, Labour adopted a new anti-Semitism code which critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, said fell unacceptably short of the IHRA definition. Labour's version did not include a number of its examples of anti-Semitism, including: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Following a consultation - and widespread criticism - Labour subsequently adopted the fullIHRA definition and examples,external, along with an accompanying statement that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Critics have said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermines the IHRA definition - but Labour says it is intended to reassure members they can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as a racist endeavour - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive. Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn insisted there was no place in the party for anti-Semitism. Some of his supporters said the problem had been exaggerated and was being used as a stick to beat him by people who didn't like his leadership of the party or his views on the Middle East. The former Labour leader comes from a different political tradition than virtually every other post-war Labour leader, having campaigned for 40 years against Western imperialism and aggression. Mr Corbyn's opponents accused him of being too close to Hamas, a militant Islamist group, and Hezbollah, a Lebanese paramilitary group. Both groups are widely viewed in the West as terrorist organisations. He described representatives of Hamas as his ""friends"" after inviting them to a controversial meeting in Parliament in 2009. He later said he regretted his use of language, but insisted his motivation in talking to enemies of Israel was the promotion of peace in the Middle East. But his critics argued his views created the space for anti-Semitism to flourish in the party and he had condoned anti-Jewish prejudice through several of his own actions. Mr Corbyn faced criticism in August 2018 after a video emergedon the Daily Mail website,externalof a 2013 clip in which he said a group of British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks brandedthe comments ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech and accused the Labour leader of being an anti-Semite. Mr Corbyn said he had used the term ""Zionist"" in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". He added: ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" In August 2018, the then Labour leader also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014 which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian militants and killed. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyntweeted,externalthat Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions and words are false"", adding: ""What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children."" Mr Corbyn said he had attended the event in Tunis as part of a wider event about the search for peace. Corbyn wreath row explained Earlier in August 2018, Jeremy Corbyn apologised over an event he hosted as a backbench MP in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Afterthe Times published details of the event,external, the then Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Mr Corbyn apologised for not condemning an anti-Semitic mural in London In March 2018, Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial work from a wall in east London. He later said he had not looked at it properly, calling it ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"". The artist, called Mear One, denied this, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Following the row, Mr Corbyn said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain"" caused and conceded there were ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Luciana Berger said she had become ashamed of the party she joined as a teenager Unease within Labour ranks in Parliament intensified in 2017 and 2018 amid concerns the leadership was not doing enough to defend Jewish MPs, such as Luciana Berger, who were themselves the targets of anti-Semitic abuse and death threats. In March 2018, scores of Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented ""Enough is Enough"" rally outside Parliament. In a further sign of the breakdown in trust between Labour and the Jewish community, the Jewish Labour Movement considered severing its century-old affiliation to the party. While deciding to retain its ties, the organisation of 2,000 members did pass a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and voted to describe the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism In February 2019, nine MPs quit Labour, many of them citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Ms Berger, who had a police escort at the 2018 Labour Party conference, said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Ms Berger's supporters, including then deputy leader Tom Watson, claimed she has been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". Among the other defectors, Joan Ryan claimed the party had ""become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism"" while Ian Austin blamed Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". Eight of the defectors joined the newly formed Independent Group, which became Change UK, but three, including Luciana Berger, went on to join the Liberal Democrats, and failed to get elected at the 2019 general election. The two that remained in Change UK lost their seats, while Gavin Shuker, who stood as an independent, also lost his seat. Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey decided not to stand for re-election. Ian Austin did not join The Independent Group and stood down at the 2019 general election, advising his constituents to vote Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn. In March 2018, the head of the Labour Party's disputes panel quit after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft said she had not not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that had led to his suspension In July 2018, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers published the same front page, warning that a government led by Mr Corbyn would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". Earlier that month the party brought disciplinary action against the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, after she reportedly called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Ms Hodge refused to apologise and the action was later dropped. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead since 1979, quit the party's group in Parliament in August 2018, saying the leadership had become ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". He stood as an independent at the 2019 general election but lost his seat to the Labour candidate. In May 2019, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - Peter Willsman - was suspended afterLBC radio reported,externalhe had been recorded as saying that the Israeli embassy was ""almost certainly"" behind the anti-Semitism row. And Labour's successful candidate in the Peterborough by-election, Lisa Forbes, was engulfed in a row after it emerged she had liked a social media post suggesting Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". She apologised and calls for her to be suspended were rejected but the controversy led to fresh ructions and claims racism had become ""institutionalised"" within the party. Correction 26 May 2021: An earlier version of this article reported that 30 members of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) had accepted the IHRA's working definition. This was not accurate at the time of writing and this line has been amended in the story. Update 25th June 2019: Although intended as a general guide, an earlier version of this article omitted some relevant information and it has since been updated. Correction 23rd July 2019:  An earlier version of this article inaccurately said that Labour has never confirmed the number of anti-Semitism cases it is investigating and this has been amended to confirm that the party did release figures for a 10 month period in 2018/19.

Monaco noble claims millions from France,"Monaco's Royal Palace: The principality is a sun-drenched tax haven A French-born aristocrat has asked the French state to pay him â¬351m (Â£314m; $401m) in damages, alleging that it tricked his relatives out of succeeding to the throne of Monaco. Count Louis de Causans, 44, says that early in the 20th Century France changed the succession rules to thwart a German claim to the throne. Mr de Causans told the French daily Le Parisien that it was a matter of family honour to rectify the ""trickery"". Prince Albert II rules Monaco today. In a video broadcast by Le Parisien (in French),external, Mr de Causans said ""I want the truth to come out - I want reparation for the injustice done to my family by France"". He stressed that his dispute was with France, not with Prince Albert. His lawyer, Jean-Marc DescoubÃ¨s, told the BBC that ""on 2 July this year we asked the foreign ministry to pay compensation to my client"". The ministry has two months to accept or reject the request, so the deadline is 2 September. ""If the government refuses we will sue it in court,"" he explained. Mr de Causans, who lives in Paris, says he is a direct descendant of HonorÃ© III, who ruled the tiny Mediterranean principality in 1733-1793. The royal family are known as the House of Grimaldi. Prince Albert II married South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock in 2011 The claim centres around Prince Louis II, who reigned in 1922-1949. He was a bachelor, without any legitimate royal heir, and therefore under the original inheritance rules he was ineligible to reign. Mr de Causans maintains that under these rules his own branch of the Grimaldi family should have succeeded to the throne instead. But in 1911 a law was passed, under French pressure, changing the rules so that Louis could reign. He had an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, and the new law enabled her to be adopted by Louis, thus getting round the succession problem. Charlotte was born of a passionate liaison between Louis and a cabaret singer, Marie-Juliette Louvet. Conman dupes victims as fake Monaco prince Court backs Monaco love child story Monaco country profile At the time the great European powers were in an arms race that turned into the carnage of World War I in 1914. Mr de Causans says the succession should have gone to a German nobleman from his own branch of the family - Wilhelm, the Second Duke of Urach, who was Louis' cousin. The lawyer, Jean-Marc DescoubÃ¨s, said that ""it was quite simply unacceptable for a German to reign over Monaco then, on the eve of the First World War"". ""We identified the responsibility of the French government,"" he told the BBC. ""There were secret meetings in Paris and Monaco between the French ambassador and Monaco authorities, they signed a secret pact. I have some evidence, and will give it to the court if the French government doesn't want to pay."" When asked why Mr de Causans had only decided to make his claim now, he said the late Prince Rainier III - Albert's predecessor - had ""blocked everything"" during his reign. He died in 2005. Rainier had barred Mr de Causans and his side of the Grimaldi family from entering Monaco, the lawyer said. The â¬351m figure for the claim resulted from the calculations of lawyers and accountants, based on the Grimaldi fortune and Mr de Causans's age, he said.

Artificial intelligence 'as good as eye experts',"Elaine Manna had her sight saved at Moorfields Eye hospital in London Artificial intelligence can diagnose eye disease as accurately as some leading experts, research suggests. A study byMoorfields Eye Hospital,externalin London and the Google companyDeepMind,externalfound that a machine could learn to read complex eye scans and detect more than 50 eye conditions. Doctors hope artificial intelligence could soon play a major role in helping to identify patients who need urgent treatment. They hope it will also reduce delays. A team at DeepMind, based in London, created an algorithm, or mathematical set of rules, to enable a computer to analyse optical coherence tomography (OCT), a high resolution 3D scan of the back of the eye. Thousands of scans were used to train the machine how to read the scans. Then, artificial intelligence was pitted against humans. The computer was asked to give a diagnosis in the cases of 1,000 patients whose clinical outcomes were already known. The same scans were shown to eight clinicians - four leading ophthalmologists and four optometrists. Each was asked to make one of four referrals: urgent, semi-urgent, routine and observation only. Artificial intelligence performed as well as two of the world's leading retina specialists, with an error rate of only 5.5%. Crucially, the algorithm did not miss a single urgent case. The results, published in the journalNature Medicine,external, were described as ""jaw-dropping"" by Dr Pearse Keane, consultant ophthalmologist, who is leading the research at Moorfields Eye Hospital. Digital read-out from a 3D OCT eye scan He told the BBC:  ""I think this will make most eye specialists gasp because we have shown this algorithm is as good as the world's leading experts in interpreting these scans."" Artificial intelligence was able to identify serious conditions such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which can lead to blindness unless treated quickly. Dr Keane said the huge number of patients awaiting assessment was a ""massive problem"". He said:  ""Every eye doctor has seen patients go blind due to delays in referral; AI should help us to flag those urgent cases and get them treated early."" Dr Dominic King, medical director, DeepMind Health, explained how his team trained artificial intelligence to read eye scans: ""We used two neural networks, which are complex mathematical systems which mimic the way the brain operates, and inputted thousands of eye scans. ""They divided the eye into anatomical areas and were able to classify whether disease was present."" Some previous attempts at using AI have led to what's known as a ""black box"" problem - where the reasoning behind the computer analysis is hidden. By contrast, the DeepMind algorithm provides a visual map of where the disease is, allowing clinicians to check how the AI has come to its decision, which is crucial if doctors and patients are to have confidence in its diagnoses. Eight ways intelligent machines are already in your life AI will create as many jobs as it displaces AI a new weapon in cancer fight So how soon could AI be used to diagnose patient scans in hospital? Dr Keane said: ""We really want to get this into clinical use within two to three years but cannot until we have done a major real-time trial to confirm these exciting findings. He said the evidence suggests AI will ease the burden on clinicians, enabling them to prioritise the more urgent cases. Elaine Manna lost her sight in her left eye 18 years ago. In 2013, her vision began deteriorating in her right eye and an OCT scan revealed she needed urgent treatment for wet AMD, which occurs when abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina. She now has regular injections which stop the vessels growing or bleeding. Elaine told me: ""I was devastated when I lost sight in my left eye, so my remaining vision is precious."" She said the research findings were ""absolutely brilliant"", adding: ""People will have their sight saved because of artificial intelligence, because doctors will be able to intervene sooner."" AI may also be able to interpret mammograms as part of screening for breast cancer DeepMind is also doing research with Imperial College London to see if AI can learn how to interpret mammograms, and improve the accuracy of breast cancer screening. The company also has a project with University College London Hospitals (UCLH) to examine whether AI can differentiate between cancerous and healthy tissue on CT and MRI scans. This might help doctors speed up the planning of radiotherapy treatment, which can take up to eight hours in the case of very complex cancers. Within a few years it seems highly likely that artificial intelligence will play a key role in the diagnosis of disease, which should free up clinicians to spend more time with patients. But there will be some who will be unhappy about their health details being shared with a tech giant like Google. Dr Dominic King, from DeepMind, said: ""Patients have an absolute right to know how, where and who is processing their data.  We have a best in class security system; data is protected and encrypted at all times."" The Royal Free Hospital in north London was criticised in 2017 for sharing 1.6 million patient data records with DeepMind. The controversy related to an app DeepMind developed to identify patients at risk of kidney disease. The Information Commissionruled that the hospital had not done enough to safeguard patient data.

Struck-off doctor wins appeal to work,"This video can not be played Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba said she was ""sorry for my role"" in Jack Adcock's death A doctor who was struck off over the death of a six-year-old boy has won her appeal to practise medicine again. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba was convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence in 2015 over the death of Jack Adcock, who died of sepsis at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011. She was struck off in January 2018. Speaking after the appeal, the doctor said she was ""pleased with the outcome"" but wanted to ""pay tribute and remember Jack Adcock, a wonderful little boy"". Jack's mother, Nicola Adcock, said she was ""disgusted"" and ""devastated"" by the judgement and that it made a ""mockery of the justice system"". Dr Bawa-Garba toldBBC's Panorama: ""I want to let the parents know that I'm sorry for my role in what has happened to Jack. ""I also want to acknowledge and give gratitude to people around the world from the public to the medical community who have supported me."" The doctor's appeal was funded by medics because they said the ruling would discourage practitioners from being open when reviewing mistakes. Jack died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a heart condition, had been admitted to the hospital in Leicester with vomiting and diarrhoea in 2011. He died 11 hours later from a cardiac arrest caused by sepsis triggered by pneumonia. The subsequent trial in 2015 heard the boy's death was caused by ""serious neglect"" by staff who failed to recognise his body was ""shutting down"" and close to death, the prosecution claimed. At one point, Dr Bawa-Garba mistook Jack for another patient who had a do not resuscitate order, the court was told. The paediatric specialist only resumed treatment when a junior doctor pointed out the error, although the prosecution accepted Jack had already been ""past the point of no return"". Dr Bawa-Garba said in her defence she had worked a 12-hour shift with no break and there was a lot of miscommunication in the ward. Dr Bawa-Garba was suspended from the medical register for a year in June 2017. However, the General Medical Council (GMC) appealed against the decision claiming it was ""not sufficient to protect the public"" and she was struck off in January 2018. Thousands of doctors signed an open letter of support for Dr Bawa-Garba stating the case would ""lessen our chances of preventing a similar death"". The doctor struck off for honest mistakes Doctors to be protected over medical errors Medics rally behind struck off doctor Doctor guilty of boy's manslaughter Earlier, three senior judges quashed the High Court's decision and restored the lesser sanction of a one-year suspension. Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton, who announced the ruling, said ""no concerns"" had ""ever been raised about the clinical competence of Dr Bawa-Garba, other than in relation to Jack's death"". ""The evidence before the tribunal was that she was in the top third of her specialist trainee cohort,"" he said. He added that the tribunal was satisfied her actions in relation to the boy were ""neither deliberate nor reckless"", and did ""not present a continuing risk to patients"". However, Mrs Adcock said the ruling would cause people to lose ""faith and trust"" in the NHS, adding she would ""never forgive"" Dr Bawa-Garba and that she was considering appealing against the decision. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, fully accepted the Court of Appeal's judgement. He said: ""As the independent regulator responsible for protecting patient safety we are frequently called upon to take difficult decisions, and we do not take that role lightly."" Mr Massey added the case had ""exposed a raft of concerns"" around the role of criminal law in medicine and the GMC had commissioned an independent review as a consequence. ""Doctors have rightly challenged us to speak out more forcefully to support those practising in pressured environments, and that is what we are increasing our efforts to do,"" he said. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba (R) was struck off following an appeal by the doctors' regulator Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, chair of the Doctors' Association UK, said the decision was a ""small step in the right direction for patients and doctors"". ""We need to make sure that patients and families get the answers they need through open and transparent engagement with NHS organisations,"" she said. ""The GMC needs to rethink its priorities in enabling this to happen rather than aggressively pursuing doctors in the courts."" Dr Chandra Kanneganti, chair of the British International Doctors' Association (BIDA), said the GMC had been wrong in taking the case to court and it was not right to ""scapegoat one doctor for failures in the system"".

Israeli PM attacks Corbyn in wreath row,"This video can not be played Corbyn asked about Tunisia wreath-laying criticism Israel's PM has criticised Jeremy Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyn said Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions... are false"". The Labour leader said he had attended the event in Tunis in 2014 as part of a wider event about the search for peace. He hit back at the Israeli prime minister, accusing his government of discriminating against Israel's Palestinian minority. Mr Netanyahu had also accused Mr Corbyn of comparing Israel to the Nazis, although a Labour statement reiterated a previous denial of that claim. The Israeli leader had commented after the Daily Mailsaid Mr Corbyn was,externalpictured with a wreath near memorials of the group behind the attack. Allow Twitter content?

In response to the story, the Labour leader said that while at a conference, he had attended a memorial for victims of the bombing of Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters by Israel in 1985. Mr Corbyn was also asked about a second wreath-laying, reportedly remembering people killed by Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. The Mail had reported that the Labour leader was photographed near memorials to members of the militant Black September group behind the 1972 attack. Asked who this wreath had been for, if they were not terrorists, Mr Corbyn replied simply that a wreath ""was indeed laid"". But he added: ""I was present when it was laid. I don't think I was actually involved in it. ""I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it. ""You cannot pursue peace by a cycle of violence. The only way you pursue peace is a cycle of dialogue."" However, Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Mr Corbyn ""needs to recognise he can't cavort with terrorists"". She called on him to apologise to the widows and children of those killed in the Munich terror attack. Eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian group at the 1972 summer games in Munich. The hostages and a West German police officer were killed by the group, with five of the eight hostage-takers killed by German police during a failed rescue attempt. However, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi of Jewish Voice for Labour said Mr Corbyn was in Tunis for a pro-peace conference and that the accusations were ""yet another cooked-up example of people trying to attribute guilt to the Labour Party leader by association"". By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton It is highly unusual for a foreign prime minister to get involved in a British political row. It's even more unusual for that to happen on a public forum like Twitter. Add in the fact the Jeremy Corbyn replied to Benjamin Netanyahu's tweet and you're looking at a unique political moment. In his reply, Jeremy Corbyn described the Israeli Prime Minister's accusations as false. But he also took the opportunity to say that the killing of Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces deserves ""unequivocal condemnation"". His supporters say the purpose of Benjamin Netanyahu's message is to shut down that sort of criticism of Israel's actions. But his critics will argue that the fact such a senior figure has got involved in Labour's internal row over anti-Semitism shows how urgently the party needs to resolve an issue that has been hanging over it for months. On Twitter, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn had ""devoted his life to promoting justice and peace"" which involved ""meeting people who haven't shared those ideals"". ""Having a politician like Netanyahu join the media feeding frenzy is a line in the sand,"" he added. Jeremy Corbyn was pictured at a wreath-laying ceremony in 2014 The Daily Mail has also published a video of Mr Corbyn from an event in 2013. In the video, Mr Corbyn said Palestinians had experienced ""conditions in the West Bank, under occupation, of the very sort that will be recognisable by many people in Europe who suffered occupation during the Second World War"". A Labour statement said Mr Corbyn had not compared Israel to the Nazis ""but the conditions of civilian populations in besieged cities in wartime"". Referring to the accusation of wreath-laying, Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger said: ""Being 'present' is the same as being involved. ""When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. ""There can also never be a 'fitting memorial' for terrorists. Where is the apology?"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said his behaviour was ""unbelievable and shocking"". On Sunday Labour's press team said: ""The Munich widows are being misled. Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings."" In a tweet, Labour said he and other Parliamentarians had been honouring victims of the 1985 Israeli bombings. It comes amid a wider row aboutanti-Semitism in the Labour party. Critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, say a new code of conduct adopted by the party is not as comprehensive about anti-Semitism as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) guidelines. Labour says it has included the international definition word-for-word in the code, although critics say the Labour code leaves out examples of how criticism of Israel can be anti-Semitic.

Struck off for 'honest mistakes'," Jack Adcock wasn’t himself when he returned from school. He later started vomiting and had diarrhoea, which continued through the night. In the morning Jack was taken to the GP by his mother, Nicola, and referred directly to Leicester Royal Infirmary’s children’s assessment unit (CAU). Nicola Adcock Less than 12 hours later he was dead. “Losing a child is the most horrendous thing ever. But to lose a child in the way we lost Jack – we should never have lost him,” Mrs Adcock says. Trainee doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba arrived at work expecting to be on the general paediatrics ward - the ward she’d been on all week. She had only recently returned to work after having her first baby. Before her 13 months’ maternity leave, she had been working in community paediatrics, treating children with chronic illnesses and behavioural problems. Dr Bawa-Garba But when medical staff gathered to discuss the day’s work, they were told someone was needed to cover the CAU – the doctor supposed to be doing it was on a course. And Dr Bawa-Garba volunteered to step in. She also carried the bleep – which alerts the doctor that a patient needs seeing urgently on the wards or in the Accident and Emergency unit, across four floors of the busy Leicester Royal Infirmary – and was required to respond to calls from midwives, other doctors or parents. Soon after Dr Bawa-Garba took over, the bleep went off – a child down in the accident and emergency unit, several floors below, needed urgent attention and she missed the rest of the morning handover. Back in the CAU, Dr Bawa-Garba was asked to see Jack Adcock by the nurse in charge, Sister Theresa Taylor, who was worried he had looked very sick when he had been admitted. She was the only staff nurse that day. Because of staff shortages, two of the three CAU nurses were from an agency and not allowed to perform many nursing procedures. “Jack was really lethargic, very sleepy. He wasn’t really very with it,” says Mrs Adcock. She told medical staff he had been up all night with diarrhoea and sickness. The boy’s hands and feet were cold and had a blue-grey tinge. He also had a cough. “I knew that I had to get a line in him quickly to get some bloods and also give him some fluids to rehydrate him,” says Dr Bawa-Garba. He didn’t flinch when she put his cannula in. Because of a pre-existing heart condition, Jack had been taking enalapril – a drug to control his blood pressure and help pump blood around his body – twice a day. But Dr Bawa-Garba says she didn’t want him to have the enalapril, because he was dehydrated and it might have made his blood pressure drop too much. Because of this, she says, she left it off his drug chart. She then asked for an X-ray to check Jack’s chest. Blood was taken – some was sent down to the labs, while a quicker test was done to measure his blood acidity and lactate levels – the latter being a measure of how much oxygen is reaching the tissues. The tests revealed his blood was too acidic. “A normal pH is 7.34 – but Jack’s was seven and his lactate was also very high. A normal is about two and his was 11, so I knew then he was very unwell,” Dr Bawa-Garba says. She gave him a large boost of fluid – a bolus – to resuscitate him. Her working diagnosis was gastroenteritis and dehydration. But she didn’t consider that Jack might have had a more serious condition. It was a mistake she regrets to this day. Jack had been admitted under the care of Dr Stephen O’Riordan, the consultant who was supposed to be in charge that day – but he hadn’t realised he was on call and had double-booked himself with teaching commitments in Warwick and hadn’t arrived at work. Another consultant based elsewhere in the hospital had said she was available to help and cover him if needed – although she had her own duties. After an hour of being on fluids to rehydrate him, Jack seemed to be responding well. “He was a little more alert and we thought he was getting better,” Mrs Adcock says. Dr Bawa-Garba thought that too. One of the less experienced doctors in the unit had been unable to do Jack’s next blood tests. They had tried but couldn’t get blood, so Dr Bawa-Garba went to do it herself. This time, when Dr Bawa-Garba went to take blood from his finger, Jack resisted, pulling away. “That kind of response, to me, said that he was responding to the bolus,” she says. “Also, the result I got showed that the pH had gone from seven to 7.24. In my mind I’m thinking this is going the right way.” However, not enough blood had been taken to get another lactate measurement. Dr Bawa-Garba looked for Jack’s blood results from the lab. She had fast-tracked them an hour-and-a-half earlier. But when she went to view them on the computer system, it had gone down. The whole hospital was affected. This meant not only that blood test results were delayed, but also that the alert system designed to flag up abnormal results on computer screens was out of action. She asked one of the doctors in her team to chase up the results for her patients, and took on some of that doctor’s tasks. Those tests would have indicated that Jack may have had kidney failure and that he needed antibiotics. By this point, Jack was sitting up in the bed drinking juice. “I automatically thought he was perking up,” says Victor, Jack’s father. Because he had stopped vomiting, Dr Bawa-Garba prescribed some Dioralyte – rehydrating salts. But the fluid he was losing from having diarrhoea had not been documented by his nurse. Dr Bawa-Garba also reviewed Jack’s X-ray, which had been ready for a few hours. Dr Bawa-Garba says no-one had flagged it was available. She says she had been busy with other patients – including a baby with sepsis that needed a lumbar puncture – and this was the first opportunity she had had to review it. The X-ray showed that Jack had a chest infection so she prescribed antibiotics. But Dr Bawa-Garba says she wishes she had given him antibiotics sooner. This was the last time Dr Bawa-Garba treated Jack, who was also being cared for by an agency nurse. The nurse was doing his observations - including his temperature, heart rate and blood pressure - but did not record them regularly. Consultant Dr Stephen O’Riordan arrived at the hospital. “I hadn’t worked with him before, so I introduced myself,” Dr Bawa-Garba says. She then went to chase up Jack’s blood results, which still hadn’t come through – the doctor she had assigned to do it hadn’t managed to get them. Dr Bawa-Garba tried a number of extensions before managing to speak to someone. They read out Jack’s results and she noted them down. She says she was looking out for one particular test result called CRP, which would confirm whether Jack’s illness had been caused by bacteria or a virus. She noted it was 97, far higher than it should have been, so she circled it. But she says she was concentrating so much on the CRP that she failed to register that his creatinine and urea were also high – signalling possible kidney failure. During the afternoon handover, Dr Bawa-Garba told Dr O’Riordan about Jack – his diarrhoea and vomiting, heart condition, and enalapril medication. She says she told him Jack’s lactate level was 11, and mentioned some of the other blood test results. She said she had started him on antibiotics for a chest infection, and asked his advice about the fluids Jack was being given. She says Dr O’Riordan noted down what she said and ordered repeat blood tests. Dr Bawa-Garba says she had assumed he would go to see Jack - based on the description she had given and the fact he had asked for further tests - but he didn’t. By this time, Jack had been moved to ward 28 under the care of a different team. On his way up there, he had been sick again. It was at this point that another failing in Jack’s care occurred. Mrs Adcock says she asked a nurse looking after Jack on that ward if she could give him his enalapril – the medication to regulate his blood pressure. He was due his second dose of the day. She recalls the nurse telling her she’d checked with another doctor on duty. Mrs Adcock says she was told the nurse wouldn’t be able to give the medication to Jack, as it had not been prescribed, but his mother could. So Mrs Adcock gave it to him. The nurse later said she had also asked for a doctor to come to see Jack. “We’d got Toy Story on but he was still knocking his oxygen mask off,” Mrs Adcock says. “I was just saying, ‘Come on sweetheart go to sleep,’ and I was rubbing his face. I’ll never forget – he closed his eyes and I thought something’s not quite right. His tongue, or his lips, looked blue. I ran out of the room, saying, ‘Can someone come and look at Jack?’” Dr Bawa-Garba had been on call for more than 12 hours when an emergency call went out for a patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest on ward 28 and doctors and nurses rushed to help. In the morning, Dr Bawa-Garba had had to intervene to stop doctors from trying to resuscitate a terminally ill boy who had a “do not resuscitate” order. She assumed it was the same boy. What she didn’t know was that Jack had subsequently been moved to the same ward as the boy who had crashed in the morning – ward 28. A terrible confusion was about to follow. “While we’re running up the stairs, all I was thinking is, ‘It’s the child with the do-not-resuscitate again – that someone is trying to resuscitate. This is a mistake,’” she says. When she reached the fourth floor, at least 11 people were already in the side room, she says. Meanwhile, Nicola Adcock was waiting outside the room. In that moment, Dr Bawa-Garba didn’t recognise her. She says: I walk in and say, ‘He’s not for resuscitation,’ because I thought it was the child with the ‘do not resuscitate’ order.” Dr Bawa-Garba says she was then told by another doctor that the patient was not the same boy as earlier – but was Jack Adcock. “I was shocked and I was like, ‘Why is Jack crashing?’” she says. She told the team to continue the resuscitation. “I remember going hysterical and just thinking, you know, ‘Please look after my little boy,’” says Mrs Adcock. “And then I remember somebody taking me back into the room and telling me, ‘Jack needs his mummy.’” At 21:21 the decision was made to stop resuscitation. Jack had died of sepsis. Experts later said the interruption to the resuscitation had not contributed to his death – but he shouldn’t have been given enalapril and he should have been given antibiotics much earlier. At the Adcocks’ home in Glen Parva, a suburb of Leicester, Jack’s sister Ruby has moved into his old room. His has been recreated in the room she vacated. Stars featuring handwritten messages from Jack’s schoolmates, saying how much they will miss him and his cheeky laugh, adorn the navy blue walls of the replica bedroom. “It’s my way of coping,” says Mrs Adcock. She says she has yet to grieve. The investigations, court proceedings, and appeals have taken a toll on the family. I blame Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba for my son’s death and I will never, ever, ever, ever forgive her.” She describes Jack as a “joyful little boy” and says he and his younger sister, Ruby, adored each other. Jack used to love dancing, swimming and going to watch Leicester City football team, says his father, even though he had been in and out of hospital during his short life. “We were season ticket holders but since that happened  [Jack’s death] I haven’t been able to go,” he says. “I can’t face it.” Jack Adcock The night Jack died, Mr and Mrs Adcock were taken into a room off the ward, where they were met by doctors they’d never seen before. “We were told, ‘I’m really sorry but your son’s passed away,” says Mrs Adcock. “It just didn’t sink in.” She remembers them saying he had had pneumonia and an internal bleed. She asked to see her son. The last time she had seen him, he had been asleep and had looked peaceful. “He had no tubes, he had nothing,” she says. This time, “there was blood – I just couldn’t believe it was him, my baby, gone”. Everyone on the ward was crying, she says, including Dr Bawa-Garba, who was sobbing. “Nobody expected Jack would die.” The doctor came over to express her condolences and Mrs Adcock thanked her for looking after Jack. “I wish I could take those words away. I never knew then what I know now,” she says. The following day, Saturday, the family was invited back to the hospital to meet a group of doctors, nurses and managers from the trust to discuss what had happened. Minutes taken by one of Mrs Adcock’s friends from university, whom the family had invited to the meeting, give an indication of what was discussed. The hospital representatives apologised for the boy’s death and said they would investigate. “They said he just wasn’t looked after; he didn’t have the right support; he wasn’t given the right care,” Mrs Adcock says. She wanted to know about the interrupted resuscitation and so they talked about that too. The family was also told that a junior doctor had failed to recognise the severity of Jack’s condition, according to the minutes. The police then arrived – there was to be an investigation after the unexpected death of the child. “I remember being absolutely terrified, thinking, ‘I haven’t done anything, why are the police here?’” Mrs Adcock says. After Jack’s post-mortem examination, two days later, the family was told that he had died of a streptococcal infection and had developed sepsis and they could make plans for his funeral. Jack Adcock “Everything was in place. There was an article going in the paper on the Friday to say when his funeral was going to be,” Mrs Adcock says. But then they were asked to cancel their plans and meet the police at the coroner’s office to discuss an inquest. “As you can imagine at that point, we felt physically sick – the anger raged.  We just could not believe what we were hearing, so automatically we said, ‘So you’re telling us someone’s responsible for our son’s death?’” Mrs Adcock says. There was then a second post-mortem examination in case criminal proceedings were opened. “It took three months to get my little boy back, to be able to lay him to rest,” Mrs Adcock says. Not a day goes past, Dr Bawa-Garba says, when she doesn’t think about the day Jack died. I am sorry for not recognising sepsis and I am sorry for my role in what happened to Jack.” The 41-year-old mother of three says the impact on her and her family has been huge. She has had to move house and unpleasant material was posted on social media. “I had parents from my daughter’s school asking if I was OK because they were getting leaflets in their letterboxes saying that they should sign a petition to say that I should be struck off,” she says. The case attracted a lot of media coverage. “I’m a very private person, but I had my face in the newspaper.” Dr Bawa-Garba had enjoyed an unblemished career before Jack’s death and was well-regarded by her colleagues. Hadiza Bawa-Garba Born in Nigeria, she had wanted to be a doctor since she was about 13 years old, after recovering from malaria. At 16 she moved to the UK to study for her A-levels. After her first degree at Southampton University, she studied medicine at Leicester and set her sights on becoming a paediatrician. Hadiza Bawa-Garba and family “I've been in the UK for more than half my life,” she says. “I love the NHS. I love the fact that people can get access to free medical health and that you can be part of that process.” But that all changed the day she covered for a colleague at the CAU. “The last picture I have of Jack is him sitting up drinking from a beaker, nothing prepared me to see him crash,” she says. “After I realised that we were actually resuscitating Jack, I just couldn’t understand why he had crashed. When the team wanted to stop, I didn’t want to stop - because in my mind I'm thinking he’s not meant to crash,” she says. Afterwards, she went to the nurses’ station and sobbed. “I just couldn’t control myself and I'm not usually a weepy person,” she says. “I just kept thinking, ‘How did that happen? Why did he crash? What went wrong?’” Dr Bawa-Garba recalls the moment that Mrs Adcock came up to her to thank her for her help. “I said to her, ‘I'm really sorry about the outcome – I don't know how this happened,’” she says. Later that night, Dr Bawa-Garba called Dr O’Riordan – the consultant who had arrived in the afternoon, after double-booking himself that day – to tell him about Jack’s death. She went home at 23:00 – some 15 hours after she had started her 12-hour shift – and updated Jack’s notes with what had happened at the resuscitation. The following day, she was back at work at the assessment unit. She knew the hospital was meeting the Adcocks and asked if she could attend. But she says Dr O’Riordan told her that she had to get on with her clinical duties. The consultant then added to the notes that Dr Bawa-Garba had made. He wrote that Dr Bawa-Garba had “not stressed” to him that Jack’s lactate level was 11. On Sunday, struggling to process what had happened, Dr Bawa-Garba phoned Mrs Adcock to say she was sorry for the family’s loss. “I just wanted to reach out to see how mum was holding up because it must be devastating,” she says. The following day, she says, she was admonished by Dr O’Riordan for making that call and told not to have any more contact with the family because an investigation was to be launched. He then told her that they needed to discuss Jack’s death properly because he thought she hadn’t highlighted to him how ill Jack was, she says. He wanted to talk about how things could have been done differently to stop it happening again, she adds. Dr Bawa-Garba had already started to write down her reflections. “When you have a case that has had an impact on you, you write down how you feel and what you would change,” she says. “I made my own action plan about how I would be able to address those things that I wish I had done differently.” On 25 February, a week after Jack’s death, Dr O’Riordan asked Dr Bawa-Garba to meet him in the hospital canteen, rather than the office he shared with other consultants. She was told to list everything that she could have done differently, she says. So she continued that personal reflective process with Dr O’Riordan in the canteen. “I was beating myself up about every single detail and obviously wishing that I had recognised sepsis, so we spoke about that and I was very open and explained everything,” she says. “It contained what I felt I could’ve done better plus some of the things that Dr O’Riordan also felt that I could’ve done better.” Jack died from sepsis.Sepsis is when the immune system overreacts to an infection and attacks the body’s own organs and tissues. According to the UK Sepsis Trust, about 14,000 people die each year because it is not diagnosed or treated early enough. At the meeting, Dr O’Riordan took notes, which he then transferred to what is called a training encounter form, she says. This contained one section for Dr O’Riordan to write on and one for Dr Bawa-Garba to document her learning points and reflections. However, she didn’t agree with all Dr O’Riordan said and didn’t sign the form. Both her reflections and the training encounter form were uploaded to her e-portfolio, an online system used for learning purposes. As soon as the meeting finished, Dr Bawa-Garba says she was sent home by Dr O’Riordan. Dr O’Riordan declined Panorama’s invitation to comment on Dr Bawa-Gaba’s account of the meeting. Recognising her need for further training, the hospital took Dr Bawa-Gaba off the on-call rota and put her on to the paediatric intensive care unit under the supervision of a consultant.There she would see lots of children with sepsis, some of whom would get better then get worse – like Jack, she says. “I was probably slower than I used to be, because I was micromanaging and double-checking everything and second-guessing myself all the time,” she says. Using what she had learned from Jack Adcock’s death, Dr Bawa-Garba says, she helped carry out a sepsis study and formed a junior doctor weekly teaching programme where doctors would discuss “near misses” or incidents when patients had died so they could learn from them. The hospital had carried out its own investigation and Dr Bawa-Garba continued to work there. But five months after Jack’s death, Dr O’Riordan left the Leicester Royal Infirmary and moved to Ireland. Because Jack’s death was unexpected, the hospital conducted an investigation to identify what had gone wrong with the little boy’s care. They produced a report in August 2011 and updated it six months later. It not only pointed to errors made by Dr Bawa-Garba and nursing staff - including Dr Bawa-Garba’s failure to recognise the severity of Jack’s illness - it also found a series of “system failings”. “I think that we let Jack Adcock down - there’s no doubt about that in my mind,” says Andrew Furlong, medical director since 2016 of University Hospitals Leicester, which includes the Leicester Royal Infirmary. Andrew Furlong There were six root causes for Jack’s poor care, the report said, listing 23 recommendations for improvement and 79 actions to minimise the risk of another child dying in such unacceptable circumstances. The recommendations were wide-ranging but included: - Robust processes for helping staff return to work after periods of protracted leave or maternity leave - A dedicated presence of consultants on the children’s assessment unit - New guidelines on the use of agency nurses - Better visual prompts for staff about abnormal blood results “Best practice shows that when you’re trying to identify learning, the way to do that is in an open culture, where people can give evidence without fear of sanction or blame,” Mr Furlong says. Panorama has spoken to doctors who worked in the paediatric department shortly before Jack’s death. None felt able to go on the record. They said doctors and nurses at the hospital had been raising concerns about staffing before Jack’s death. They said consultant cover had been patchy and that factional infighting between consultants had caused problems for trainee doctors - it wasn’t something they could speak out about, they had had to keep their head down. Junior doctors did try to raise their concerns that trainees were being used to plug rota gaps, often at the last minute. The CAU was one of the areas where there was never enough staff, and the hospital recognised that this posed a risk. One doctor said she would pray before she went into work because she was worried something bad would happen. In response, Mr Furlong says that as the only children’s emergency department serving 1.2 million people, the CAU was always busy. “That isn’t unique to this trust, nor was the difficulty in recruiting doctors and nurses, too few were coming out of training nationally, a fact which the NHS locally and nationally is still struggling with. At the start of every shift, the nurses and doctors in charge routinely review staffing levels and move resources to where they are most needed,” he says. After Jack’s death, the police started their own investigation and the Adcocks praise them for the support they have given the family. But they say they heard very little from the hospital. They were sent a copy of the Leicester Royal Infirmary investigation and invited to discuss it, but they didn’t want to. Dr Bawa-Garba In February 2012 – a year after Jack’s death, and just after Dr Bawa-Garba had given birth to her second child – she received a phone call from the police. At first, she thought she had misheard what she was being told. “The officer said, ‘We’re investigating Jack’s death as a possible manslaughter case and we need you to come down to the station,’” she says. She went along thinking it would be a similar process to the hospital investigation. But suddenly she found herself under arrest and being read her rights. Her photograph and fingerprints were taken. During the six-hour interview, all she could think about was her two-week-old daughter who would need breastfeeding. During phone calls home, she could hear the hungry baby crying. The police investigation came to nothing. Seven weeks later, Dr Bawa-Garba was told that no charges were going to be brought against her. More than a year later, in July 2013, Jack’s inquest started at Leicester Town Hall. “We didn’t really know anything until it went to the inquest,” says Mrs Adcock. “We couldn’t speak to anyone – we weren’t really told anything.” It was only then, the Adcocks say, they heard the “true facts” and “listened to the detail” about the errors that Dr Bawa-Garba had made. According to Mrs Adcock, the expert witness at the inquest, Dr Gale Pearson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, stated that if Jack “had been given the right treatment, antibiotics, correct bolus, intensive care, consultant treatment, he would have not died when he died, how he died, the way he died – he may have still been here”. “I think I collapsed, nobody could believe it,” Mrs Adcock says. The inquest was adjourned shortly after Dr Pearson’s expert testimony and the case was referred back to the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviewed its decision to prosecute. The family are clear about who they blame for Jack’s death – Dr Bawa-Garba and one of the nurses who had treated him. If they had done everything they could, the Adcocks say, they would have been devastated but could have said “Thank you,” and walked away. But as Mrs Adcock puts it, “All they did was contribute to my son’s death.” Dr Bawa-Garba continued to work at Leicester Royal Infirmary, but one evening in December 2014, while she was on call on the neonatal unit, she was contacted by her educational supervisor, who asked to meet her. Dr Jonathan Cusack Dr Jonathan Cusack was the head of the unit, so she didn’t think much of it. But, as she sat down, he told her she had been charged with manslaughter. “I don’t think I registered because I said, ‘Er, OK – but I need to finish my shift and I have teaching tomorrow.’ I was supposed to be teaching some medical students the next day. He said, ‘No, you need to go home, you have been charged with manslaughter.’” Dr Bawa-Garba passed her bleep on to another doctor and went home, her head spinning with thoughts about what would happen to her family if she were to be convicted of manslaughter and sent to prison. As the police were investigating Jack Adcock’s death, other failings in patient care across Leicestershire were emerging. Following the Mid Staffs scandal – where hundreds of patients were exposed to “appalling” levels of care at Stafford Hospital – a new measure to help hospitals spot problems was introduced. The Summary Hospital-Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) uses adjusted data from individual trusts to flag up a higher-than-expected number of deaths. It acts as an early warning system highlighting a need for further investigation. In 2013, Leicester GPs had started to become concerned about the University Hospitals of Leicester Trust’s SHMI. It had been higher than it should have been since the SHMI was introduced in 2010. After deliberating with the Trust, they asked Dr Ron Hsu, then a public health consultant and now associate professor at the University of Leicester, to investigate further. He met representatives from the local Clinical Commissioning Groups, the hospital and NHS England to devise and agree a plan. Teams of doctors and nurses were tasked with going through the records of patients who had either unexpectedly died in hospital or died within 30 days of leaving between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013. It didn’t look at paediatrics. They focused on a sample that would help them identify systematic clinical issues. This is where you learn the most, Dr Hsu says. In large rooms set aside in the hospital, the teams pored over patients' notes looking at the kind of care they were receiving and identifying things they thought had gone wrong. The bar was set high – a team of doctors or nurses had to be unanimous before they agreed a patient had received poor care, Dr Hsu says. When Dr Hsu came to tally the results, he did not believe what he saw. “It was shocking. Based on what I read I was expecting around 10% of patients to have received unacceptable care,” he says. But in fact nearly a quarter of patients in the report had received “unacceptable care” – serious errors had been made that would have increased the risk of harm. In over half, there were “significant lessons to learn” – aspects of care that could be done better. It included issues with “do not resuscitate” orders, delayed antibiotics, failure to detect serious illness despite multiple clinical signs, unexpected deterioration, medication errors, and IT failures. The problems ran across all health care in Leicestershire and Rutland, but the “vast majority” of lessons came from the hospital. “The issues were obviously longstanding and the consultants and nurses working in the hospital were not necessarily surprised by what we were finding,” says Dr Geth Jenkins, a former GP in Earl Shilton and a member of the team that carried out the review. Dr Hsu asked to meet the medical directors of the Trust. But at a meeting between the local clinical commissioning groups, hospitals, community organisations and NHS England to discuss the findings, the discussion soon turned from how to fix the problems to how to get the message out, Dr Hsu says. “They were concerned about their reputation,” he says. That December he was asked to see officials from NHS England. “They were concerned about the abruptness of the presentation, they would like it softened, as it were, maybe made user-friendly,” he says. Later that month, he says he received a list of 50 changes – mostly relating to the colour and presentation of the report and the size of the charts. Then, the following February, he received another raft of changes. Dr Hsu says he’s been around long enough to know if reports don’t work out well for someone, people have ways of of ensuring that the report doesn’t really get anywhere. “They were worried that people will lose faith in the health services,” he says. “We were at the time, the fifth or the sixth largest NHS trust in England and it’s a trust that whatever happens to it, you couldn’t ignore.” Dr Jenkins says: It was clear NHS England wanted the report to go away.” The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust was not the worst, neither was it the best, he adds. “If they found these kinds of issues when the Trust’s SHMI was high but not that high, what would they find with other hospitals that had higher ones?"" he asks. Nine months after Dr Hsu submitted his report, it was posted on the Trust website. A summary version was produced for the press and the public. The media were carefully managed, Dr Hsu says. “It took ages for the conclusions to become public,” says Dr Orest Mulka, a former GP in Measham, and one of the reviewers. “And when I discovered that the media, including the BBC, had portrayed them as relating to the care of terminally ill patients receiving palliative care, I thought this was completely untrue. Most of the patients who died were emergency admissions who were not expected to do so.” Mr Furlong says the Trust was the first to use this review method and now others are using similar techniques to look at what can be learned from patients who have died. The hospital appointed Dr Ian Sturgess to consider improvements in the emergency sector. But some local GPs were frustrated and thought there was a resistance to change and a reluctance to talk openly about the problems. In October 2014 they sent a letter sent to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, warning of “broken systems serving patients and carers in our area”. “Every week we receive reports from our constituent GPs informing us of incidents of distressing medical and nursing care that patients are being exposed to at Leicester Royal Infirmary,” the letter said. The GPs went on to say that in their view the hospital was “potentially on a par with Mid Staffordshire Hospital”. It’s a description Mr Furlong rejects. Far from ignoring problems, he says, the Trust went looking for them. “In the Mid Staffs enquiry they found that there had been hundreds of avoidable deaths, the reviewers drew no such conclusion in this review,” he says. NHS England declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Furlong says that improvements have been made and that the review has now been repeated, with results due for publication in September. While the review cannot be extrapolated to all admissions, both Dr Mulka and Dr Jenkins see parallels in what they found with the care of Jack Adcock. “The issues were all laid bare - poor staffing levels; communication problems and poor handovers; IT systems not working; no senior staff on duty, with juniors left to do everything,"" Dr Jenkins says. ""They all walked into a toxic environment that day,"" he adds. On 5 October 2015, Dr Bawa-Garba found herself in the dock in Nottingham Crown Court, along with two other defendants - nurses Theresa Taylor and Isabel Amaro. The cells below were a constant reminder of what might happen to her. The three pleaded not guilty to the charge of manslaughter by gross negligence at the start of what was to be a four-week trial. “I remember sitting there and listening to their account of my actions and I felt like a criminal,” says Dr Bawa-Garba. The case attracted a lot of media attention. Dr Bawa-Garba would travel from her home in Leicester up to Nottingham. “I remember vividly one time we were sitting on the train and I was in The Metro paper. My picture was there and the passenger sitting opposite me kept looking at the paper and looking at me and looking up,” she says. Dr Bawa-Garba on her way to court Several staff from the hospital were witnesses for the prosecution and barristers representing the other defendants each cross-examined Dr Bawa-Garba. It was the same for CAU ward sister Theresa Taylor. Isabel Amaro didn’t give evidence. The jurors were instructed to decide whether the three defendants were guilty of unlawfully killing Jack Adcock, basing this decision exclusively on the evidence put before them. Aspects of the trial have caused consternation among the medical profession. “Doctors became particularly concerned when they heard about all of the systems failings at the hospital and felt these weren’t heard fully in court,” says Dr Cusack, Dr Bawa-Garba’s educational supervisor, who attended parts of the trial. The hospital’s own investigation, which flagged up all the contributory factors and failings that had led to Jack’s death, wasn’t put before the jury, he says. Not all failings were heard, he says. A number of other aspects of the case have also given rise to controversy. On the fifth day of the trial, Dr Stephen O’Riordan, the consultant who was meant to be on duty the day Jack died, took the stand. As the consultant, he had ultimate responsibility for the patients admitted on the CAU that day. Attached to his witness statement was the training encounter form containing details of his discussion with Dr Bawa-Garba in the canteen eight days after Jack’s death - the form Dr Bawa-Garba refused to sign. Dr O’Riordan told the court that he recalled the pH was 7.08 and “the lactate was high” saying he couldn’t remember if Dr Bawa-Garba had told him the actual value at their afternoon handover, before Jack died. He said: At no time was this patient highlighted to me as urgent, unwell, septic or that I needed to see him.” The point of a handover, he said, was the passing of information from one junior doctor to another - the consultant’s role was supervisory to ensure the information was transferred. Some doctors, however, contest this saying that the handover is to provide an opportunity for consultants to decide how best to manage patients, and to pick up on points that trainees have failed to flag. “Doctors work in teams and the consultant is in charge of that team. While doctors are responsible for their actions, many feel Dr Bawa-Garba was let down by the consultant on call both on the day that Jack died and subsequently,” Dr Cusack says. The role of the enalapril, the drug given to regulate Jack Adcock’s blood pressure, has also generated debate. Some doctors have expressed concern that its role in Jack’s cardiac arrest has been underplayed. Mrs Adcock says she feels that these doctors are blaming her for her son’s death. At the coroner’s inquest in August 2014, Dr O’Riordan’s barrister suggested that enalapril had been a significant factor. But the coroner, Mrs Catherine Mason, dismissed this idea. “I have no evidence of that at all,” she said. There was nothing in the report by Dr David O’Neill, the pathologist, or from toxicology, that suggested it played a role, she said. She then repeated the point, saying that there was “no evidence that the enalapril was incorrect or caused or contributed to his death”. Measurements of the levels of enalapril in Jack’s blood were not taken as they were thought not to be useful. At the criminal trial, experts agreed that Jack shouldn’t have been given the drug in the condition he was in, though all accepted that Mrs Adcock had behaved perfectly responsibly by giving it to him. They didn’t agree on how much it had affected him, though. Dr O’Neill said whether or not enalapril played a role was beyond his expertise. But when asked if it was a “significant factor” in Jack’s rapid deterioration, he said this was “consistent with the clinical history”. His post-mortem results could not confirm or refute it. The jury also heard from Dr Simon Nadel, a paediatric intensive care consultant in London, who thought enalapril had aggravated Jack Adcock’s condition, but wasn’t the cause of death. Another prosecution expert agreed. Dr Nadel said the little boy was “well on down the slippery slope by then” and had a “barn door” case of sepsis. This was the most important cause of his death, he said. Dr Bawa-Garba’s defence expert, however, thought the signs of sepsis were “more subtle”. After two weeks, it was Dr Bawa-Garba’s turn to give evidence. Mr Andrew Thomas QC, for the prosecution, told Dr Bawa-Garba that no-one was suggesting that she deliberately set out to harm Jack Adcock. What was at stake was whether she fell below the standard of a reasonably competent junior doctor. He pressed Dr Bawa-Garba on the reflection she did after Jack’s death. “List for us, please, all of the mistakes,” Mr Thomas said. “After this case happened, I reflected on my practice and this can be found in my e-portfolio, and I listed deficiencies that I felt were in the care that I provided on that day,” Dr Bawa-Garba replied. One of them, she said, was her failure to register warning signs in the blood tests. Mr Thomas told her to pause as people were going to write the list down. He then pressed her further and one by one, she listed how she felt she should have done better. “I wish that I had been clearer in my communication with the consultant,” she said “That's two. Keep going,” Mr Thomas said. “When I reassessed Jack, I was falsely reassured because he was alert, drinking from a beaker, responding to voice, pushing his mask away because he didn't want it on his face,” she replied. She added: “I should not have relied on the nurses to get back to me with the clinical deterioration as I normally do.” She should have looked at the nursing chart, she said. “That’s three. Number four?” “I underestimated the severity of his illness,” Dr Bawa-Garba said. “Number five?” “On the reflection I did following this incident, those were the points that I looked at,” she said. The next day was spent exploring all the points in detail. Dr Bawa-Garba continued to describe where she should have done better. Dr Cusack says the use of her reflections made by the prosecution has made doctors fearful about admitting their errors. “All doctors are expect to regularly reflect honestly and openly on their practice to improve patient care,” he says. At the end of the trial, the judge summed up the case to the jury. The prosecution relied on the fact she ignored “obvious clinical findings and symptoms”; did not review Jack’s X-ray and give antibiotics early enough; failed to obtain the morning blood test results early enough and act on the abnormalities they showed; and failed to make proper clinical notes. The judge told the jury they could only convict the health professionals in front of them if they were negligent and that their negligence significantly contributed to Jack’s death or its timing. The negligence had to be gross or severe, he said - what they did or didn’t do had to be truly, exceptionally bad. He said they should set aside any criticisms or feelings towards others involved in Jack’s care. They had to consider the circumstances within which the defendants were working when considering if they were guilty. Dr Bawa-Garba in police custody On 4 November 2015, the jury found Dr Bawa-Garba guilty. She was led away in handcuffs to a cell while her team worked out her bail conditions. “I sat in that small room and prayed,” she says. Then she asked for a pen to write. After initially being denied one, in case she harmed herself, she was given a pen outside the cell. “I remember writing and writing until the ink ran out in the pen,” she says. “I had two very young children - my oldest is severely autistic and goes to a special needs school. So I made plans that if I was to go to prison he would have to go out and live with my mother in Nigeria.” Nicola and Victor Adcock outside court For the Adcocks it was the day they had been waiting for. “For a split second you think, ‘Yes, we’ve got justice for our son’s death,’” says Mrs Adcock. Dr Bawa-Garba spent the next six weeks trying to plan for every scenario. She returned to court in December for sentencing. She had brought a rucksack with her in case she was sent to prison. “I remember on the morning of the sentencing telling my parents that I didn’t want them there in the court in Nottingham,” she says. I didn’t want my dad to see me being taken away in handcuffs. But he just started sobbing on that morning because I wouldn’t let him come to court with me.” Dr Bawa-Garba was given a two-year suspended sentence. Nurse Isabel Amaro received the same sentence. Ward sister Theresa Taylor had been found not guilty. Dr Bawa Garba applied for leave to appeal against her conviction, but this was denied in November 2016. Pulse At the heart of this story is the tragic death of a much-loved little boy and the loss felt by the family. But there’s been a much wider impact too. In 2017, the General Medical Council’s tribunal service suspended Dr Bawa-Garba for a year. They said that while her actions fell “far below the standards expected of a competent doctor”, they had taken into account other factors. These included that fact she had learnt from her errors; had an unblemished record before and after Jack Adcock’s death; and the system failures at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. The tribunal’s decision angered Mrs Adcock. “How can somebody make that many mistakes, be found guilty by a jury and be able to practise again? It doesn’t give the public any faith in the NHS,” she says. If you walked into a hospital and saw that doctor, would you be happy for her to treat your child?” So Mrs Adcock approached the GMC to see if she could appeal. She set up an online petition, with thousands of people pledging support. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, says that after receiving legal advice the GMC applied to the High Court to overturn the decision made by its own tribunal. He denies being influenced by the Adcocks’ petition, and says the GMC acted out of the need to protect public confidence in the profession, given the seriousness of the conviction. Charlie Massey Dr Bawa-Garba was struck off in January 2018, meaning that she could no longer practise medicine in the UK. “The best way to protect patients is by supporting doctors. But we are also a regulator, and sometimes we have to make tough and unpopular decisions,” Charlie Massey says. The decision has certainly been unpopular among the medical profession. Dr Bawa-Garba’s striking off caused outrage, and led to allegations that she had become a scapegoat for a failing and unsafe NHS. A social media storm ensued, accompanied by the hashtag “#IamHadiza”, with doctors wearing T-shirts and badges in her support. One said: An overworked and under-supported doctor was thrown under the bus by the GMC.” “Drs working flat out in a broken and unsafe system,” said another. “Huge solidarity with this doctor who could be any one of us NHS doctors working in an overstretched, purposefully underfunded and dangerously understaffed service,” added another. For Dr Hsu, the outcry from around the country suggested that what he had seen at Leicester was widespread across the NHS. A crowdfunding campaign also got under way to enable Dr Bawa-Garba get another legal opinion. It raised over £360,000 in about a month with contributions from around 180 countries. Dr Chris Day, a junior doctor and one of the people behind the crowdfunding, says he was overwhelmed by the response. “I think people want to know how it was possible that a junior doctor could get convicted for gross negligence manslaughter, going about her duties as a junior doctor - and when there were so many systemic factors at play,” he says. Dr Chris Day After Dr Bawa-Garba was struck off, The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, an organisation that aims to promote diversity and equality, has expressed concerns that healthcare workers from BAME groups are disproportionately referred to their respective regulators. They have written to the GMC. Indeed, one official review concluded that BAME groups are also disproportionately prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter - although it only looked at a small number of cases. The GMC’s Charlie Massey says he understands these concerns. He says that nearly twice as many black and minority ethnic doctors are referred to the GMC by their employer than white doctors. “And that's important, because the vast majority of referrals that come to us from employers, do result in investigations, whereas it’s a minority of complaints that are made to us by the public,” he says.  A review is underway to look at the disproportionate referral rate. Others in the medical profession have found different ways of registering a protest. One group of doctors tore up their GMC registration certificates in front of its headquarters in London and others took themselves off the register completely. Doctors protesting in Scotland with the politician, Anas Sarwar Dr Peter Wilmshurst, a Midlands-based cardiologist, wrote to the GMC to ask them to investigate him. All doctors make mistakes and that is understandably scary for patients, he says. “I’ve made clinical mistakes including delayed diagnosis and errors in treatment. Some sick patients died. I suspect that many would have died anyway but in some cases my errors are likely to have contributed to poor outcomes and some patient deaths,” he says. “I therefore feel obliged to ask the GMC to investigate my clinical practice over the last 40 years to see whether I should be struck off the medical register.” But Mrs Adcock says the doctors are mistaken in their interpretation of what happened. “The reason the doctors are doing what they’re doing, they’re scared for themselves. I understand that because they’re thinking if we make an honest mistake we’re going to be charged. That isn’t the case. They need to look at the number of errors that doctor made on the day for the judge to say ‘truly exceptionally bad’,” she says. The Adcocks In 2013, Professor Don Berwick MD, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in the US, was asked by the then prime minister, David Cameron, to advise about how to improve patient safety in the NHS following the Mid Staffs scandal. His report made a raft of recommendations including moving away from blaming an individual to looking to learn from errors. “We said if there’s fear in the system people are frightened about identifying hazards, about speaking up when they make a mistake about speaking up when something goes wrong then how could it ever get safer?” he says. Dr Don Berwick “You could fire everybody, punish everybody and put in an entirely new workforce, you will have the same injuries and the same errors occur again unless you’ve actually changed the systems of work,” he adds. He says that when there’s been a serious tragedy families are understandably angry. “We have to help them understand what happened, to be open about what happened, to apologise for what happened,” he says. But he says he has sympathy for Dr Bawa-Garba. “Even though she made mistakes she was trapped - she was trapped in a set of circumstances which set her up for failure.” Dr Bawa-Garba Dr Bawa-Garba has been on a long journey. The story began in an overstretched hospital in February 2011 when she was 34. She was charged with manslaughter in December 2014 and convicted in November the following year. She was struck off the medical register in January this year. And on Monday she was reinstated to the medical register by the Court of Appeal. The judges ruled that Dr Bawa-Garba's actions had been neither deliberate or reckless and she should not have been struck off. The GMC has accepted the judgement. “The lessons that I’ve learnt will live with me forever. I welcome the verdict because for me that’s an opportunity to do something that I’ve dedicated my life to doing, which is medicine. But I wanted to pay tribute and remember Jack Adcock, a wonderful little boy who started this story,” Dr Bawa-Garba said. “My hope is that lessons learnt from this case will translate into better working conditions for junior doctors, better recognition of sepsis, and factors in place that will improve patient safety.” Built with Shorthand"
Doctors to be protected,"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba (R) was struck off following an appeal by the doctors' regulator New measures designed to improve patient safety and protect doctors and nurses when mistakes are made, are to be announced by the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. It comes after concerns were raised following the case of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba,who was struck offafter the death of a six-year-old boy. Mr Hunt said staff should be able to learn from their mistakes. Hundreds of medics also signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba. She was found guilty of mistakes in the care of six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Leicestershire, who died of sepsis in 2011. Followinga government reviewordered by Mr Hunt, new measures are being introduced. These include: the investigation of every hospital death by a medical examiner or coroner data on doctors' performance will allow them to see how they compare to others to help them improve the regulator - the General Medical Council - will no longer be able to appeal against the findings of doctors' disciplinary hearings Professor Norman Williams who conducted the review said that ""a clearer understanding"" of when manslaughter charges should be brought in healthcare ""should lead to fewer criminal investigations"". Professor Williams said criminal investigation should be confined ""to just those rare cases where an individual's performance is so 'truly exceptionally bad' that it requires a criminal sanction"". Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months by a tribunal, but was then removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". But the health secretary says improving patient safety means doctors and other staff must be able to reflect openly and freely when they have made ordinary mistakes, instead of being punished for them. ""When something goes tragically wrong in healthcare, the best apology to grieving families is to guarantee that no-one will experience that same heartache again,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I was deeply concerned about the unintended chilling effect on clinicians' ability to learn from mistakes following recent court rulings... the actions from this authoritative review will help us promise them that the NHS will support them to learn, rather than seek to blame."" Doctors say medicine is about balancing risk - and that mistakes will happen. The British Medical Association, representing doctors, said that it would be monitoring closely how the law was applied in the light of the review's recommendations. BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""If we, as doctors, and the wider health service are to learn from these mistakes and to prevent such tragedies occurring, the NHS needs a dramatic shift away from the current culture of blame."" The Department of Health and Social Care said the changes would mean bereaved families would get more information about the circumstances of their loved ones' death and more data would be shared across the NHS to help prevent avoidable deaths in the future.

Israeli PM attacks Corbyn over 2014 event,"This video can not be played Corbyn asked about Tunisia wreath-laying criticism Israel's PM has criticised Jeremy Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyn said Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions... are false"". The Labour leader said he had attended the event in Tunis in 2014 as part of a wider event about the search for peace. He hit back at the Israeli prime minister, accusing his government of discriminating against Israel's Palestinian minority. Mr Netanyahu had also accused Mr Corbyn of comparing Israel to the Nazis, although a Labour statement reiterated a previous denial of that claim. The Israeli leader had commented after the Daily Mailsaid Mr Corbyn was,externalpictured with a wreath near memorials of the group behind the attack. Allow Twitter content?

In response to the story, the Labour leader said that while at a conference, he had attended a memorial for victims of the bombing of Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters by Israel in 1985. Mr Corbyn was also asked about a second wreath-laying, reportedly remembering people killed by Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. The Mail had reported that the Labour leader was photographed near memorials to members of the militant Black September group behind the 1972 attack. Asked who this wreath had been for, if they were not terrorists, Mr Corbyn replied simply that a wreath ""was indeed laid"". But he added: ""I was present when it was laid. I don't think I was actually involved in it. ""I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it. ""You cannot pursue peace by a cycle of violence. The only way you pursue peace is a cycle of dialogue."" However, Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Mr Corbyn ""needs to recognise he can't cavort with terrorists"". She called on him to apologise to the widows and children of those killed in the Munich terror attack. Eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian group at the 1972 summer games in Munich. The hostages and a West German police officer were killed by the group, with five of the eight hostage-takers killed by German police during a failed rescue attempt. However, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi of Jewish Voice for Labour said Mr Corbyn was in Tunis for a pro-peace conference and that the accusations were ""yet another cooked-up example of people trying to attribute guilt to the Labour Party leader by association"". By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton It is highly unusual for a foreign prime minister to get involved in a British political row. It's even more unusual for that to happen on a public forum like Twitter. Add in the fact the Jeremy Corbyn replied to Benjamin Netanyahu's tweet and you're looking at a unique political moment. In his reply, Jeremy Corbyn described the Israeli Prime Minister's accusations as false. But he also took the opportunity to say that the killing of Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces deserves ""unequivocal condemnation"". His supporters say the purpose of Benjamin Netanyahu's message is to shut down that sort of criticism of Israel's actions. But his critics will argue that the fact such a senior figure has got involved in Labour's internal row over anti-Semitism shows how urgently the party needs to resolve an issue that has been hanging over it for months. On Twitter, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn had ""devoted his life to promoting justice and peace"" which involved ""meeting people who haven't shared those ideals"". ""Having a politician like Netanyahu join the media feeding frenzy is a line in the sand,"" he added. Jeremy Corbyn was pictured at a wreath-laying ceremony in 2014 The Daily Mail has also published a video of Mr Corbyn from an event in 2013. In the video, Mr Corbyn said Palestinians had experienced ""conditions in the West Bank, under occupation, of the very sort that will be recognisable by many people in Europe who suffered occupation during the Second World War"". A Labour statement said Mr Corbyn had not compared Israel to the Nazis ""but the conditions of civilian populations in besieged cities in wartime"". Referring to the accusation of wreath-laying, Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger said: ""Being 'present' is the same as being involved. ""When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. ""There can also never be a 'fitting memorial' for terrorists. Where is the apology?"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said his behaviour was ""unbelievable and shocking"". On Sunday Labour's press team said: ""The Munich widows are being misled. Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings."" In a tweet, Labour said he and other Parliamentarians had been honouring victims of the 1985 Israeli bombings. It comes amid a wider row aboutanti-Semitism in the Labour party. Critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, say a new code of conduct adopted by the party is not as comprehensive about anti-Semitism as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) guidelines. Labour says it has included the international definition word-for-word in the code, although critics say the Labour code leaves out examples of how criticism of Israel can be anti-Semitic.

Medical malpractice reviewed,"Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off following an appeal Jeremy Hunt has ordered an urgent review of medical malpractice cases following concerns over a recent manslaughter case involving a doctor. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba wasstruck off the medical registerafter she was found guilty of mistakes in the care of a six-year-old boy who died of sepsis. The health secretary says clarity is needed about drawing the line between gross negligence and ordinary errors. Doctors should learn from - not fear - mistakes, he says. The Bawa-Garba case has rocked the medical profession. Medics rally behind struck off doctor Doctor struck off over six-year-old's death More than 800 medics have signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba, saying focusing on one person ignored the part low staffing levels played in the tragedy and striking her off would discourage medics from being open when reviewing mistakes. Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months last June by a tribunal, but she has now been removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". Jack died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""The only way we can reduce mistakes in the NHS is to learn from every single one, and the tragic case of Dr Bawa-Garba raises many important questions about how the health system supports staff to be open and transparent when things go wrong."" The government's rapid review will be led by Prof Sir Norman Williams, former President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and will report back by the end of April 2018. It will look at: Any lessons that need to be learned by the General Medical Council and other professional regulators How learning, openness and transparency can be protected so that mistakes are learned from and not covered up Providing clarity to doctors about where they stand with respect to criminal liability and professional misconduct When six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was admitted to the hospital in February 2011, his sepsis went undiagnosed and led to him suffering a cardiac arrest. The courts heard Dr Bawa-Garba, a paediatrician, committed a ""catalogue"" of errors, including missing signs of his infection and mistakenly thinking Jack was under a do-not-resuscitate order. At the time of the ruling, Jack's mother, Nicola, said: ""We are absolutely elated with the decision. It's what we wanted. ""I know we'll never get Jack back but we have got justice for our little boy."" The Medical Protection Society, which represented Dr Bawa-Garba, said at the time: ""A conviction should not automatically mean that a doctor who has fully remediated and demonstrated insight into their clinical failings is erased."" An online appeal set up by concerned doctors has raised more than Â£320,000 to help pay the legal costs of Dr Bawa-Garba. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the General Medical Council, welcomed the announcement of the government's rapid review.

Former aide taped 'Trump phone call',"This video can not be played Omarosa Manigault Newman: The audio tapes A former adviser to Donald Trump has released what she says is a tape of a phone call from the US president after her dismissal last year. In the tape played on US TV channel NBC, a voice presumed to be Mr Trump's expresses surprise at Omarosa Manigault Newman being fired the previous day. ""Nobody even told me about it,"" the male voice can be heard saying. She is releasing a memoir soon and the White House have described her as a disgruntled ex-employee. The dos and don'ts of the Situation Room The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Trump targets critics' security clearance Tweeting on Monday, Mr Trump said his former employee had only started to attack him after she lost her job.

President Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, says she may have broken the law by recording private conversations at the White House. Ms Manigault Newman knew the president from her days as a star of The Apprentice reality TV show, and advised him on African-American issues during the 2016 election before taking a communications role in the White House. By Tara McKelvey, BBC White House reporter ""Wacky Omarosa"" the president calls her. He has a point: her disclosures are hugely entertaining - and embarrassing for the president. Through her book and TV appearances, she's exposed private conversations and the inner workings of an unconventional administration, but she hasn't exposed any serious wrongdoing, and it's unlikely she will. She worked in the office of public liaison, focusing on outreach to the African-American community, and didn't have access to top-level secrets. I'd often see her float in and out of White House events, leaving them early if they got boring, or showing her friends around the place and inviting them to the White House mess for coffee. Her revelations are now creating a stir for a reality-TV-star-studded West Wing but this episode's likely to end soon. In the excerpt broadcast, the voice said to be the president's tells Ms Manigault Newman he has seen on the news that she is ""thinking of leaving"" and asks, ""What's going on?""

When Ms Manigault Newman asks if President Trump is aware of what is happening, he brushes the question aside, saying, ""Let's not go down the road. This is non-negotiable discussion.""

The BBC has learned that Worboys, thought to be one of the UK's most prolific rapists, was interviewed under caution last month. Met Police detectives are examining claims of sexual assault and administering a substance with intent to commit a sexual offence. The offences are alleged to have occurred between 1997 and 2007. In January the Parole Board revealed that it haddecided to free Worboys, who was convicted in 2009 of crimes against 12 women. Amid the uproar that followed the announcement, a woman came forward to police with a new allegation, dating back to 1997. A dossier containing other allegations was presented to police by the complainant's lawyers. The black cab used by Worboys in his attacks In March, the High Court overturned the Parole Board's decision - a ruling which prompted the Justice Secretary, David Gauke, to seek the resignation of the Board's chairman, Nick Hardwick. A fresh parole panel is being established to consider Worboys' case again.

Dozens hurt as coach overturns on M25,"A total of 41 people were taken to hospital after the coach overturned at the Swanley junction Dozens of passengers have been taken to hospital - three with serious injuries - after the coach they were travelling in overturned on the M25. Seven children were among those hurt when the vehicle came off the motorway at Swanley, Kent at 16:00 BST. The crash was on the anti-clockwise carriageway near junction three. The road was closed for emergency crews to attend the crash site. Kent Police later said a baby boy was born at the scene in the queuing traffic. Kent Fire and Rescue Service crews had to use cutting gear to free two people trapped. Eyewitness Mitchell Melvin helped rescue some of those on board. ""We quickly jumped up, smashed a back window, was pulling people off the back, realised that some people were stuck underneath where they've come out of the side of the coach, so we went down the side and started taking people out from the side as well"", he said. Andrei Branescu was driving home from a business meeting when he saw the traffic stop. He said: ""I saw the fire brigade helping people come out from the back window of the coach one by one. ""The distress and fear in these peoples' eyes was unbelievable and my thoughts really go out to the families of the people involved in this accident."" Long delays are expected with traffic queues stretching back five miles, the Highways Agency said Kent Police said all those on the coach were accounted for and a number of people had received treatment at the scene for minor injuries before being conveyed to local hospitals. The Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington declared a major incident alert and said it was continuing to treat 23 people who had been on board the coach. Kent Fire and Rescue Service said firefighters used cutting gear to free two people trapped A police spokesman said while specialist recovery for the coach had been arranged, it was expected the slip road would remain closed for several hours.

Builder accused of ÃÂ£4m digger destruction,"Five new houses belonging to McCarthy and Stone were destroyed A builder has been accused of causing Â£4m of damage by ripping apart five new homes with a digger. Hertfordshire Police was called to Ermine Street in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, at about 17:40 BST on Saturday. Daniel Neagu, 30, from Athelstone Road in Harrow, north-west London, has been charged with causing criminal damage. Magistrates heard that the houses belonged to development company McCarthy and Stone. A spokeswoman for the firm said Mr Neagu was not employed directly but worked for subcontractor Fenton.

Trio guilty of killing London model,"Harry Uzoka was killed by a stab wound to the heart in January A London model has been found guilty of killing his fashion rival in a row over a girlfriend. George Koh, 24, stabbed fellow model Harry Uzoka in the heart after he went to settle the dispute, accompanied by two friends on 11 January. Mr Uzoka, 25, who was armed with a dumbbell bar, died in the street outside his Shepherd's Bush home. Koh denied murder, claiming he had two knives because he was scared Mr Uzoka and his friends would beat him up. 'Murdered model had landed film role' Model knifed to death in 'row over girl' Harry Uzoka was warned before fatal fight But an Old Bailey jury found him guilty of murder, along with his machete-wielding friend Merse Dikanda, 24. Personal trainer Jonathan Okigbo, also 24, was convicted of manslaughter. (L-R) Merse Dikanda, Jonathan Okigbo and George Koh appearing at the Old Bailey Mr Uzoka was signed with London's Premier Model Management agency and counted catwalk star Jourdan Dunn among his friends. He hadrecently landed a film rolebut became annoyed by ""the less successful copycat Koh"", the court heard on Monday. Their relationship deteriorated after Koh bragged to Paris-based model Annecetta Lafon that he had sex with Mr Uzoka's girlfriend, fellow model Ruby Campbell. Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC said: ""Koh claimed that he knew Uzoka well and then said that he had sex with Uzoka's girlfriend and that was the reason why they no longer talked."" But on January 11, Mr Uzoka received a message from Koh saying: ""Where you I'll come there n we can fight bring ur friends with u."" Mr Uzoka, replied: ""Come Shepherd's Bush."" Mr Uzoka was described as being a ""pleasure to work with"" by London's Premier Model Management The defendants took a minicab and confronted Mr Uzoka and his flatmate Adrian Harper outside their address. Mr Harper, who also had a metal pole, told jurors: ""I was expecting a fist fight but I took the bell bar because I knew we were outnumbered. ""I had no idea and did not expect that knives would be used and I would not have gone out if I had thought knives would be used."" When he saw his friend again Mr Uzoka said ""I've been stabbed,"" and collapsed in the road. Giving evidence, Koh said: ""Although Merse had a machete and I had two knives it was Harry who was the aggressor."" Koh, of York Way, Camden, pleaded guilty to two charges of possessing a knife. Dikanda, of no fixed abode, denied possessing a machete on 11 January and possessing a knife on 25 January but was convicted of the charges. All three men will be sentenced on 21 September.

Streamer Ninja won't play with female gamers,"Tyler ""Ninja"" Blevins has revealed that he doesn't ""play with female gamers"" out of respect for his wife. The US gamer and husband of fellow streamer Jessica ""JGhosty"" Blevins has suggested that it could lead to rumours regarding him and the women he's playing with. He says ""the only way to avoid that is to not play with them at all"". Ninja is famous for playing Fortnite and is the first Twitch streamer to reach 10 million followers. However fame has come at a price - he says that he now has to be mindful of who he's playing with. ""If I have one conversation with one female streamer where we're playing with one another, and even if there's a hint of flirting, that is going to be taken and going to be put on every single video and be clickbait forever,"" he toldPolygon in an interview,external. The streamer recently celebrated his one-year anniversary with his wife and manager, Jessica Blevins. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ninja says it was his decision, not his wife's, to limit his streaming partners to men only. ""That was not even her. She had nothing to do with it. That was me being, 'I love our relationship',"" he said. ""I honestly think that... it's just kind of like a respect thing."" Despite excluding a whole group of players, Ninja says he hasn't faced a backlash from the gaming community. Twitch streamer Rage Darling isn't particularly offended by Ninja's comments. But she says he's ""indirectly reinforcing the stereotype that a lot of female gamers are Twitch thots"". The 20-year-old gamer says a Twitch thot is something that many women on the site are labelled as. ""It's basically someone, particularly female, that uses her sexual identity to get more views or more money. Someone that is quite promiscuous."" Rage Darling says Ninja is ""indirectly reinforcing a stereotype"" ""I think that if people were more relaxed about playing with female gamers, which a lot of people are, it would break the boundary of; 'if you're playing with a female gamer you're probably dating them',"" she adds. ""It's a difficult one because when you're streaming on Twitch and you're a female gamer you are sort of ultimately ridiculed. ""But I don't think he's purposefully trying to encourage it."" Ninja's decision has encouraged debates around gender with members of the gaming community. Some agree with his viewpoint. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Toddler-attack dog owners facing jail,"The family of the mauled toddler said after the attack it had ruined their lives A couple are facing jail after their pit bull terrier-type dog mauled and severely injured an 18-month-old girl. Michael Thornton, 27, and Hayley Eldridge, 29, from Chatham, Kent, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court to owning a dog that was dangerously out of control in a public place. A police marksman shot the dog after it attacked Viktoria Resetjnova in a playground on 4 April 2017. The couple will be sentenced on 24 September. They had allowed a 15-year-old girl to walk the dog, which was a breed banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Dogs are banned from the play area The animal, called Max, attacked Viktoria, who had been playing with her older sister on the Jenkins Dale estate in the town. She was seriously injured in the attack and faces years of surgery on her scalp, which was ripped open, according to court documents. The pair had owned the white-and-tan dog for only about a week, the documents said, after rehoming what was advertised as a Staffordshire bull terrier cross-breed. The court was also told that Thornton and Eldridge had given cannabis to the teenager, who cannot be named, as payment for walking the animal. At the time of the attack Viktoria's parents said in a statement: ""The incident has ruined our lives and the lives of our two children."" Thornton and Eldridge have been bailed ahead of sentencing at the same court. Judge David Griffiths-Jones QC warned them they faced a potential jail term.

MP denies lying about speeding,"Fiona Onasanya arrived at the Old Bailey on Monday and denied lying about speeding A Labour MP has denied perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying about who was driving a speeding vehicle. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya, 34, appeared at the Old Bailey earlier charged with the offence. She pleaded not guilty to one count of perverting the course of justice. Her brother Festus Onasanya, 33, denied three counts of the same offence. They are both due to face trial at the same court on 12 November. Ms Onasanya and her brother, who are jointly charged with one count, were released on unconditional bail. The charge the siblings face relates to an allegation that they falsely claimed the driver of a vehicle caught speeding on the 24 July last year was another man. Mr Onasanya, from Chesterton, Cambridge, faces two further charges relating to allegations he blamed someone else for two separate speeding incidents on 17 June and 23 August last year.

Turkey accuses US of 'stab in the back',"Moves to ease Turkey's economic woes have failed to stop market turmoil as the country's row with the US deepens. Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Monday that the US was seeking to ""stab it in the back"". The US last week imposed sanctions on Turkey over its refusal to extradite a US preacher imprisoned in the country. The sanctions caused market turmoil, which the central bank attempted - but failed - to soothe with a series of market-boosting measures. Mr Erdogan told a news conference in the Turkish capital, Ankara: ""You act on one side as a strategic partner, but on the other, you fire bullets into the foot of your strategic partner. ""We are together in Nato and then you seek to stab your strategic partner in the back."" The pastor is only one of a number of issues dividing Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan As the crisis deepened at the end of last week, the lira and the Turkish stock market slid sharply. Mr Erdogan, who has presided over soaring inflation and borrowing levels, says the lira's fall is the result of a plot rather than prevailing economic conditions. Turkey's interior ministry said it was taking legal action against 346 social media accounts it claimed had posted comments about the weakening lira ""in a provocative way"". Time to book a holiday? Turkey's lira slump explained Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down The dispute centres on Turkey's refusal to release American pastor Andrew Brunson. Mr Brunson has been detained for nearly two years, accused of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. The Turkish president is angry that the US has not taken more action against the Gulenist movement and what he said was a failure ""to unequivocally condemn"" the 2016 coup attempt. The US has refused to extradite Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues US support for Kurdish rebel groups fighting Islamic State (IS) fighters in northern Syria is another major difficulty, given Turkey's battle against a Kurdish insurgency in its own country. Mr Erdogan has also been getting closer to Russia. That creates an awkward triangle, given that Turkey is a Nato member, Russia is Nato's number one threat and the organisation is obliged to defend any member that is attacked. Nato uses the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to fight against IS and there has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close it. The lira's worst day was Friday, when US President Donald Trump approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, following Turkey's refusal to free an American pastor who has been in detention there for nearly two years. Experts have blamed the drop in the Turkish lira on fears thatthe country is descending into an economic crisis. Turkey's stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year. Meanwhile, inflation has hit 15%. Investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, since the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. More than a third of Turkish banks' lending is in foreign currencies, according to Reuters,external. Although the lira rose slightly after the central bank's move to support the economy, it still hit a new record low against the dollar. Investors globally fear the damage spreading and have been prompted to sell riskier assets, including other emerging market currencies. The Turkish Central Bank announced on Monday that banks would be given all the liquidity - help to keep money moving - they needed. But the bank did not increase interest rates, which would help contain inflation while supporting the lira. It is not clear if this comes after Mr Erdogan's pressure. The president is famously averse to interest rate rises. He has dismissed the fall of the currency as ""a storm in a tea cup"" and urged Turks to sell dollars and buy lira to help boost the currency. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent President Erdogan sees Turkey's problems as the result of a plot rather than economic fundamentals. That kind of talk might play well politically with some audiences in Turkey, but it won't wash in the markets. Turkey has underlying problems in the form of a fairly large international trade deficit, high levels of foreign currency debt owed by the private sector and a persistent inflation problem. Certainly the situation has been aggravated by the deterioration in political relations with the United States and the higher tariffs that Turkey now faces on its steel and aluminium sales in the US.  But the scale of the apparent impact was due to the fact that Turkey was already economically and financially vulnerable. Business executive Kemal, who lives in Istanbul, said: ""It is not unusual or unexpected to see some companies go under when there is such a sudden devaluation of the currency.

Monaco noble sues France for millions,"Monaco's Royal Palace: The principality is a sun-drenched tax haven A French-born aristocrat has asked the French state to pay him â¬351m (Â£314m; $401m) in damages, alleging that it tricked his relatives out of succeeding to the throne of Monaco. Count Louis de Causans, 44, says that early in the 20th Century France changed the succession rules to thwart a German claim to the throne. Mr de Causans told the French daily Le Parisien that it was a matter of family honour to rectify the ""trickery"". Prince Albert II rules Monaco today. In a video broadcast by Le Parisien (in French),external, Mr de Causans said ""I want the truth to come out - I want reparation for the injustice done to my family by France"". He stressed that his dispute was with France, not with Prince Albert. His lawyer, Jean-Marc DescoubÃ¨s, told the BBC that ""on 2 July this year we asked the foreign ministry to pay compensation to my client"". The ministry has two months to accept or reject the request, so the deadline is 2 September. ""If the government refuses we will sue it in court,"" he explained. Mr de Causans, who lives in Paris, says he is a direct descendant of HonorÃ© III, who ruled the tiny Mediterranean principality in 1733-1793. The royal family are known as the House of Grimaldi. Prince Albert II married South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock in 2011 The claim centres around Prince Louis II, who reigned in 1922-1949. He was a bachelor, without any legitimate royal heir, and therefore under the original inheritance rules he was ineligible to reign. Mr de Causans maintains that under these rules his own branch of the Grimaldi family should have succeeded to the throne instead. But in 1911 a law was passed, under French pressure, changing the rules so that Louis could reign. He had an illegitimate daughter, Charlotte, and the new law enabled her to be adopted by Louis, thus getting round the succession problem. Charlotte was born of a passionate liaison between Louis and a cabaret singer, Marie-Juliette Louvet. Conman dupes victims as fake Monaco prince Court backs Monaco love child story Monaco country profile At the time the great European powers were in an arms race that turned into the carnage of World War I in 1914. Mr de Causans says the succession should have gone to a German nobleman from his own branch of the family - Wilhelm, the Second Duke of Urach, who was Louis' cousin. The lawyer, Jean-Marc DescoubÃ¨s, said that ""it was quite simply unacceptable for a German to reign over Monaco then, on the eve of the First World War"". ""We identified the responsibility of the French government,"" he told the BBC. ""There were secret meetings in Paris and Monaco between the French ambassador and Monaco authorities, they signed a secret pact. I have some evidence, and will give it to the court if the French government doesn't want to pay."" When asked why Mr de Causans had only decided to make his claim now, he said the late Prince Rainier III - Albert's predecessor - had ""blocked everything"" during his reign. He died in 2005. Rainier had barred Mr de Causans and his side of the Grimaldi family from entering Monaco, the lawyer said. The â¬351m figure for the claim resulted from the calculations of lawyers and accountants, based on the Grimaldi fortune and Mr de Causans's age, he said.

Corbyn pressed over 'terror memorial' claim,"This video can not be played Corbyn asked about Tunisia wreath-laying criticism Israel's PM has criticised Jeremy Corbyn over his presence at a ceremony said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich terror attack. Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyn said Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions... are false"". The Labour leader said he had attended the event in Tunis in 2014 as part of a wider event about the search for peace. He hit back at the Israeli prime minister, accusing his government of discriminating against Israel's Palestinian minority. Mr Netanyahu had also accused Mr Corbyn of comparing Israel to the Nazis, although a Labour statement reiterated a previous denial of that claim. The Israeli leader had commented after the Daily Mailsaid Mr Corbyn was,externalpictured with a wreath near memorials of the group behind the attack. Allow Twitter content?

In response to the story, the Labour leader said that while at a conference, he had attended a memorial for victims of the bombing of Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters by Israel in 1985. Mr Corbyn was also asked about a second wreath-laying, reportedly remembering people killed by Israeli intelligence agency Mossad. The Mail had reported that the Labour leader was photographed near memorials to members of the militant Black September group behind the 1972 attack. Asked who this wreath had been for, if they were not terrorists, Mr Corbyn replied simply that a wreath ""was indeed laid"". But he added: ""I was present when it was laid. I don't think I was actually involved in it. ""I was there because I wanted to see a fitting memorial to everyone who has died in every terrorist incident everywhere because we have to end it. ""You cannot pursue peace by a cycle of violence. The only way you pursue peace is a cycle of dialogue."" However, Marie van der Zyl, the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Mr Corbyn ""needs to recognise he can't cavort with terrorists"". She called on him to apologise to the widows and children of those killed in the Munich terror attack. Eleven members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by the Palestinian group at the 1972 summer games in Munich. The hostages and a West German police officer were killed by the group, with five of the eight hostage-takers killed by German police during a failed rescue attempt. However, Naomi Wimborne-Idrissi of Jewish Voice for Labour said Mr Corbyn was in Tunis for a pro-peace conference and that the accusations were ""yet another cooked-up example of people trying to attribute guilt to the Labour Party leader by association"". By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton It is highly unusual for a foreign prime minister to get involved in a British political row. It's even more unusual for that to happen on a public forum like Twitter. Add in the fact the Jeremy Corbyn replied to Benjamin Netanyahu's tweet and you're looking at a unique political moment. In his reply, Jeremy Corbyn described the Israeli Prime Minister's accusations as false. But he also took the opportunity to say that the killing of Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces deserves ""unequivocal condemnation"". His supporters say the purpose of Benjamin Netanyahu's message is to shut down that sort of criticism of Israel's actions. But his critics will argue that the fact such a senior figure has got involved in Labour's internal row over anti-Semitism shows how urgently the party needs to resolve an issue that has been hanging over it for months. On Twitter, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Corbyn had ""devoted his life to promoting justice and peace"" which involved ""meeting people who haven't shared those ideals"". ""Having a politician like Netanyahu join the media feeding frenzy is a line in the sand,"" he added. Jeremy Corbyn was pictured at a wreath-laying ceremony in 2014 The Daily Mail has also published a video of Mr Corbyn from an event in 2013. In the video, Mr Corbyn said Palestinians had experienced ""conditions in the West Bank, under occupation, of the very sort that will be recognisable by many people in Europe who suffered occupation during the Second World War"". A Labour statement said Mr Corbyn had not compared Israel to the Nazis ""but the conditions of civilian populations in besieged cities in wartime"". Referring to the accusation of wreath-laying, Jewish Labour MP Luciana Berger said: ""Being 'present' is the same as being involved. ""When I attend a memorial, my presence alone, whether I lay a wreath or not, demonstrates my association and support. ""There can also never be a 'fitting memorial' for terrorists. Where is the apology?"" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said his behaviour was ""unbelievable and shocking"". On Sunday Labour's press team said: ""The Munich widows are being misled. Jeremy did not honour those responsible for the Munich killings."" In a tweet, Labour said he and other Parliamentarians had been honouring victims of the 1985 Israeli bombings. It comes amid a wider row aboutanti-Semitism in the Labour party. Critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, say a new code of conduct adopted by the party is not as comprehensive about anti-Semitism as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) guidelines. Labour says it has included the international definition word-for-word in the code, although critics say the Labour code leaves out examples of how criticism of Israel can be anti-Semitic.

Ben Stokes 'lied about self-defence',"Ben Stokes, who denies affray, is alleged to have knocked a man out outside a Bristol club England cricketer Ben Stokes lied when he said he acted in self-defence during a fight outside a nightclub, a court has heard. The Durham all-rounder, 27, denies affray at Bristol Crown Court. Prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis said Mr Stokes ""acted deplorably as the red mist came down"" - something his defence team labelled as ""nonsense"". The cricketer is on trial alongside Ryan Ali, 28, whom he is alleged to have knocked out outside Mbargo. Mr Ali has also denied affray while Ryan Hale, 27, was acquitted of the same charge last Thursday. Giving his closing speech, Mr Corsellis told the jury Mr Stokes acted ""to defend himself or in defence of another"" when Mr Ali had a bottle in his hand, but then ""quickly turned aggressor"". Ryan Ali has also denied a charge of affray ""Even if Mr Stokes has begun using self-defence, he very, very quickly after this became the aggressor, with Mr Hale trying to pacify him together with Mr Ali,"" Mr Corsellis said. ""He was pursuing them into the road, repeatedly punching at them at least six times, with his teammate Alex Hales calling him away 'Stokes... Stokes... stop... stop...'. ""If Mr Stokes was being tried alone, we submit that his behaviour would constitute an affray. ""It is plain Mr Stokes is lying."" Mr Corsellis added that Mr Stokes ""acted deplorably as the red mist came down and struck with such force that he rendered one person unconscious"". During his closing speech, Mr Stokes's barrister Gordon Cole QC said it was ""complete nonsense"" for the prosecution to say the cricketer was ""drunk and enraged"". He said CCTV footage from just before the fight showed he was ""not behaving in a drunk way"". He added that footage recorded by film student Max Wilson ""clearly shows Ryan Ali going at Alex Hales with a bottle"". ""You can see where Ben Stokes is, he's not rushing at anybody, he's not charging into the fray."" Mr Cole said there had been a ""great deal of rowing back"" by the prosecution since the trial began. ""Is this man [Mr Stokes] getting special treatment because of who he is?"" Mr Cole asked. Last week, giving evidence, the cricketer said he ""stepped in"" to defend two gay men before the fight in Bristol on 25 September last year. During her closing speech, Mr Ali's defence barrister Anna Midgley said there had been nothing to show her client had suddenly lost it ""from a calm gentleman to a total personality change"". ""His demeanour generally, and on the footage that we've seen, does not show an aggressive,homophobic person,"" she said. Mr Stokes, of Castle Eden, Durham, was arrested in the early hours along with Mr Ali, of Bristol, and Mr Hale, of Westbury-on-Trym. The fight took place several hours after England had played a one-day international against the West Indies at the city's County Ground. The trial continues.

Families 'failed' when children die abroad,"James Fifield died in Zante in 2014. His mother said it took three months to be given full details of the cause Families whose loved ones die while on holiday abroad are being failed by the Foreign Office, the head of a group of MPs has said. SNP MP Hannah Bardell, chairwoman of a cross-party group on deaths abroad, said some families had been left to crowdfund to pay for their son or daughter's body to be repatriated. One woman said it took three months to get full details of her son's death. The Foreign Office said its staff ""work hard to assist British people"". It added: ""However, we cannot interfere in another country's legal proceedings, and the British police can only assist in an overseas investigation if the local police invite them to do so."" Hannah Bardell said ""absolutely vital"" services for families were missing Ms Bardell told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that 40 families had so far given evidence to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Deaths Abroad and Consular Services. She said the same experiences had been heard ""time and time again"". ""We do respect the fact that foreign service officers have a very difficult job, but it's very clear that they either don't have the right training or they don't have the right resources,"" she said. ""A single point of contact, repatriation services - and financial support for that - and translation services are absolutely vital."" Allen Johnson's son Will died on holiday in Ibiza in 2008 One man, Allen Johnson - whose son Will died on holiday in Ibiza in 2008 aged 20 - said in his case the post-mortem report was left in Spanish. Ms Bardell said two families she knew of were ""still trying to get funding for documents to be translated"". She added that many others were ""having to get crowdfunded just to get the body home"". Her comments come the week after the parents of teenager Thomas Channon, who fell to his death in Magaluf, told the Victoria Derbyshire programmethey were ""devastated""by the lack of support offered by UK authorities. James Fifield died in 2014 Claire Fifield-Moore's son James died aged 18 after being hit by a drink driver in Zante in 2014. She was informed of the death by two community officers, who said James had fallen off a quad bike. ""They left me the number of the Foreign Office on the top of a newspaper, and that's all they knew,"" she said. ""We managed to contact one of [James's] friends, but none of them were with him at the time [of the death], so it was all speculation."" It was three months until they received confirmation of the cause of death, she said. Claire Fifield-Moore said not knowing the exact cause of death was ""devastating"" ""Not knowing made it so much worse,"" she said. ""You have no idea what's going on. It's such a surreal situation."" She is now calling for change, saying she felt unsupported when having to deal with a variety of issues that followed his death. ""We didn't know about repatriation, about needing to have a solicitor,"" she said. Ms Bardell said it was also wrong that families were not better supported when travelling to the country where their son or daughter had died. ""My families [in her constituency] have had to go out on airplanes where there are hen parties, stag parties,"" she said. Mr Johnson said when he travelled abroad ""it was nightmare to be on plane with holidaymakers"". ""All these young people going on holiday. And you're in disbelief and despair, and a total numbness at what happened,"" he added. At that time he had no official confirmation from the authorities that his son had died, he said, having been informed of what happened by his son's friends. The Foreign Office said: ""Our deepest sympathies go to all families who have lost loved ones abroad. ""We are in regular contact with authorities abroad about their investigations into tragic incidents involving British nationals so that we can keep families informed.""

Calls for doctor's dismissal to stand,"Jack died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest The decision to strike off a doctor over the death of six-year-old Jack Adcock should be allowed to stand, his mother has said. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba is appealing her dismissal for a ""catalogue"" of mistakes in Jack's care in 2011. Nicky Adcock claimed the public will lose trust in the NHS if Dr Bawa-Garba is reinstated. Three judges at the Court of Appeal reserved judgement after hearing a day and a half of submissions. Dr Bawa-Garba said she was ""truly sorry"" and ""apologised wholeheartedly again to Jack's family"" outside court. Nicky Adcock said the decision to dismiss Dr Bawa-Garba should stand Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a known heart condition, died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 after he developed sepsis. A 2015 criminal trial ended with Dr Bawa-Garba's conviction for gross negligence manslaughter. She was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years. It heard Jack, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, died after a ""catalogue"" of errors including missing signs of his fatal infection and mistakenly thinking he was under a do-not-resuscitate order. Dr Bawa-Garba was then suspended by a disciplinary panel. This was challenged by the GMC which won the subsequent case at the High Court, leading to the doctor being struck off. Hadiza Bawa-Garba: Suspension 'was correct decision' New measures to protect doctors after Bawa-Garba case Medics rally behind struck off doctor Now that decision is being reviewed at the Court of Appeal. Dr Bawa-Garba's legal team has been crowdfunded by medics who feel she was made a scapegoat for understaffed hospitals. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba thanked supporters outside court after the hearing finished Thejudges previously heard her removal for a ""one-off mistake"" had robbed the NHS of a ""young and talented"" doctor. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said any other sanction undermined its rules and her manslaughter conviction. Speaking outside court, Mrs Adcock said: ""I don't think the public will trust the NHS if she is reinstated. ""I hope the decision will stand where she will still be struck off and will never be able to work in the UK again."" Dr Bawa-Garba said: ""I apologise wholeheartedly again to Jack's family for my role in the events which led to his death. ""I am truly sorry for this and will live with it for the rest of my life."" Judges told the court the judgment would come ""just as soon as we are able"" but it may not be possible ""within the next few days"".

Doctors to be protected over errors,"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba (R) was struck off following an appeal by the doctors' regulator New measures designed to improve patient safety and protect doctors and nurses when mistakes are made, are to be announced by the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. It comes after concerns were raised following the case of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba,who was struck offafter the death of a six-year-old boy. Mr Hunt said staff should be able to learn from their mistakes. Hundreds of medics also signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba. She was found guilty of mistakes in the care of six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Leicestershire, who died of sepsis in 2011. Followinga government reviewordered by Mr Hunt, new measures are being introduced. These include: the investigation of every hospital death by a medical examiner or coroner data on doctors' performance will allow them to see how they compare to others to help them improve the regulator - the General Medical Council - will no longer be able to appeal against the findings of doctors' disciplinary hearings Professor Norman Williams who conducted the review said that ""a clearer understanding"" of when manslaughter charges should be brought in healthcare ""should lead to fewer criminal investigations"". Professor Williams said criminal investigation should be confined ""to just those rare cases where an individual's performance is so 'truly exceptionally bad' that it requires a criminal sanction"". Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months by a tribunal, but was then removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". But the health secretary says improving patient safety means doctors and other staff must be able to reflect openly and freely when they have made ordinary mistakes, instead of being punished for them. ""When something goes tragically wrong in healthcare, the best apology to grieving families is to guarantee that no-one will experience that same heartache again,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I was deeply concerned about the unintended chilling effect on clinicians' ability to learn from mistakes following recent court rulings... the actions from this authoritative review will help us promise them that the NHS will support them to learn, rather than seek to blame."" Doctors say medicine is about balancing risk - and that mistakes will happen. The British Medical Association, representing doctors, said that it would be monitoring closely how the law was applied in the light of the review's recommendations. BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""If we, as doctors, and the wider health service are to learn from these mistakes and to prevent such tragedies occurring, the NHS needs a dramatic shift away from the current culture of blame."" The Department of Health and Social Care said the changes would mean bereaved families would get more information about the circumstances of their loved ones' death and more data would be shared across the NHS to help prevent avoidable deaths in the future.

Criminalising doctors to be reviewed,"Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off following an appeal Jeremy Hunt has ordered an urgent review of medical malpractice cases following concerns over a recent manslaughter case involving a doctor. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba wasstruck off the medical registerafter she was found guilty of mistakes in the care of a six-year-old boy who died of sepsis. The health secretary says clarity is needed about drawing the line between gross negligence and ordinary errors. Doctors should learn from - not fear - mistakes, he says. The Bawa-Garba case has rocked the medical profession. Medics rally behind struck off doctor Doctor struck off over six-year-old's death More than 800 medics have signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba, saying focusing on one person ignored the part low staffing levels played in the tragedy and striking her off would discourage medics from being open when reviewing mistakes. Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months last June by a tribunal, but she has now been removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". Jack died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""The only way we can reduce mistakes in the NHS is to learn from every single one, and the tragic case of Dr Bawa-Garba raises many important questions about how the health system supports staff to be open and transparent when things go wrong."" The government's rapid review will be led by Prof Sir Norman Williams, former President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and will report back by the end of April 2018. It will look at: Any lessons that need to be learned by the General Medical Council and other professional regulators How learning, openness and transparency can be protected so that mistakes are learned from and not covered up Providing clarity to doctors about where they stand with respect to criminal liability and professional misconduct When six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was admitted to the hospital in February 2011, his sepsis went undiagnosed and led to him suffering a cardiac arrest. The courts heard Dr Bawa-Garba, a paediatrician, committed a ""catalogue"" of errors, including missing signs of his infection and mistakenly thinking Jack was under a do-not-resuscitate order. At the time of the ruling, Jack's mother, Nicola, said: ""We are absolutely elated with the decision. It's what we wanted. ""I know we'll never get Jack back but we have got justice for our little boy."" The Medical Protection Society, which represented Dr Bawa-Garba, said at the time: ""A conviction should not automatically mean that a doctor who has fully remediated and demonstrated insight into their clinical failings is erased."" An online appeal set up by concerned doctors has raised more than Â£320,000 to help pay the legal costs of Dr Bawa-Garba. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the General Medical Council, welcomed the announcement of the government's rapid review.

Ticketmaster to close its resale sites,"Little Mix are among the artists who have protested at the prices charged by secondary ticketing sites Ticketmaster is closing its secondary ticketing websites Seatwave and Get Me In, in a bid to combat touts. The sites, which allow you to offload unwanted tickets, have frequently been exploited by so-called professional sellers who hike up the prices. ""We know that fans are tired of seeing others snap up tickets just to resell for a profit on secondary websites, so we have taken action,"" said Andrew Parsons, head of Ticketmaster UK. The sites will be shut down in October. In their place, people will be allowed to sell tickets directly on Ticketmaster, where a simple click will release tickets back into the market. Unlike the current system, users will only be allowed to charge the original price or less - including any booking fees paid initially. Ticketmaster has also vowed to be transparent about the difference between ""new"" and resold tickets. When selecting seats for a concert, theatre or sporting event, the seat map will show standard tickets in blue and second-hand tickets in pink. Resold tickets will be clearly identified to customers The decision to shut down Seatwave and Get Me In comes a month after the Irish governmentbacked a bill,externalthat would ban the resale of tickets for more than face value. At the same time, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority is conducting an investigation into the secondary market and has said it is considering legal action against the Swiss-based firm Viagogo. Ticketmaster may well have seen the writing on the wall and decided to get out of the market before it became untenable. The move also allows it to steal the thunder of fan-to-fan ticket exchanges like Twickets, which cap resale prices at 10% above face value. Artists like Ed Sheeran and Adele have recently chosen Twickets as official resale partners for their tour - a scenario Ticketmaster will hope to reverse by shedding its association with touts. ""Closing down our secondary sites and creating a ticket exchange on Ticketmaster has always been our long-term plan,"" said Parsons. ""Selling tickets through Ticketmaster is really simple: We do all the hard work and outline the maximum that can be charged for the ticket - and it doesn't cost fans a penny to sell them."" Some of the changes take effect immediately. From Monday (13 August), there will be no new events listed on Get Me In or Seatwave. The sites will close permanently in October in the UK and Ireland, and later in the year for the rest of Europe. However, fans and touts will still be able to sell tickets for a profit on rival services including Viagogo and the eBay-owned Stubhub. TheSociety of Ticket Agents and Retailers,externalwelcomed the ""excellent"" news, as it meant ticket buyers would ""have another safe and trusted place to resell their tickets"". Yet its chief executive, Jonathan Brown, said resale for profit would continue on other marketplaces, ""including those based overseas"". ""The ongoing enforcement work by the Competition and Market Authority and others to ensure compliance with UK legislation is crucial,"" he continued. The news was also welcomed by campaigning groupThe FanFair Alliance,external, who said it had brought ""a genuine transformation of the secondary market... much closer"".

The doctor struck off for honest mistakes," Jack Adcock wasn’t himself when he returned from school. He later started vomiting and had diarrhoea, which continued through the night. In the morning Jack was taken to the GP by his mother, Nicola, and referred directly to Leicester Royal Infirmary’s children’s assessment unit (CAU). Nicola Adcock Less than 12 hours later he was dead. “Losing a child is the most horrendous thing ever. But to lose a child in the way we lost Jack – we should never have lost him,” Mrs Adcock says. Trainee doctor Hadiza Bawa-Garba arrived at work expecting to be on the general paediatrics ward - the ward she’d been on all week. She had only recently returned to work after having her first baby. Before her 13 months’ maternity leave, she had been working in community paediatrics, treating children with chronic illnesses and behavioural problems. Dr Bawa-Garba But when medical staff gathered to discuss the day’s work, they were told someone was needed to cover the CAU – the doctor supposed to be doing it was on a course. And Dr Bawa-Garba volunteered to step in. She also carried the bleep – which alerts the doctor that a patient needs seeing urgently on the wards or in the Accident and Emergency unit, across four floors of the busy Leicester Royal Infirmary – and was required to respond to calls from midwives, other doctors or parents. Soon after Dr Bawa-Garba took over, the bleep went off – a child down in the accident and emergency unit, several floors below, needed urgent attention and she missed the rest of the morning handover. Back in the CAU, Dr Bawa-Garba was asked to see Jack Adcock by the nurse in charge, Sister Theresa Taylor, who was worried he had looked very sick when he had been admitted. She was the only staff nurse that day. Because of staff shortages, two of the three CAU nurses were from an agency and not allowed to perform many nursing procedures. “Jack was really lethargic, very sleepy. He wasn’t really very with it,” says Mrs Adcock. She told medical staff he had been up all night with diarrhoea and sickness. The boy’s hands and feet were cold and had a blue-grey tinge. He also had a cough. “I knew that I had to get a line in him quickly to get some bloods and also give him some fluids to rehydrate him,” says Dr Bawa-Garba. He didn’t flinch when she put his cannula in. Because of a pre-existing heart condition, Jack had been taking enalapril – a drug to control his blood pressure and help pump blood around his body – twice a day. But Dr Bawa-Garba says she didn’t want him to have the enalapril, because he was dehydrated and it might have made his blood pressure drop too much. Because of this, she says, she left it off his drug chart. She then asked for an X-ray to check Jack’s chest. Blood was taken – some was sent down to the labs, while a quicker test was done to measure his blood acidity and lactate levels – the latter being a measure of how much oxygen is reaching the tissues. The tests revealed his blood was too acidic. “A normal pH is 7.34 – but Jack’s was seven and his lactate was also very high. A normal is about two and his was 11, so I knew then he was very unwell,” Dr Bawa-Garba says. She gave him a large boost of fluid – a bolus – to resuscitate him. Her working diagnosis was gastroenteritis and dehydration. But she didn’t consider that Jack might have had a more serious condition. It was a mistake she regrets to this day. Jack had been admitted under the care of Dr Stephen O’Riordan, the consultant who was supposed to be in charge that day – but he hadn’t realised he was on call and had double-booked himself with teaching commitments in Warwick and hadn’t arrived at work. Another consultant based elsewhere in the hospital had said she was available to help and cover him if needed – although she had her own duties. After an hour of being on fluids to rehydrate him, Jack seemed to be responding well. “He was a little more alert and we thought he was getting better,” Mrs Adcock says. Dr Bawa-Garba thought that too. One of the less experienced doctors in the unit had been unable to do Jack’s next blood tests. They had tried but couldn’t get blood, so Dr Bawa-Garba went to do it herself. This time, when Dr Bawa-Garba went to take blood from his finger, Jack resisted, pulling away. “That kind of response, to me, said that he was responding to the bolus,” she says. “Also, the result I got showed that the pH had gone from seven to 7.24. In my mind I’m thinking this is going the right way.” However, not enough blood had been taken to get another lactate measurement. Dr Bawa-Garba looked for Jack’s blood results from the lab. She had fast-tracked them an hour-and-a-half earlier. But when she went to view them on the computer system, it had gone down. The whole hospital was affected. This meant not only that blood test results were delayed, but also that the alert system designed to flag up abnormal results on computer screens was out of action. She asked one of the doctors in her team to chase up the results for her patients, and took on some of that doctor’s tasks. Those tests would have indicated that Jack may have had kidney failure and that he needed antibiotics. By this point, Jack was sitting up in the bed drinking juice. “I automatically thought he was perking up,” says Victor, Jack’s father. Because he had stopped vomiting, Dr Bawa-Garba prescribed some Dioralyte – rehydrating salts. But the fluid he was losing from having diarrhoea had not been documented by his nurse. Dr Bawa-Garba also reviewed Jack’s X-ray, which had been ready for a few hours. Dr Bawa-Garba says no-one had flagged it was available. She says she had been busy with other patients – including a baby with sepsis that needed a lumbar puncture – and this was the first opportunity she had had to review it. The X-ray showed that Jack had a chest infection so she prescribed antibiotics. But Dr Bawa-Garba says she wishes she had given him antibiotics sooner. This was the last time Dr Bawa-Garba treated Jack, who was also being cared for by an agency nurse. The nurse was doing his observations - including his temperature, heart rate and blood pressure - but did not record them regularly. Consultant Dr Stephen O’Riordan arrived at the hospital. “I hadn’t worked with him before, so I introduced myself,” Dr Bawa-Garba says. She then went to chase up Jack’s blood results, which still hadn’t come through – the doctor she had assigned to do it hadn’t managed to get them. Dr Bawa-Garba tried a number of extensions before managing to speak to someone. They read out Jack’s results and she noted them down. She says she was looking out for one particular test result called CRP, which would confirm whether Jack’s illness had been caused by bacteria or a virus. She noted it was 97, far higher than it should have been, so she circled it. But she says she was concentrating so much on the CRP that she failed to register that his creatinine and urea were also high – signalling possible kidney failure. During the afternoon handover, Dr Bawa-Garba told Dr O’Riordan about Jack – his diarrhoea and vomiting, heart condition, and enalapril medication. She says she told him Jack’s lactate level was 11, and mentioned some of the other blood test results. She said she had started him on antibiotics for a chest infection, and asked his advice about the fluids Jack was being given. She says Dr O’Riordan noted down what she said and ordered repeat blood tests. Dr Bawa-Garba says she had assumed he would go to see Jack - based on the description she had given and the fact he had asked for further tests - but he didn’t. By this time, Jack had been moved to ward 28 under the care of a different team. On his way up there, he had been sick again. It was at this point that another failing in Jack’s care occurred. Mrs Adcock says she asked a nurse looking after Jack on that ward if she could give him his enalapril – the medication to regulate his blood pressure. He was due his second dose of the day. She recalls the nurse telling her she’d checked with another doctor on duty. Mrs Adcock says she was told the nurse wouldn’t be able to give the medication to Jack, as it had not been prescribed, but his mother could. So Mrs Adcock gave it to him. The nurse later said she had also asked for a doctor to come to see Jack. “We’d got Toy Story on but he was still knocking his oxygen mask off,” Mrs Adcock says. “I was just saying, ‘Come on sweetheart go to sleep,’ and I was rubbing his face. I’ll never forget – he closed his eyes and I thought something’s not quite right. His tongue, or his lips, looked blue. I ran out of the room, saying, ‘Can someone come and look at Jack?’” Dr Bawa-Garba had been on call for more than 12 hours when an emergency call went out for a patient who had suffered a cardiac arrest on ward 28 and doctors and nurses rushed to help. In the morning, Dr Bawa-Garba had had to intervene to stop doctors from trying to resuscitate a terminally ill boy who had a “do not resuscitate” order. She assumed it was the same boy. What she didn’t know was that Jack had subsequently been moved to the same ward as the boy who had crashed in the morning – ward 28. A terrible confusion was about to follow. “While we’re running up the stairs, all I was thinking is, ‘It’s the child with the do-not-resuscitate again – that someone is trying to resuscitate. This is a mistake,’” she says. When she reached the fourth floor, at least 11 people were already in the side room, she says. Meanwhile, Nicola Adcock was waiting outside the room. In that moment, Dr Bawa-Garba didn’t recognise her. She says: I walk in and say, ‘He’s not for resuscitation,’ because I thought it was the child with the ‘do not resuscitate’ order.” Dr Bawa-Garba says she was then told by another doctor that the patient was not the same boy as earlier – but was Jack Adcock. “I was shocked and I was like, ‘Why is Jack crashing?’” she says. She told the team to continue the resuscitation. “I remember going hysterical and just thinking, you know, ‘Please look after my little boy,’” says Mrs Adcock. “And then I remember somebody taking me back into the room and telling me, ‘Jack needs his mummy.’” At 21:21 the decision was made to stop resuscitation. Jack had died of sepsis. Experts later said the interruption to the resuscitation had not contributed to his death – but he shouldn’t have been given enalapril and he should have been given antibiotics much earlier. At the Adcocks’ home in Glen Parva, a suburb of Leicester, Jack’s sister Ruby has moved into his old room. His has been recreated in the room she vacated. Stars featuring handwritten messages from Jack’s schoolmates, saying how much they will miss him and his cheeky laugh, adorn the navy blue walls of the replica bedroom. “It’s my way of coping,” says Mrs Adcock. She says she has yet to grieve. The investigations, court proceedings, and appeals have taken a toll on the family. I blame Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba for my son’s death and I will never, ever, ever, ever forgive her.” She describes Jack as a “joyful little boy” and says he and his younger sister, Ruby, adored each other. Jack used to love dancing, swimming and going to watch Leicester City football team, says his father, even though he had been in and out of hospital during his short life. “We were season ticket holders but since that happened  [Jack’s death] I haven’t been able to go,” he says. “I can’t face it.” Jack Adcock The night Jack died, Mr and Mrs Adcock were taken into a room off the ward, where they were met by doctors they’d never seen before. “We were told, ‘I’m really sorry but your son’s passed away,” says Mrs Adcock. “It just didn’t sink in.” She remembers them saying he had had pneumonia and an internal bleed. She asked to see her son. The last time she had seen him, he had been asleep and had looked peaceful. “He had no tubes, he had nothing,” she says. This time, “there was blood – I just couldn’t believe it was him, my baby, gone”. Everyone on the ward was crying, she says, including Dr Bawa-Garba, who was sobbing. “Nobody expected Jack would die.” The doctor came over to express her condolences and Mrs Adcock thanked her for looking after Jack. “I wish I could take those words away. I never knew then what I know now,” she says. The following day, Saturday, the family was invited back to the hospital to meet a group of doctors, nurses and managers from the trust to discuss what had happened. Minutes taken by one of Mrs Adcock’s friends from university, whom the family had invited to the meeting, give an indication of what was discussed. The hospital representatives apologised for the boy’s death and said they would investigate. “They said he just wasn’t looked after; he didn’t have the right support; he wasn’t given the right care,” Mrs Adcock says. She wanted to know about the interrupted resuscitation and so they talked about that too. The family was also told that a junior doctor had failed to recognise the severity of Jack’s condition, according to the minutes. The police then arrived – there was to be an investigation after the unexpected death of the child. “I remember being absolutely terrified, thinking, ‘I haven’t done anything, why are the police here?’” Mrs Adcock says. After Jack’s post-mortem examination, two days later, the family was told that he had died of a streptococcal infection and had developed sepsis and they could make plans for his funeral. Jack Adcock “Everything was in place. There was an article going in the paper on the Friday to say when his funeral was going to be,” Mrs Adcock says. But then they were asked to cancel their plans and meet the police at the coroner’s office to discuss an inquest. “As you can imagine at that point, we felt physically sick – the anger raged.  We just could not believe what we were hearing, so automatically we said, ‘So you’re telling us someone’s responsible for our son’s death?’” Mrs Adcock says. There was then a second post-mortem examination in case criminal proceedings were opened. “It took three months to get my little boy back, to be able to lay him to rest,” Mrs Adcock says. Not a day goes past, Dr Bawa-Garba says, when she doesn’t think about the day Jack died. I am sorry for not recognising sepsis and I am sorry for my role in what happened to Jack.” The 41-year-old mother of three says the impact on her and her family has been huge. She has had to move house and unpleasant material was posted on social media. “I had parents from my daughter’s school asking if I was OK because they were getting leaflets in their letterboxes saying that they should sign a petition to say that I should be struck off,” she says. The case attracted a lot of media coverage. “I’m a very private person, but I had my face in the newspaper.” Dr Bawa-Garba had enjoyed an unblemished career before Jack’s death and was well-regarded by her colleagues. Hadiza Bawa-Garba Born in Nigeria, she had wanted to be a doctor since she was about 13 years old, after recovering from malaria. At 16 she moved to the UK to study for her A-levels. After her first degree at Southampton University, she studied medicine at Leicester and set her sights on becoming a paediatrician. Hadiza Bawa-Garba and family “I've been in the UK for more than half my life,” she says. “I love the NHS. I love the fact that people can get access to free medical health and that you can be part of that process.” But that all changed the day she covered for a colleague at the CAU. “The last picture I have of Jack is him sitting up drinking from a beaker, nothing prepared me to see him crash,” she says. “After I realised that we were actually resuscitating Jack, I just couldn’t understand why he had crashed. When the team wanted to stop, I didn’t want to stop - because in my mind I'm thinking he’s not meant to crash,” she says. Afterwards, she went to the nurses’ station and sobbed. “I just couldn’t control myself and I'm not usually a weepy person,” she says. “I just kept thinking, ‘How did that happen? Why did he crash? What went wrong?’” Dr Bawa-Garba recalls the moment that Mrs Adcock came up to her to thank her for her help. “I said to her, ‘I'm really sorry about the outcome – I don't know how this happened,’” she says. Later that night, Dr Bawa-Garba called Dr O’Riordan – the consultant who had arrived in the afternoon, after double-booking himself that day – to tell him about Jack’s death. She went home at 23:00 – some 15 hours after she had started her 12-hour shift – and updated Jack’s notes with what had happened at the resuscitation. The following day, she was back at work at the assessment unit. She knew the hospital was meeting the Adcocks and asked if she could attend. But she says Dr O’Riordan told her that she had to get on with her clinical duties. The consultant then added to the notes that Dr Bawa-Garba had made. He wrote that Dr Bawa-Garba had “not stressed” to him that Jack’s lactate level was 11. On Sunday, struggling to process what had happened, Dr Bawa-Garba phoned Mrs Adcock to say she was sorry for the family’s loss. “I just wanted to reach out to see how mum was holding up because it must be devastating,” she says. The following day, she says, she was admonished by Dr O’Riordan for making that call and told not to have any more contact with the family because an investigation was to be launched. He then told her that they needed to discuss Jack’s death properly because he thought she hadn’t highlighted to him how ill Jack was, she says. He wanted to talk about how things could have been done differently to stop it happening again, she adds. Dr Bawa-Garba had already started to write down her reflections. “When you have a case that has had an impact on you, you write down how you feel and what you would change,” she says. “I made my own action plan about how I would be able to address those things that I wish I had done differently.” On 25 February, a week after Jack’s death, Dr O’Riordan asked Dr Bawa-Garba to meet him in the hospital canteen, rather than the office he shared with other consultants. She was told to list everything that she could have done differently, she says. So she continued that personal reflective process with Dr O’Riordan in the canteen. “I was beating myself up about every single detail and obviously wishing that I had recognised sepsis, so we spoke about that and I was very open and explained everything,” she says. “It contained what I felt I could’ve done better plus some of the things that Dr O’Riordan also felt that I could’ve done better.” Jack died from sepsis.Sepsis is when the immune system overreacts to an infection and attacks the body’s own organs and tissues. According to the UK Sepsis Trust, about 14,000 people die each year because it is not diagnosed or treated early enough. At the meeting, Dr O’Riordan took notes, which he then transferred to what is called a training encounter form, she says. This contained one section for Dr O’Riordan to write on and one for Dr Bawa-Garba to document her learning points and reflections. However, she didn’t agree with all Dr O’Riordan said and didn’t sign the form. Both her reflections and the training encounter form were uploaded to her e-portfolio, an online system used for learning purposes. As soon as the meeting finished, Dr Bawa-Garba says she was sent home by Dr O’Riordan. Dr O’Riordan declined Panorama’s invitation to comment on Dr Bawa-Gaba’s account of the meeting. Recognising her need for further training, the hospital took Dr Bawa-Gaba off the on-call rota and put her on to the paediatric intensive care unit under the supervision of a consultant.There she would see lots of children with sepsis, some of whom would get better then get worse – like Jack, she says. “I was probably slower than I used to be, because I was micromanaging and double-checking everything and second-guessing myself all the time,” she says. Using what she had learned from Jack Adcock’s death, Dr Bawa-Garba says, she helped carry out a sepsis study and formed a junior doctor weekly teaching programme where doctors would discuss “near misses” or incidents when patients had died so they could learn from them. The hospital had carried out its own investigation and Dr Bawa-Garba continued to work there. But five months after Jack’s death, Dr O’Riordan left the Leicester Royal Infirmary and moved to Ireland. Because Jack’s death was unexpected, the hospital conducted an investigation to identify what had gone wrong with the little boy’s care. They produced a report in August 2011 and updated it six months later. It not only pointed to errors made by Dr Bawa-Garba and nursing staff - including Dr Bawa-Garba’s failure to recognise the severity of Jack’s illness - it also found a series of “system failings”. “I think that we let Jack Adcock down - there’s no doubt about that in my mind,” says Andrew Furlong, medical director since 2016 of University Hospitals Leicester, which includes the Leicester Royal Infirmary. Andrew Furlong There were six root causes for Jack’s poor care, the report said, listing 23 recommendations for improvement and 79 actions to minimise the risk of another child dying in such unacceptable circumstances. The recommendations were wide-ranging but included: - Robust processes for helping staff return to work after periods of protracted leave or maternity leave - A dedicated presence of consultants on the children’s assessment unit - New guidelines on the use of agency nurses - Better visual prompts for staff about abnormal blood results “Best practice shows that when you’re trying to identify learning, the way to do that is in an open culture, where people can give evidence without fear of sanction or blame,” Mr Furlong says. Panorama has spoken to doctors who worked in the paediatric department shortly before Jack’s death. None felt able to go on the record. They said doctors and nurses at the hospital had been raising concerns about staffing before Jack’s death. They said consultant cover had been patchy and that factional infighting between consultants had caused problems for trainee doctors - it wasn’t something they could speak out about, they had had to keep their head down. Junior doctors did try to raise their concerns that trainees were being used to plug rota gaps, often at the last minute. The CAU was one of the areas where there was never enough staff, and the hospital recognised that this posed a risk. One doctor said she would pray before she went into work because she was worried something bad would happen. In response, Mr Furlong says that as the only children’s emergency department serving 1.2 million people, the CAU was always busy. “That isn’t unique to this trust, nor was the difficulty in recruiting doctors and nurses, too few were coming out of training nationally, a fact which the NHS locally and nationally is still struggling with. At the start of every shift, the nurses and doctors in charge routinely review staffing levels and move resources to where they are most needed,” he says. After Jack’s death, the police started their own investigation and the Adcocks praise them for the support they have given the family. But they say they heard very little from the hospital. They were sent a copy of the Leicester Royal Infirmary investigation and invited to discuss it, but they didn’t want to. Dr Bawa-Garba In February 2012 – a year after Jack’s death, and just after Dr Bawa-Garba had given birth to her second child – she received a phone call from the police. At first, she thought she had misheard what she was being told. “The officer said, ‘We’re investigating Jack’s death as a possible manslaughter case and we need you to come down to the station,’” she says. She went along thinking it would be a similar process to the hospital investigation. But suddenly she found herself under arrest and being read her rights. Her photograph and fingerprints were taken. During the six-hour interview, all she could think about was her two-week-old daughter who would need breastfeeding. During phone calls home, she could hear the hungry baby crying. The police investigation came to nothing. Seven weeks later, Dr Bawa-Garba was told that no charges were going to be brought against her. More than a year later, in July 2013, Jack’s inquest started at Leicester Town Hall. “We didn’t really know anything until it went to the inquest,” says Mrs Adcock. “We couldn’t speak to anyone – we weren’t really told anything.” It was only then, the Adcocks say, they heard the “true facts” and “listened to the detail” about the errors that Dr Bawa-Garba had made. According to Mrs Adcock, the expert witness at the inquest, Dr Gale Pearson, a paediatric intensive care consultant, stated that if Jack “had been given the right treatment, antibiotics, correct bolus, intensive care, consultant treatment, he would have not died when he died, how he died, the way he died – he may have still been here”. “I think I collapsed, nobody could believe it,” Mrs Adcock says. The inquest was adjourned shortly after Dr Pearson’s expert testimony and the case was referred back to the Crown Prosecution Service, which reviewed its decision to prosecute. The family are clear about who they blame for Jack’s death – Dr Bawa-Garba and one of the nurses who had treated him. If they had done everything they could, the Adcocks say, they would have been devastated but could have said “Thank you,” and walked away. But as Mrs Adcock puts it, “All they did was contribute to my son’s death.” Dr Bawa-Garba continued to work at Leicester Royal Infirmary, but one evening in December 2014, while she was on call on the neonatal unit, she was contacted by her educational supervisor, who asked to meet her. Dr Jonathan Cusack Dr Jonathan Cusack was the head of the unit, so she didn’t think much of it. But, as she sat down, he told her she had been charged with manslaughter. “I don’t think I registered because I said, ‘Er, OK – but I need to finish my shift and I have teaching tomorrow.’ I was supposed to be teaching some medical students the next day. He said, ‘No, you need to go home, you have been charged with manslaughter.’” Dr Bawa-Garba passed her bleep on to another doctor and went home, her head spinning with thoughts about what would happen to her family if she were to be convicted of manslaughter and sent to prison. As the police were investigating Jack Adcock’s death, other failings in patient care across Leicestershire were emerging. Following the Mid Staffs scandal – where hundreds of patients were exposed to “appalling” levels of care at Stafford Hospital – a new measure to help hospitals spot problems was introduced. The Summary Hospital-Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI) uses adjusted data from individual trusts to flag up a higher-than-expected number of deaths. It acts as an early warning system highlighting a need for further investigation. In 2013, Leicester GPs had started to become concerned about the University Hospitals of Leicester Trust’s SHMI. It had been higher than it should have been since the SHMI was introduced in 2010. After deliberating with the Trust, they asked Dr Ron Hsu, then a public health consultant and now associate professor at the University of Leicester, to investigate further. He met representatives from the local Clinical Commissioning Groups, the hospital and NHS England to devise and agree a plan. Teams of doctors and nurses were tasked with going through the records of patients who had either unexpectedly died in hospital or died within 30 days of leaving between 1 April 2012 and 31 March 2013. It didn’t look at paediatrics. They focused on a sample that would help them identify systematic clinical issues. This is where you learn the most, Dr Hsu says. In large rooms set aside in the hospital, the teams pored over patients' notes looking at the kind of care they were receiving and identifying things they thought had gone wrong. The bar was set high – a team of doctors or nurses had to be unanimous before they agreed a patient had received poor care, Dr Hsu says. When Dr Hsu came to tally the results, he did not believe what he saw. “It was shocking. Based on what I read I was expecting around 10% of patients to have received unacceptable care,” he says. But in fact nearly a quarter of patients in the report had received “unacceptable care” – serious errors had been made that would have increased the risk of harm. In over half, there were “significant lessons to learn” – aspects of care that could be done better. It included issues with “do not resuscitate” orders, delayed antibiotics, failure to detect serious illness despite multiple clinical signs, unexpected deterioration, medication errors, and IT failures. The problems ran across all health care in Leicestershire and Rutland, but the “vast majority” of lessons came from the hospital. “The issues were obviously longstanding and the consultants and nurses working in the hospital were not necessarily surprised by what we were finding,” says Dr Geth Jenkins, a former GP in Earl Shilton and a member of the team that carried out the review. Dr Hsu asked to meet the medical directors of the Trust. But at a meeting between the local clinical commissioning groups, hospitals, community organisations and NHS England to discuss the findings, the discussion soon turned from how to fix the problems to how to get the message out, Dr Hsu says. “They were concerned about their reputation,” he says. That December he was asked to see officials from NHS England. “They were concerned about the abruptness of the presentation, they would like it softened, as it were, maybe made user-friendly,” he says. Later that month, he says he received a list of 50 changes – mostly relating to the colour and presentation of the report and the size of the charts. Then, the following February, he received another raft of changes. Dr Hsu says he’s been around long enough to know if reports don’t work out well for someone, people have ways of of ensuring that the report doesn’t really get anywhere. “They were worried that people will lose faith in the health services,” he says. “We were at the time, the fifth or the sixth largest NHS trust in England and it’s a trust that whatever happens to it, you couldn’t ignore.” Dr Jenkins says: It was clear NHS England wanted the report to go away.” The University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust was not the worst, neither was it the best, he adds. “If they found these kinds of issues when the Trust’s SHMI was high but not that high, what would they find with other hospitals that had higher ones?"" he asks. Nine months after Dr Hsu submitted his report, it was posted on the Trust website. A summary version was produced for the press and the public. The media were carefully managed, Dr Hsu says. “It took ages for the conclusions to become public,” says Dr Orest Mulka, a former GP in Measham, and one of the reviewers. “And when I discovered that the media, including the BBC, had portrayed them as relating to the care of terminally ill patients receiving palliative care, I thought this was completely untrue. Most of the patients who died were emergency admissions who were not expected to do so.” Mr Furlong says the Trust was the first to use this review method and now others are using similar techniques to look at what can be learned from patients who have died. The hospital appointed Dr Ian Sturgess to consider improvements in the emergency sector. But some local GPs were frustrated and thought there was a resistance to change and a reluctance to talk openly about the problems. In October 2014 they sent a letter sent to former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, warning of “broken systems serving patients and carers in our area”. “Every week we receive reports from our constituent GPs informing us of incidents of distressing medical and nursing care that patients are being exposed to at Leicester Royal Infirmary,” the letter said. The GPs went on to say that in their view the hospital was “potentially on a par with Mid Staffordshire Hospital”. It’s a description Mr Furlong rejects. Far from ignoring problems, he says, the Trust went looking for them. “In the Mid Staffs enquiry they found that there had been hundreds of avoidable deaths, the reviewers drew no such conclusion in this review,” he says. NHS England declined to comment to the BBC. Mr Furlong says that improvements have been made and that the review has now been repeated, with results due for publication in September. While the review cannot be extrapolated to all admissions, both Dr Mulka and Dr Jenkins see parallels in what they found with the care of Jack Adcock. “The issues were all laid bare - poor staffing levels; communication problems and poor handovers; IT systems not working; no senior staff on duty, with juniors left to do everything,"" Dr Jenkins says. ""They all walked into a toxic environment that day,"" he adds. On 5 October 2015, Dr Bawa-Garba found herself in the dock in Nottingham Crown Court, along with two other defendants - nurses Theresa Taylor and Isabel Amaro. The cells below were a constant reminder of what might happen to her. The three pleaded not guilty to the charge of manslaughter by gross negligence at the start of what was to be a four-week trial. “I remember sitting there and listening to their account of my actions and I felt like a criminal,” says Dr Bawa-Garba. The case attracted a lot of media attention. Dr Bawa-Garba would travel from her home in Leicester up to Nottingham. “I remember vividly one time we were sitting on the train and I was in The Metro paper. My picture was there and the passenger sitting opposite me kept looking at the paper and looking at me and looking up,” she says. Dr Bawa-Garba on her way to court Several staff from the hospital were witnesses for the prosecution and barristers representing the other defendants each cross-examined Dr Bawa-Garba. It was the same for CAU ward sister Theresa Taylor. Isabel Amaro didn’t give evidence. The jurors were instructed to decide whether the three defendants were guilty of unlawfully killing Jack Adcock, basing this decision exclusively on the evidence put before them. Aspects of the trial have caused consternation among the medical profession. “Doctors became particularly concerned when they heard about all of the systems failings at the hospital and felt these weren’t heard fully in court,” says Dr Cusack, Dr Bawa-Garba’s educational supervisor, who attended parts of the trial. The hospital’s own investigation, which flagged up all the contributory factors and failings that had led to Jack’s death, wasn’t put before the jury, he says. Not all failings were heard, he says. A number of other aspects of the case have also given rise to controversy. On the fifth day of the trial, Dr Stephen O’Riordan, the consultant who was meant to be on duty the day Jack died, took the stand. As the consultant, he had ultimate responsibility for the patients admitted on the CAU that day. Attached to his witness statement was the training encounter form containing details of his discussion with Dr Bawa-Garba in the canteen eight days after Jack’s death - the form Dr Bawa-Garba refused to sign. Dr O’Riordan told the court that he recalled the pH was 7.08 and “the lactate was high” saying he couldn’t remember if Dr Bawa-Garba had told him the actual value at their afternoon handover, before Jack died. He said: At no time was this patient highlighted to me as urgent, unwell, septic or that I needed to see him.” The point of a handover, he said, was the passing of information from one junior doctor to another - the consultant’s role was supervisory to ensure the information was transferred. Some doctors, however, contest this saying that the handover is to provide an opportunity for consultants to decide how best to manage patients, and to pick up on points that trainees have failed to flag. “Doctors work in teams and the consultant is in charge of that team. While doctors are responsible for their actions, many feel Dr Bawa-Garba was let down by the consultant on call both on the day that Jack died and subsequently,” Dr Cusack says. The role of the enalapril, the drug given to regulate Jack Adcock’s blood pressure, has also generated debate. Some doctors have expressed concern that its role in Jack’s cardiac arrest has been underplayed. Mrs Adcock says she feels that these doctors are blaming her for her son’s death. At the coroner’s inquest in August 2014, Dr O’Riordan’s barrister suggested that enalapril had been a significant factor. But the coroner, Mrs Catherine Mason, dismissed this idea. “I have no evidence of that at all,” she said. There was nothing in the report by Dr David O’Neill, the pathologist, or from toxicology, that suggested it played a role, she said. She then repeated the point, saying that there was “no evidence that the enalapril was incorrect or caused or contributed to his death”. Measurements of the levels of enalapril in Jack’s blood were not taken as they were thought not to be useful. At the criminal trial, experts agreed that Jack shouldn’t have been given the drug in the condition he was in, though all accepted that Mrs Adcock had behaved perfectly responsibly by giving it to him. They didn’t agree on how much it had affected him, though. Dr O’Neill said whether or not enalapril played a role was beyond his expertise. But when asked if it was a “significant factor” in Jack’s rapid deterioration, he said this was “consistent with the clinical history”. His post-mortem results could not confirm or refute it. The jury also heard from Dr Simon Nadel, a paediatric intensive care consultant in London, who thought enalapril had aggravated Jack Adcock’s condition, but wasn’t the cause of death. Another prosecution expert agreed. Dr Nadel said the little boy was “well on down the slippery slope by then” and had a “barn door” case of sepsis. This was the most important cause of his death, he said. Dr Bawa-Garba’s defence expert, however, thought the signs of sepsis were “more subtle”. After two weeks, it was Dr Bawa-Garba’s turn to give evidence. Mr Andrew Thomas QC, for the prosecution, told Dr Bawa-Garba that no-one was suggesting that she deliberately set out to harm Jack Adcock. What was at stake was whether she fell below the standard of a reasonably competent junior doctor. He pressed Dr Bawa-Garba on the reflection she did after Jack’s death. “List for us, please, all of the mistakes,” Mr Thomas said. “After this case happened, I reflected on my practice and this can be found in my e-portfolio, and I listed deficiencies that I felt were in the care that I provided on that day,” Dr Bawa-Garba replied. One of them, she said, was her failure to register warning signs in the blood tests. Mr Thomas told her to pause as people were going to write the list down. He then pressed her further and one by one, she listed how she felt she should have done better. “I wish that I had been clearer in my communication with the consultant,” she said “That's two. Keep going,” Mr Thomas said. “When I reassessed Jack, I was falsely reassured because he was alert, drinking from a beaker, responding to voice, pushing his mask away because he didn't want it on his face,” she replied. She added: “I should not have relied on the nurses to get back to me with the clinical deterioration as I normally do.” She should have looked at the nursing chart, she said. “That’s three. Number four?” “I underestimated the severity of his illness,” Dr Bawa-Garba said. “Number five?” “On the reflection I did following this incident, those were the points that I looked at,” she said. The next day was spent exploring all the points in detail. Dr Bawa-Garba continued to describe where she should have done better. Dr Cusack says the use of her reflections made by the prosecution has made doctors fearful about admitting their errors. “All doctors are expect to regularly reflect honestly and openly on their practice to improve patient care,” he says. At the end of the trial, the judge summed up the case to the jury. The prosecution relied on the fact she ignored “obvious clinical findings and symptoms”; did not review Jack’s X-ray and give antibiotics early enough; failed to obtain the morning blood test results early enough and act on the abnormalities they showed; and failed to make proper clinical notes. The judge told the jury they could only convict the health professionals in front of them if they were negligent and that their negligence significantly contributed to Jack’s death or its timing. The negligence had to be gross or severe, he said - what they did or didn’t do had to be truly, exceptionally bad. He said they should set aside any criticisms or feelings towards others involved in Jack’s care. They had to consider the circumstances within which the defendants were working when considering if they were guilty. Dr Bawa-Garba in police custody On 4 November 2015, the jury found Dr Bawa-Garba guilty. She was led away in handcuffs to a cell while her team worked out her bail conditions. “I sat in that small room and prayed,” she says. Then she asked for a pen to write. After initially being denied one, in case she harmed herself, she was given a pen outside the cell. “I remember writing and writing until the ink ran out in the pen,” she says. “I had two very young children - my oldest is severely autistic and goes to a special needs school. So I made plans that if I was to go to prison he would have to go out and live with my mother in Nigeria.” Nicola and Victor Adcock outside court For the Adcocks it was the day they had been waiting for. “For a split second you think, ‘Yes, we’ve got justice for our son’s death,’” says Mrs Adcock. Dr Bawa-Garba spent the next six weeks trying to plan for every scenario. She returned to court in December for sentencing. She had brought a rucksack with her in case she was sent to prison. “I remember on the morning of the sentencing telling my parents that I didn’t want them there in the court in Nottingham,” she says. I didn’t want my dad to see me being taken away in handcuffs. But he just started sobbing on that morning because I wouldn’t let him come to court with me.” Dr Bawa-Garba was given a two-year suspended sentence. Nurse Isabel Amaro received the same sentence. Ward sister Theresa Taylor had been found not guilty. Dr Bawa Garba applied for leave to appeal against her conviction, but this was denied in November 2016. Pulse At the heart of this story is the tragic death of a much-loved little boy and the loss felt by the family. But there’s been a much wider impact too. In 2017, the General Medical Council’s tribunal service suspended Dr Bawa-Garba for a year. They said that while her actions fell “far below the standards expected of a competent doctor”, they had taken into account other factors. These included that fact she had learnt from her errors; had an unblemished record before and after Jack Adcock’s death; and the system failures at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. The tribunal’s decision angered Mrs Adcock. “How can somebody make that many mistakes, be found guilty by a jury and be able to practise again? It doesn’t give the public any faith in the NHS,” she says. If you walked into a hospital and saw that doctor, would you be happy for her to treat your child?” So Mrs Adcock approached the GMC to see if she could appeal. She set up an online petition, with thousands of people pledging support. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC, says that after receiving legal advice the GMC applied to the High Court to overturn the decision made by its own tribunal. He denies being influenced by the Adcocks’ petition, and says the GMC acted out of the need to protect public confidence in the profession, given the seriousness of the conviction. Charlie Massey Dr Bawa-Garba was struck off in January 2018, meaning that she could no longer practise medicine in the UK. “The best way to protect patients is by supporting doctors. But we are also a regulator, and sometimes we have to make tough and unpopular decisions,” Charlie Massey says. The decision has certainly been unpopular among the medical profession. Dr Bawa-Garba’s striking off caused outrage, and led to allegations that she had become a scapegoat for a failing and unsafe NHS. A social media storm ensued, accompanied by the hashtag “#IamHadiza”, with doctors wearing T-shirts and badges in her support. One said: An overworked and under-supported doctor was thrown under the bus by the GMC.” “Drs working flat out in a broken and unsafe system,” said another. “Huge solidarity with this doctor who could be any one of us NHS doctors working in an overstretched, purposefully underfunded and dangerously understaffed service,” added another. For Dr Hsu, the outcry from around the country suggested that what he had seen at Leicester was widespread across the NHS. A crowdfunding campaign also got under way to enable Dr Bawa-Garba get another legal opinion. It raised over £360,000 in about a month with contributions from around 180 countries. Dr Chris Day, a junior doctor and one of the people behind the crowdfunding, says he was overwhelmed by the response. “I think people want to know how it was possible that a junior doctor could get convicted for gross negligence manslaughter, going about her duties as a junior doctor - and when there were so many systemic factors at play,” he says. Dr Chris Day After Dr Bawa-Garba was struck off, The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, an organisation that aims to promote diversity and equality, has expressed concerns that healthcare workers from BAME groups are disproportionately referred to their respective regulators. They have written to the GMC. Indeed, one official review concluded that BAME groups are also disproportionately prosecuted for gross negligence manslaughter - although it only looked at a small number of cases. The GMC’s Charlie Massey says he understands these concerns. He says that nearly twice as many black and minority ethnic doctors are referred to the GMC by their employer than white doctors. “And that's important, because the vast majority of referrals that come to us from employers, do result in investigations, whereas it’s a minority of complaints that are made to us by the public,” he says.  A review is underway to look at the disproportionate referral rate. Others in the medical profession have found different ways of registering a protest. One group of doctors tore up their GMC registration certificates in front of its headquarters in London and others took themselves off the register completely. Doctors protesting in Scotland with the politician, Anas Sarwar Dr Peter Wilmshurst, a Midlands-based cardiologist, wrote to the GMC to ask them to investigate him. All doctors make mistakes and that is understandably scary for patients, he says. “I’ve made clinical mistakes including delayed diagnosis and errors in treatment. Some sick patients died. I suspect that many would have died anyway but in some cases my errors are likely to have contributed to poor outcomes and some patient deaths,” he says. “I therefore feel obliged to ask the GMC to investigate my clinical practice over the last 40 years to see whether I should be struck off the medical register.” But Mrs Adcock says the doctors are mistaken in their interpretation of what happened. “The reason the doctors are doing what they’re doing, they’re scared for themselves. I understand that because they’re thinking if we make an honest mistake we’re going to be charged. That isn’t the case. They need to look at the number of errors that doctor made on the day for the judge to say ‘truly exceptionally bad’,” she says. The Adcocks In 2013, Professor Don Berwick MD, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement in the US, was asked by the then prime minister, David Cameron, to advise about how to improve patient safety in the NHS following the Mid Staffs scandal. His report made a raft of recommendations including moving away from blaming an individual to looking to learn from errors. “We said if there’s fear in the system people are frightened about identifying hazards, about speaking up when they make a mistake about speaking up when something goes wrong then how could it ever get safer?” he says. Dr Don Berwick “You could fire everybody, punish everybody and put in an entirely new workforce, you will have the same injuries and the same errors occur again unless you’ve actually changed the systems of work,” he adds. He says that when there’s been a serious tragedy families are understandably angry. “We have to help them understand what happened, to be open about what happened, to apologise for what happened,” he says. But he says he has sympathy for Dr Bawa-Garba. “Even though she made mistakes she was trapped - she was trapped in a set of circumstances which set her up for failure.” Dr Bawa-Garba Dr Bawa-Garba has been on a long journey. The story began in an overstretched hospital in February 2011 when she was 34. She was charged with manslaughter in December 2014 and convicted in November the following year. She was struck off the medical register in January this year. And on Monday she was reinstated to the medical register by the Court of Appeal. The judges ruled that Dr Bawa-Garba's actions had been neither deliberate or reckless and she should not have been struck off. The GMC has accepted the judgement. “The lessons that I’ve learnt will live with me forever. I welcome the verdict because for me that’s an opportunity to do something that I’ve dedicated my life to doing, which is medicine. But I wanted to pay tribute and remember Jack Adcock, a wonderful little boy who started this story,” Dr Bawa-Garba said. “My hope is that lessons learnt from this case will translate into better working conditions for junior doctors, better recognition of sepsis, and factors in place that will improve patient safety.” Built with Shorthand"
Toddler-attack dog owners facing jailThe pit bull-type dog was shot dead by police after savaging an 18-month-old girl in a playground.Kent,"The family of the mauled toddler said after the attack it had ruined their lives A couple are facing jail after their pit bull terrier-type dog mauled and severely injured an 18-month-old girl. Michael Thornton, 27, and Hayley Eldridge, 29, from Chatham, Kent, pleaded guilty at Maidstone Crown Court to owning a dog that was dangerously out of control in a public place. A police marksman shot the dog after it attacked Viktoria Resetjnova in a playground on 4 April 2017. The couple will be sentenced on 24 September. They had allowed a 15-year-old girl to walk the dog, which was a breed banned under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Dogs are banned from the play area The animal, called Max, attacked Viktoria, who had been playing with her older sister on the Jenkins Dale estate in the town. She was seriously injured in the attack and faces years of surgery on her scalp, which was ripped open, according to court documents. The pair had owned the white-and-tan dog for only about a week, the documents said, after rehoming what was advertised as a Staffordshire bull terrier cross-breed. The court was also told that Thornton and Eldridge had given cannabis to the teenager, who cannot be named, as payment for walking the animal. At the time of the attack Viktoria's parents said in a statement: ""The incident has ruined our lives and the lives of our two children."" Thornton and Eldridge have been bailed ahead of sentencing at the same court. Judge David Griffiths-Jones QC warned them they faced a potential jail term.

Spain festival collapse injures hundreds,"This video can not be played It is not yet clear what caused the platform to collapse More than 300 people have been injured, five seriously, after a section of wooden platform collapsed at an urban sports and music festival in Spain. It had been packed with people watching a rap artist at the two-day O MarisquiÃ±o event in the north-west city of Vigo, in Galicia. Police confirmed that there were no known fatalities. Witnesses reported scenes of panic as people - many of them teenagers - tried to scramble to safety. Some fell into the sea. Personal effects such as mobile phones and handbags were left scattered on the ground. Several emergency teams attended to the injured, and divers were sent into the sea to check that no-one was trapped beneath the structure. Allow Twitter content?

The incident happened shortly before midnight on Sunday as a crowd was listening to the Majorcan rap artist Rels B. According to eyewitnesses, the wooden platform gave way during the first song of the concert as Rels B, who had just started his performance, told the crowd to jump, local media report. ""The floor [of the platform] dropped like a lift. It was a matter of five seconds,""Aitana Alonso told a local newspaper,external.  ""It broke and we all fell. People fell on me. I had trouble getting out. I was trying to get out and skidded, my foot got stuck, in the water. I got it out. A boy gave me his hand and I got out. I felt paralysed and [then] I left. There was a girl with blood on her head."" It is not yet clear why the platform collapsed Earlier, the regional health minister, Jesus Vazquez Almuina, told local radio about the nature of the injuries people suffered. ""These are provisional figures, patients are still being evaluated... The vast majority are light injuries for bruises. There are five hospitalisations, mainly broken bones and some head injuries,"" he told local radio. In a tweet (in Spanish),Rels B wished ""strength"" to the injured,externaland advised anyone worried about friends or relatives to contact an emergency information point set up by festival organisers. The mayor of the city, Abel Caballero, has said there will be an investigation into the causes of the incident. It is not yet clear whether the platform collapsed because there were too many people on it, or because the structure itself was weak, or whether other factors were involved. O MarisquiÃ±o is a free festival taking place outdoors in Vigo in August, attended by some 160,000 visitors. It features various cultural activities, including concerts and gastronomy, and some 10 sports competitions - including skateboarding and mountain biking - over a three-day period.

Lindsay Lohan 'sorry' for Me Too comments,"Lindsay Lohan has apologised for comments she made about the Me Too movement, where she said women who speak up about sexual harassment ""look weak"". The actress said: ""I would like to unreservedly apologise for any hurt and distress caused by a quote in a recent interview."" She had toldThe Times,externalthat some women go to the police ""for the attention."" The Me Too campaign is a movement against sexual assault. It started following allegations of sexual harassment made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein. In her original interview, Lindsay Lohan had said that she'd not had negative experiences in Hollywood when it came to sexual harassment. Lindsay has apologised ""for any pain I may have caused"" ""I can't speak on something I didn't live, right? Look, I am very supportive of women,"" she said. ""Everyone goes through their own experiences in their own ways."" She added: ""You make it a real thing by making it a police report. ""I'm going to really hate myself for saying this, but I think by women speaking against all these things, it makes them look weak when they are very strong women."" Allegations against Harvey Weinstein started the Me Too movement Lindsay Lohan has since toldPeople,external: ""The quote solely related to my hope that a handful of false testimonies out of a tsunami of heroic voices do not serve to dilute the importance of the #MeToo movement, and all of us who champion it. ""However, I have since learned how statements like mine are seen as hurtful, which was never my intent. I'm sorry for any pain I may have caused.

How Ed Sheeran is tackling touts,"Ed Sheeran has taken an aggressive stance against touts by cancelling more than 10,000 tickets for his upcoming stadium tour. After the tour went on sale, the star's team identified purchases by known touts and revoked their tickets. Any tickets listed for re-sale on sites like Viagogo were also cancelled. Fans who'd bought from those sites - often at vastly inflated prices - were given assistance in claiming refunds and getting genuine tickets. So far, more than Â£240,000 has been returned to fans who inadvertently bought invalid tickets. ""We're achieving exactly what Ed wanted, which is 'we want you to come in and pay this [fixed] price,'"" said Stuart Galbraith of concert promoters Kilimanjaro Live. A further 500 tickets are going to be cancelled this week, ahead of Sheeran's first night at Manchester's Etihad Stadium, he added. Allow YouTube content?

Sheeran's team decided to pursue touts after hundreds of tickets for a Teenage Cancer Trust gig were snapped up and sold for profit last March. He imposed strict conditions on his 18-date stadium tour, including: Names printed on tickets, with ID required at the door A maximum of four tickets per customer Tickets listed for resale to be cancelled Any tickets bought by a ""business or trader""  to be cancelled In addition, the on-sale date was a Saturday - rather than the traditional Friday - to make sure genuine fans had the greatest possible chance of being online. Sheeran also partnered withTwickets,external- a site which allows fans to swap tickets at face value or less, in order to protect fans from the ""unethical practices"" of touts. Galbraith negotiated with ticket resellers Get Me In, Seatwave and StubHub to make sure they wouldn't list tickets for the tour - in some cases, using the threat of prosecution under the Consumer Rights Act to reinforce his point. ""The only agency which listed against our wishes and ignored all our correspondence was Viagogo,"" said Galbraith. Once tickets had been sold, the promoters ""very laboriously"" went through all the transactions and ""identified known touts and multiple purchases"". Those tickets, and any listed on sites like Viagogo were immediately invalidated. The woman taking on Viagogo Ticket resellers 'misleading' consumers ""We refunded everybody even though we know they're power sellers and touts, so we can't be accused of taking double income off a single ticket,"" said Galbraith. When the tour launches, anyone who turns up unaware their ticket has been cancelled will be met by a customer care team, he added. ""We'll have teams that say, 'your ticket is invalid' and it'll be stamped invalid. That's important because it will enable them to go back to Viagogo and claim a refund. ""What we'll also then do is... send them to the next window and sell them a ticket at face value."" Arctic Monkeys have also been battling touts on their upcoming UK tour He added: ""We genuinely hope we turn away as few people as possible. Because at the end of the day, even the people who've bought in the secondary market, as far as Ed is concerned, are still his [fans]."" At the time of writing, Viagogo was still offering tickets to the tour, with prices in excess of Â£400, compared to a face value of between Â£49 and Â£88. Sheeran's ticketing system is not a first - Glastonbury and the West End musical Hamilton operate similar policies - but no-one has attempted it for a large-scale tour before. It was conceived with the help of theFanFair Alliance,external, which lobbies against the ""black market"" in concert tickets, and has already been mimicked by the Arctic Monkeys for their upcoming UK tour. Their manager, Ian McAndrew, said he and the band had grown tired of fans being ""misled, confused and, I believe, fraudulently led to spend large sums of money on tickets, even when tickets are actually still available"" at face value. In total, the band sold 190,000 tickets with only a small percentage appearing on secondary resale sites. Again, only Viagogo refused a request not to list the tickets. The Swiss-based site iscurrently facing legal actionover its failure to comply with consumer protection laws. Asked for a response to this story, Viagogo directed the BBC to theFAQ section,externalof its website, where it protests against concert promoters who deny entry to fans using resold tickets. ""These types of entry restrictions are highly unfair and in our view, unenforceable and illegal,"" it says.

Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba is appealing her dismissal for a ""catalogue"" of mistakes in Jack's care in 2011. Nicky Adcock claimed the public will lose trust in the NHS if Dr Bawa-Garba is reinstated. Three judges at the Court of Appeal reserved judgement after hearing a day and a half of submissions. Dr Bawa-Garba said she was ""truly sorry"" and ""apologised wholeheartedly again to Jack's family"" outside court. Nicky Adcock said the decision to dismiss Dr Bawa-Garba should stand Jack, who had Down's syndrome and a known heart condition, died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 after he developed sepsis. A 2015 criminal trial ended with Dr Bawa-Garba's conviction for gross negligence manslaughter. She was sentenced to two years in prison suspended for two years. It heard Jack, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, died after a ""catalogue"" of errors including missing signs of his fatal infection and mistakenly thinking he was under a do-not-resuscitate order. Dr Bawa-Garba was then suspended by a disciplinary panel. This was challenged by the GMC which won the subsequent case at the High Court, leading to the doctor being struck off. Hadiza Bawa-Garba: Suspension 'was correct decision' New measures to protect doctors after Bawa-Garba case Medics rally behind struck off doctor Now that decision is being reviewed at the Court of Appeal. Dr Bawa-Garba's legal team has been crowdfunded by medics who feel she was made a scapegoat for understaffed hospitals. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba thanked supporters outside court after the hearing finished Thejudges previously heard her removal for a ""one-off mistake"" had robbed the NHS of a ""young and talented"" doctor. Lawyers for the General Medical Council said any other sanction undermined its rules and her manslaughter conviction. Speaking outside court, Mrs Adcock said: ""I don't think the public will trust the NHS if she is reinstated. ""I hope the decision will stand where she will still be struck off and will never be able to work in the UK again."" Dr Bawa-Garba said: ""I apologise wholeheartedly again to Jack's family for my role in the events which led to his death. ""I am truly sorry for this and will live with it for the rest of my life."" Judges told the court the judgment would come ""just as soon as we are able"" but it may not be possible ""within the next few days"".

Don't choose Viagogo - minister,"A minister has told consumers not to use Viagogo, one of the big four secondary ticket resellers. Digital Minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 live that if fans had to use a secondary site to buy tickets, ""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards to investigate. The ASA says Viagogo has been breaking UK advertising rules by failing to make additional fees clear. ""Viagogo continues to mislead consumers by not being upfront and clear about additional booking fees and delivery charges that are added at the end of the booking process,"" said the ASA. It has now handed the case over to National Trading Standards, which will undertake any necessary enforcement against Viagogo. ""We have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,"" said a trading standards spokesman. It has the power to prosecute firms for breaching ASA rulings, with penalties including fines or even closing offending firms. Geneva-based Viagogo was one of four ticket brokers subject to ASA action in March. The advertising watchdog saidViagogo had agreed to make compulsory fees ""sufficiently clear""by 26 May, but had failed to do so. The other three big resellers - StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn - were also subject to the action against ""drip pricing"", where VAT, booking and delivery fees were added at the end of the booking process. The ASA has received 23 complaints about Viagogo from groups including campaigners Fanfair Alliance, and concert promoters Festival Republic and Kilimanjaro Live. This video can not be played Digital minister warns consumers not to use Viagogo Kilimanjaro Live is promoting Ed Sheeran's upcoming UK stadium tour. Last week more than 10,000 tickets for that tour were cancelled,in an attempt to encourage fairer prices. Stuart Galbraith, of Kilimanjaro Live, said he negotiated with GetMeIn, Seatwave and StubHub to ensure they would not resell tickets for the tour. ""The only agency which listed against our wishes and ignored all our correspondence was Viagogo,"" he said. ""We're achieving exactly what Ed wanted, which is 'we want you to come in and pay this [fixed] price'."" Ed Sheeran performs at Radio 1's Biggest Weekend in Swansea last Saturday Reg Walker of the consultancy Iridium pointed out that Viagogo was no longer based in Britain and ""seems to regard UK consumer protection legislation as a minor inconvenience"". ""It was also claiming to be an official site on Google paid advertisements and that again by the Advertising Standard Authority was deemed to be a breach of the code, so there is a long history here of Viagogo being non-compliant,"" he told 5 live. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority saidViagogo would face legal actionafter failing to make changes it had demanded. Its rivals StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave had agreed to provide better information about the tickets sold on their sites. They must warn if buyers risk being denied entry, the exact seats they will get and who was selling the tickets. However, the consumer watchdog said Viagogo had failed to give the same undertakings. Viagogo has not responded to a BBC request for comment. Suzy Barnes, from Bristol, followed a Facebook ad to what looked like an official ticket site for the O2 to buy Pearl Jam tickets, spending about Â£1,000 for four seats. ""I received a notification from Viagogo to say I had bought tickets - the transaction was in Czech currency. I went to the O2 website and then discovered the tickets didn't even go on sale for another week. When they did they were Â£60 each,"" she says. ""Viagogo has not responded to my questions about how tickets could have been presented for sale before they had even been released. ""I feel I have been massively scammed out of Â£1,000 and there seems no way to challenge this or get my money back.""

Doctors to be protected over medical errors,"Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba (R) was struck off following an appeal by the doctors' regulator New measures designed to improve patient safety and protect doctors and nurses when mistakes are made, are to be announced by the Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. It comes after concerns were raised following the case of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba,who was struck offafter the death of a six-year-old boy. Mr Hunt said staff should be able to learn from their mistakes. Hundreds of medics also signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba. She was found guilty of mistakes in the care of six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Leicestershire, who died of sepsis in 2011. Followinga government reviewordered by Mr Hunt, new measures are being introduced. These include: the investigation of every hospital death by a medical examiner or coroner data on doctors' performance will allow them to see how they compare to others to help them improve the regulator - the General Medical Council - will no longer be able to appeal against the findings of doctors' disciplinary hearings Professor Norman Williams who conducted the review said that ""a clearer understanding"" of when manslaughter charges should be brought in healthcare ""should lead to fewer criminal investigations"". Professor Williams said criminal investigation should be confined ""to just those rare cases where an individual's performance is so 'truly exceptionally bad' that it requires a criminal sanction"". Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months by a tribunal, but was then removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". But the health secretary says improving patient safety means doctors and other staff must be able to reflect openly and freely when they have made ordinary mistakes, instead of being punished for them. ""When something goes tragically wrong in healthcare, the best apology to grieving families is to guarantee that no-one will experience that same heartache again,"" Mr Hunt said. ""I was deeply concerned about the unintended chilling effect on clinicians' ability to learn from mistakes following recent court rulings... the actions from this authoritative review will help us promise them that the NHS will support them to learn, rather than seek to blame."" Doctors say medicine is about balancing risk - and that mistakes will happen. The British Medical Association, representing doctors, said that it would be monitoring closely how the law was applied in the light of the review's recommendations. BMA council chair Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ""If we, as doctors, and the wider health service are to learn from these mistakes and to prevent such tragedies occurring, the NHS needs a dramatic shift away from the current culture of blame."" The Department of Health and Social Care said the changes would mean bereaved families would get more information about the circumstances of their loved ones' death and more data would be shared across the NHS to help prevent avoidable deaths in the future.

Hunt orders review of criminalising doctors,"Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off following an appeal Jeremy Hunt has ordered an urgent review of medical malpractice cases following concerns over a recent manslaughter case involving a doctor. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba wasstruck off the medical registerafter she was found guilty of mistakes in the care of a six-year-old boy who died of sepsis. The health secretary says clarity is needed about drawing the line between gross negligence and ordinary errors. Doctors should learn from - not fear - mistakes, he says. The Bawa-Garba case has rocked the medical profession. Medics rally behind struck off doctor Doctor struck off over six-year-old's death More than 800 medics have signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba, saying focusing on one person ignored the part low staffing levels played in the tragedy and striking her off would discourage medics from being open when reviewing mistakes. Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months last June by a tribunal, but she has now been removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". Jack died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""The only way we can reduce mistakes in the NHS is to learn from every single one, and the tragic case of Dr Bawa-Garba raises many important questions about how the health system supports staff to be open and transparent when things go wrong."" The government's rapid review will be led by Prof Sir Norman Williams, former President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and will report back by the end of April 2018. It will look at: Any lessons that need to be learned by the General Medical Council and other professional regulators How learning, openness and transparency can be protected so that mistakes are learned from and not covered up Providing clarity to doctors about where they stand with respect to criminal liability and professional misconduct When six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was admitted to the hospital in February 2011, his sepsis went undiagnosed and led to him suffering a cardiac arrest. The courts heard Dr Bawa-Garba, a paediatrician, committed a ""catalogue"" of errors, including missing signs of his infection and mistakenly thinking Jack was under a do-not-resuscitate order. At the time of the ruling, Jack's mother, Nicola, said: ""We are absolutely elated with the decision. It's what we wanted. ""I know we'll never get Jack back but we have got justice for our little boy."" The Medical Protection Society, which represented Dr Bawa-Garba, said at the time: ""A conviction should not automatically mean that a doctor who has fully remediated and demonstrated insight into their clinical failings is erased."" An online appeal set up by concerned doctors has raised more than Â£320,000 to help pay the legal costs of Dr Bawa-Garba. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the General Medical Council, welcomed the announcement of the government's rapid review.

Rail fares expected to rise 3.5% for 2019,"Millions of commuters are set to face a 3.5% rise in rail fares from January. The fare hike comes after a summer of chaos for many train customers,after a rail timetable overhaul saw scores of cancellations and delays. The exact increase will be announced on Wednesday when official inflation figures - used to set the price increases - for July are published. The expected rise comes after magazine Which? found rail firms are the second least-trusted industry in the UK. Economists are predicting that the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation - the number used by the Department for Transport to set rail fare increases -  will increase by 3.5%. This year rail fares rose by 3.6% -the biggest jump for five years. Campaigners have called on the government to freeze rail fares and use a different measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index, to determine rail fare increases. CPI does not take into account the cost of mortgage payments and tends to be lower than RPI. This video can not be played ""I know the train's probably going to be late"" The Department for Transport said taxpayers subside the network by more than Â£4bn a year. ""Any fare increase is unwelcome, but it is not fair to ask people who do not use trains to pay more for those who do,"" a spokesperson said. Northern cancels Sunday rail services again Rail timetable changes scaled Former Transport Secretary Lord Adonis likened the fact that one in five people was not satisfied with their last journey to a ""national crisis"". He said: ""Can you imagine if one in five people coming out of a supermarket were not happy with the food they were buying? ""Passengers shouldn't be expected to pay more for a worse service."" And some train users have already vented their anger on Twitter.  Jean Thierry said: ""A substantial service improvement is required to justify any sort of increase in fares."" Allow Twitter content?

In May, an overhaul of rail timetables led to widespread rail disruption with Northern bringing in a temporary timetable that removed more than 100 trains a day, while Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern also introduced a reduced service. On Sunday, Northern cancelled services for Liverpool, Lancashire and Greater Manchester. There was similar disruption on 5 August and across the UK on the day of the World Cup final. Labour called on the government to freeze rail fares on the routes most severely affected by the timetable changes - Govia Thameslink, Arriva Rail North and First Transpennine Express as a ""small gesture of goodwill"" for passengers. The Campaign for Better Transport also called on the government to freeze fares. ""Given the mess surrounding the new timetable, the lack of improvements and the failure to deliver compensation. the government cannot go on telling passengers that fare increases are justified,"" a spokesperson said. Consumer group Which? said rail fares have increased by 40% since 2008 - more than one-and-a-half times higher than the rise in CPI inflation (26%) over the same period. The rail fare rise is taking place at a time when a survey by consumer body Which? found that the train industry was the UK's second least-trusted consumer industry. Which?'s consumer insight tracker found that in July 2018, only 23% trusted train travel. This represents a six percentage-point drop compared with July 2017. ""In fact, this makes train travel one of the least-trusted consumer industries, beaten to last place only by car dealers,"" Which? said. Rail Delivery Group spokesman Seb Gordon admitted the rail industry ""had a pretty torrid time"" since the May timetable came into effect. But added: ""The last survey, which is the survey that Which are quoting, showed that about 80% of passengers were satisfied with their last journey."" How will the rail fare price rise affect you?

New fund unveiled to tackle rough sleeping,"The government has unveiled its Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleeping on England's streets. It wants to ""help people turn their lives around"", including support for mental health and addictions. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire vowed to make homelessness ""a thing of the past"" and the government has vowed to end rough sleeping by 2027. But Labour says the plan is already ""unravelling"" as it's become clear no new money is being invested. Homelessness has been on the rise for the past seven years, with around4,750 people estimated to be sleeping roughon any given night in England in 2017. Charities have welcomed the plan, but warned that it was ""a step forward and not a total fix"". Rough sleeping rises for seventh year UK 'could end homelessness in a decade' Homeless in the snow: 'I hope I wake up' The Rough Sleeping Strategy will focus on preventing people from becoming homeless in the first place by offering a range of support. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto. Can't see the map?Click here,external. But when questioned on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brokenshire said half of the promised Â£100m had already been committed to homelessness and rough sleeping, with the other half ""reprioritised"" from existing budgets in his department. ""There are significant sums of money being focused and targeted,"" he said. ""Half of that has already been committed to homelessness and rough sleeping. ""The other remaining half of this is money that's new to rough sleeping and homelessness, reflecting and recognising the priorities and importance of taxes."" He also denied that government policies were behind the rise in homelessness. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""The government's rough sleeping plan has unravelled just hours after it was announced. It's now clear there is no additional money for the housing department to tackle the crisis of rough sleeping. ""Rough sleeping has more than doubled since 2010 thanks to decisions made by Tory ministers, but this feeble plan lacks any urgency."" He added that the next Labour government would end rough sleeping within its first term by making 8,000 homes available to those with a history of sleeping on the streets. And Sarah Jones, shadow housing minister, said she was ""shocked"" it was not new money. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

About Â£30 million will be spent on mental health help and treatment for substance misuse as part of the proposals, which were developed in conjunction with charities and experts. This will include training for staff on how to help people affected by the illegal drug Spice -a synthetic cannabinoid that 90-95% of homeless people in Manchester are estimated to use. In addition, the government will put about Â£50m towards homes outside London for those who are ready to move on from hostels or refuges. Rough sleepers will also be helped to access services and accommodation by a network of specialist ""navigators"". This video can not be played A rough sleeper tells the BBC what it's like on the streets Seven homelessness charities - Crisis, Homeless Link, National Housing Federation, Shelter, St Basils, St Mungo's and Thames Reach - who advised ministers on the strategy said in a joint statement that it was ""a significant step towards the government's goal of ending rough sleeping by 2027"". However, they added that ministers ""must also set out bold, cross-departmental plans to tackle the root causes of all forms of homelessness and prevent it from happening in the first place"". This video can not be played Hilary Burkitt from Shelter on the government's new plan Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: ""This strategy is an important step forward in the fight against the rough sleeping emergency that's led to people dying on our streets. ""But let's be clear, this is a step forward and not a total fix for homelessness. ""We still need to tackle the chronic lack of genuinely affordable homes, deep instability of renting and problems with housing benefit that are leaving so many without a home."" She called for a plan ""to build many more social homes"" and ""efforts to create real security for those struggling with their rent"". Homeless by the sea Almost 30,000 lone parent families made homeless New homelessness law: What impact will it have? Crisis chief executive Jon Sparkes told Today: ""They're intervening in the right way - more outreach work, mental health support and so on. ""But of course, it's not tackling the root causes of homelessness and indeed rough sleeping. Which are that we don't have enough social houses, we have a welfare system which doesn't cover the cost of housing and there are huge groups of people excluded from the system altogether."" Ministers are also expected to review legislation on homelessness and rough sleeping, including the Vagrancy Act - which currently makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg in England and Wales. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We recognise this is a complex issue - as well as ensuring people have somewhere to live, we have to deal with underlying problems and ultimately help people turn their lives around."" ""It is simply unacceptable that people have to sleep on the streets and I am determined to make it a thing of the past,"" added Mr Brokenshire. Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said the strategy was ""a positive first step"" but added: ""We must go much further, much faster. ""Rough sleeping is only the tip of the iceberg - right now, councils are currently housing over 79,000 homeless families and 123,000 children in temporary housing. ""Councils want to end all homelessness by preventing it from happening in the first place.""

Bayer shares tumble over weedkiller case,"Shares in German pharmaceutical group Bayer have dropped sharply following a US verdict linking a product to cancer. By mid-morning on Monday, Bayer's shares had lost 10.4% of their value. Bayer owns agriculture giant Monsanto - which was ordered by a California judge on Friday to pay $289m (Â£226m) damages to a man who said ingredients used in a weedkiller had caused his cancer. Bayer says the product - glyphosate - is safe. It completed its $66bn takeover of Monsanto in June. EU settles dispute over weedkiller glyphosate UK 'will support' pesticide ban The villagers who fear herbicides The landmark lawsuit was the first to go to trial alleging a glyphosate link to cancer. The claimant, groundsman Dewayne Johnson, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2014. His lawyers said he regularly used a form of RangerPro while working at a school in Benicia, California. The Californian jury said Monsanto should have warned users about the dangers of its Roundup and RangerPro weedkillers. Mr Johnson is among more than 5,000 similar plaintiffs across the US. Glyphosate is the world's most common weedkiller. The California ruling could lead to hundreds of other claims against Monsanto. A Bayer spokesperson told the BBC on Saturday that the two companies operated independently. In a statement the company said: ""Bayer is confident, based on the strength of the science, the conclusions of regulators around the world and decades of experience, that glyphosate is safe for use and does not cause cancer when used according to the label."" Monsanto said it intends to appeal against the verdict. Glyphosate was introduced by Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers.

Climbers feared dead in Tajik crash,"The Pamir mountains are a major tourist draw Twelve mainly Russian climbers and a crew member have survived a helicopter crash in the mountains of Tajikistan. But three Russian climbers and two Tajik pilots died in the accident in the Pamir Mountains in east Tajikistan. The ""hard landing"" of the helicopter happened at 17:30 (11:30 GMT) on Sunday, Tajik officials said. Russian news agencies said the helicopter had taken the climbers from a nearby base camp on the Fortambek glacier on the Ismoili Somoni peak. Of the 12 climbers to survive, two are Belarusian and Spanish and the remainder Russian. The surviving crew member was from Tajikistan. A Russian Mi-8 helicopter similar to that which crash landed in Tajikistan The helicopter, a Russian-built Mi-8, crash-landed on the edge of the Fortambek glacier, approximately 300 km (186 miles) east of the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. At 7,495m (24,590ft), the Ismoili Somoni mountain is Tajikistan's highest and a major tourist attraction.

Man charged over digger destruction,"Five new houses belonging to McCarthy and Stone were destroyed A builder has been accused of causing Â£4m of damage by ripping apart five new homes with a digger. Hertfordshire Police was called to Ermine Street in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, at about 17:40 BST on Saturday. Daniel Neagu, 30, from Athelstone Road in Harrow, north-west London, has been charged with causing criminal damage. Magistrates heard that the houses belonged to development company McCarthy and Stone. A spokeswoman for the firm said Mr Neagu was not employed directly but worked for subcontractor Fenton. Police said they arrested a man at the scene after being called to the site of the newly built retirement homes. McCarthy and Stone said owners were due to move into the unoccupied bungalows within weeks. ""We are now awaiting a structural engineer's report, so we can plan the work required to repair or rebuild these properties,"" she said. ""We are absolutely devastated for the purchasers affected and our priority is to continue to stay in close contact with them and their families, and to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum."" Magistrates in Hatfield were told Mr Neagu, who appeared by videolink, was a Romanian national and had lived in the UK for three years. He was remanded in custody and will appear for a plea hearing at St Albans Crown Court on 10 September.

Plan to end rough sleeping within decade,"The government has unveiled its Â£100m strategy to tackle rough sleeping on England's streets. It wants to ""help people turn their lives around"", including support for mental health and addictions. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire vowed to make homelessness ""a thing of the past"" and the government has vowed to end rough sleeping by 2027. But Labour says the plan is already ""unravelling"" as it's become clear no new money is being invested. Homelessness has been on the rise for the past seven years, with around4,750 people estimated to be sleeping roughon any given night in England in 2017. Charities have welcomed the plan, but warned that it was ""a step forward and not a total fix"". Rough sleeping rises for seventh year UK 'could end homelessness in a decade' Homeless in the snow: 'I hope I wake up' The Rough Sleeping Strategy will focus on preventing people from becoming homeless in the first place by offering a range of support. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto. Can't see the map?Click here,external. But when questioned on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Brokenshire said half of the promised Â£100m had already been committed to homelessness and rough sleeping, with the other half ""reprioritised"" from existing budgets in his department. ""There are significant sums of money being focused and targeted,"" he said. ""Half of that has already been committed to homelessness and rough sleeping. ""The other remaining half of this is money that's new to rough sleeping and homelessness, reflecting and recognising the priorities and importance of taxes."" He also denied that government policies were behind the rise in homelessness. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said: ""The government's rough sleeping plan has unravelled just hours after it was announced. It's now clear there is no additional money for the housing department to tackle the crisis of rough sleeping. ""Rough sleeping has more than doubled since 2010 thanks to decisions made by Tory ministers, but this feeble plan lacks any urgency."" He added that the next Labour government would end rough sleeping within its first term by making 8,000 homes available to those with a history of sleeping on the streets. And Sarah Jones, shadow housing minister, said she was ""shocked"" it was not new money. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

About Â£30 million will be spent on mental health help and treatment for substance misuse as part of the proposals, which were developed in conjunction with charities and experts. This will include training for staff on how to help people affected by the illegal drug Spice -a synthetic cannabinoid that 90-95% of homeless people in Manchester are estimated to use. In addition, the government will put about Â£50m towards homes outside London for those who are ready to move on from hostels or refuges. Rough sleepers will also be helped to access services and accommodation by a network of specialist ""navigators"". This video can not be played A rough sleeper tells the BBC what it's like on the streets Seven homelessness charities - Crisis, Homeless Link, National Housing Federation, Shelter, St Basils, St Mungo's and Thames Reach - who advised ministers on the strategy said in a joint statement that it was ""a significant step towards the government's goal of ending rough sleeping by 2027"". However, they added that ministers ""must also set out bold, cross-departmental plans to tackle the root causes of all forms of homelessness and prevent it from happening in the first place"". This video can not be played Hilary Burkitt from Shelter on the government's new plan Polly Neate, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: ""This strategy is an important step forward in the fight against the rough sleeping emergency that's led to people dying on our streets. ""But let's be clear, this is a step forward and not a total fix for homelessness. ""We still need to tackle the chronic lack of genuinely affordable homes, deep instability of renting and problems with housing benefit that are leaving so many without a home."" She called for a plan ""to build many more social homes"" and ""efforts to create real security for those struggling with their rent"". Homeless by the sea Almost 30,000 lone parent families made homeless New homelessness law: What impact will it have? Crisis chief executive Jon Sparkes told Today: ""They're intervening in the right way - more outreach work, mental health support and so on. ""But of course, it's not tackling the root causes of homelessness and indeed rough sleeping. Which are that we don't have enough social houses, we have a welfare system which doesn't cover the cost of housing and there are huge groups of people excluded from the system altogether."" Ministers are also expected to review legislation on homelessness and rough sleeping, including the Vagrancy Act - which currently makes it illegal to sleep rough or beg in England and Wales. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We recognise this is a complex issue - as well as ensuring people have somewhere to live, we have to deal with underlying problems and ultimately help people turn their lives around."" ""It is simply unacceptable that people have to sleep on the streets and I am determined to make it a thing of the past,"" added Mr Brokenshire. Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said the strategy was ""a positive first step"" but added: ""We must go much further, much faster. ""Rough sleeping is only the tip of the iceberg - right now, councils are currently housing over 79,000 homeless families and 123,000 children in temporary housing. ""Councils want to end all homelessness by preventing it from happening in the first place.""

Heathrow queues more than two hours,"The boss of Virgin Atlantic, which obtained the data, called on the government to fix the long queues Delays at Heathrow Airport passport control left passengers queuing for up to two and a half hours last month, figures show. On 30 of 31 days in July, Border Force missed its target of a 45-minute wait or less for 95% of visitors from outside the European Economic Area. Virgin Atlantic, which obtained the data, said passengers were ""frustrated"". The government said it would send 200 extra staff to Heathrow this summer. According to the data, the longest immigration queues were on 6 July when travellers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) - an area made up of 31 European countries - had to wait in line for up to two hours and 38 minutes. BA boss demands action on Heathrow queues BBC's Gardner left stuck on plane again Reality Check: Would a 'no deal' Brexit prevent planes flying? Craig Kreeger, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said while it was agreed that security and safety was a priority, other countries were managing their borders better than the UK. He said ""only the Border Force"" could take action to ""resolve these unacceptable queue times"". ""At a time when the UK needs to show the world it is open for business, the government and Border Force need to provide a great first impression for every visitor every time,"" he said. Non-EEA citizens cannot use the electronic gates, which run a face recognition check and passport scan Citizens aged 12 or over from the European Union, the EEA and Switzerland can use the electronic gates atHeathrow's passport control,external- but visitors from all other countries must have their passports checked by a Border Force official. Michael Klein, an art dealer from New York who regularly travels through Heathrow, described his experiences of the airport as ""just horrendous"". Mr Klein, 66, told the BBC he had queued for two hours or more at passport control on three occasions in the past month alone. ""There's absolutely no accommodations made for families or elderly. No one seems to care,"" he added. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's chief executive, has previously called for the Home Office to allow visitors from ""low risk countries"" - like the US, he suggests - to be allowed to use the electronic gates. Last week the boss of British Airways, Alex Cruz,wrote a letter to the Timesurging the government to deal with Heathrow's ""border farce"". He said ""two-hour queues are fast becoming the norm"" and Heathrow had missed its target for non-EEA arrivals 6,000 times so far this year. BBC reporter Jenny Kumah said the Home Office explained its poor performance in July was worsened by a ""large numbers of vulnerable adults and children arriving"", alongside a number of computer errors. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The vast majority of people who arrive at Heathrow get through the border within our service standards. ""But we understand the frustration for those who have experienced longer waits and remain fully committed to working with our partners to reduce waiting times as far as is possible. ""At the same time, we will not compromise the essential checks we carry out at the border which keep our country safe. ""We are making sure Border Force has the resources it needs and are deploying 200 additional staff at Heathrow over the summer.""

How best to help rough sleepers?,"A poster telling people not to give change to rough sleepers has sparked a debate on how people treat them. It's after a housing campaigner posted a picture of a poster online which said: ""You will be helping them to buy the drugs that could kill them."" The West Midlands police and crime commissioner says he does not approve of the message. The poster has been used in other parts of the country before. Allow Twitter content?

People seem to be split about whether or not you should give spare change to homeless people living on the street. But if you don't want to give cash to rough sleepers, how else can you help? ""We've always argued that it's a matter of personal choice what you do,"" says Paul Noblet from the youth homelessness charity Centrepoint. ""You can give money - it doesn't have to be a bad thing. If you want to avoid doubt, maybe it's sometimes better to buy that person some food or a drink."" He adds that you can also ""make a donation to charity - or to put them in touch with a helpline."" A number of homelessness charities have help lines to call, where they will try and arrange long-term accommodation for homeless people. Paul welcomes the decision to take the posters down, saying they ""really can give the impression that everyone out there rough sleeping is out there just to beg and to make money. It's just so not the case."" Nathan plays the penny whistle to try to earn some change James, in the West Midlands, has been a rough sleeper for ""eight years on and off"". He tells Newsbeat: ""When I get money, I have to spend it on something to get my head down, like a pastime - I smoke spice."" Nathan, another rough sleeper in the area, says he can make Â£40 ""on a good day,"" and spends it on ""basic living expenses"". He doesn't admit to doing drugs, but says: ""if I choose to - that's my fair. ""People spend money on coffee and cigarettes and fatty foods, and all sorts of things that make them feel better."" But Mickey, a Big Issue seller, says: ""I used to be on the streets. I used to be on the heroin, crack and mamba [synthetic cannabis]."" ""I have beggars sitting here, and when people give them money, it loses me money. ""I've been out here grafting, and they'd rather just give to people that sit on the floor than the people who work for it."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Matt Harrison, director of StreetLink, a charity whose website appeared on the poster, comments: ""Research shows that the majority of people sleeping rough or who are homeless do not beg,"" and recommends contacting a charity if they see a rough sleeper. He adds: ""However, we believe that any campaigns asking people to donate should be carried out sensitively, and that it is always the individual's choice as to whether they give money directly to someone they see on the street.""

No longer a big city problem,"""What can I do?"" Tony, aged 72, is living in a tent in the middle of Milton Keynes Rough sleeping in England has reached record levels - withfigures published on Thursday showing an annual rise of 15%, representing a 169% increase since 2010. It's no longer confined to London and the big cities - three quarters are outside the capital - and rough sleepers have been appearing in tents and shop doorways in towns where it seems unexpected and out of place. Tony, a 72-year-old former railway worker, is living in a small blue tent in a concrete underpass. It gives him some shelter from the bitingly cold January wind blowing along Midsummer Boulevard, not far from families shopping in Milton Keynes. It's not the kind of town where you'd expect to see clusters of homeless people, their tents and mattresses a few yards away from Costa coffee and Marks and Spencer. ""It could be worse... but not much."" Ian and Will are living in a car park in Crewe It's the classic new town, a model of modern post-War optimism, laid out as neatly as a circuit board. There aren't any books called Down and Out in Milton Keynes. But homelessness seems to be coming closer to home. There are lines of tents in the underpasses, and a hut made of wood and bits of plastic is wedged under a road bridge. Tony, one of an estimated 130 rough sleepers in the middle of Milton Keynes, has been homeless for almost a year, saying he lost his flat after a problem over rent and benefits, which ended with the bailiffs on his doorstep. This video can not be played Ian and Will say they live under the threat of violent attacks from local youths He says that he can afford to eat, but has no chance of being able to afford private rent. ""What can I do?"" he says. He is not self-pitying and doesn't blame anyone else, but sits in his hat and coat beside the one-man tent that now holds all his possessions. He says his family could call him if they wanted to get in touch. ""Every time I wake up, it's a bonus,"" he says. As the problem has become more visible, there have been innovative and creative acts of generosity. Tom Davis, who was once homeless himself, founded a charity toconvert a bus into temporary accommodation,external- a ""bus shelter"". The coach being turned into bunk beds for 16 homeless people was once a touring bus for Robbie Williams and his road crew. Tony says he has no chance of being able to afford high local rents As well as providing a safe bed for the night, the bus will provide an address, allowing people to sign up for GPs and health services. Tom says it will also help with one of the big unacknowledged problems for rough sleepers, the intense loneliness. Among the new homeless in Milton Keynes are people who are working. Some of these are caught in the unreliable incomes of zero-hour contracts. But others, such as Isaac, are working full-time. This video can not be played Homeless while working full-time: ""If I said it was overwhelming, it would be an understatement."" This project manager for Deloitte has found himself temporarily part of the town's homeless population, staying in a winter shelter. He says that being presentable, not being on drugs and not appearing vulnerable, has made it even harder to get help. Tents have appeared in the underpasses of Milton Keynes This rise in rough sleeping has shocked local people. Pam Williams, who chairs the bus shelter project, says she got involved because she was so upset when she saw homeless people appearing outside the train station. A local street cleaner goes by, who says he was once part of the less visible homeless population - spending days and nights with his wife in late-night fast food restaurants. Annual rough sleeping count shows highest ever recorded level of 4,751 The numbers have risen by 15% compared with last year, up 169% since 2010 More than three quarters are outside London Big increases reported in Brighton, Medway, Southend, Oxford, Tameside, Worthing, Salford and Eastbourne 14% of rough sleepers are women More than nine in 10 are over the age of 25 One in five is originally from outside the UK How are the homeless counted? Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto. Can't see the map?Click here,external. The reasons for this increase are as varied as the stories of the rough sleepers. It might relate to benefits changes, unaffordable housing, low incomes, addiction, relationship breakdowns, mental health problems, debt, bereavement. There are former servicemen and ex-prisoners - and there are people who do not fit into any of these stereotypes. Homelessness, once associated with the big cities, is snaking across the country. The train line north from London goes through Milton Keynes and then to Crewe, where rough sleeping now lives alongside quiet red-brick terraces. Will (right) says he has Huntingdon's disease and has recently left hospital. Ian says Crewe is his home town. A homeless man's tent is floodlit by the windows of a leisure centre, where families are hurrying inside from the cold. A short distance away is a small indoor car park. In the far corner, behind the rows of family saloons, there's a flag of Saint George hanging over a tangle of mattresses and bedding. Ian and Will are living there, dressed in layers and ready for more than the elements. They say that local youngsters regularly attack them when they're sleeping, throwing bricks at them or assaulting them. Ian says they can't even defend themselves because they think they will get the blame if they try to tackle the teenagers circling nearby. He might be described as ""homeless"", but Crewe is Ian's home town. The streets where he now sleeps rough were the same streets he walked to school. Chris, at the YMCA during the severe weather, is homeless in his home town ""It's embarrassing seeing people you grew up with,"" he says. Will, shaking and unsteady, has Huntington's disease and says he has returned to the streets after a long spell in hospital. ""It could be worse,"" says Ian. ""Not much,"" says Will. But since talking to the rough sleepers in Crewe last week, Cheshire East council has found Will accommodation. It's apparent how much help depends on volunteers and charities. Will and Ian say they are able to survive only because of help from Bernard Potter, a retired accountant who helped to set upLooking After the Homeless (LATH),external, a group of volunteers who provide food, advice and a drop-in centre. It's such unsung people, a no-nonsense pensioner in a flat cap, who are keeping people alive. ""Fear the homeless"": Graffiti on a mirror wall in Milton Keynes When there's severe weather, the local YMCA in Crewe lets people stay inside. There are already more than 60 regular residents - and on top of this another seven camp beds are set up for the night. Chris, who has one of the beds, talks openly about his troubles with crack and heroin. He's also homeless in his own home town. When he was sleeping rough, he saw people he knew from school. ""They've got houses, they've got family. We've got nothing... except a camp bed,"" he says. ""It destroys your head sometimes."" Being inside for the night means warmth and safety from the threat of being beaten up by bored teenagers. ""You wake up shivering, the rain battering down on you and you've nowhere else to go,"" Chris says. Tom Davis has set up a charity converting a former Robbie Williams tour bus into accommodation for the homeless Across the room is a middle-aged Polish man. He has a gentle manner, but speaks almost no English. Using Google Translate, he says he was a farm worker but was never paid wages and lost both his work and accommodation after he had been in hospital for an operation. He has ended up on a camp bed in the YMCA, wearing a Christmas jumper. It's hard to imagine anyone looking more stuck and isolated. Joel Lewis, a manager at the YMCA, says he's seen the levels of homelessness getting worse, with demand in Crewe up by almost 40% compared with the previous year. Bernard Potter has helped homeless people to survive, say those he has helped in Crewe He says he's worried such rising numbers will mean that shelters will become like ""warehouses"", unable to offer the support so sorely needed. His colleague Matt Coles says he has seen people arriving who have lost fingers and toes to frostbite. With numbers rising to record levels across the country, it could be a long winter for those sleeping rough and those trying to help them.

Deported homeless win damages,"This video can not be played Tomas Lusas, a Lithuanian national, was awarded Â£10,000 after being illegally detained The government is to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to European rough sleepers who were illegally detained and deported. Figures obtained by the BBC reveal that in the year to May 2017, 698 homeless EU nationals were targeted and removed from the country. The Home Office said no further action was being taken against European citizens for rough sleeping. Law firms told the BBC that at least 45 clients were currently pursuing claims. Each claim is worth thousands of pounds, and varies according to the length of time spent in detention as well as other aggravating factors. Tomas Lusas, from Lithuania, was arrested by immigration officers in 2016 after being kicked out of his home and forced onto the streets in west London. He said: ""One morning I was woken up in my sleeping bag. There were six or seven officers and they said 'Home Office'. ""They took my ID. Two minutes later I was in handcuffs. Two minutes after that I was in a van. ""I was shouting, 'I'm gonna lose my job if you arrest me today'. But nobody listened to me. Nobody allowed me to explain why I was sleeping rough."" Mr Lusas refused to sign his removal papers and was detained at Brook House Immigration Centre in Gatwick for 19 days. ""It was like being in jail,"" he said. ""Your freedom is taken away. And what kills you is that you don't know the end of your sentence. ""I've spent nine years of my life in England and I didn't want to leave just because I was sleeping rough."" Mr Lusas appealed against his deportation and was successful. He was later awarded more than Â£10,000 in damages. The Home Office under Theresa May introduced the concept of rough sleeping as an abuse of EU treaty rights two years ago. But immigration enforcement teams were targeting rough sleepers even if they were in work or had a permanent right of residence in the UK. The policy was halted aftera judicial review in Decemberruled it to be unlawful and discriminatory. Leonie Hirst, an immigration and public law barrister, said anyone from the EU or the European Economic Area who had been detained or deported in similar circumstances could now make a potential claim. ""The EU law is clear and very robust, but the policy was a very flimsy attempt to misuse the law, simply to meet immigration targets,"" she said. ""I think it is highly unlikely, particularly given that people were targeted who were working, that this policy has done anything except cost significant amounts of public money."" Ms Hirst said she had heard evidence that immigration teams were working to quotas. She said she had seen cases where officials were ignoring the usual practice of inquiring into individual circumstances before deciding whether to remove them. ""One of my clients told immigration officers that he had payslips with him to prove he was working, and he had the response, 'we don't want to see those, we're operating quotas',"" she said. A Home Office spokesperson said that ""claims for compensation will be considered on a case-by-case basis"" and that the government was ""determined to break the homelessness cycle"".

Turkey acts to curb currency crisis,"Moves to ease Turkey's economic woes have failed to stop market turmoil as the country's row with the US deepens. Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Monday that the US was seeking to ""stab it in the back"". The US last week imposed sanctions on Turkey over its refusal to extradite a US preacher imprisoned in the country. The sanctions caused market turmoil, which the central bank attempted - but failed - to soothe with a series of market-boosting measures. Mr Erdogan told a news conference in the Turkish capital, Ankara: ""You act on one side as a strategic partner, but on the other, you fire bullets into the foot of your strategic partner. ""We are together in Nato and then you seek to stab your strategic partner in the back."" The pastor is only one of a number of issues dividing Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan As the crisis deepened at the end of last week, the lira and the Turkish stock market slid sharply. Mr Erdogan, who has presided over soaring inflation and borrowing levels, says the lira's fall is the result of a plot rather than prevailing economic conditions. Turkey's interior ministry said it was taking legal action against 346 social media accounts it claimed had posted comments about the weakening lira ""in a provocative way"". Time to book a holiday? Turkey's lira slump explained Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down The dispute centres on Turkey's refusal to release American pastor Andrew Brunson. Mr Brunson has been detained for nearly two years, accused of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. The Turkish president is angry that the US has not taken more action against the Gulenist movement and what he said was a failure ""to unequivocally condemn"" the 2016 coup attempt. The US has refused to extradite Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues US support for Kurdish rebel groups fighting Islamic State (IS) fighters in northern Syria is another major difficulty, given Turkey's battle against a Kurdish insurgency in its own country. Mr Erdogan has also been getting closer to Russia. That creates an awkward triangle, given that Turkey is a Nato member, Russia is Nato's number one threat and the organisation is obliged to defend any member that is attacked. Nato uses the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to fight against IS and there has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close it. The lira's worst day was Friday, when US President Donald Trump approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, following Turkey's refusal to free an American pastor who has been in detention there for nearly two years. Experts have blamed the drop in the Turkish lira on fears thatthe country is descending into an economic crisis. Turkey's stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year. Meanwhile, inflation has hit 15%. Investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, since the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. More than a third of Turkish banks' lending is in foreign currencies, according to Reuters,external. Although the lira rose slightly after the central bank's move to support the economy, it still hit a new record low against the dollar. Investors globally fear the damage spreading and have been prompted to sell riskier assets, including other emerging market currencies. The Turkish Central Bank announced on Monday that banks would be given all the liquidity - help to keep money moving - they needed. But the bank did not increase interest rates, which would help contain inflation while supporting the lira. It is not clear if this comes after Mr Erdogan's pressure. The president is famously averse to interest rate rises. He has dismissed the fall of the currency as ""a storm in a tea cup"" and urged Turks to sell dollars and buy lira to help boost the currency. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent President Erdogan sees Turkey's problems as the result of a plot rather than economic fundamentals. That kind of talk might play well politically with some audiences in Turkey, but it won't wash in the markets. Turkey has underlying problems in the form of a fairly large international trade deficit, high levels of foreign currency debt owed by the private sector and a persistent inflation problem. Certainly the situation has been aggravated by the deterioration in political relations with the United States and the higher tariffs that Turkey now faces on its steel and aluminium sales in the US.  But the scale of the apparent impact was due to the fact that Turkey was already economically and financially vulnerable. Business executive Kemal, who lives in Istanbul, said: ""It is not unusual or unexpected to see some companies go under when there is such a sudden devaluation of the currency. However, I do not believe it will crumble the economy."" British holidaymaker Paul Fothergill, who is staying in Dalyan, says he has been holidaying in Turkey for the last 30 years. He said: ""Since we arrived on Thursday the Turkish lira has nosedived. It's very sad for locals and investors, but incredibly good for us, the Brits. ""You can imaging how cheap our evening meals and trips have been. The most expensive meal, including drinks and tip, so far was Â£12 for me and my wife."" Heather, a Briton who has lived in Turkey for 15 years with her family, said: ""This last year has seen ridiculous price rises and price differences in shops and supermarkets. Prices of basics like butter, cheese, fruit and vegetables are so expensive that we think twice about putting them in our baskets. ""Petrol and utilities have also seen price rises. Wages have not gone up, so we worry about where this will end. It may be beneficial for those with pounds, dollars or euros but rest of us are struggling.""

Heathrow passport queues more than two hours,"The boss of Virgin Atlantic, which obtained the data, called on the government to fix the long queues Delays at Heathrow Airport passport control left passengers queuing for up to two and a half hours last month, figures show. On 30 of 31 days in July, Border Force missed its target of a 45-minute wait or less for 95% of visitors from outside the European Economic Area. Virgin Atlantic, which obtained the data, said passengers were ""frustrated"". The government said it would send 200 extra staff to Heathrow this summer. According to the data, the longest immigration queues were on 6 July when travellers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) - an area made up of 31 European countries - had to wait in line for up to two hours and 38 minutes. BA boss demands action on Heathrow queues BBC's Gardner left stuck on plane again Reality Check: Would a 'no deal' Brexit prevent planes flying? Craig Kreeger, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said while it was agreed that security and safety was a priority, other countries were managing their borders better than the UK. He said ""only the Border Force"" could take action to ""resolve these unacceptable queue times"". ""At a time when the UK needs to show the world it is open for business, the government and Border Force need to provide a great first impression for every visitor every time,"" he said. Non-EEA citizens cannot use the electronic gates, which run a face recognition check and passport scan Citizens aged 12 or over from the European Union, the EEA and Switzerland can use the electronic gates atHeathrow's passport control,external- but visitors from all other countries must have their passports checked by a Border Force official. Michael Klein, an art dealer from New York who regularly travels through Heathrow, described his experiences of the airport as ""just horrendous"". Mr Klein, 66, told the BBC he had queued for two hours or more at passport control on three occasions in the past month alone. ""There's absolutely no accommodations made for families or elderly. No one seems to care,"" he added. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's chief executive, has previously called for the Home Office to allow visitors from ""low risk countries"" - like the US, he suggests - to be allowed to use the electronic gates. Last week the boss of British Airways, Alex Cruz,wrote a letter to the Timesurging the government to deal with Heathrow's ""border farce"". He said ""two-hour queues are fast becoming the norm"" and Heathrow had missed its target for non-EEA arrivals 6,000 times so far this year. BBC reporter Jenny Kumah said the Home Office explained its poor performance in July was worsened by a ""large numbers of vulnerable adults and children arriving"", alongside a number of computer errors. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The vast majority of people who arrive at Heathrow get through the border within our service standards. ""But we understand the frustration for those who have experienced longer waits and remain fully committed to working with our partners to reduce waiting times as far as is possible. ""At the same time, we will not compromise the essential checks we carry out at the border which keep our country safe. ""We are making sure Border Force has the resources it needs and are deploying 200 additional staff at Heathrow over the summer.""

Muslims warn PM of Johnson 'whitewash',"This video can not be played Why Boris Johnson's comments have sparked an internal Conservative Party investigation The UK's largest Muslim organisation is calling on Theresa May to ensure the inquiry into Boris Johnson's burka comments is not a ""whitewash"". According tothe Guardian,,externalthe Muslim Council of Britain will tell the prime minister ""no-one should be allowed to victimise minorities with impunity"". Mr Johnsonis facing an investigationafter saying women in burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". He did not respond to the row in his latest newspaper column. Why some Muslim women wear the veil Watchdog criticises Johnson's burka comments UKIP burka comments 'cowardly' The Muslim Council of Britain's letter, seen by the Guardian, said it was ""hopeful"" that the party ""will not allow any whitewashing of this specific inquiry currently in process"". The council previously said the support shown to Mr Johnson from Tory MPs had ""shone a light on the underbelly of Islamophobia"" within the party. A woman wearing a burka protests near Mr Johnson's constituency office The organisation added that it had received Islamophobic hate mail referring to former foreign secretary Mr Johnson's comments. Meanwhile, the Tell Mama project, which monitors anti-Muslim violence, reported an increase in incidents of abuse aimed at women wearing the niqab or hijab over the past week. Mr Johnson - who returned home from his holiday in Italy over the weekend - has not yet responded to the row. In hislatest column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,external- one week on from hisoriginal comments,externalabout the Muslim full-face veil - Mr Johnson did not mention the issue but instead chose to write about housing. Earlier, herefused to answerthe questions of journalists waiting outside his Oxfordshire home, saying he had ""nothing to say about this matter"" except to offer out cups of tea. The Conservative Party launched its disciplinary investigation after receiving dozens of complaints about Mr Johnson's remarks. Mrs May and Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis have called on him to apologise. This video can not be played ""There's no reason to insult people in that way,"" one woman told the BBC's Asian Network But others - including Brexiteer backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg and comedian Rowan Atkinson - have expressed support. According to a ComRes poll for the Sunday Express, 53% of people who responded believe Mr Johnson should not be disciplined for his comments. The complaints against him are being looked at by an investigating officer, who can dismiss them if they are found to be obviously trivial, lacking in merit or unable to be fairly investigated. Communities and Local Government Secretary James Brokenshire told BBC Breakfast: ""There is an ongoing investigation in relation to complaints that have been made over Boris's comments last week. I think that's the right approach."" He added ""I would certainly have not chosen the words that Boris used,"" but would not comment on it further during the investigation. Should they be upheld, the complaints will then be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. On Friday, in a separate investigation into a complaint, theUK's equalities watchdog saidMr Johnson's remarks were ""inflammatory and divisive"" and his comments risked ""vilifying Muslim women"".

Rail fares expected to rise 3.5% in 2019,"Millions of commuters are set to face a 3.5% rise in rail fares from January.

The exact increase will be announced on Wednesday when official inflation figures - used to set the price increases - for July are published. The expected rise comes after magazine Which? found rail firms are the second least-trusted industry in the UK.

Painting bought for ÃÂ£165k is 'fake',"Fiona Bruce and art dealer Philip Mould with the painting A painting bought for Â£165,000, and thought to have been painted by British artist Sir William Nicholson, could be nearly worthless after an art expert cast doubt on its authenticity. The still life of a glass jug and pears was examined on the BBC's Fake or Fortune? programme. An expert said there was not enough evidence to confirm who painted it. However, a handwriting expert believes the work is authentic, and evidence links it to Nicholson's paint box. Presenter Fiona Bruce said she was ""shocked"" as the case had been ""so strong"". ""It was just love at first sight,"" owner Lyn said of the piece, adding that she ""didn't have any doubt"" of its authenticity when she bought it in 2006. But when a catalogue of Nicholson's work - the official list of all his known pieces - was published by Reed in 2011, Lyn's painting was not included. ""I was hurt. I feel it's a miscarriage of justice,"" Lyn said. And so she hoped the Fake Or Fortune? team could prove otherwise. Will Darby, whose Mayfair gallery - Browse and Darby - exhibited the painting before selling it to Lyn for Â£165,000 ($210,456), told Fiona Bruce: ""I was shocked. As far as I was concerned this painting couldn't have been done by anyone else."" Lyn said she was 'sore' to learn that Patricia Reed thought her painting was not an authentic Nicholson In Sunday night's episode, new evidence was revealed that scientifically linked the painting to Nicholson's own paint box which is kept in his grandson's house. A handwriting expert told the programme he was ""100% convinced"" that writing on the back of the painting was by Nicholson. Pigments also matched those used in a very similar Nicholson painting now in Canada. Augustus John painting found after house cleared out Work starts to restore painted-over Banksy murals Stolen art found under drug dealer's bed Despite this, expert Patricia Reed was still not convinced it was genuine. ""There is nothing that gives direct evidence that he actually executed the work himself,"" she said. Born in 1872, Nicholson spent five decades painting portraits, landscapes and still lifes. Reed said some of Nicholson's painting boards would be reused by painters being taught by him in his studio. This group, known as the ""Sunday painters"", famously included Winston Churchill and Ms Reed said the painting could have been executed by one of them. International art dealer Philip Mould said: ""This has to be one of the most convincing technical investigations we've done on a picture.""

Drunken Facebook message aids man's battleBA worker 'sacked for man bun hairstyle',"David Evans said he was left in debt after his dad died A drunken message on social media very rarely solves your biggest problems. David Evans' family was in debt and facing a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" after the death of his 56-year-old father in Germany, with no will in place. One night Mr Evans, from Llandudno, Conwy county, posted a message to his MP Guto Bebb on Facebook after a ""few too many beers"". But the Aberconwy MP stepped in to help, bringing his two-and-a-half year battle to an end. Following the death of Mr Evans - also known as David - in January 2016, his family wanted to bring the body back to Wales to be buried, but repatriating it and the funeral itself ran up bills of about Â£10,000. These costs were on top of paying off Mr Evans' father's debts. Facebook offers solution to end drunken posts What are four of the biggest hazards of social media?

US far-right rally outnumbered by opponents,"Fewer than expected white nationalists took part in the rally White nationalists have staged a rally near the White House in Washington, but were far outnumbered by counter-protesters. About 20 far-right supporters attended the demonstration, which came a year after violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one person dead. Hundreds of chanting opponents staged their own rally nearby, denouncing white supremacy and racism. The two sides were kept apart by a heavy police presence. About 400 people had initially been expected at the ""Unite the Right 2"" rally but on the day nowhere near that number took part. The white nationalists were escorted by police officers to Lafayette Square, in front of the White House, and were heckled along the route by a larger group of counter-protesters chanting ""shame"" and ""get out of my city"". Charlottesville: 'A battle for the soul of America' The rise of the alt-right Tight security was in place and authorities banned all firearms from the area. After about two hours, under heavy rain, the rally ended and supporters were escorted out of the area in two police vans. A larger group of counter-protesters meanwhile gathered at Freedom Plaza, at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue that leads to the US Capitol, chanting and waving banners. At the scene: Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington As a small group of white supremacists gathered for their second ""Unite the Right"" rally, the rain began to fall. Much like the sodden pavements outside the White House, the follow up to last year's rally in Charlottesville was nothing more than a damp squib. Organisers had applied for a permit for as many as 400 people - but in the end they couldn't gather much more than 20. The counter-protesters came out in much larger numbers, a mix of locals with hand-made signs; Black Lives Matter activists, and also some Antifa - left-wing militants - dressed head to toe in black. It all passed off peacefully, to the relief of many who remember last year's violent clashes. Police had worked hard to ensure the Unite the Right group was well away from counter-protesters. If today showed anything, it was that a message of racism was well and truly drowned out, in more ways than one. Last year's far-right rally in Charlottesville was one of the largest gatherings of white nationalists in America in decades. The march had been organised to protest against plans to remove a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. Sunday's counter demonstration gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington Heather Heyer, 32, was killed after a neo-Nazi driver ploughed his car into a group of anti-racist protesters. Dozens of other people were injured in violence between the two groups.

Spain festival collapse injures dozens,"This video can not be played It is not yet clear what caused the platform to collapse More than 300 people have been injured, five seriously, after a section of wooden platform collapsed at an urban sports and music festival in Spain. It had been packed with people watching a rap artist at the two-day O MarisquiÃ±o event in the north-west city of Vigo, in Galicia. Police confirmed that there were no known fatalities. Witnesses reported scenes of panic as people - many of them teenagers - tried to scramble to safety. Some fell into the sea. Personal effects such as mobile phones and handbags were left scattered on the ground. Several emergency teams attended to the injured, and divers were sent into the sea to check that no-one was trapped beneath the structure. Allow Twitter content?

According to eyewitnesses, the wooden platform gave way during the first song of the concert as Rels B, who had just started his performance, told the crowd to jump, local media report. ""The floor [of the platform] dropped like a lift. It was a matter of five seconds,""Aitana Alonso told a local newspaper,external.  ""It broke and we all fell. People fell on me. I had trouble getting out. I was trying to get out and skidded, my foot got stuck, in the water. I got it out. A boy gave me his hand and I got out. I felt paralysed and [then] I left. There was a girl with blood on her head."" It is not yet clear why the platform collapsed Earlier, the regional health minister, Jesus Vazquez Almuina, told local radio about the nature of the injuries people suffered. ""These are provisional figures, patients are still being evaluated... The vast majority are light injuries for bruises. There are five hospitalisations, mainly broken bones and some head injuries,"" he told local radio. In a tweet (in Spanish),Rels B wished ""strength"" to the injured,externaland advised anyone worried about friends or relatives to contact an emergency information point set up by festival organisers. The mayor of the city, Abel Caballero, has said there will be an investigation into the causes of the incident. It is not yet clear whether the platform collapsed because there were too many people on it, or because the structure itself was weak, or whether other factors were involved. O MarisquiÃ±o is a free festival taking place outdoors in Vigo in August, attended by some 160,000 visitors. It features various cultural activities, including concerts and gastronomy, and some 10 sports competitions - including skateboarding and mountain biking - over a three-day period.

Turkey pledges action to calm markets,"Turkey's president wants manufacturers to shore up the lira by not using foreign currencies Turkey has pledged it will take action to calm markets after the lira plunged to a new record low in Asian trading. The details would be unveiled shortly, the country's finance minister told Turkish newspaper Hurriyet. ""From Monday morning onwards our institutions will take the necessary steps and will share the announcements with the market,"" Berat Albayrak said. The lira lost 20% of its value versus the dollar on Friday.  It had already fallen more than 40% in the past year. Thelatest blow came on Friday, when US President Donald Trump said he had approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium. Concerns about contagion prompted investors to sell riskier assets on Monday including emerging market currencies and stocks in Asia. Time to book a holiday? Turkey's lira slump explained Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down Mr Albayrak said the country would ""act in a speedy manner"" and its plan included help for the banks and small and medium-sized businesses most affected by the dramatic volatility in the lira. His assurance came after Turkey's president blamed the lira's plunge on a plot against the country. The pastor is only one of a number of issues dividing Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan ""What is the reason for all this storm in a tea cup? There is no economic reason... This is called carrying out an operation against Turkey,"" he said. Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again urged Turks to sell dollars and buy liras to help boost the currency. ""I am specifically addressing our manufacturers: Do not rush to the banks to buy dollars... You should know that to keep this nation standing is... also the manufacturers' duty,"" he said. Experts have blamed the drop in the lira on fears that Turkey may be falling into an economic crisis. The Turkish stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year. Meanwhile, inflation has hit 15%. Investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, as the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. Then there are Turkey's worsening relations with the US. Donald Trump's administration hit Turkey's justice and interior ministers with sanctions last week. The dispute centres on Turkey's refusal to release American pastor Andrew Brunson. Mr Brunson has been detained for nearly two years, accused him of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. Trump's decision to double US tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium has only exacerbated the situation. Not much yet.  Turkey's finance minister said they would start implementing an action plan on Monday but gave no further details. Some would like to see Turkey's central bank increase interest rates. Not only would this help contain inflation but it would also help support the lira. But there are fears that Mr Erdogan, who is famously averse to interest rate rises, may be pressuring the central bank not to act. Early last month, he claimed the exclusive power to appoint the bankers that set interest rates - and to cement his control he has put his son-in-law in charge of economic policy. Mr Erdogan favours lowering borrowing costs to fuel credit growth and economic expansion. Investors are worried that Turkish companies could struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros - a debt pile that only grows as the lira falls. Over a third of Turkish banks' lending is in foreign currencies, according to Reuters,external. Concerns about contagion were recently reinforced bya report in the Financial Times,externalsaying that the European Central Bank is concerned about the exposure of eurozone banks to Turkey. In particular, the report flags that Spain's BBVA, Italy's UniCredit and France's BNP Paribas, all of which have significant operations in Turkey, are especially exposed. Eight years ago, concerns about contagion during the eurozone debt crisis saw investors push up the borrowing costs of highly indebted eurozone countries, exacerbating their debt problems. There are already signs that contagion is spreading, with investors selling riskier assets on Monday. Emerging market currencies fell on along with the lira, while Asian stocks fell across the board.

Turkey acts in bid to curb currency crisis,"Moves to ease Turkey's economic woes have failed to stop market turmoil as the country's row with the US deepens. Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Monday that the US was seeking to ""stab it in the back"". The US last week imposed sanctions on Turkey over its refusal to extradite a US preacher imprisoned in the country. The sanctions caused market turmoil, which the central bank attempted - but failed - to soothe with a series of market-boosting measures. Mr Erdogan told a news conference in the Turkish capital, Ankara: ""You act on one side as a strategic partner, but on the other, you fire bullets into the foot of your strategic partner. ""We are together in Nato and then you seek to stab your strategic partner in the back."" The pastor is only one of a number of issues dividing Mr Trump and Mr Erdogan As the crisis deepened at the end of last week, the lira and the Turkish stock market slid sharply. Mr Erdogan, who has presided over soaring inflation and borrowing levels, says the lira's fall is the result of a plot rather than prevailing economic conditions. Turkey's interior ministry said it was taking legal action against 346 social media accounts it claimed had posted comments about the weakening lira ""in a provocative way"". Time to book a holiday? Turkey's lira slump explained Trump tariff move pushes Turkish lira down The dispute centres on Turkey's refusal to release American pastor Andrew Brunson. Mr Brunson has been detained for nearly two years, accused of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a failed coup in 2016. The Turkish president is angry that the US has not taken more action against the Gulenist movement and what he said was a failure ""to unequivocally condemn"" the 2016 coup attempt. The US has refused to extradite Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Pastor Andrew Brunson was moved to house arrest last month due to health issues US support for Kurdish rebel groups fighting Islamic State (IS) fighters in northern Syria is another major difficulty, given Turkey's battle against a Kurdish insurgency in its own country. Mr Erdogan has also been getting closer to Russia. That creates an awkward triangle, given that Turkey is a Nato member, Russia is Nato's number one threat and the organisation is obliged to defend any member that is attacked. Nato uses the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey to fight against IS and there has been some domestic pressure on Mr Erdogan to close it. The lira's worst day was Friday, when US President Donald Trump approved the doubling of tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium, following Turkey's refusal to free an American pastor who has been in detention there for nearly two years. Experts have blamed the drop in the Turkish lira on fears thatthe country is descending into an economic crisis. Turkey's stock market has also fallen 17%, while government borrowing costs have risen to 18% a year. Meanwhile, inflation has hit 15%. Investors are worried that Turkish companies that borrowed heavily to profit from a construction boom may struggle to repay loans in dollars and euros, since the weakened lira means there is now more to pay back. More than a third of Turkish banks' lending is in foreign currencies, according to Reuters,external. Although the lira rose slightly after the central bank's move to support the economy, it still hit a new record low against the dollar. Investors globally fear the damage spreading and have been prompted to sell riskier assets, including other emerging market currencies. The Turkish Central Bank announced on Monday that banks would be given all the liquidity - help to keep money moving - they needed. But the bank did not increase interest rates, which would help contain inflation while supporting the lira. It is not clear if this comes after Mr Erdogan's pressure. The president is famously averse to interest rate rises. He has dismissed the fall of the currency as ""a storm in a tea cup"" and urged Turks to sell dollars and buy lira to help boost the currency. Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent President Erdogan sees Turkey's problems as the result of a plot rather than economic fundamentals. That kind of talk might play well politically with some audiences in Turkey, but it won't wash in the markets. Turkey has underlying problems in the form of a fairly large international trade deficit, high levels of foreign currency debt owed by the private sector and a persistent inflation problem. Certainly the situation has been aggravated by the deterioration in political relations with the United States and the higher tariffs that Turkey now faces on its steel and aluminium sales in the US.  But the scale of the apparent impact was due to the fact that Turkey was already economically and financially vulnerable. Business executive Kemal, who lives in Istanbul, said: ""It is not unusual or unexpected to see some companies go under when there is such a sudden devaluation of the currency. However, I do not believe it will crumble the economy."" British holidaymaker Paul Fothergill, who is staying in Dalyan, says he has been holidaying in Turkey for the last 30 years. He said: ""Since we arrived on Thursday the Turkish lira has nosedived. It's very sad for locals and investors, but incredibly good for us, the Brits. ""You can imaging how cheap our evening meals and trips have been. The most expensive meal, including drinks and tip, so far was Â£12 for me and my wife."" Heather, a Briton who has lived in Turkey for 15 years with her family, said: ""This last year has seen ridiculous price rises and price differences in shops and supermarkets. Prices of basics like butter, cheese, fruit and vegetables are so expensive that we think twice about putting them in our baskets. ""Petrol and utilities have also seen price rises. Wages have not gone up, so we worry about where this will end. It may be beneficial for those with pounds, dollars or euros but rest of us are struggling.""

Malicious fax leaves firms open to attack,"A demo showed a malicious fax being used to take over a fax machine and display an image Booby-trapped image data sent by fax can let malicious hackers sneak into corporate networks, security researchers have found. Since many companies use fax machines that are also printers and photocopiers, they often have a connection to the internal network. The malicious images exploit protocols established in the 1980s that define the format of fax messages. The research was presented at the Def Con hacker conference in Las Vegas. The two researchers said millions of companies could be at risk because they currently did little to secure fax lines. ""Fax has no security measures built in - absolutely nothing,"" security researcher Yaniv Balmas, from Check Point software, told the BBC. Mr Balmas uncovered the security holes in the fax protocols with the help of colleague Eyal Itkin and said they were ""surprised"" by the extent to which fax was still used. ""There seems to be a lot of organisations, government agencies, banks and others that are still using fax,"" said Mr Balmas. He added that there were historical and legal reasons why the ageing technology was still so prevalent. ""Fax is still considered as visual evidence in court but an email is not,"" he said. ""That's why some government agencies require you to send a fax."" England's NHS is known to be a big user of fax machines. About 9,000 of themwere recently found to still be in use in the service. Gaining control of the machine that handles faxes, copying and printing can give attackers a foothold on a vulnerable network. They could then use this access to explore and attack the larger organisation, said Mr Balmas. The weakness emerges in the protocols that define the way the data making up fax messages should be prepared. ""The protocols we use for fax were standardised in the 1980s and have not been changed since,"" Mr Balmas said. Doctors are using old-fashioned fax machines to communicate This weakness let the pair craft an image that harboured a malicious payload. For their test case, the payload used was a software exploit known as Eternal Blue, which was behind the massive WannaCry attack last year. The fax protocols were poorly worded, which had led to them being interpreted in different ways by different manufacturers, said Mr Balmas. And this had contributed to the vulnerabilities in the fax system. In particular, the researchers found problems with the way the protocols were used in some multi-purpose printers made by HP that are widely used in the business world. HP has now issued a patch for its printers, which will close the loopholes found by the pair. But, said Mr Balmas, because fax numbers were very widely shared, they could be an easy-to-find attack route for malicious hackers who targeted different machines. So far, there is no evidence that malicious hackers are using the booby-trapped images to penetrate otherwise well defended networks.

Heathrow passport queues reach 2.5 hours,"The boss of Virgin Atlantic, which obtained the data, called on the government to fix the long queues Delays at Heathrow Airport passport control left passengers queuing for up to two and a half hours last month, figures show. On 30 of 31 days in July, Border Force missed its target of a 45-minute wait or less for 95% of visitors from outside the European Economic Area. Virgin Atlantic, which obtained the data, said passengers were ""frustrated"". The government said it would send 200 extra staff to Heathrow this summer. According to the data, the longest immigration queues were on 6 July when travellers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) - an area made up of 31 European countries - had to wait in line for up to two hours and 38 minutes. BA boss demands action on Heathrow queues BBC's Gardner left stuck on plane again Reality Check: Would a 'no deal' Brexit prevent planes flying? Craig Kreeger, the boss of Virgin Atlantic, said while it was agreed that security and safety was a priority, other countries were managing their borders better than the UK. He said ""only the Border Force"" could take action to ""resolve these unacceptable queue times"". ""At a time when the UK needs to show the world it is open for business, the government and Border Force need to provide a great first impression for every visitor every time,"" he said. Non-EEA citizens cannot use the electronic gates, which run a face recognition check and passport scan Citizens aged 12 or over from the European Union, the EEA and Switzerland can use the electronic gates atHeathrow's passport control,external- but visitors from all other countries must have their passports checked by a Border Force official. Michael Klein, an art dealer from New York who regularly travels through Heathrow, described his experiences of the airport as ""just horrendous"". Mr Klein, 66, told the BBC he had queued for two hours or more at passport control on three occasions in the past month alone. ""There's absolutely no accommodations made for families or elderly. No one seems to care,"" he added. John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's chief executive, has previously called for the Home Office to allow visitors from ""low risk countries"" - like the US, he suggests - to be allowed to use the electronic gates. Last week the boss of British Airways, Alex Cruz,wrote a letter to the Timesurging the government to deal with Heathrow's ""border farce"". He said ""two-hour queues are fast becoming the norm"" and Heathrow had missed its target for non-EEA arrivals 6,000 times so far this year. BBC reporter Jenny Kumah said the Home Office explained its poor performance in July was worsened by a ""large numbers of vulnerable adults and children arriving"", alongside a number of computer errors. A Home Office spokesman said: ""The vast majority of people who arrive at Heathrow get through the border within our service standards. ""But we understand the frustration for those who have experienced longer waits and remain fully committed to working with our partners to reduce waiting times as far as is possible. ""At the same time, we will not compromise the essential checks we carry out at the border which keep our country safe. ""We are making sure Border Force has the resources it needs and are deploying 200 additional staff at Heathrow over the summer.""

Watchdog 'lets down' 999 van death family,"The Yalcin family said the loss of their son was like the loss of a limb A man whose brother was run over by a Met police van on a 999 call has said his family has lost trust in the police complaints regulator. He said the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has failed to collect and disclose key evidence during its investigation. Suleyman Yalcin was struck and killed by the van in Haringey, north London, last December. The IOPC said it had carried out a thorough, independent investigation. Sinasi Yalcin, Suleyman's brother, said his death was like the loss of a limb to his parents. ""We would watch our football team with him, in a pub or at home, we would have a drink together. I miss that,"" he explained. Mr Yalcin said he was concerned evidence was not being properly gathered and disclosed to them or their representatives by the IOPC. ""Firstly we trusted the IOPC, and then step by step, we lost our confidence in them, before losing it completely. Suleyman was killed by a police van in December ""We are looking for justice and truth. That is all the family want."" A Freedom of Information request sent by the BBC shows the IOPC has faced 17 complaints since it was established in January, when it replaced the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The IPCC had also been criticised for the way it had conducted its investigations. Its report into the death of Sean Rigg, who died in police custody in 2008, was criticised in an external review for making ""basic mistakes"" such as failing to properly investigate CCTV. In one partially upheld complaint, the IOPC was alleged to have failed to keep interested parties updated, harassed individuals by searching their address at Christmas, and faced criticism for delays in the investigation process. In another partially upheld case, the IOPC's report and press release on a case were criticised in a complaint. Four complaints have been dismissed, while the remaining 11 are still ongoing, including further allegations of delays, errors in reports and failures to gather evidence properly. Deborah Coles of Inquest, a charity that campaigns on incidents of state-related death, said Mr Yalcin's case suggested systemic failures in the investigation process were continuing. ""We need to ensure we have an independent police watchdog that's able to handle complaints, wrongdoing and abuses of power, and is also themselves accountable for their own actions,"" she said. Met corruption claims investigated by IOPC Man died after falling ill in police van Deborah Coles said the IOPC must avoid the investigative failings of the past The IOPC said it carried out a thorough, independent investigation into Mr Yalcin's death. ""We have made every effort to involve the family in our investigation. Our thoughts remain with them and all of those affected,"" it said. It said the police van's dashcam and data recorder were analysed, as well as CCTV from two buses and accounts from 11 witnesses, and the coroner had been complimentary of its conduct. Concerning the complaints, the IOPC said it was committed to providing the highest possible standard of service and where complaints were made it fully investigated.

Muslims warn PM against Johnson 'whitewash',"This video can not be played Why Boris Johnson's comments have sparked an internal Conservative Party investigation The UK's largest Muslim organisation is calling on Theresa May to ensure the inquiry into Boris Johnson's burka comments is not a ""whitewash"". According tothe Guardian,,externalthe Muslim Council of Britain will tell the prime minister ""no-one should be allowed to victimise minorities with impunity"". Mr Johnsonis facing an investigationafter saying women in burkas looked like ""letter boxes"" or ""bank robbers"". He did not respond to the row in his latest newspaper column. Why some Muslim women wear the veil Watchdog criticises Johnson's burka comments UKIP burka comments 'cowardly' The Muslim Council of Britain's letter, seen by the Guardian, said it was ""hopeful"" that the party ""will not allow any whitewashing of this specific inquiry currently in process"". The council previously said the support shown to Mr Johnson from Tory MPs had ""shone a light on the underbelly of Islamophobia"" within the party. A woman wearing a burka protests near Mr Johnson's constituency office The organisation added that it had received Islamophobic hate mail referring to former foreign secretary Mr Johnson's comments. Meanwhile, the Tell Mama project, which monitors anti-Muslim violence, reported an increase in incidents of abuse aimed at women wearing the niqab or hijab over the past week. Mr Johnson - who returned home from his holiday in Italy over the weekend - has not yet responded to the row. In hislatest column in Monday's Daily Telegraph,external- one week on from hisoriginal comments,externalabout the Muslim full-face veil - Mr Johnson did not mention the issue but instead chose to write about housing. Earlier, herefused to answerthe questions of journalists waiting outside his Oxfordshire home, saying he had ""nothing to say about this matter"" except to offer out cups of tea. The Conservative Party launched its disciplinary investigation after receiving dozens of complaints about Mr Johnson's remarks. Mrs May and Conservative chairman Brandon Lewis have called on him to apologise. This video can not be played ""There's no reason to insult people in that way,"" one woman told the BBC's Asian Network But others - including Brexiteer backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg and comedian Rowan Atkinson - have expressed support. According to a ComRes poll for the Sunday Express, 53% of people who responded believe Mr Johnson should not be disciplined for his comments. The complaints against him are being looked at by an investigating officer, who can dismiss them if they are found to be obviously trivial, lacking in merit or unable to be fairly investigated. Communities and Local Government Secretary James Brokenshire told BBC Breakfast: ""There is an ongoing investigation in relation to complaints that have been made over Boris's comments last week. I think that's the right approach."" He added ""I would certainly have not chosen the words that Boris used,"" but would not comment on it further during the investigation. Should they be upheld, the complaints will then be looked at by an independent panel which could refer Mr Johnson to the party's board, which has the power to expel him. On Friday, in a separate investigation into a complaint, theUK's equalities watchdog saidMr Johnson's remarks were ""inflammatory and divisive"" and his comments risked ""vilifying Muslim women"".

Extreme weather hits grouse shooting season,"Scotland's gamekeepers are expecting a poor grouse shooting season this year. Late snow in March followed by warm dry weather in May, June and July has affected the number of birds breeding successfully. This means some estates are cancelling shooting days to preserve future stocks. The grouse season in Scotland is estimated to be worth Â£32m each year. The bad season is likely to have a knock on effect for tourism. Scottish Gamekeepers Association chairman Alex Hogg said his members, however, will still deliver millions of pounds of ""free"" conservation measures despite the poor shooting season. ""Someone ultimately has to pick up the tab for conservation because it is expensive,"" he said. ""Our members are out every day in all weathers controlling predators and undertaking habitat work at landscape scale. ""This protects game species - the business model - so some of the income comes back, but it also benefits an array of species particularly the many threatened ground-nesting birds we now have in Scotland. ""This year, sadly, it looks like we will welcome less international shots for the grouse and that will squeeze the money available for estates to pay for everything else. ""But the management still goes on every day, without diverting public cash the government needs away from other priorities like schools, roads and hospitals."" The grouse season in Scotland is estimated to be worth Â£32m each year. Sporting shooting supports 11,000 full-time jobs in the country, of which 2,640 are in the grouse sector. The Gift of Grouse campaign aims to highlight the importance of grouse shooting for Scotland and the economic, leisure, tourism and conservation benefits. A campaign spokeswoman said: ""The unpredictability of this iconic wild bird is part of what makes grouse shooting so sought-after at an international level and such an important element of the field sports tourism offer of Scotland. ""Grouse can bounce back remarkably quickly in the right weather conditions, so moor managers are careful to maintain their breeding stock ready for that recovery, hopefully next year."" Conservation groups such as RSPB Scotland have held the shooting industry to account over its management practises. Amid tensions over the alleged persecution of birds of prey by the industry, it has advocated the introduction of a licensing system to regulate estates. Shooting season for the game bird usually begins each year on August 12, known as the Glorious Twelfth, but will start this year on Monday as the traditional date fell on Sunday.

Deported rough sleepers win damages,"This video can not be played Tomas Lusas, a Lithuanian national, was awarded Â£10,000 after being illegally detained The government is to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds to European rough sleepers who were illegally detained and deported. Figures obtained by the BBC reveal that in the year to May 2017, 698 homeless EU nationals were targeted and removed from the country. The Home Office said no further action was being taken against European citizens for rough sleeping. Law firms told the BBC that at least 45 clients were currently pursuing claims. Each claim is worth thousands of pounds, and varies according to the length of time spent in detention as well as other aggravating factors. Tomas Lusas, from Lithuania, was arrested by immigration officers in 2016 after being kicked out of his home and forced onto the streets in west London. He said: ""One morning I was woken up in my sleeping bag. There were six or seven officers and they said 'Home Office'. ""They took my ID. Two minutes later I was in handcuffs. Two minutes after that I was in a van. ""I was shouting, 'I'm gonna lose my job if you arrest me today'. But nobody listened to me. Nobody allowed me to explain why I was sleeping rough."" Mr Lusas refused to sign his removal papers and was detained at Brook House Immigration Centre in Gatwick for 19 days. ""It was like being in jail,"" he said. ""Your freedom is taken away. And what kills you is that you don't know the end of your sentence. ""I've spent nine years of my life in England and I didn't want to leave just because I was sleeping rough."" Mr Lusas appealed against his deportation and was successful. He was later awarded more than Â£10,000 in damages. The Home Office under Theresa May introduced the concept of rough sleeping as an abuse of EU treaty rights two years ago. But immigration enforcement teams were targeting rough sleepers even if they were in work or had a permanent right of residence in the UK. The policy was halted aftera judicial review in Decemberruled it to be unlawful and discriminatory. Leonie Hirst, an immigration and public law barrister, said anyone from the EU or the European Economic Area who had been detained or deported in similar circumstances could now make a potential claim. ""The EU law is clear and very robust, but the policy was a very flimsy attempt to misuse the law, simply to meet immigration targets,"" she said. ""I think it is highly unlikely, particularly given that people were targeted who were working, that this policy has done anything except cost significant amounts of public money."" Ms Hirst said she had heard evidence that immigration teams were working to quotas. She said she had seen cases where officials were ignoring the usual practice of inquiring into individual circumstances before deciding whether to remove them. ""One of my clients told immigration officers that he had payslips with him to prove he was working, and he had the response, 'we don't want to see those, we're operating quotas',"" she said. A Home Office spokesperson said that ""claims for compensation will be considered on a case-by-case basis"" and that the government was ""determined to break the homelessness cycle"".

UK 'could end homelessness in a decade',"The UK could see an end to homelessness within 10 years if the government embraces certain policies, according to the homeless charity Crisis. In a newly-published report,external, Crisis sets out a comprehensive plan to make homelessness ""a thing of the past"". It says 100,500 social homes need to be built each year for the next 15 years. ""We must not become a society that simply accepts homelessness as 'a sad fact of life'... it doesn't have to be this way,"" said Crisis's Jon Sparkes. The charity estimates that there are currently 236,000 homeless people across England, Wales and Scotland, including those living in unsuitable temporary accommodation. Their report, Everybody In: How To End Homelessness In Great Britain, follows work with the Chartered Institute of Housing, Heriot-Watt University, the National Housing Federation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). The findings, endorsed by experts from around the world, include the following proposals: 100,500 social homes to be built annually for the next 15 years to meet the needs of the homeless and those on low incomes A national roll-out of Housing First, which aims to provide more than 18,000 homeless people with homes and a package of specialised support Better rights for private renters and a reform to housing benefit, to protect people once they have been housed Hospitals, prisons, the care system, and other parts of the state to be legally required to help find homes for those leaving their care Job Centres to have homelessness specialists ""For the first time ever, we have a comprehensive plan that shows exactly how we can address the root causes of homelessness and make it a thing of the past,"" said Mr Sparkes, chief executive of Crisis. ""Other parts of the world are taking huge strides towards ending it, and Britain can too."" The call for funding for new homes is also being backed by the Local Government Association, which represents local authorities in England. After his long-term relationship ended, things spiralled for Tony. ""I lost my job, my relationship, my home and eventually ended up on the streets,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. For two years he was sleeping in cardboard boxes and doorways in central London. ""It was quite hellish,"" he said. ""For the first six months it was absolutely numbing. It was a total sensory perception shut down."" The biggest barrier to him finding help was himself. ""My self esteem just disappeared,"" he said. ""I felt embarrassed, ashamed, I was very depressed and at some stages contemplated suicide."" But eventually he did get help and, with the support of Crisis, now has a home and a job working for a local council's housing advice and homelessness team. ""It's been an absolute turnaround,"" he said.

The spokesman highlighted last week's announcement of Â£30m for councils ""to help boost support available to people living on the streets"".

New ÃÂ£30m fund to help rough sleepers,"Councils in England with high levels of rough sleepers will soon receive a share of a new Â£30m fund. A team of experts will be formed by government to help reduce the number of people living on the street, which has been rising for the last seven years. The measures aim to ""break the homelessness cycle once and for all"", the government said. Labour dismissed the initiative as a ""pitiful response to a national crisis"". But Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC he was ""absolutely committed"" to reducing homelessness. ""People can look at ministers like me and say 'are they really going to do this?'"" Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast. ""Judge us by the actual actions and this is real action that is going to help people."" Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler hassaid she would resignif the problem of rough sleeping worsens while she is in office. Homeless man found dead 'on doorstep' of Parliament Rough sleeping in England rises for seventh year Homeless in the snow: 'I hope I wake up' There were 4,751 people counted or estimated to be bedding down outside in autumn 2017, a 15% rise on the year before and more than double the figure recorded five years ago.

From April, councils in England will be legally obliged to provide services to anyone at risk of becoming homeless, not just those with a priority need such as vulnerable people or families with children. The Homelessness Reduction Bill will oblige councils to start assessing someone at risk of being made homeless 56 days before losing their home. Currently, the threat of homelessness is defined as starting 28 days before the person loses their home. Homeless by the sea Almost 30,000 lone parent families made homeless New homelessness law: What impact will it have? Greg Beales, campaigns director at homelessness charity Shelter, said that while the new measures would make ""a genuine difference"", most people become homeless because they cannot afford anywhere to live - ""a situation made far worse by welfare cuts"". The government's strategy should include ""building more social homes to rent, and making sure housing benefit is fit for purpose,"" he added.

AssadÃ¢ÂÂs momentum,"A shop in the old city of Damascus sells flags of the World Cup teams Damascus feels different. The centre of the city was barely damaged in the last seven years of war, unlike many of the suburbs, which have been turned into rubble. But the soundtrack of the war almost always accompanied daily life: air and artillery strikes on the suburbs, and much less powerfully, shelling coming from the rebel forces. However, since the fall of Eastern Ghouta, the big rebel enclave on the edge of Damascus in the spring, all that has changed. The war is still in the minds of the people, dominating lives. But physically it is elsewhere, concentrated at the moment in the south, close to the border with Jordan and the boundary with the Golan Heights, Syrian territory occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. In the Christian quarter of the old walled city, the narrow streets and narrower alleys are packed with people. Shops and restaurants are open and busy. Bars have big screens ready for another evening of games at the World Cup. Cafes in Damascus are showing World Cup matches Back in March, when I was here last, I interviewed a teenage girl whose leg had been blown off by a mortar, fired from rebel positions, which landed in the same streets. A much heavier weight of fire was directed at Eastern Ghouta - at the rebels who controlled it, and the civilians who had the bad luck to be living there. The fire came from the Syrian Arab Army, its allied militias and its Russian allies. It is now possible, with official permission and a military escort, to visit the ruins of Eastern Ghouta. Damage is everywhere. The areas closest to the front lines are worst. Concrete blocks of flats, half a dozen or so storeys high, are smashed and perforated by shell holes, and often gutted by fire too. Why is there a war in Syria? Southern Syria fighting displaces 270,000 War crimes committed in Syria battle - UN The main armed group in Eastern Ghouta, Jaish al-Islam, constructed an alternative subterranean life. It dug tunnels that linked concrete basements. The workmanship was remarkable, considering the tunnels were built in an enclave that was effectively under siege from the end of 2011 to only a few months ago. Some of the tunnels are big enough for a medium-sized van to be driven along them. An underground hospital that was packed with the dead and the dying during the worst of the shelling is still open, under the flags of Syria and Russia. It still functions, treating children who have hurt themselves playing on bomb sites. One of the tunnels built under Eastern Ghouta In the end, Jaish al-Islam's organisation was not enough to resist the tenacity and ruthlessness of the Syrian armed forces, and the firepower of the Russians. In the last few years most of the armed groups in Syria lost the backing of outside powers. Earlier in the war, the US, Britain, as well as Turkey, the Saudis and Qatar, to varying degrees, helped train and arm rebels who wanted to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Everything changed after 2015,when Russia intervened decisively in the war. The men who built the tunnels under Eastern Ghouta expected to win. They were wrong, though for a while it looked as if they might be right. But with the fall of Eastern Ghouta, and a few other small enclaves around Damascus, the regime has built up formidable momentum. President Assad and his generals have been ostracised and sanctioned by the Western world, the Saudis and others. But after seven years they are closing in on victory in the conflict that started in March 2011 in Deraa, south of Damascus on the border with Jordan. The town is now the focus of an offensive by government troops, supported by the Russians. They are aiming to recapture a broad section of southern Syria from the rebels. Leaflets have been seen in Deraa, referring back to the first demonstrations, stating that the uprising began in the city and it would be buried there. Control of south-western Syria (27 June 2018) At the time of writing, something like 270,000 civilians (according to UN figures) have been displaced by the fighting. They are not being allowed into Jordan, or the Golan Heights. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross have issued grave warnings about the threat to life. The Syrian army's tactics are now familiar. Heavy military pressure is accompanied by talks for ""reconciliation"", which is another word for a negotiated surrender. Some groups that have opposed the regime for years are complying. Others insist they will fight on. It is hard to see how the battle can be sustained for more than a short time against the firepower of the Syrian army and the Russians. Behind the fighting is a bigger reality. The Assad regime believes it has almost finished off its enemies. It cannot do much aboutthe big powers who have troops in parts of Syria, particularly Turkey, the United States and their allies. But the armed groups who claim descent from the first demonstrators in Deraa in March 2011 are fighting their last battles. Syria's bloodshed, Syria's wars, its smashed cities, continue to break lives. But the Assad regime's fight for survival is almost done.

Guards accused of assaults at prison,"Lowdham Grange is a category B prison with about 900 inmates Allegations have emerged of assaults by prison officers on inmates following several outbreaks of violence at a Nottinghamshire jail. Relatives of three prisoners contacted the BBC to complain about conditions at HMP Lowdham Grange. One said she was told a handcuffed inmate had been thrown down stairs and others ""pulled from cells and punched"". Serco, which runs the prison, said it had received no complaints about officers assaulting prisoners. Lowdham Grange was ""peaceful and operating to its normal regime"", it added. The allegations have been made against a background of rising violence at Lowdham over the past few years. The latest prison inspection, in 2015, concluded use of force by staff ""was very high"" and not always ""fully justified or warranted"". Inmates' relatives said mistreatment of prisoners had raised tensions and caused the recent outbreaks of disorder. However, the Independent Monitoring Board - which sends volunteers to observe day-to-day life inside prisons - said it had been ""impressed by the efficient, calm and humane way"" in which serious incidents were tackled. It also highlighted ""concerted indiscipline"" by groups of prisoners. The BBC has asked Serco what caused the recent disturbances but it has not responded to the question. Violencefirst broke out at Lowdham, in Nottinghamshire, on 26 July. One woman, whose brother is an inmate, said he told her: A handcuffed prisoner was thrown down a metal flight of stairs Inmates not involved in the disorder were ""pulled out of their cells and punched"" Stun grenades or ""flashbangs"" were used against prisoners She added that, according to her brother: ""Officers had balaclavas on so no-one would be able to recognise them."" She alleged the violence broke out after inmates complained about ""racist"" comments from guards. There wasfurther disorder at the prison on 31 July. The sister of a second inmate said her brother was locked in his cell for 24 hours without food as a result of ""staff shortages"" caused by the incident. She also alleged that: In many cases, new inmates were not seen by the prison's healthcare team ""for weeks"" The prison was unaware of her brother's food allergies, and his ""breathing was compromised"" Instances of staff-on-inmate or inmate-on-inmate violence were common Her brother witnessed self-harm or suicide attempts every day Complaints were often not taken seriously unless a prisoner behaved badly or harmed themselves The prison is nicknamed ""Lowdham Strange"" because of the amount of inmates with mental health issues On 6 August,there was another disturbance, which - according to two complainants - was a result of tensions caused by inmates being ""locked down"" during a water leak affecting the prison. One woman, whose son is an inmate at Lowdham, said she had been told staff often beat inmates to ""manipulate"" them, with some needing hospital treatment. She also said prisoners were kept in their cells for longer than the recommended time and ""paid off in phone credit to keep them quiet"". According to government guidelines, prisoners should be able to spend between 30 minutes and an hour outside in the open air each day. Low staffing levels at Lowdham made management of prisoners difficult, said the Independent Monitoring Board The company said the three disturbances over the past three weeks were unrelated and ""were on different wings and each of them only involved a handful of prisoners"". In relation to the disorder on 26 July, a spokesman said ""a maximum of six prisoners"" had been involved in ""concerted indiscipline"" which was contained in the wing and no-one was injured. He added: ""There were no punches thrown. We don't go into specific tactics used, but it was resolved peacefully."" Serco said the disturbance on 31 July was further ""concerted indiscipline by a small group of six prisoners on one of the wings"" which was ""peacefully resolved"" and involved only a small number of prisoners, and that no-one was injured. It said the 6 August disorder was ""small"" and ""over in five minutes"". In response to the prisoners' other allegations, Mark Hanson, Serco's contract director at HMP Lowdham Grange, said: ""There have been three recent minor incidents of concerted indiscipline at the prison and officers have intervened professionally and effectively to bring each of them to a close, using standard procedures and equipment. ""The safety of everyone at the prison is our first priority. We take a zero tolerance to any violent behaviour and we will work with the police to prosecute any individuals committing acts of violence."" Serco said there had been no complaints about officers assaulting prisoners and any such complaints would be referred to the police as a matter of course. It also said it had received no allegations of racism from inmates. Inspectors uncover serious failings at Birmingham prison Lincolnshire prison refers to inmates as 'residents' Norwich Prison officers 'still being attacked' The number of assaults at Lowdham Grange, which has a capacity for about 900 inmates, has risen every year since 2009. In 2017, there were 318 assaults - up from 237 the year before, and more than double the amount in 2014. On average, this amounts to 3.6 assaults for every 10 prisoners. About two thirds were ""prisoner-on-prisoner"", while the others were assaults on staff. In 2017, there were 402 incidents of self-harm, up from 288 the year before. A further 162 took place in the first three months of 2018. There were two prisoner deaths in 2017 and one in June 2018. Serco would not say how many prison officers were based at Lowdham. In a 2015 report,external, HM Inspector of Prisons said levels of violence against staff and prisoners had risen since a 2011 inspection, and were much higher than similar establishments. The report outlined how safety had deteriorated and the ""levels of violence between prisoners and towards staff were high and too much of it was serious"". It also found the ""use of force was very high"" and the inspectors were not assured it ""was always fully justified or warranted and not all incidents were de-escalated as quickly as they might have been"". Levels of self-harm had risen and were higher than comparable prisons and there were ""unacceptable waiting times to see health professionals"". It highlighted that prisoners had ""little confidence in the complaints system"" and the jail received more complaints than similar prisons. Inspectors also found examples of complaints that were not fully investigated and responded to. Inspectors said they were not assured that use of force ""was always fully justified or warranted"" The IMB's latest annual report found ""levels of violence between prisoners and, on occasions towards staff were of concern"". It said: ""Injuries sustained by prisoners were sometimes quite serious and required hospital treatment. Assaults on staff were rarer but still occurred and sometimes required hospital treatment."" The report, published in June, also said a ""command suite"" was opened to co-ordinate the management of ""serious incidents"" on at least 25 occasions during the year. It said these incidents included prisoners balancing over railings, building barricades, ""concerted indiscipline"" by groups of prisoners and apparent hostage situations. The board said it observed some of these and was ""impressed by the efficient, calm and humane way in which the incidents were managed"". Board members said the ""worryingly high"" use of psychoactive substances was one cause of violent behaviour. The report also pointed out low staffing levels made management of prisoners difficult, and said ""the proportion of inexperienced staff contributed to challenging atmospheres on some wings"". It said: ""Staffing was seldom at the agreed level during the year. However the board noted that considerable efforts were made to maintain the full regime."" The board also raised concerns about the number of prisoners with mental health issues who were kept in segregation for extended periods of time and was concerned about the number of prisoners who chose to remain behind their doors during the day. In addition, the building where the majority of healthcare services are delivered was unfit for purpose, the report said. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: ""This has been a long hot summer, and it sounds like Lowdham Grange has problems. Perhaps it is time for the inspectorate to conduct an inspection, as only one report has been published on the prison in the last seven years. ""This illustrates how prisons can deteriorate very quickly. They also show how important it is for prisons to have robust and imaginative management and careful oversight of staff."" A HM Inspectorate of Prisons spokesman said inspections took place every three or four years and they were not announced. He said intelligence files were kept on all prisons. ""When they are assessing whether there should be an inspection scheduled, they look at what information is available. ""It will always be on a case by case basis,"" he said.
