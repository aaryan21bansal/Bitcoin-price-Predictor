New cabinet: Who is in Liz Truss's top team?,"Prime Minister Liz Truss has appointed her new cabinet, hours after taking over at 10 Downing Street. For the first time none of the ""great offices of state"" is held by a white man, with Suella Braverman as home secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and James Cleverly as foreign secretary. Here is a guide to the new faces and role changes. Liz Truss became prime minister on 6 September 2022, replacing Boris Johnson who was in post for slightly more than three years. She was not the first choice of Conservative MPs - but she was the clear winner in a ballot of Tory members, who had the final say. Truss has been a government minister since 2012, and held cabinet posts under David Cameron, Theresa May and Johnson, most recently as foreign secretary. A Remain supporter at the 2016 EU referendum, who began her political journey at Oxford University as a Liberal Democrat, she is now an enthusiastic Brexiteer who has vowed to get back to traditional tax-cutting Tory values. Truss, who has two children, was elected to Parliament as MP for South West Norfolk in 2010 after serving as deputy director of think tank Reform. ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey has been appointed health secretary, taking over from Stephen Barclay who had only been in the role for two months, and will also be deputy prime minister. The former work and pensions secretary is a long-time friend of Liz Truss and was closely involved in her leadership campaign. Coffey, who was elected MP for Suffolk Coastal in 2010, previously served in a number of roles including environment minister, Commons deputy leader and assistant whip. A devout Roman Catholic, she was asked about her views on abortion after the recent US Supreme Court ruling and said the law was not going to change in the UK - although she added she would prefer people not to have abortions. The former Mars and BBC employee is a member of the Campaign for Real Ale with a love of karaoke, and lists her interests as watching football, gardening and music. Kwasi Kwarteng was chancellor for 38 days before being asked by the prime minister to stand aside after a turbulent few weeks for the UK economy. The former business secretary is a close friend and ally of Liz Truss, and backed her successful leadership campaign. But his ""mini-budget"" pledging Â£45bn of tax cuts, funded by borrowing, was followed by market turbulence and an intervention from the Bank of England. His departure means he is the second shortest-serving UK chancellor since the Second World War. Kwarteng, who got a scholarship to Eton and studied at Cambridge, worked in finance before his time in politics, and has written a book about the legacy of the British Empire. James Cleverly is the new foreign secretary, taking over Liz Trussâs former department. It wonât be a totally new department for him - heâs been a foreign minister before, for the Middle East and North Africa, and later for Europe and North America. He most recently served as education secretary under Boris Johnson. Cleverly was in the Territorial Army and went to Sandhurst and, outside of work, enjoys painting model soldiers and hanging out with his border terriers. Heâll have a busy brief ahead as foreign secretary with the ongoing war in Ukraine and the UK governmentâs current plans to override parts of the Northern Ireland protocol â part of the Brexit deal agreed with the EU. Suella Braverman has nabbed one of the âgreat offices of stateâ as home secretary, tasked with things like the plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. Sheâs a barrister who was previously the attorney general and ran to be the leader herself in the Tory leadership contest. Her parents emigrated to the UK in the 1960s from Kenya and Mauritius, and both spent time in local politics â with her mother being a councillor for 16 years. She has two children, studied law at Cambridge, and loves sushi. Braverman was the first cabinet minister to take maternity leave â after the law was changed so that cabinet ministers could receive paid maternity leave, having previously been expected to resign their posts. Ben Wallace remains the defence secretary, a post he's held since July 2019. While almost all the other posts have seen a big mix-up, this continuity was anticipated given he's been leading the response to the war in Ukraine. He's popular with Tory members - and was once considered a favourite to replace Boris Johnson - but chose not to stand in the leadership contest. While some of the characters in Truss's new cabinet are more divisive in the Tory party, Wallace is pretty widely respected across the parliamentary party with many colleagues seeing him as a safe pair of hands. During his eight-year spell in the Army, he served in Germany, Cyprus, Belize and Northern Ireland - where he helped thwart an IRA bomb attack. Nadhim Zahawi has been a fast riser in the party - gaining support and public recognition in his role as vaccines minister during the pandemic. As chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster he'll be responsible for running the Cabinet Office, the department that supports the prime minister and basically helps departments work together better on issues that involve more than one. He'll also be the equalities minister. Zahawi was previously chancellor of the exchequer but for only two months - having been promoted when Rishi Sunak resigned - and pretty swiftly afterwards said Boris Johnson should resign. He's a former child refugee who fled Iraq with his parents in the 1970s and co-founded the market research firm YouGov. He is now believed to be one of the richest politicians in the Commons. Simon Clarke has been promoted to the full cabinet as levelling up, housing and communities secretary, taking over from Greg Clark, who replaced Michael Gove in July. He was previously chief secretary to the Treasury but chose to support Liz Truss for the leadership rather than his former boss Rishi Sunak. The MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland was previously a minister in the housing, communities and local government department and describes himself as a lifelong Boro fan. Clarke, who has agoraphobia, is a qualified solicitor who worked as a policy specialist on health and education before being elected in 2017. Jacob Rees-Mogg has been given the role of business (and energy) secretary and his appointment certainly signals the potential direction of travel for this government. One of the Conservative Party's highest profile Brexiteers - previously in cabinet as Brexit opportunities and government efficiency minister - he's very pro-deregulation of business and wants to remove a host of rules and regulations post-Brexit. He's also been a critic in the past of what he's called âclimate alarmismâ and has been very pro-fracking. One of the first MPs to back Liz Truss for the leadership, Rees-Mogg set up his own investment management company in 2007, is a father-of-six, and describes himself as an avid cricket fan. Kemi Badenoch has entered the cabinet as international trade secretary after surprising many by reaching the last four in the leadership contest. The former minister in the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities and equalities minister, who did not endorse any of her rivals in the leadership race, replaces Anne-Marie Trevelyan. Badenoch, who has been outspoken on issues such as gender-neutral toilets which she opposes, stood on an ""anti-woke"" platform and argued for the state to be slimmed down. The former software engineer worked in banking and later as a director of the Spectator magazine before being elected to the London Assembly. She became MP for Saffron Walden in Essex in 2017, and lists her interests as including engineering and technology, social mobility and integration. Chloe Smith replaces new Health Secretary ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey as work and pensions secretary. She had been a minister in the department since September 2021 and was an early supporter of Liz Trussâs leadership bid. In June 2021 the mother-of-two announced she had been given the all clear from breast cancer after her diagnosis the previous November and says she is now back to full health and full of energy. A keen cyclist, Smith highlights her interest in transport and her work to help reduce youth unemployment in her constituency of Norwich North. Before entering parliament in 2009 - following a by-election sparked by the resignation of the sitting Labour MP after the expenses scandal - she worked for accountancy and professional service firm Deloitte. Alok Sharma will stay on as president for COP26, the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference, working in the Cabinet Office. This is pretty expected - as the role will expire soon. But what will be interesting to watch is how he leaves when it does. He's previously warned he would ""quit"" if the new prime minister scraps any of the UK's commitments to net zero. The new Business and Energy Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has previously expressed scepticism at the need to fight climate change, so this new working relationship will be one to watch. Brandon Lewis is in the cabinet for a third time, this time in the role of justice secretary, replacing Dominic Raab. The former Northern Ireland secretary, who resigned in July, initially backed Nadhim Zahawi for the leadership but endorsed Liz Truss at the start of August. He had previously been party chairman and minister without portfolio in Theresa Mayâs cabinet and served as a minister in several departments under May, David Cameron, Boris Johnson. A qualified barrister and former company director, Lewis was a borough councillor in Brentwood for 10 years - five as leader - before entering parliament. The father-of-two, who became Great Yarmouth MP in 2010, took up triathlon the year after he was elected and has completed two London Marathons. Kit Malthouse replaces new Foreign Secretary James Cleverly as education secretary. The former chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, responsible for running the Cabinet Office, did not say who he was supporting in the leadership race. He came to the fore in the Brexit debate, when his name was put to a so-called compromise plan to replace Theresa May's proposed Northern Ireland backstop with ""alternative arrangements"". Malthouse was a deputy mayor of London from 2008, serving under Boris Johnson, and became MP for North West Hampshire in 2015. A chartered accountant who has run a number of small businesses, the father-of-three lists his interests as including gardening, reading and watching modern dance. Ranil Jayawardena has become environment secretary, taking over from George Eustice. He was previously a minister in the international trade department, working for Liz Truss before she became foreign secretary, and was an early supporter of her leadership bid. Jayawardena, who has three children, used to work for Lloyds Bank and was also a councillor in Hampshire. He entered the Commons as MP for North East Hampshire in 2015. Anne-Marie Trevelyan has become transport secretary, replacing Grant Shapps. She had previously been international trade secretary, replacing Liz Truss in the role in 2021, and before that had been international development secretary but lost her place in the cabinet when the department was scrapped. An outspoken Brexiteer who resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in 2018 in protest at Theresa Mayâs Brexit withdrawal deal, she supported Truss in the leadership race. The former chartered accountant entered the Commons as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2015 and describes herself as having a passion for singing. Chris Heaton-Harris has been promoted to the cabinet as Northern Ireland secretary, replacing Shailesh Vara who only took on the role in July. The former chief whipâs new position was one that initially proved hard to fill, and certainly is regarded by some as a bit of a poisoned chalice right now - the nation is currently without a functioning devolved government. One of his key priorities will be resolving tensions over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the Brexit deal that Liz Truss wants to override - which the DUP has argued is necessary if it is to re-enter into power sharing in Northern Ireland. The qualified football referee describes himself as a fierce Eurosceptic but may well need to engage with the EU in negotiations about this. Before becoming a politician, Heaton-Harris ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. Alister Jack remains secretary of state for Scotland in Liz Trussâs first cabinet, a role he has held since Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019. The former government whip did not reveal who he supported in the leadership contest. Before entering parliament as MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017, Jack was a businessman who founded tent-hire and self-storage companies. Jack, who has three grown up children, is also a dairy farmer and grows Christmas trees. Robert Buckland remains secretary of state for Wales, continuing in the role he took on after Simon Hartâs resignation in July. The former barrister had previously been in the cabinet, as justice secretary, between July 2019 and September 2021 and is also a former solicitor general. He previously backed Rishi Sunak for Tory leader, before switching to Liz Truss, which made him some foes among Sunak's camp who accused him privately of serving his own interests. He is Welsh, born in Llanelli, but represents a seat in South Swindon rather than in Wales - which isn't usual practice and could prove controversial. Buckland has twin children and says his interests include music, wine, political history and watching rugby and cricket. Penny Mordaunt has returned to the cabinet as leader of the House of Commons, responsible for delivery of the governmentâs legislative programme, replacing Mark Spencer. She endorsed Liz Truss after nearly beating her into the final two of the Conservative leadership race. Most recently a trade minister, the naval reservist made history when she became the UK's first female defence secretary in 2019 and had also been in cabinet in 2017 as international development secretary. The former magicianâs assistant is perhaps best known outside Westminster for appearing on ITV's celebrity diving show Splash! Before becoming MP for Portsmouth North in 2010 she was a press officer for Kensington and Chelsea Council and the Freight Transport Association, and a director of the Big Lottery Fund and Diabetes UK. Lord True has been named leader of the House of Lords, responsible for delivery of the governmentâs legislative programme in the Upper House. A former Cabinet Office minister, he replaces Baroness Evans who had held the position since 2016. Before being made a life peer in 2010, True had been leader of the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and before that had worked in John Majorâs policy unit when he was prime minister. A fluent Italian speaker, who has previously lived and studied in the country, he lists his interests as including history, gardening and sport. Michelle Donelan has been appointed culture secretary, giving her a second chance to make her mark in cabinet following her resignation two days into the job of education secretary in July. The former higher and further education minister replaces Nadine Dorries, having backed Liz Truss after initially supporting her former boss Nadhim Zahawi and then Penny Mordaunt in the leadership race. Previously a government whip, Donelan worked in the media and entertainment industry before entering parliament, including a period as communications manager at professional wrestling firm WWE. The MP for Chippenham, first elected in 2015, says she enjoys walking her dog in her limited spare time. Jake Berry is the new minister without portfolio and Conservative party chairman, replacing Andrew Stephenson. He will be responsible for trying to gear the party up for the next election - Stephenson's predecessor Oliver Dowden resigned after a bruising set of by-elections for the Conservative party earlier this year. Berry will have to engage with Tory associations around the country (some of which weren't particularly happy at Boris Johnson's ousting), and help unite the party after months of infighting. He was previously Northern Powerhouse minister and has been chairman of the Northern Research Group, representing many of the Tory MPs who won seats in traditional Labour heartlands in 2019. The group, and Berry in particular, have pushed the government repeatedly on what it is doing to âlevel upâ and invest in those kinds of areas, which will likely form a big part of any future election strategy of his. Wendy Morton has been appointed chief whip, responsible for party discipline and ensuring Conservative MPs vote along party lines, and will attend cabinet. The former assistant whip backed Liz Truss at the start of the leadership contest and replaces Chris Heaton-Harris in the role. Morton, who has also been a transport and Foreign Office minister, says her interests include walking, cookery, art deco and ceramics. She was first elected MP for the West Midlands constituency of Aldridge-Brownhills in 2015, having missed out to Trussâs rival Rishi Sunak in a bid to become the party candidate for Richmond in 2014. Chris Philp has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury, attending cabinet, and takes over from new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke. The former digital minister initially backed Sajid Javid in the leadership race but endorsed Liz Truss in July. Philp, who has also held junior roles in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, has spoken of how the NHS saved the lives of his twins after they were born very prematurely at 25 weeks. He was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015. Michael Ellis has been appointed attorney general - the chief legal adviser to the government - and can attend cabinet. He replaces new Home Secretary Suella Braverman, having previously filled in for her when she went on maternity leave in 2021. A former Cabinet Office minister and paymaster general, Ellis supported Liz Trussâs rival Rishi Sunak in the Conservative leadership race. Ellis worked as a barrister for 17 years before entering parliament and his legal experience has previously led to him getting the role of solicitor general for England and Wales in 2019. He was elected MP for Northampton North in 2010. Edward Argar will attend cabinet after being named paymaster general and Cabinet Office minister, replacing new Attorney General Michael Ellis. The former health minister, who resigned in July, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race after initially backing ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Before entering parliament he worked in management consultancy and communications at various companies including outsourcing firm Serco and was a city councillor in Westminster. He has been MP for Charnwood since 2015 and lists his interests as including gardening, tennis and watching cricket. Vicky Ford has become development minister at the Foreign Office and will attend cabinet. The former MEP and South Cambridgeshire local councillor was an early supporter of Liz Truss in the leadership race. Before entering politics she worked as managing director of an international bank and was involved in raising money for infrastructure projects in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Ford, who has three children, was elected MP for Chelmsford in 2017 and lists her interests as including cricket, fly fishing, gardening and singing. Tom Tugendhat will attend cabinet as security minister in the Home Office, after reaching the final five in the Conservative leadership race. The former Territorial Army officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2017 but this is his first ministerial post. His backing of Liz Truss after being eliminated from the leadership race was surprising to many in the Conservative party - given he's always been considered part of the more âcentristâ One Nation group of Tory MPs. Tugendhat will now sit in a government largely skewed to the right-wing of the party. He was highly critical of the withdrawal from Afghanistan by Western forces in 2021, and of Boris Johnson during his premiership, but now he's in a government role his outspoken interventions are likely to be toned down. James Heappey will continue as minister for the armed forces, and take on the veterans brief, in the Ministry of Defence. He'll now attend cabinet too though - the top table of government ministers. He's a former soldier who spent 10 years in the Army, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland, and his profile rose significantly during the UK's withdrawal from Afghanistan and more recently the Ukraine war. He's considered a strong communicator and he, like his boss Ben Wallace who is staying on as defence secretary, does seem to bridge divisions across the Tory party factions. Heappey describes himself as a very keen sportsman who also loves to cook. Graham Stuart has become climate minister in the business department and will also attend cabinet. The former Foreign Office and international trade minister, who has also been a government whip, supported Liz Truss in the leadership race. He describes himself as a keen cyclist and says his interests include football, economics, motorcycling and punk rock. Stuart, who set up a publishing business after leaving university, was first elected MP for the East Yorkshire constituency of Beverley and Holderness in 2005. Newcomers includes ministers who did not attend the most recent cabinet. Click hereif you cannot see the Cabinet Guide There was quite a big turnover in Ms Truss's reshuffle, with several high-profile members of the previous cabinet leaving. The replacements include 13 new members who have taken up cabinet roles for the first time. After all the comings and goings, there are now two more women serving in the cabinet than there were under Boris Johnson, taking the total to nine. That makes up 30% overall, which is the same as the first cabinets under Gordon Brown and Theresa May. As for the education of those assembled by Ms Truss, 68% of them went to private schools, up slightly when compared with Mr Johnson's 2019 cabinet and up greatly when compared with Theresa May's in 2016. At 35%, Ms Truss's new cabinet has the lowest proportion of members who were educated at Oxford or Cambridge since Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1997.

Kwasi Kwarteng: Chancellor who likes a challenge,"Kwasi Kwarteng has been sacked as chancellor and replaced by Jeremy Hunt after his mini-budget resulted in financial turbulence and a revolt from Tory MPs. He has become Britain's second shortest-serving chancellor, lasting just 38 days in the role. The long-time ally of Prime Minister Liz Truss, seen as her political soulmate, was appointed to the role on 6 September. Speaking before Mr Kwarteng became chancellor, one friendtold the Times,externalthat he and Ms Truss were a bit like ""Batman and Robin"", adding: ""They are both slight social misfits, amiable geeks, and have strong views which are in tune with each other."" He took over at Number 11 Downing Street at a critical time for the UK economy, with millions looking to him for help with soaring winter energy bills. An Old Etonian who became the first black Conservative cabinet minister in 2021, he read classics and history at Trinity College, Cambridge, and has a PhD in economic history. He is also a past winner of notoriously tough BBC quiz show University Challenge. Age:47 Place of birth:East London Education:Trinity College, Cambridge and Harvard University Family:Married to solicitor Harriet Edwards with one daughter Parliamentary constituency:Spelthorne (Surrey) Mr Kwarteng's parents came to the UK from Ghana as students in the 1960s. He was born in East London in 1975, the same year as Ms Truss. His economist father and barrister mother gave him a traditional Ashanti first name, meaning ""born on Sunday"", when he was actually born on a Monday. He told the BBC'sPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinson podcasthis parents stayed silent on the matter when he jokingly pulled them up on it. The Church was a strong part of his mother's life and she was a lifelong Conservative voter. He was just three years old when Margaret Thatcher came to power, and she would remain prime minister until his GCSE year. He has said in the past that his mother deeply admired Mrs Thatcher as someone ""who wanted to rely on their own efforts"" and has described himself as a ""pragmatic Thatcherite"". He attended the exclusive private school Eton College after winning a scholarship there, and went on to graduate with a double first from Cambridge University in classics and history. One well-known anecdote about the young Kwasi Kwarteng harks back to his admissions interview for Trinity College. The self-confident 17-year-old told the tutor, who had arrived late and hadn't conducted many of these interviews before: ""Don't worry, sir - I'm sure you'll do very well."" He was part of the Cambridge team which won University Challenge in 1995, although he generated headlines for uttering a swearword after he buzzed in and forgot the answer to a question. He has since questioned how,externalmuch being good at quizzes ""relates to anything in what people call 'real life'"". Kwasi Kwarteng appeared in the winning team for Trinity College, Cambridge, on University Challenge in 1994-95 He attended Harvard University in the United States on a Kennedy Scholarship, before returning to the University of Cambridge to complete a PhD in economic history in 2000. During his second stint at the university, Tristram Hunt, the former Labour MP and now head of the V&A Museum, joked that then roommate Mr Kwarteng was ""quite ungovernable and dishevelled"". He worked as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph and a financial analyst at banks including JP Morgan in the City of London and got involved in Conservative politics as chairman of the Bow Group think tank. He has remarked that ""politics was always something I was drawn to"", and he made his first attempt to become an MP in 2005. He stood as the Conservative candidate for Brent East at the general election, but came third. There was also an unsuccessful run for the London Assembly in 2008. However, he became part of the ""class of 2010"", a cohort of politicians entering Westminster for the first time that year. He was elected as MP for Spelthorne in Surrey and entered Parliament the same time as future colleagues Ms Truss, Priti Patel and Sajid Javid. Hismaiden speech in the House of Commons,externalcame with some comments he described as ""controversial"", when he used the opportunity to criticise the former Labour government led by Gordon Brown and how it tackled the 2008 financial crisis. ""They have not once accepted any blame for what happened and they seem to think that we can just sail on as before,"" he said, also setting out the view that ""wealth creation is the most important element in getting us out of this recession"". Listen: Political Thinking with Nick Robinson - The Kwasi Kwarteng One I don't believe in windfall taxes, says Kwasi Kwarteng Although Mr Kwarteng was tipped to become the Conservatives' first black cabinet member as early as 2006, he spent eight years as a constituency MP before he became a minister. He backed Leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and in 2017 became a ministerial aide to the then Chancellor Philip Hammond, before becoming a junior minister in the Department for Exiting the European Union. Mr Kwarteng also co-authored the book Britannia Unchained with several Tory MPs, including Ms Truss. In the 2012 text, they claimed: ""Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world."" He has since distanced himself from this view. Mr Kwarteng has used his spare time to write several books and pamphlets on topics from Mrs Thatcher's final six months in office to the British Empire and its legacy. He has argued that ""the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a cartoon-like view of history"", and has said he thinks that view is true on both sides of the issue. Mr Kwarteng backed Leave in the EU referendum Mr Kwarteng was a supporter of Boris Johnson who put him on the ministerial fast-track as energy minister in 2019. He worked there for more than a year before becoming business secretary 18 months later. The ascent has been described as a ""reward"" for his backing of Mr Johnson during the race for party leadership. The realities of the pandemic and the soaring cost of energy, however, meant that his views on state intervention in industry moderated. ""There's nothing [better] to convert someone from being a radical free marketeer to seeing the virtues of government action than making them an energy minister,"" he said at a 2019 Conservative party conference event. That same year, he married solicitor Harriet Edwards, having previously dated former Home Secretary Amber Rudd. His political partnership with Ms Truss, a fellow member of the 2010 intake of MPs, paid dividends when she asked her close ally to serve as chancellor. But the mini-budget he unveiled on 23 September spooked financial markets and prompted a drop in the value of the pound. Amid warnings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Bank of England stepped in to buy government bonds in a bid to stabilise their value. The chancellor said he had listened to criticism - including from within his party - and there was a U-turn on a plan to abolish the 45p rate of income tax for top earners. But market turbulence continued, causing speculation that the government would announce a further reversal on its tax-cutting plans. The day before his ejection from Number 11 Downing Street, Mr Kwarteng said ""our position hasn't changed"" - and that he would ""absolutely"" still be in his job a month later.

Here is a selection of photos from the day she officially replaced Boris Johnson as leader, becoming the country's third-ever female PM. The day began with a media circus outside 10 Downing Street to capture Mr Johnson's farewell speech - almost two months exactly since he resigned as Conservative leader following a string of controversies The outgoing prime minister compared himself to ""one of those booster rockets"" that ""has fulfilled its function"" and pointed to what he said were his achievements in office, such as resolving the Brexit impasse, the vaccine programme during the pandemic and supporting Ukraine following its invasion by Russia Mr Johnson's wife Carrie, pictured in pink, and his sister Rachel were among supporters who gathered to watch his parting words, which brought to an end a tumultuous premiership of less than three years Farewell speech done, Boris Johnson waved goodbye After delivering his speech outside Downing Street, both Mr Johnson and Ms Truss travelled separately to meet the Queen at Balmoral Castle in Aberdeenshire First, Mr Johnson arrived and tendered his resignation to the monarch Then Ms Truss arrived to officially succeed Mr Johnson as prime minister She was met by the 96-year-old Queen, who was pictured with a walking stick After greeting each other, Ms Truss was officially appointed as the UK's 56th prime minister and the third female PM After leaving Balmoral, Ms Truss returned to Downing Street to deliver her first speech as prime minister As rain hit Downing Street, the lectern from which Ms Truss would make her speech was swiftly moved inside only to be brought back out just minutes later as the downpour eased MPs, Downing Street staff and supporters were caught in the heavy rain as they waited for Ms Truss to arrive at Number 10 As she made her first public address as the new PM, Liz Truss said she was honoured to take on the role ""at a vital time for our country"" (Left-right) Brandon Lewis, Nadhim Zahawi and Ben Wallace were among those who listened to Ms Truss make her maiden speech as PM The new PM and her husband Hugh O'Leary shared a smile on the doorstep of No 10 And there was a round of applause as she walked into No 10 as PM for the first time After the ceremony of Ms Truss's arrival at No 10, there was the matter of assembling a new cabinet.

"Free school meals rollout begins in WalesUniversal free school meals have begun for some ages, with all primary pupils to be covered by 2024.Wales","The youngest primary school pupils have started getting free school meals, with other year groups set to recieve them by 2024 Young children have started to receive universal free school meals this week, but older children in Wales must wait. Reception pupils, aged four and five, are being offered the meals from this month as part of a phased rollout to all primary school children by 2024. Eight local authorities have said year 1 and 2 pupils will also qualify from the start of term. But the Welsh Conservatives said the plans were ""wrong"" to include the children of ""millionaire families"". All of Wales' approximately 272,000 primary school pupils are set to get free lunches by 2024. It is part of a deal between Plaid Cymru and the Labour Welsh government. Free school meals for all plan starts in September Families choosing between food and kids' sport Rising number of children on free school meals The Welsh government and Plaid Cymru said their joint policy would be extended to around 6,000 nursery-age children. ""It's nice to have something back,"" said Gethin Tomos, the father-of-two pupils at Ysgol Nantgaredig in Carmarthenshire. Gethin Tomos said he understand it isn't possible to roll out free school meals for every child immediately Mr Tomos' youngest has just started in reception class and so is eligible for free school dinners, while his older daughter doesn't qualify yet. ""It's a good idea obviously. It's very important that all children get offered some sort of free meal throughout the week,"" he said. Newport, Ceredigion, Blaenau Gwent, Torfaen, Pembrokeshire, Conwy, Vale of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire councils have all said pupils under the age of seven will get free school meals from this week. In Anglesey, Caerphilly and Gwynedd, reception and year 1 classes will be eligible, with Caerphilly planning to extend provision to year 2 pupils in November. Many councils, including Wrexham, Pembrokeshire and Conwy, are due to extend the provision to all primary school pupils from September 2023, earlier than the Welsh government target of 2024. At Ysgol Nantgaredig, all children in reception and full-time nursery started getting free school meals this week. Catherine Davies has a daughter in year 4, and although she welcomes the scheme, she believes means testing might be a better way to focus the help. ""Dependent on where you are on the scale of how much income [you receive] and how comfortable you are, perhaps it's more help for some than others,"" she said. ""I think [means tested] just makes a bit more sense"". This video can not be played Cook Jane Jones at Ysgol Twm o'r Nant in Denbigh is looking forward to the challenge Headteacher Steffan Griffiths said around two-thirds of the reception class had taken up the offer of a free school meal as well as the majority of the nursery children. While it was ""working fine"" at the moment, he said there would be more challenges as the scheme is expanded. Ysgol Nantgaredig headteacher Steffan Griffiths said it would be a ""huge challenge"" to meet the demand free school meals would bring ""At the moment we're feeding just over a 100 pupils within an hour and 15 minutes during our lunch break with three members of staff,"" he said. ""If you add 20, 30, 40, 50 pupils by next summer to that number it's going to be a huge challenge to do the same within the same period of time with the same number of staff"". Some councils across Wales have had to adapt and extend school kitchens to meet demand, and some have struggled to recruit extra staff. Gwynedd council has written to parents and carers to ask them to help work in schools to ""ensure the success of delivering free school meals"" while also ""earning some money"". Ellie Harwood from the Child Poverty Action Group said she was ""absolutely delighted"" to see the scheme begin. ""It's a wonderful thought thinking of the littlest children starting school this week... knowing that all of them can go down to the dinner hall, sit down and eat together with their friends,"" she said. Ellie Harwood said spending that directly benefits children would help ensure they ""don't suffer unnecessarily in the cost of living crisis"" She said councils and schools should be commended for getting the policy off the ground, despite the ""postcode lottery"" of which year groups are eligible in different areas. ""Targeting additional funding into services that directly benefit children is a really good way of making sure that children don't suffer unnecessarily in the cost of living crisis,"" she added. The policy of universal free school meals for all primary pupils is part of a three-year cooperation agreement between the Welsh government and Plaid Cymru. All primary school pupils in Wales will recieve free school meals by 2024 Marking the beginning of the scheme, Plaid and the Welsh government said free school meals would also be extended to full-time nursery pupils in schools. Some councils including Merthyr Tydfil and Carmarthenshire had already said full-time nursery children would be eligible from the start of this school term. Ministers earmarked Â£35m of funding, on top of Â£25m in the last financial year, to upgrade kitchens and digital systems along with Â£200m over three years for the day-to-day costs. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Families throughout Wales are under huge pressure because of the cost-of-living crisis and we are doing everything we can to support them. ""Extending free school meals to all primary schools is one of a number of measures we are taking to support families through this difficult time."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the policy would mean ""no child will need to go hungry while they are in class"". Plaid said it ultimately wanted to see free school meals for secondary school pupils too. But the Welsh Conservatives said ""limited resources"" should be focused on the poorest. ""There is a cost-of-living crisis and we need every single penny of public funds to be targeted at where it is most needed, which Labour and Plaid's blanket approach fails to do,"" the party's leader Andrew RT Davies said. The youngest children in England and Scotland already receive universal free school meals with plans to extend it further in Scotland.

Sturgeon says rents will be frozen 'from today',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces the plan to freeze rents until spring Nicola Sturgeon has announced a rent freeze for public and private rented properties as part of efforts to help people struggling with rising bills. The first minister said the cost-of-living crisis was a ""humanitarian emergency"" which could cost lives. Her government is to table emergency legislation banning evictions during winter and freezing rents until spring. There are also plans to freeze rail fares and to boost the Scottish Child Payment to Â£25 per week from November. Ms Sturgeon has also written to new Prime Minister Liz Truss, asking her to convene a four-nation meeting of political leaders to focus on helping households. At-a-glance: The programme for government Cost of living to dominate year ahead at Holyrood Live coverage and reaction to the statement The plans were part of the first minister's annual Programme for Government speech, which comes at the start of each new year at Holyrood. She said the legislative programme was deliberately focused on the cost-of-living crisis, which she said ""poses a danger not just to livelihoods but to lives"". Ms Sturgeon called for action from UK ministers ""on a scale similar to the Covid response"", but said her government would also take further steps to ""strengthen the emergency safety net for those struggling to pay bills"". This includes an increase in the Scottish Child Payment - a weekly payment to familieswho are in receipt of certain benefits,external- to Â£25 per week from 15 November. The scheme is also to be expanded to eligible under-16s, meaning more than 400,000 could benefit. ScotRail fares are to be frozen until at least March 2023, with the government having taken the rail operator into public ownership earlier in the year. And Ms Sturgeon confirmed that emergency legislation would be tabled at Holyrood to protect tenants in private and socially rented homes. This will include a moratorium on evictions during winter as well as a rent freeze, to run from today until at least the end of March next year. Nicola Sturgeon's plans to freeze rents, ban evictions and raise the child payment to Â£25 a week will make the headlines today. But these announcements were prefaced with a very stark warning from the first minister - that the Scottish government is getting short of cash. That rising inflation has reduced their spending power and that larger-than-expected pay deals for public sector workers and other cost-of-living help will also limit what they can spend elsewhere. In short, ""hard choices"" lie ahead and the Scottish government won't be able to do everything it would like. That may not only mean rejecting new demands but potentially delaying or dropping some existing commitments. The first minister did not give details. It seems that is being delegated to her deputy, John Swinney, who is due to make a separate financial statement tomorrow. The Scottish Association of Landlords accused the the government of ""attacking landlords for political reasons"". Chief executive John Blackwood said the proposals ""will only further reduce the supply of housing, putting more people at risk. This is not a solution, it will only cause more hardship."" He also said he had been ""inundated"" by landlords saying they would be removing their vacant properties from the rental market. This video can not be played Student renter Matthew Peacock: ""We need to look at actually rent reductions."" In her speech the first minister warned that her government faces ""hard choices"" in how these policies are paid for, with an emergency budget review being carried out. She said it would mean ""stopping some things we planned to do, to fund what is essential to support people through this crisis"". The other proposals announced as part of the Programme for Government included: extending free school meals to include pupils in primary 6 and 7 abolishing the not proven verdictas part of a Criminal Justice Bill establishing a new public body responsible for qualifications through an Education Reform Bill the creation of a National Care Service a Local Visitor Levy Bill to give councils the power to apply a levy on overnight stays government support for a bill to protect safe access for women to healthcare facilities that provide abortion services Ms Sturgeon also said she still aims to hold an independence referendum in October 2023, arguing that Holyrood lacks the powers ""we desperately need to respond to a crisis like this"". But opposition parties hit out at this, saying it was a waste of time and money. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the programme ""falls woefully short"". He called for the Scottish and UK governments to ""tackle the cost of living crisis jointly together"" and said Ms Truss would roll out plans in the coming days to alleviate the pressure on household budgets. Mr Ross also said an independence referendum was ""unacceptable at a time when people are struggling - the wrong priority at the worst possible time"". This video can not be played Landlord John Blackwood: ""Fewer and fewer people will rent out properties and tenants will really struggle to find a home."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the government ""needs to go further and go faster to avert this crisis"". He said: ""Whether you voted yes or no, whether you voted leave or remain, your bills are going up right now - you need urgent action right now. ""You need a UK government to step in right now to impose an energy price freeze and a windfall tax, and you need an emergency cost of living act in Scotland right now to put more money in people's pockets."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the speech was ""thin gruel"" for anxious Scots, and that the government lacked the ""humility, creativity and ambition necessary to face the problems"". The Scottish Greens - who are in government with the SNP - welcomed the announcements. MSP Ariane Burgess said the rent freeze would ""provide vital stability and support for tenants across Scotland at a time when many are suffering"".

Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions,"Prime Minister Liz Truss is understood to be planning to borrow billions to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500 with full details expected on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. The government's plans to subsidise bills means that customers will not be expected to repay the support. It is unclear how long the government support will last, but the overall government support package is expected to total around Â£100bn. The  ultimate figure will depend on gas and energy price movements in the highly volatile international energy markets as well as how much additional support is offered to the most vulnerable. Ms Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with details expected to be announced on Thursday. Energy bosses have insisted for some time that a government-backed superfund from which they could borrow to subsidise bills ""is the only game in town"". However, the government is understood to be reluctant to see money added to customer bills for up to 20 years so energy companies could pay back the loans. It is also thought to be reluctant to add the cost to general taxation, given their pledges to be a tax cutting government. What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? New PM Liz Truss expected to freeze energy bills Warning firms will close this winter without help What cost-of-living payments will I get? Kwasi Kwarteng - tipped to be the new chancellor - has already indicated the government is prepared to borrow to support the economy. This would be consistent with Ms Truss' position that the UK needs to break free of the Treasury's strict spending rules. Nevertheless, the estimated Â£100bn is a sizeable sum to borrow at the same time as cutting taxes and boosting spending on defence and it could end up costing more than that, given the fluctuating price of wholesale gas. ""One of the dangers here is that it could even be more expensive than Â£100bn,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, contrasting it with the Covid-prompted furlough scheme, which cost Â£60bn-Â£70bn. ""There has to be a risk that energy prices stay high for a long time, perhaps even up to three or four years,"" he said. ""Then this starts being baked into public spending long-term."" The cost of UK government borrowing hit its highest level for eight years on Tuesday, with the yield on ten-year bonds rising above 3%. That reflects the market's expectation that the government will have to borrow more and means any future borrowing will be more expensive. Mr Johnson said the plan to borrow to support energy bills was only one you would adopt ""if you can't think of anything else"" because it amounted to subsidising everybody's gas use, when the higher price suggested there was not enough gas available. That could lead to rationing, he suggested, and would mean high-income households would benefit by a much larger amount than those at the lower end. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Government sources say that over time, new energy supply measures - such as cutting the link between renewable sources and the gas price - will lower costs while a growing economy will shrink the proportion of overall debt to the size of the economy. Businesses are also expected to be offered some relief in the plan set to be announced on Thursday. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more. Thousands would go bust or cut their wage bills by firing staff. The precise mechanism to help business may be more complicated and would be reviewed more frequently but reports suggest it could see the government mandate energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy businesses use. Including businesses could easily push the cost of the government's energy plan over Â£100bn. Alex Veitch of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""It is encouraging that the government is seriously considering the support it can give to businesses during these very difficult times. ""But it remains to be seen whether these plans will go far enough in offering the help that many firms so desperately need."" Craig Beaumont from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""This commitment looks very promising, and arguably the best reassurance that small businesses need that some form of help with bills will follow - not just for households. ""The scope and reach of the help is going to be absolutely crucial to save hundreds of thousands of small businesses this winter."" What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills?

Holiday Inn hit by cyber attack,"Holiday Inn owner, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), has confirmed the company has been hit by a cyber-attack. IHG, which has some of the world's largest hotel chains, issued a statement saying it was investigating ""unauthorised access"" to a number of its technology systems. The UK-based company said its ""booking channels and other applications"" had been disrupted since Monday. It manages the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent hotels. ""IHG is working to fully restore all systems as soon as possible,"" the company said. IHG confirmed it was assessing the nature, extent and impact of the incident and had implemented its response plans, including appointing external specialists to investigate the breach. The company is also in the process of notifying regulatory authorities.

LiveLiveCanada stabbings: Suspect may have been sighted - police21 minutes ago,"The suspect in a stabbing that left 10 dead and 18 others injured has died after he was arrested by police, officials say Myles Sanderson, 32, was apprehended when police rammed his stolen vehicle off the road after a high-speed car chase Police say Sanderson went into ""medical distress"" after he was detained, and was taken to hospital where he was declared dead His capture in the town of Rosthern in Saskatchewan on Wednesday afternoon ends a giant manhunt that covered three provinces Both Myles Sanderson and his brother, Damien, were charged with murder over Sunday's massacre Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday at James Smith Cree Nation - the indigenous community where most of the victims lived Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now ending our live coverage of the arrest and death of the main suspect in the stabbing spree that claimed the lives of 10 people in Canada on Sunday. Myles Sanderson died after experiencing ""medical distress"" after his arrest on Wednesday, police said, without giving further detail. They also declined to comment further on how his brother Damien, who is accused of helping in the murders, died earlier this week. His body was found on Monday, and police say they suspect his brother may have killed him. Our live coverage was provided by Max Matza, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Nadine Yousif, Robin Levinson-King and Grace Conley, and edited by Rebecca Seales. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau will be holding a news conference on Thursday from the west coast city of Vancouver. It's safe to assume that he'll be asked extensively about the investigation by journalists there. Earlier on Thursday, he plans to speak on the phone with US President Joe Biden. Trudeau has been introducing tough new anti-gun laws in recent months, last monthimposing a total ban on the import of handguns. It remains to be seen what his administration can do to prevent future mass stabbing attacks. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan In a story that has had many twists, there was a final one this evening: that suspect Myles Sanderson died after being taken into custody. And in a story that also has many unresolved questions, there was another to add: the circumstances of that death, particularly given photos have emerged that seem to show him standing up as he was being arrested. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore didn't have many answers to offer. Asked if he could have died from an overdose - he had a documented history of substance abuse - Blackmore gave no more details. She also refused to say whether Narcan, a drug given to stop overdoses, was administered. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she said, adding that how he died was part of the ongoing investigation. Here's what we've just heard from police: The police press conference is over. They confirmed that Myles Sanderson died following his arrest, but did not provide details on how he died. They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public. ""People want to understand what happened here and how that unfolded,"" she said. She acknowledged this was just the first step in victims' healing process and that many questions remain unanswered. ""They can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,"" she said. Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday, after being named a suspect and charged with first-degree murder along with his brother. His body was found near other victims around James Smith Cree Nation. ""At this point in time, he is considered a suspect in the homicides that were committed,"" Blackmore says. Police said his injuries did not appear self-inflicted at the time. They did not elaborate during Wednesday's press conference. As people hear updates from police on Myles Sanderson's arrest, several gathered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a sombre vigil. ""Tomorrow we start the process on our grieving"", said James Smith Cree Nation chief Wally Burns to mourners, some of whom wiped away tears. âIâm holding back a lot of hurt, a lot of anger. I wish this was just a dream, but itâs not.â It is one of several vigils that have taken place or are planned for the coming days in honour of the 10 victims who died in the mass stabbing attacks. A collective prayer for James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon residents will also take place at First Nations University of Canada in Regina on Friday. Words of solidarity have poured in from across the nation and around the world. The Queen has also sent her condolences, with a statement earlier today saying she was mourning ""with all Canadians at this tragic time"". Police say there were signs the now-deceased suspect was injured before his arrest. Initial reports on Wednesday, when he was spotted near Wakaw, indicated he may have had an injury. A vehicle was broken into in Weldon, after the attacks on Sunday, and it appeared he may have stolen a first-aid kit. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Police in Saskatchewan were quick to send out mobile phone alerts to residents shortly after they realised that a mass attack was taking place. Over the last few days, loud emergency phone alerts with updates on the manhunt became commonplace. These types of alerts are usually sent for missing children or extreme weather events. People I spoke to here were on the fence about the alerts and their frequency. Some felt they were useful information that helped residents to remain cautious and aware. Others thought it was added stress amid the terrible news. But this response suggested that the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - had shifted public communication tactics in the wake of another killing spree in Canada. In Nova Scotia, a maritime province on Canada's east coast, a commission is looking into the police response to a mass shooting when a gunman, posing as a police officer, killed 22 people over the course of two days in April 2020. One of the main issues being looked into at the inquiry?  Why the force failed to use the provincial alert system to warn people of the danger. The last alert sent by police announcing a sighting of the suspect The assistant commissioner continues that police have conducted more than 120 interviews so far in connection with the case as they try to piece together what happened. Asked about the suspect's Myles Sanderson's brother, who was discovered dead on Monday, police say they are not prepared yet to say how he died. ""We may not know how some things unfolded,"" she says. Blackmore says it remains unclear how Damien died, and ""how that unfolded between the two of them"". Asked about the suspect's possible motive, the RCMP assistant commissioner says his motivation ""may at this time and forever just be known to Myles"". Police are now taking questions from journalists in Regina, and have refused to give more detail as to how Sanderson died. ""He was the only occupant of the vehicle when he was arrested,"" says the RCMP assistant commissioner. ""Shortly after being arrested he went into medical distress,"" she says, repeating her earlier statement. She says a post-mortem examination will determine how he died. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she says, saying how he died is part of the ongoing investigation. Police are now repeating their statement in French, one of Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Saskatchewan RCMP chief adds that she visited the affected communities today, and personally witnessed the ""generosity and support"" of the residents there. She adds her appreciation to all the police officers involved in the search, which took place over an area about half the size of Europe. Police spotted the white truck that he had stolen, and after stopping him, ""through verbal identification, confirmed the driver to Myles Sanderson,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore. ""He was arrested by police and taken into custody. A knife was discovered inside his vehicle,"" she says. ""Shortly after his arrest he went into medical distress,"" she continued without describing how he died. The suspect's stolen vehicle Police have confirmed that Myles Sanderson died shortly after he was arrested earlier on Wednesday, after going into ""medical distress"". ""This evening our province is breathing a collective sigh of relief as Myles Sanderson is no longer at large,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore, beginning her statement. She is now going through a timeline of the police response. Police first arrived at the James Smith Cree Nation at 06:18 on Sunday, she says. ""The magnitude of this investigation is immense,"" she continues. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are now giving an update from the Mounties' regional headquarters in Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore, who leads the Saskatchewan RCMP, will be speaking. Many questions remain unanswered, including how people were stabbed across two communities in a short space of time, and why police failed to track down Myles Sanderson when he ceased contact with his parole officer.

"LiveLiveCanada stabbings: Suspect may have been sighted - policeThere is a possible sighting of Myles Sanderson in James Smith Cree Nation, an alert sent to phones warns.US & Canada","The suspect in a stabbing that left 10 dead and 18 others injured has died after he was arrested by police, officials say Myles Sanderson, 32, was apprehended when police rammed his stolen vehicle off the road after a high-speed car chase Police say Sanderson went into ""medical distress"" after he was detained, and was taken to hospital where he was declared dead His capture in the town of Rosthern in Saskatchewan on Wednesday afternoon ends a giant manhunt that covered three provinces Both Myles Sanderson and his brother, Damien, were charged with murder over Sunday's massacre Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday at James Smith Cree Nation - the indigenous community where most of the victims lived Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now ending our live coverage of the arrest and death of the main suspect in the stabbing spree that claimed the lives of 10 people in Canada on Sunday. Myles Sanderson died after experiencing ""medical distress"" after his arrest on Wednesday, police said, without giving further detail. They also declined to comment further on how his brother Damien, who is accused of helping in the murders, died earlier this week. His body was found on Monday, and police say they suspect his brother may have killed him. Our live coverage was provided by Max Matza, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Nadine Yousif, Robin Levinson-King and Grace Conley, and edited by Rebecca Seales. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau will be holding a news conference on Thursday from the west coast city of Vancouver. It's safe to assume that he'll be asked extensively about the investigation by journalists there. Earlier on Thursday, he plans to speak on the phone with US President Joe Biden. Trudeau has been introducing tough new anti-gun laws in recent months, last monthimposing a total ban on the import of handguns. It remains to be seen what his administration can do to prevent future mass stabbing attacks. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan In a story that has had many twists, there was a final one this evening: that suspect Myles Sanderson died after being taken into custody. And in a story that also has many unresolved questions, there was another to add: the circumstances of that death, particularly given photos have emerged that seem to show him standing up as he was being arrested. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore didn't have many answers to offer. Asked if he could have died from an overdose - he had a documented history of substance abuse - Blackmore gave no more details. She also refused to say whether Narcan, a drug given to stop overdoses, was administered. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she said, adding that how he died was part of the ongoing investigation. Here's what we've just heard from police: The police press conference is over. They confirmed that Myles Sanderson died following his arrest, but did not provide details on how he died. They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public. ""People want to understand what happened here and how that unfolded,"" she said. She acknowledged this was just the first step in victims' healing process and that many questions remain unanswered. ""They can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,"" she said. Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday, after being named a suspect and charged with first-degree murder along with his brother. His body was found near other victims around James Smith Cree Nation. ""At this point in time, he is considered a suspect in the homicides that were committed,"" Blackmore says. Police said his injuries did not appear self-inflicted at the time. They did not elaborate during Wednesday's press conference. As people hear updates from police on Myles Sanderson's arrest, several gathered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a sombre vigil. ""Tomorrow we start the process on our grieving"", said James Smith Cree Nation chief Wally Burns to mourners, some of whom wiped away tears. âIâm holding back a lot of hurt, a lot of anger. I wish this was just a dream, but itâs not.â It is one of several vigils that have taken place or are planned for the coming days in honour of the 10 victims who died in the mass stabbing attacks. A collective prayer for James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon residents will also take place at First Nations University of Canada in Regina on Friday. Words of solidarity have poured in from across the nation and around the world. The Queen has also sent her condolences, with a statement earlier today saying she was mourning ""with all Canadians at this tragic time"". Police say there were signs the now-deceased suspect was injured before his arrest. Initial reports on Wednesday, when he was spotted near Wakaw, indicated he may have had an injury. A vehicle was broken into in Weldon, after the attacks on Sunday, and it appeared he may have stolen a first-aid kit. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Police in Saskatchewan were quick to send out mobile phone alerts to residents shortly after they realised that a mass attack was taking place. Over the last few days, loud emergency phone alerts with updates on the manhunt became commonplace. These types of alerts are usually sent for missing children or extreme weather events. People I spoke to here were on the fence about the alerts and their frequency. Some felt they were useful information that helped residents to remain cautious and aware. Others thought it was added stress amid the terrible news. But this response suggested that the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - had shifted public communication tactics in the wake of another killing spree in Canada. In Nova Scotia, a maritime province on Canada's east coast, a commission is looking into the police response to a mass shooting when a gunman, posing as a police officer, killed 22 people over the course of two days in April 2020. One of the main issues being looked into at the inquiry?  Why the force failed to use the provincial alert system to warn people of the danger. The last alert sent by police announcing a sighting of the suspect The assistant commissioner continues that police have conducted more than 120 interviews so far in connection with the case as they try to piece together what happened. Asked about the suspect's Myles Sanderson's brother, who was discovered dead on Monday, police say they are not prepared yet to say how he died. ""We may not know how some things unfolded,"" she says. Blackmore says it remains unclear how Damien died, and ""how that unfolded between the two of them"".

"Holiday Inn hit by cyber attackThe chain, run by Intercontinental Hotel Group, said their online services were facing disruptions.","Holiday Inn owner, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), has confirmed the company has been hit by a cyber-attack. IHG, which has some of the world's largest hotel chains, issued a statement saying it was investigating ""unauthorised access"" to a number of its technology systems. The UK-based company said its ""booking channels and other applications"" had been disrupted since Monday. It manages the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent hotels. ""IHG is working to fully restore all systems as soon as possible,"" the company said. IHG confirmed it was assessing the nature, extent and impact of the incident and had implemented its response plans, including appointing external specialists to investigate the breach. The company is also in the process of notifying regulatory authorities. Hackers target politicians with fake news site Nato investigates hacker sale of missile firm data In a statement, the company said: ""We will be supporting hotel owners and operators as part of our response to the ongoing service disruption.

IHG did not say there had been any loss of customer data. It also did not specifically say it was a ransomware attack, but most of the speculation points in that direction. Last month, a Holiday Inn in Istanbul was breached by LockBit, which released data stolen from the company. It is not known if there is a connection between the attacks. The hotel chain was also the target of athree-month security breach in 2017when more than 1,200 of its franchised hotels in the US were affected.

Trudeau has been introducing tough new anti-gun laws in recent months, last monthimposing a total ban on the import of handguns. It remains to be seen what his administration can do to prevent future mass stabbing attacks. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan In a story that has had many twists, there was a final one this evening: that suspect Myles Sanderson died after being taken into custody. And in a story that also has many unresolved questions, there was another to add: the circumstances of that death, particularly given photos have emerged that seem to show him standing up as he was being arrested. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore didn't have many answers to offer. Asked if he could have died from an overdose - he had a documented history of substance abuse - Blackmore gave no more details. She also refused to say whether Narcan, a drug given to stop overdoses, was administered. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she said, adding that how he died was part of the ongoing investigation. Here's what we've just heard from police: The police press conference is over. They confirmed that Myles Sanderson died following his arrest, but did not provide details on how he died. They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public. ""People want to understand what happened here and how that unfolded,"" she said. She acknowledged this was just the first step in victims' healing process and that many questions remain unanswered. ""They can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,"" she said. Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday, after being named a suspect and charged with first-degree murder along with his brother. His body was found near other victims around James Smith Cree Nation. ""At this point in time, he is considered a suspect in the homicides that were committed,"" Blackmore says. Police said his injuries did not appear self-inflicted at the time. They did not elaborate during Wednesday's press conference. As people hear updates from police on Myles Sanderson's arrest, several gathered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a sombre vigil. ""Tomorrow we start the process on our grieving"", said James Smith Cree Nation chief Wally Burns to mourners, some of whom wiped away tears. âIâm holding back a lot of hurt, a lot of anger. I wish this was just a dream, but itâs not.â It is one of several vigils that have taken place or are planned for the coming days in honour of the 10 victims who died in the mass stabbing attacks. A collective prayer for James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon residents will also take place at First Nations University of Canada in Regina on Friday. Words of solidarity have poured in from across the nation and around the world. The Queen has also sent her condolences, with a statement earlier today saying she was mourning ""with all Canadians at this tragic time"". Police say there were signs the now-deceased suspect was injured before his arrest. Initial reports on Wednesday, when he was spotted near Wakaw, indicated he may have had an injury. A vehicle was broken into in Weldon, after the attacks on Sunday, and it appeared he may have stolen a first-aid kit. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Police in Saskatchewan were quick to send out mobile phone alerts to residents shortly after they realised that a mass attack was taking place. Over the last few days, loud emergency phone alerts with updates on the manhunt became commonplace. These types of alerts are usually sent for missing children or extreme weather events. People I spoke to here were on the fence about the alerts and their frequency. Some felt they were useful information that helped residents to remain cautious and aware. Others thought it was added stress amid the terrible news. But this response suggested that the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - had shifted public communication tactics in the wake of another killing spree in Canada. In Nova Scotia, a maritime province on Canada's east coast, a commission is looking into the police response to a mass shooting when a gunman, posing as a police officer, killed 22 people over the course of two days in April 2020. One of the main issues being looked into at the inquiry?  Why the force failed to use the provincial alert system to warn people of the danger. The last alert sent by police announcing a sighting of the suspect The assistant commissioner continues that police have conducted more than 120 interviews so far in connection with the case as they try to piece together what happened. Asked about the suspect's Myles Sanderson's brother, who was discovered dead on Monday, police say they are not prepared yet to say how he died. ""We may not know how some things unfolded,"" she says. Blackmore says it remains unclear how Damien died, and ""how that unfolded between the two of them"". Asked about the suspect's possible motive, the RCMP assistant commissioner says his motivation ""may at this time and forever just be known to Myles"". Police are now taking questions from journalists in Regina, and have refused to give more detail as to how Sanderson died. ""He was the only occupant of the vehicle when he was arrested,"" says the RCMP assistant commissioner. ""Shortly after being arrested he went into medical distress,"" she says, repeating her earlier statement. She says a post-mortem examination will determine how he died. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she says, saying how he died is part of the ongoing investigation. Police are now repeating their statement in French, one of Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Saskatchewan RCMP chief adds that she visited the affected communities today, and personally witnessed the ""generosity and support"" of the residents there. She adds her appreciation to all the police officers involved in the search, which took place over an area about half the size of Europe. Police spotted the white truck that he had stolen, and after stopping him, ""through verbal identification, confirmed the driver to Myles Sanderson,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore. ""He was arrested by police and taken into custody. A knife was discovered inside his vehicle,"" she says. ""Shortly after his arrest he went into medical distress,"" she continued without describing how he died. The suspect's stolen vehicle Police have confirmed that Myles Sanderson died shortly after he was arrested earlier on Wednesday, after going into ""medical distress"". ""This evening our province is breathing a collective sigh of relief as Myles Sanderson is no longer at large,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore, beginning her statement. She is now going through a timeline of the police response. Police first arrived at the James Smith Cree Nation at 06:18 on Sunday, she says. ""The magnitude of this investigation is immense,"" she continues. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are now giving an update from the Mounties' regional headquarters in Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore, who leads the Saskatchewan RCMP, will be speaking. Many questions remain unanswered, including how people were stabbed across two communities in a short space of time, and why police failed to track down Myles Sanderson when he ceased contact with his parole officer. Police say they have will only permit journalists to ask question for 20 minutes after making a statement. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Maitlis wrong about Cummings rebuke, says BBC chair","BBC Chairman Richard Sharp has said ex-Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis was ""completely wrong"" to suggest the rebuke she received for on-air remarks about Dominic Cummings made ""no sense"". Last month in a keynote speech, Maitlis said the BBC's ruling against her was made ""without any kind of due process"". She added it may have been ""a message of reassurance"" to the government, which the corporation has denied. Sharp said she was ""a great journalist"" but had put opinions ahead of facts. In 2020, theBBC said Maitlis broke its impartiality guidelineswhen she opened an episode of Newsnight by saying that Dominic Cummings, then former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief adviser, had ""broken the rules"" with a lockdown trip to Durham and ""the country can see that, and it's shocked the Government cannot"". While giving her keynote MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival last month, Maitlis suggested that growing political pressure has led the media to censor itself. Emily Maitlis says BBC rebuke made no sense Speaking at a House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee session on Tuesday looking into the modern media landscape, Mr Sharp, who became BBC Chairman in February 2021, said: ""While I thought the issues she raised were worthwhile and very good, she was completely wrong in saying the due process [regarding the Cummings comments] wasn't followed. ""I think probably to my mind that reflected also the fact that I disagree with her view of impartiality, which may mean that she can lead with her own opinions and follow-up with the facts."" Richard Sharp became BBC chairman in February 2021 He added: ""The issues around why it was found, both by us and then [broadcasting watchdog] Ofcom subsequently, that we had appropriately addressed the issue was because she led with her opinions. ""And as a great journalist it wasn't that her instincts were wrong, the issue is how the BBC does what it does, which is we have to provide the facts in an impartial way to the audience and allow them to draw their own opinions."" The corporation's director general Tim Davie, who was also appearing in front of the committee, added that while he thought Maitlis was an ""outstanding journalist"", he also disagreed with her criticism of the BBC's handling of the Cummings introduction. He was not the BBC's boss at the time of the ruling. In her speech last month, Maitlis also suggested a BBC board member, believed to be Sir Robbie Gibb, was an ""active agent of the Conservative Party"". Mr Sharp said on Tuesday he was ""disappointed"" with Maitlis's remarks about Sir Robbie, again saying she was ""completely wrong"". He said Sir Robbie, who had 'liked' an apparently anti-SNP post on Twitter, was entitled to his view, though he'd ""prefer that non-execs refrain from tweeting around controversial or partisan issues"". They should, he said, ""seek to avoid getting involved in matters of controversy"", adding they are not required to, however. He said he had been informed that Sir Robbie did not in fact 'like' the tweet in question, rather he had accidentally pressed the like button while scrolling through his Twitter feed. The subject of Joe Lycett's widely-shared appearance on Laura Kuenssberg's new BBC Sunday morning show also came up. Joe Lycett is an English comedian and presenter The stand-up comedian and presenter pretended to endorse the new prime minister Liz Truss, joking that he was ""incredibly right-wing"". While some praised the satire on social media, others were not so impressed and a frontpage headline in the Daily Mail the next day accused the BBC of anti-Conservative bias. ""Laura is exceptional,"" said Mr Davie, addressing the matter. ""We can debate the merits of that particular booking, [but] I don't think it displays BBC bias in the slightest. ""The audience saw it for what it was, by the way"". He continued: ""I think by yesterday, with the front page and the headline we had 28 complaints, and they're up to 66 complaints. The audience saw it for what it was, it was bemusing."" The director general went on to say that Kuenssberg, the BBC's former political editor, had ""conducted herself... in an exemplary fashion in a slightly difficult situation"". The BBC bosses were answering questions on the same morning Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries announced she was to leave her role, after just less than a year, in order to focus on her writing career. Earlier this year, Ms Dorries announced a two-year freeze of the licence fee and said attention would in due course turn to the BBC's funding model in the longer term. She had previously tweeted thatthe next licence fund settlement would be the last. The licence fee's existence is guaranteed until at least 31 December 2027 by the BBC's royal charter, which sets out the broadcaster's funding and purpose, and lengthy negotiations have already taken place between BBC bosses and the government over a future funding settlement. Mr Davie said on Tuesday the BBC is under ""a lot of pressure"" regarding the licence fee and is looking at what the right funding method might be going forward, but stressed he does believe in a public-funding model. On arrival into his role last year,Mr Sharp described the licence fee as the ""least worst"" wayof funding the BBC. A committee member also discussed BBC sports pundit Gary Lineker and his comments on social media. Mr Davie said he has had discussions with Lineker over the years about him following BBC impartiality guidelines and feels he has made a ""massive improvement to where he was a few years ago"". ""I'm very supportive of Gary, I think he's a brilliant presenter, and I think it is work in progress in terms of where he draws the line, but we've had a good conversation, I think he understands the guidelines,"" he added.

Dutch city may be first to ban most meat adsHaarlem is to ban most adverts for meat from public spaces because of the food's impact on climate.Europe,"Haarlem in The Netherlands is set to ban most meat ads from public spaces because of the food's climate impact. In what is thought to be the first such move by a city, it will enforce the ban from 2024. The motion drafted by GroenLinks - a green political party - has faced opposition from the meat sector and some who say it stifles free speech. The UN says livestock generate morethan 14% of all man-made greenhouse gases,external, including methane. ""Meat is very harmful to the environment. We cannot tell people that there is a climate crisis and encourage them to buy products that are part of it,"" Ziggy Klazes, a councillor from GroenLinks who drafted the motion, told the Trouw newspaper. The government of the city of 160,000 says it has not yet been decided whether sustainably produced meat will be included in the ad ban. The proposal was also supported by MPs from the Christian Democratic Challenge party. Climate change: Do I need to stop eating meat? The backlash from the meat industry was swift. ""The authorities are going too far in telling people what's best for them,"" said a spokesman from the Central Organisation for the Meat Sector. The right-wing BVNL party called it an ""unacceptable violation of entrepreneurial freedom"" and said it ""would be fatal for pig farmers"". ""Banning commercials from politically born motives is almost dictatorial,"" Haarlem BVNL councillor Joey Rademaker said. Herman BrÃ¶ring, a law professor from the University of Groningen, said the ban could infringe on freedom of expression and lead to lawsuits from wholesalers. About 95% of people in the Netherlands eat meat, but more than half do not eat it every day,according to Statistics Netherlands.,external Amsterdam and The Hague have already banned adverts for the aviation and fossil fuel industries. Beef produces the most greenhouse gas emissions, which include methane. Lamb has the next highest environmental footprint but these emissions are 50% less than beef.

Pakistan fights to stop biggest lake from bursting,"Pakistan's biggest lake, Manchar Lake, is on the verge of bursting its banks and flooding surrounding areas Pakistani authorities are struggling to stop their biggest lake from bursting its banks after last-ditch attempts to lower water levels failed. Manchar Lake, in Sindh province, is dangerously full after record monsoons that inundated swathes of Pakistan. Three breaches of the lake's banks so far - two to protect areas nearby - have displaced over 100,000 people. But it could still overflow and rescue teams are racing to evacuate many more people who remain at risk of drowning. Floods in Pakistan have affected some 33 million people and killed at least 1,314, including 458 children, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Agency said. Estimates suggest the floods have caused at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage. Sindh province produces half of the country's food supply, exacerbating fears of serious food shortages in a country already struggling with an economic crisis. Pakistan's navy has been helping rescue some of those stranded - but many more remain at risk of drowning On Sunday, officials breached Manchar lake after it had flooded two rural towns. The hope was the move would prevent it from further bursting its banks and inundating more densely-populated areas. The move affected an estimated 400 villages - a total of 135,000 people. The decision to deliberately flood some villages is a controversial one - the lake straddles two districts, Dadu and Jamshoro, both home to hundreds of thousands of people, and about 80% of the region is underwater. Now residents near the lake are using government machinery to strengthen embankments to try to avoid a catastrophic, unplanned overspill. ""There are three breaches in the lake, two by plan, one is unplanned breach. It is our target that our big cities, towns, we can save them,"" Sindh's minister of irrigation Jam Khan Shoro told the BBC's Newshour programme. Villagers were warned to evacuate before the planned breaches. But local sources say not everyone was taken to safety in time - some didn't want to leave their homes or livestock, a lifeline for many in rural communities, and there are few places for them to go. The military has been brought in to help with evacuations but mostly locals are coming to each other's aid. Some who've left their homes in the last few days ahead of the Manchar breach were taken to a nearby government-run facility that's being used as a shelter for the displaced, but the conditions leave much to be desired. ON THE GROUND:'We spent the whole night running from the flood' IN PICTURES:Floods and fear in Pakistan WATCH:Bed frames used to pull victims over floodwaters Many displaced people are living on the roadside without shelter, food or clean drinking water. ""We have we got nothing here, we try to find food for our kids all day, some nights we sleep without food,"" one woman told the BBC. ""We are scared that the roof may collapse on us - it's damaged,"" another villager said. ""Our children are getting sick and we've been sleeping on the floor - there aren't beds for many of us."" Those who are not cut off are trying to make their way to higher ground Officials have said a little over a quarter of a million people are in shelters, a fraction of the 33 million Pakistanis affected. Relief efforts can't keep pace with demand - there is simply too much need and too few resources. Damaged infrastructure is also hampering aid and rescue operations. Some connecting roads in Sindh province have either collapsed, are flooded or are backed up for days with queuing traffic. Pakistan is facing one of its worst climate-induced natural disasters in years, as record torrential rainfall and melting glaciers in the country's northern mountains have caused devastating floods. Meanwhile, UN children's agency Unicef said more children were at risk of dying from disease in Pakistan due to the shortage of clean water. The disaster has also highlighted the stark disparity between countries that are the largest contributors towards climate change and countries that bear the brunt of its impact. Pakistan produces less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions but its geography makes itextremely vulnerable to climate change.

Dutch city may be first to ban most meat ads,"Haarlem in The Netherlands is set to ban most meat ads from public spaces because of the food's climate impact. In what is thought to be the first such move by a city, it will enforce the ban from 2024. The motion drafted by GroenLinks - a green political party - has faced opposition from the meat sector and some who say it stifles free speech. The UN says livestock generate morethan 14% of all man-made greenhouse gases,external, including methane. ""Meat is very harmful to the environment. We cannot tell people that there is a climate crisis and encourage them to buy products that are part of it,"" Ziggy Klazes, a councillor from GroenLinks who drafted the motion, told the Trouw newspaper. The government of the city of 160,000 says it has not yet been decided whether sustainably produced meat will be included in the ad ban. The proposal was also supported by MPs from the Christian Democratic Challenge party. Climate change: Do I need to stop eating meat? The backlash from the meat industry was swift. ""The authorities are going too far in telling people what's best for them,"" said a spokesman from the Central Organisation for the Meat Sector. The right-wing BVNL party called it an ""unacceptable violation of entrepreneurial freedom"" and said it ""would be fatal for pig farmers"". ""Banning commercials from politically born motives is almost dictatorial,"" Haarlem BVNL councillor Joey Rademaker said. Herman BrÃ¶ring, a law professor from the University of Groningen, said the ban could infringe on freedom of expression and lead to lawsuits from wholesalers. About 95% of people in the Netherlands eat meat, but more than half do not eat it every day,according to Statistics Netherlands.,external Amsterdam and The Hague have already banned adverts for the aviation and fossil fuel industries. Beef produces the most greenhouse gas emissions, which include methane. Lamb has the next highest environmental footprint but these emissions are 50% less than beef.

"Maitlis wrong about Cummings rebuke, says BBC chairman","BBC Chairman Richard Sharp has said ex-Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis was ""completely wrong"" to suggest the rebuke she received for on-air remarks about Dominic Cummings made ""no sense"". Last month in a keynote speech, Maitlis said the BBC's ruling against her was made ""without any kind of due process"". She added it may have been ""a message of reassurance"" to the government, which the corporation has denied. Sharp said she was ""a great journalist"" but had put opinions ahead of facts. In 2020, theBBC said Maitlis broke its impartiality guidelineswhen she opened an episode of Newsnight by saying that Dominic Cummings, then former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief adviser, had ""broken the rules"" with a lockdown trip to Durham and ""the country can see that, and it's shocked the Government cannot"". While giving her keynote MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival last month, Maitlis suggested that growing political pressure has led the media to censor itself. Emily Maitlis says BBC rebuke made no sense Speaking at a House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport select committee session on Tuesday looking into the modern media landscape, Mr Sharp, who became BBC Chairman in February 2021, said: ""While I thought the issues she raised were worthwhile and very good, she was completely wrong in saying the due process [regarding the Cummings comments] wasn't followed. ""I think probably to my mind that reflected also the fact that I disagree with her view of impartiality, which may mean that she can lead with her own opinions and follow-up with the facts."" Richard Sharp became BBC chairman in February 2021 He added: ""The issues around why it was found, both by us and then [broadcasting watchdog] Ofcom subsequently, that we had appropriately addressed the issue was because she led with her opinions. ""And as a great journalist it wasn't that her instincts were wrong, the issue is how the BBC does what it does, which is we have to provide the facts in an impartial way to the audience and allow them to draw their own opinions."" The corporation's director general Tim Davie, who was also appearing in front of the committee, added that while he thought Maitlis was an ""outstanding journalist"", he also disagreed with her criticism of the BBC's handling of the Cummings introduction. He was not the BBC's boss at the time of the ruling. In her speech last month, Maitlis also suggested a BBC board member, believed to be Sir Robbie Gibb, was an ""active agent of the Conservative Party"". Mr Sharp said on Tuesday he was ""disappointed"" with Maitlis's remarks about Sir Robbie, again saying she was ""completely wrong"". He said Sir Robbie, who had 'liked' an apparently anti-SNP post on Twitter, was entitled to his view, though he'd ""prefer that non-execs refrain from tweeting around controversial or partisan issues"". They should, he said, ""seek to avoid getting involved in matters of controversy"", adding they are not required to, however. He said he had been informed that Sir Robbie did not in fact 'like' the tweet in question, rather he had accidentally pressed the like button while scrolling through his Twitter feed. The subject of Joe Lycett's widely-shared appearance on Laura Kuenssberg's new BBC Sunday morning show also came up. Joe Lycett is an English comedian and presenter The stand-up comedian and presenter pretended to endorse the new prime minister Liz Truss, joking that he was ""incredibly right-wing"". While some praised the satire on social media, others were not so impressed and a frontpage headline in the Daily Mail the next day accused the BBC of anti-Conservative bias. ""Laura is exceptional,"" said Mr Davie, addressing the matter. ""We can debate the merits of that particular booking, [but] I don't think it displays BBC bias in the slightest. ""The audience saw it for what it was, by the way"". He continued: ""I think by yesterday, with the front page and the headline we had 28 complaints, and they're up to 66 complaints. The audience saw it for what it was, it was bemusing."" The director general went on to say that Kuenssberg, the BBC's former political editor, had ""conducted herself... in an exemplary fashion in a slightly difficult situation"". The BBC bosses were answering questions on the same morning Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries announced she was to leave her role, after just less than a year, in order to focus on her writing career. Earlier this year, Ms Dorries announced a two-year freeze of the licence fee and said attention would in due course turn to the BBC's funding model in the longer term. She had previously tweeted thatthe next licence fund settlement would be the last. The licence fee's existence is guaranteed until at least 31 December 2027 by the BBC's royal charter, which sets out the broadcaster's funding and purpose, and lengthy negotiations have already taken place between BBC bosses and the government over a future funding settlement. Mr Davie said on Tuesday the BBC is under ""a lot of pressure"" regarding the licence fee and is looking at what the right funding method might be going forward, but stressed he does believe in a public-funding model. On arrival into his role last year,Mr Sharp described the licence fee as the ""least worst"" wayof funding the BBC. A committee member also discussed BBC sports pundit Gary Lineker and his comments on social media. Mr Davie said he has had discussions with Lineker over the years about him following BBC impartiality guidelines and feels he has made a ""massive improvement to where he was a few years ago"". ""I'm very supportive of Gary, I think he's a brilliant presenter, and I think it is work in progress in terms of where he draws the line, but we've had a good conversation, I think he understands the guidelines,"" he added. Emily Maitlis says BBC rebuke made no sense Laura Kuenssberg: Signing off after seven dizzying years BBC licence fee deal will be the last - Dorries Who is the BBC's new chairman, Richard Sharp?

What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills?,"As Liz Truss traversed the UK racking up the votes to defeat Rishi Sunak, in the same towns where she wooed the membership hustings, including in leafy apparently affluent areas, the size of the challenge she was vying to inherit was getting notably worse. The situation on the ground has deteriorated for ordinary households and businesses, as prices continued to surge yet higher. And at the same time there has been an ominous turn in the markets for British government borrowing and in currency markets. The combination of these two changes alter the reality of the situation she now takes on as prime minister. The question is how much it changes the immediate solutions she has promised as campaigner. From Durham to Derbyshire and Stoke-on-Trent and beyond, the stories we have reported on in many local communities show the real life depths of this cost of living crisis, even at current energy prices. The surge in food prices is breaking the charitable model of food banks and food pantries that have emerged in almost every town and city. Not only has demand surged, turning many of last year's food charity donors into recipients of support, but supplies are now a problem. Many of these projects are reliant on surplus food stocks from supermarket supply chains. But supermarkets facing massive inflationary pressures, trying to avoid passing on all of those price hikes to consumers, have been trimming surplus stock, meaning there is less tinned goods available for donations. Demand up hugely, at a time when supply is a problem. This is just one manifestation of out-of-control inflation. Jo Yendole from Stone Community hub says some people have stopped using hot water We visited a facility in Stone, Staffordshire. Jo Yendole who helps run Stone Community hub said: ""One of the guys who's on licence from prison, sort of struggling to maintain his flat and the cost of his flat actually said he would prefer to go back to prison because it was easier because he just couldn't see how we were going to afford to live. ""And another lady who she was she's talking about the cost of gas and an energy prices said she'd completely turned her boiler off and wasn't using any hot water and was boiling a kettle. The gas price is not even affordable in the summer for her"". Truss vows action on energy ahead of first day as PM Government closes in on energy rescue plan What could be done to combat high energy costs? Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss At a pantry in Matlock, Derbyshire, which offers subsidised food at about a tenth of supermarket prices, Beverley Parker from Rural Action Derbyshire told me people were returning fresh food, because they could not afford refrigeration costs. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges and freezers because they can't afford the electricity. You're risking your own health and that of your family, by eating food that hasn't been stored correctly. ""A lot of people are choosing to either get rid of their cars or not use them. Public transport in the countryside is limited at best. So we've we've even heard of people walking six miles from the food bank, and then six miles back home, because they can't afford the bus fare."" At another community hub in Peterlee, County Durham, I met dual-income working families who had started to grow their own vegetables and heard the co-ordinators tell of clients pre-emptively cancelling energy bill direct debits. Much of this happened even before the move in prices up to Â£3,549. While the energy companies have tried to pre-empt the arrival of Liz Truss with a ready to go plan to cancel the rise in the energy cap, that might not require upfront borrowing, there are still huge amounts of support being relied upon, even at existing bills. One energy company boss, former government fuel poverty tsar Derek Lickorish who is chairman of Utilita, told me the reality for the poorest customers. A typical Â£50 on prepayment meters which would ordinarily last 12 days in winter, might only last two days from January. ""Liz Truss has said that she intends to solve this problem, and I welcome that. This is a war footing to my mind. It will affect government borrowing. ""If we don't, we're going to have major problems with customers having unaffordable bills. There'll be huge mental health problems, we will see businesses going broke, we'll see people losing their jobs and they want to have disposable income to spend with businesses. It really is Armageddon, if we don't deal with this, and that's what we've got to get on with it"". So as we head towards some version of the energy companies tariff deficit fund being announced imminently by the new prime minister, she faces further pressure from the markets. The dollar has been strong as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has indicated a sharper rise in interest rates. But sterling has fallen notably against the dollar and the euro. Long-term borrowing costs for the government have topped 3%, setting the floor for borrowing for mortgages and for businesses. The government will have to work closely with the Bank of England These are jitters rather than a crisis. In that context it was notable to see both Ms Truss and her likely Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, row back from her early campaign rhetoric criticising the Bank of England. The government and Bank will need to work very closely together in the coming months. An important difference with the pandemic bailout is there can be no expectation that the Bank will buy up most of the issuance of extra government borrowing. The Bank has already indicated it will do the opposite soon as part of ""reverse QE"". If the government needs to borrow more, it will have to find buyers for the debt among pension funds, insurers and foreign buyers, and pay a high price. If the PM wants to abide by her campaign promises to make tens of billions of tax cuts, and help launch an energy bailout for both households and businesses, at a time when energy prices in markets could go yet higher, borrowing will have to go up in the first instance. But if she does not help both sectors, disposable income will drain from the economy, and many small businesses will simply go bust, hiking up unemployment too. The new prime minister already faced a very tricky balancing act between inflation and recession. The past month means the room for manoeuvre has got even smaller. Given this hand, Rishi Sunak may not end up regretting his loss. Truss vows action on energy on first day as PM Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions New PM Liz Truss expected to freeze energy bills Warning firms will close this winter without help Israel and Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, sources tell BBC UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

Prince Harry urges people to 'lean in' for Invictus,"Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex is seen on stage during for the Invictus Games Dusseldorf 2023 Prince Harry has praised the location of the next Invictus Games, calling Dusseldorf ""brilliant and filled with amazing people"". He visited the German city to mark one year until the competition for injured military veterans is held there. Speaking at Merkur Spiel-Arena, he said he was taken with the city's ""vibrant atmosphere"". He was joined by Meghan, who made her first UK address this week after quitting as a working royal. Prince Harry said: ""From what I've witnessed today already, I have a good sense of how we will bring the motto of these games - A Home For Respect - to life. ""It is my belief that showing respect and appreciation is just as important as experiencing respect and appreciation. That's the spirit we're bringing to Dusseldorf.""

With red carpets and walkabouts, when is a royal visit not a royal visit? Prince Harry and Meghan's visit to Germany looked much like a royal trip from before they moved to the US. Along with the UK engagements this week, it raises the bigger question of what kind of public role the couple will lead in future. Will they become a kind of parallel court, mixing celebrity with royalty? Because there are big differences. While the Royal Family are very skilled at saying nothing, the Sussexes' media ventures will keep pushing them to say everything, about themselves, their opinions and their royal connections. Like Meghan's magazine interview last week and her Spotify podcasts, that will mean controversy alongside the publicity. But the public interest in Meghan and Harry remains intense. Everyone has a view. Expect even more attention this week before they return to California.

"Rise in teenage vaping, as drug use falls - survey","Selling vapes to under-18s is illegal in the UK Vaping among secondary-school children is rising, with nearly one in five 15-year-olds using e-cigarettes in 2021, a survey by NHS Digital suggests. Among 11-15-year-olds, 9% say they are vapers - up from 6% in 2018. Doctors say children are being targeted by e-cigarette companies, with bright packaging, exotic flavours and enticing names. The long-term effects of vaping remain unknown - but it is much less harmful than smoking cigarettes. The UK has strict rules on safety, labelling and advertising to prevent children from vaping, a government spokesperson said. The survey,externalasked more than 9,000 pupils in 119 secondary schools in England about their habits between September 2021 and February 2022. Young addict fear as 17-year-old can't stop vaping Vaping - is it a risk-free option? Market flooded by unsafe vapes aimed at children It found that the percentage of teenagers taking drugs and smoking cigarettes fell between 2018 and 2021 - and alcohol use was unchanged. Overall, 18% of 11-15-year-old pupils said they had tried drugs - down from 24% in 2018. Cannabis is the most popular drug among this age group, with 6% saying they had taken it last year. Only 3% of pupils said they were current smokers, a fall from 5% in 2018. The charity, Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), said it was ""encouraging"" to see the decline in smoking which is ""far more harmful than vaping"". Vapes or e-cigarettes do not contain the harmful tobacco present in normal cigarettes but they do contain nicotine - the substance that makes people addicted to smoking. Disposable vapes, which are colourful and available in a host of sweet flavours, are growing in popularity among teenagers. The survey suggests: vaping among 15-year-old girls rose from 10% in 2018 to 21% girls are more likely to vape than boys at all ages - 10% of girls aged 11-15, compared with 7% of boys 61% of pupils who use vapes obtain them from other people, mostly friends. 57% buy them from a shop, mostly a newsagent - up from 29% three years ago Selling e-cigarettes or vapes to children is illegal in the UK and every vaping product sold containing nicotine must be registered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This video can not be played The BBC filmed a Trading Standards undercover operation But recently, trading standards told BBC News the market was being flooded by thousands of unregulated vaping products containing potentially harmful substances. And a BBC Radio 5 Live investigation found vapes being sold illegally to children in Newcastle. Child-health experts want rules tightened so vapes can be advertised only as an aid to stopping smoking, rather than as a fun and colourful lifestyle product. Dr Mike McKean, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the rise of vaping in children and young people. ""E-cigarettes remain a relatively new product and their long-term effects are still unknown,"" he said. ""It is clear that children and young people are being targeted by e-cigarette companies with bright packaging, exotic flavours and enticing names."" It was time for the UK government to introduce plain packaging - of e-cigarettes, as well as nicotine and non-nicotine e-liquids packs, Dr McKean said. ""If action is not taken soon, we run the risk of having generations of children addicted to nicotine,"" he added. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the UK had some of the strongest regulations in place to prevent children from vaping. For example. there are rules for all vape products on safety, labelling and advertising - and they cannot resemble a food or cosmetic product. Nicotine strength is limited to 20mg/ml. ""We are clear that vaping should only be used to help people quit smoking - vapes should not be used by people under 18 or non-smokers,"" she said. The results suggest pupils who frequently met up with friends outside their school or home were more likely to have recently smoked, drunk alcohol or taken drugs. Of pupils who met up with friends every day: 9% were current smokers 12% usually drank alcohol once a week 19% had taken drugs in the past month They were less satisfied with life than children who hadn't met up with friends for several weeks.

Olivia Pratt-Korbel was fatally wounded as her mum tried to stop a gunman chasing another man into their home in Liverpool on the evening of 22 August. Olivia's father John Francis Pratt said her death cannot be in vain as he urged those with information to come forward. A 34-year-old manarrested on suspicion of murder on Sundayremains in custody. Merseyside Police was given a further 36 hours on Monday evening to continue questioning the suspect, who was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The same extension was also granted regarding two men, aged 29 and 41, who were held on suspicion of assisting an offender. A fourth man, arrested on Sunday night on suspicion of the same offence, is also being questioned. Olivia Pratt-Korbel's family say they do not want to see another family suffer In a statement from the wider family, Mr Francis Pratt said: ""Words can't express the pain we are going through after Olivia was so cruelly snatched away from us. ""Those responsible need to know what they have done."" He described his daughter as a ""real bright spark who knew her own mind"" and who ""loved to laugh and make people laugh"". ""She could be a proper wind-up merchant and loved to wind her nieces up, particularly those who were older than her. ""And when they didn't like it, she'd just laugh and say 'don't forget I'm your aunty'."" He thanked those who had helped with the police investigation but pleaded for anybody else with information to speak to officers. A tribute was paid to Olivia on the big screen at Goodison Park on Saturday He added: ""We know that most people on Merseyside are good-hearted and kind just like them and we all need to stand together. ""We don't want another child to lose their life in such horrendous circumstances and we don't want to see another family suffer like we are suffering now. ""Olivia's death cannot be in vain and we want people to feel safe and be safe. ""That can only happen if we all come together and make sure there is no place for guns, or those who use guns on our streets or in our communities.""

Dutch city may be worldâs first to ban meat ads,"Haarlem in The Netherlands is set to ban most meat ads from public spaces because of the food's climate impact. In what is thought to be the first such move by a city, it will enforce the ban from 2024. The motion drafted by GroenLinks - a green political party - has faced opposition from the meat sector and some who say it stifles free speech. The UN says livestock generate morethan 14% of all man-made greenhouse gases,external, including methane. ""Meat is very harmful to the environment. We cannot tell people that there is a climate crisis and encourage them to buy products that are part of it,"" Ziggy Klazes, a councillor from GroenLinks who drafted the motion, told the Trouw newspaper. The government of the city of 160,000 says it has not yet been decided whether sustainably produced meat will be included in the ad ban. The proposal was also supported by MPs from the Christian Democratic Challenge party. Climate change: Do I need to stop eating meat? The backlash from the meat industry was swift. ""The authorities are going too far in telling people what's best for them,"" said a spokesman from the Central Organisation for the Meat Sector. The right-wing BVNL party called it an ""unacceptable violation of entrepreneurial freedom"" and said it ""would be fatal for pig farmers"". ""Banning commercials from politically born motives is almost dictatorial,"" Haarlem BVNL councillor Joey Rademaker said. Herman BrÃ¶ring, a law professor from the University of Groningen, said the ban could infringe on freedom of expression and lead to lawsuits from wholesalers. About 95% of people in the Netherlands eat meat, but more than half do not eat it every day,according to Statistics Netherlands.,external Amsterdam and The Hague have already banned adverts for the aviation and fossil fuel industries. Beef produces the most greenhouse gas emissions, which include methane. Lamb has the next highest environmental footprint but these emissions are 50% less than beef.

Pakistan fights to stop biggest lake from burstingA previous attempt to drain the lake failed - and flood levels are still dangerously high.,"Pakistan's biggest lake, Manchar Lake, is on the verge of bursting its banks and flooding surrounding areas Pakistani authorities are struggling to stop their biggest lake from bursting its banks after last-ditch attempts to lower water levels failed. Manchar Lake, in Sindh province, is dangerously full after record monsoons that inundated swathes of Pakistan. Three breaches of the lake's banks so far - two to protect areas nearby - have displaced over 100,000 people. But it could still overflow and rescue teams are racing to evacuate many more people who remain at risk of drowning. Floods in Pakistan have affected some 33 million people and killed at least 1,314, including 458 children, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Agency said. Estimates suggest the floods have caused at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage. Sindh province produces half of the country's food supply, exacerbating fears of serious food shortages in a country already struggling with an economic crisis. Pakistan's navy has been helping rescue some of those stranded - but many more remain at risk of drowning On Sunday, officials breached Manchar lake after it had flooded two rural towns. The hope was the move would prevent it from further bursting its banks and inundating more densely-populated areas. The move affected an estimated 400 villages - a total of 135,000 people. The decision to deliberately flood some villages is a controversial one - the lake straddles two districts, Dadu and Jamshoro, both home to hundreds of thousands of people, and about 80% of the region is underwater. Now residents near the lake are using government machinery to strengthen embankments to try to avoid a catastrophic, unplanned overspill. ""There are three breaches in the lake, two by plan, one is unplanned breach. It is our target that our big cities, towns, we can save them,"" Sindh's minister of irrigation Jam Khan Shoro told the BBC's Newshour programme. Villagers were warned to evacuate before the planned breaches. But local sources say not everyone was taken to safety in time - some didn't want to leave their homes or livestock, a lifeline for many in rural communities, and there are few places for them to go. The military has been brought in to help with evacuations but mostly locals are coming to each other's aid. Some who've left their homes in the last few days ahead of the Manchar breach were taken to a nearby government-run facility that's being used as a shelter for the displaced, but the conditions leave much to be desired. ON THE GROUND:'We spent the whole night running from the flood' IN PICTURES:Floods and fear in Pakistan WATCH:Bed frames used to pull victims over floodwaters Many displaced people are living on the roadside without shelter, food or clean drinking water. ""We have we got nothing here, we try to find food for our kids all day, some nights we sleep without food,"" one woman told the BBC. ""We are scared that the roof may collapse on us - it's damaged,"" another villager said. ""Our children are getting sick and we've been sleeping on the floor - there aren't beds for many of us."" Those who are not cut off are trying to make their way to higher ground Officials have said a little over a quarter of a million people are in shelters, a fraction of the 33 million Pakistanis affected. Relief efforts can't keep pace with demand - there is simply too much need and too few resources. Damaged infrastructure is also hampering aid and rescue operations. Some connecting roads in Sindh province have either collapsed, are flooded or are backed up for days with queuing traffic. Pakistan is facing one of its worst climate-induced natural disasters in years, as record torrential rainfall and melting glaciers in the country's northern mountains have caused devastating floods. Meanwhile, UN children's agency Unicef said more children were at risk of dying from disease in Pakistan due to the shortage of clean water. The disaster has also highlighted the stark disparity between countries that are the largest contributors towards climate change and countries that bear the brunt of its impact. Pakistan produces less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions but its geography makes itextremely vulnerable to climate change.

Hunt for Canada stabbing suspect after brother found dead,"The suspect in a stabbing that left 10 dead and 18 others injured has died after he was arrested by police, officials say Myles Sanderson, 32, was apprehended when police rammed his stolen vehicle off the road after a high-speed car chase Police say Sanderson went into ""medical distress"" after he was detained, and was taken to hospital where he was declared dead His capture in the town of Rosthern in Saskatchewan on Wednesday afternoon ends a giant manhunt that covered three provinces Both Myles Sanderson and his brother, Damien, were charged with murder over Sunday's massacre Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday at James Smith Cree Nation - the indigenous community where most of the victims lived Edited by Rebecca Seales We're now ending our live coverage of the arrest and death of the main suspect in the stabbing spree that claimed the lives of 10 people in Canada on Sunday. Myles Sanderson died after experiencing ""medical distress"" after his arrest on Wednesday, police said, without giving further detail. They also declined to comment further on how his brother Damien, who is accused of helping in the murders, died earlier this week. His body was found on Monday, and police say they suspect his brother may have killed him. Our live coverage was provided by Max Matza, Holly Honderich, Jessica Murphy, Nadine Yousif, Robin Levinson-King and Grace Conley, and edited by Rebecca Seales. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau will be holding a news conference on Thursday from the west coast city of Vancouver. It's safe to assume that he'll be asked extensively about the investigation by journalists there. Earlier on Thursday, he plans to speak on the phone with US President Joe Biden. Trudeau has been introducing tough new anti-gun laws in recent months, last monthimposing a total ban on the import of handguns. It remains to be seen what his administration can do to prevent future mass stabbing attacks. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan In a story that has had many twists, there was a final one this evening: that suspect Myles Sanderson died after being taken into custody. And in a story that also has many unresolved questions, there was another to add: the circumstances of that death, particularly given photos have emerged that seem to show him standing up as he was being arrested. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore didn't have many answers to offer. Asked if he could have died from an overdose - he had a documented history of substance abuse - Blackmore gave no more details. She also refused to say whether Narcan, a drug given to stop overdoses, was administered. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she said, adding that how he died was part of the ongoing investigation. Here's what we've just heard from police: The police press conference is over. They confirmed that Myles Sanderson died following his arrest, but did not provide details on how he died. They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public. ""People want to understand what happened here and how that unfolded,"" she said. She acknowledged this was just the first step in victims' healing process and that many questions remain unanswered. ""They can rest easy tonight knowing that Myles Sanderson is no longer a threat to them,"" she said. Damien Sanderson was found dead on Monday, after being named a suspect and charged with first-degree murder along with his brother. His body was found near other victims around James Smith Cree Nation. ""At this point in time, he is considered a suspect in the homicides that were committed,"" Blackmore says. Police said his injuries did not appear self-inflicted at the time. They did not elaborate during Wednesday's press conference. As people hear updates from police on Myles Sanderson's arrest, several gathered in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan for a sombre vigil. ""Tomorrow we start the process on our grieving"", said James Smith Cree Nation chief Wally Burns to mourners, some of whom wiped away tears. âIâm holding back a lot of hurt, a lot of anger. I wish this was just a dream, but itâs not.â It is one of several vigils that have taken place or are planned for the coming days in honour of the 10 victims who died in the mass stabbing attacks. A collective prayer for James Smith Cree Nation and Weldon residents will also take place at First Nations University of Canada in Regina on Friday. Words of solidarity have poured in from across the nation and around the world. The Queen has also sent her condolences, with a statement earlier today saying she was mourning ""with all Canadians at this tragic time"". Police say there were signs the now-deceased suspect was injured before his arrest. Initial reports on Wednesday, when he was spotted near Wakaw, indicated he may have had an injury. A vehicle was broken into in Weldon, after the attacks on Sunday, and it appeared he may have stolen a first-aid kit. Jessica MurphyBBC News, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan Police in Saskatchewan were quick to send out mobile phone alerts to residents shortly after they realised that a mass attack was taking place. Over the last few days, loud emergency phone alerts with updates on the manhunt became commonplace. These types of alerts are usually sent for missing children or extreme weather events. People I spoke to here were on the fence about the alerts and their frequency. Some felt they were useful information that helped residents to remain cautious and aware. Others thought it was added stress amid the terrible news. But this response suggested that the RCMP - the Royal Canadian Mounted Police - had shifted public communication tactics in the wake of another killing spree in Canada. In Nova Scotia, a maritime province on Canada's east coast, a commission is looking into the police response to a mass shooting when a gunman, posing as a police officer, killed 22 people over the course of two days in April 2020. One of the main issues being looked into at the inquiry?  Why the force failed to use the provincial alert system to warn people of the danger. The last alert sent by police announcing a sighting of the suspect The assistant commissioner continues that police have conducted more than 120 interviews so far in connection with the case as they try to piece together what happened. Asked about the suspect's Myles Sanderson's brother, who was discovered dead on Monday, police say they are not prepared yet to say how he died. ""We may not know how some things unfolded,"" she says. Blackmore says it remains unclear how Damien died, and ""how that unfolded between the two of them"". Asked about the suspect's possible motive, the RCMP assistant commissioner says his motivation ""may at this time and forever just be known to Myles"". Police are now taking questions from journalists in Regina, and have refused to give more detail as to how Sanderson died. ""He was the only occupant of the vehicle when he was arrested,"" says the RCMP assistant commissioner. ""Shortly after being arrested he went into medical distress,"" she says, repeating her earlier statement. She says a post-mortem examination will determine how he died. ""I can't speak to the specific manner of death"", she says, saying how he died is part of the ongoing investigation. Police are now repeating their statement in French, one of Canada's two official languages alongside English. The Saskatchewan RCMP chief adds that she visited the affected communities today, and personally witnessed the ""generosity and support"" of the residents there. She adds her appreciation to all the police officers involved in the search, which took place over an area about half the size of Europe. Police spotted the white truck that he had stolen, and after stopping him, ""through verbal identification, confirmed the driver to Myles Sanderson,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore. ""He was arrested by police and taken into custody. A knife was discovered inside his vehicle,"" she says. ""Shortly after his arrest he went into medical distress,"" she continued without describing how he died. The suspect's stolen vehicle Police have confirmed that Myles Sanderson died shortly after he was arrested earlier on Wednesday, after going into ""medical distress"". ""This evening our province is breathing a collective sigh of relief as Myles Sanderson is no longer at large,"" says Assistant Commissioner Blackmore, beginning her statement. She is now going through a timeline of the police response. Police first arrived at the James Smith Cree Nation at 06:18 on Sunday, she says. ""The magnitude of this investigation is immense,"" she continues. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) are now giving an update from the Mounties' regional headquarters in Regina, the capital of Saskatchewan. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Rhonda Blackmore, who leads the Saskatchewan RCMP, will be speaking. Many questions remain unanswered, including how people were stabbed across two communities in a short space of time, and why police failed to track down Myles Sanderson when he ceased contact with his parole officer. Police say they have will only permit journalists to ask question for 20 minutes after making a statement. Â© 2025 BBC.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says the programme for government is a âpoor readâ which
provides âvery thin gruelâ to anxious Scots looking for reassurance. He says freezing rail fare prices until March only delays a further increase by two months and after 15 years in power, the SNP government lacks the âhumility,
creativity and ambition necessaryâ to solve the problems facing the Scottish people. Mr Cole-Hamilton criticises the new prime minister Liz Truss, saying the UK population has ""no faith that the Conservative government has their best interests at
heart"". And he says the SNP's focus this summer has been on ""breaking up the UK and desperately passing the buck for things
they manifestly have the power to fix"". He hopes the FM felt a âprofound
sense of shameâ as she ""moved between venues at the Edinburgh Fringe"" while the bin strikes caused by ""year on year cuts to local council funding"" resulted in ""all that mess"", ""lost business"" and ""reputational damage"" to the city. ""Our capital was disgraced and diminished by the strikes,"" he says. Roz Foyer, the general secretary of the STUC (Scottish Trade Union Congress) says the Scottish government should be commended for freezing rents. She says that the powers of the Scottish Parliament can bring positive change and now tax powers should be used to bring in more income. ""The Scottish government could raise millions
from income, wealth and business taxes,"" she said. ""The Local Visitor Levy is a step in the
right direction in this regard."" Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor If there's to be a 'big bazooka' response to the energy
price crisis, no-one disputes that Westminster is the legislature with the
powers to do that. And that seems to be where new prime minister Liz Truss is heading this week. Scotland's First Minister made much of the powers she lacks
at Holyrood to address the challenges facing homes and businesses, planting
herself firmly on the side of public sector workers wanting pay to keep pace
with price inflation, but without the funds to ensure that happens. Much of Nicola Sturgeon's Programme for Government is about exhorting
others or getting them to take the strain; notably the Westminster government,
but also banks to go easy on mortgage non-payers, on ScotRail free fares
until next March, and for private landlords, a freeze on both rents and
evictions until next April, with immediate effect. Resulting from the deal with Scottish Green MSPs, the
Scottish government has been consulting on legislation for rent controls.
Today's announcement has a short-term look to it, but one that could be
extended. Landlords say they'll continue taking homes off the market,
meaning rising prices for those who rely on them and creating more homelessness
problems. The big and distinctive commitment from Nicola Sturgeon is
to the Scottish Child Payment, rising to Â£25 per week, from Â£10 less than a
year ago, and extending its reach from pre-school up to 16. It's seen as a powerful weapon against child poverty. But
with a Â£1.7bn hole burned in this year's Holyrood budget by the inflating
price of pay and government procurement, it means an ever tighter constraint on
other public services. Rent freeze a 'big win for hundreds of thousands of tenants' Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent This is a big win for
hundreds of thousands of tenants today. Many people have been enduring
skyrocketing rents at a time when they are being crippled by record household
energy and food bills. I met 26 year old Matthew who moved to Glasgow from Leeds a year ago. He told me this
afternoon he has already had to move flats after his landlord decided to hike
his monthly payments by Â£240. He described being uprooted from a community he
was beginning to settle in to. The reality for many tenants. 26 year old Matthew has already had to move flats due to a rent hike Landlords are furious at this announcement. They complain they are always seen as the âbaddiesâ and a small, greedy minority give the majority a bad name. But, they argue, they too are facing unprecedented costs and this freeze on how much they can charge will force many to leave the sector altogether. If that materialises, it could spell trouble as it would reduce overall availability in the market and may push rent prices up further. Anas Sarwar says there is
more the Scottish government could do to help with the cost of living crisis. He points to Scottish Labourâs
plans to:  Mr Sarwar maintains the first
minister increased rail fares earlier this year, and is now imposing a freeze
on those higher fares. He says the Scottish government could also introduce emergency reforms
to debt legislation, increase  funding for money advice services and cancel school
meal debt. As well as topping up the
welfare fund, offering a water charge rebate and increasing the business hardship fund, these would form the basis of ""an emergency cost of living act"" to ""change lives for the better"", he adds. For almost a year, Labour have been demanding action on the crisis and ""setting the
agenda from opposition"", Mr Sarwar says. ""Imagine what we could do in government,â he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anas Sarwar says the cost of living crisis is
a ânational emergency on the scale of the pandemic"". He says it was âshamefulâ, âimmoral"" and ""inhumaneâ that on the day the price cap increase was announced, with average bills were expected to rise to over Â£3,500, not a single Tory
minister was available to reassure the public. Mr Sarwar calls on the UK government to cancel the expected price increase, impose a cap on energy prices
for business, and introduce an enhanced windfall tax on ""energy companies making record
profits"". These measures will
bring down bills and reduce inflation, he says. The Scottish Labour leader maintains the Scottish government has been ""absent"" at times in the crisis and ""acted like commentators rather than recognising the powers
and responsibilities they have"". He points out that around a third of its income comes from taxes raised in
Scotland, and welcomes the ""change of heart"" from the SNP and Greens over rent freezes. ""I am glad a month of campaigning has paid off,"" he adds. Douglas Ross criticises the Scottish government for introducing another ""unwanted"" indyref2 bill. The Scottish Conservative leader says: ""That is unacceptable at the same time as people are struggling. ""This SNP government is prioritising their planning for a vote on separation, which they know will divide Scotland at exactly the point we should be coming together and uniting."" He says his party's priorities are the right ones for a national emergency and he concludes the programme for government does not meet Scotland's needs. Mr Ross also criticises John Swinney, the deputy first minister who is also the interim finance secretary, for ""squirrelling away"" Â£20m for indyref2. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says this programme for government ""falls woefully short of rising to the big challenges we all face here in Scotland, across the UK and around the world"". Mr Ross also congratulates the new prime minister, Liz Truss, and says that sadly it is the same first minister repeating her mantra of seeking grievance with the Westminster government. He calls on both governments to tackle the crisis by working together. Mr Ross says he has discussed this with the new prime minister and he says there are plans ready to be rolled out, but the SNP are not holding up their end of the deal. The Scottish government intends to introduce a further 18 bills over the course of the parliamentary year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been setting out her plans for the year to come, with a focus on the cost of living crisis. She told MSPs it was ""humanitarian emergency"" that was pushing millions into poverty and threatening the viability of businesses. Ms Sturgeon called on the UK government to take action to freeze energy prices and support for those already struggling to pay bills. She said she could not do everything that, in more normal times, she would want to do because of a lack of money but she wanted to provide an emergency safety net for those struggling to pay bills. Measures include:  The Programme for Government also includes: JUSTICE- The Not Proven verdict will be abolished as part of a Criminal Justice Bill.
The bill will also give statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases. A Children's Care and Justice Bill will finally end the practice of placing children under 18 in young offenders' institutions. EDUCATION- An Education Reform Bill will establish an independent education inspectorate and a new public body responsible for qualifications. HEALTH  TOURISM- A Local Visitor Levy Bill will be created to give local authorities a discretionary power to apply a levy on overnight visitor stays. ABORTION BUFFER ZONES- The Scottish government will support Green MSP Gillian Mackay with her proposed Member's Bill to protect safe access for women to healthcare facilities that provide abortion services. INDEPENDENCE- If the Supreme Court rules that a vote is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish government will legislate for a referendum on 19 October 2023.  Concluding her initial remarks on the programme for government, Nicola Sturgeon says that ""last, but by no means least"", is provision for a Scottish Independence Referendum
Bill. The first minister confirms that if the Supreme Court - starting on 11 October - rules that a consultative vote is within the competence
of the Scottish Parliament, legislation will be brought forward so indyref2 can take place on 19
October next year. The current cost of living crisis highlights ""the pressing need for independence"", she says. It is much worse in the UK, the FM maintains, ""because of a Brexit that Scotland voted
against but was powerless to stop"". While the response of the UK government has been ""woefully inadequate"", she says, the Scottish parliament ""stands
ready, willing and eager to act"". Independence would give Scotland ""the levers we desperately need to respond to
a crisis like this"" and  the ""wherewithal to build a better, wealthier, fairer future"", she adds. Promising to ""do everything possible to
support people and businesses through the difficult months ahead"", the government will ""continue to lay the foundations for a more equal and more
sustainable country"", she concludes. Meanwhile, soaring household energy bills are expected to be cut by energy companies using UK government-backed loans. It is thought energy bills could be frozen at their current level for roughly 18 months under the plans. Energy firms would use the loans to subsidise customer payments, with them repaid by additions to bills over 10 to 20 years or repaid via future taxation. Prime Minister Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with a price freeze widely expected. Energy bills are rocketing and the cap on prices will go up on 1 October, pushing a typical British household's gas and electricity bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549. However, the government is expected to announce on Thursday that it will step in before that rise. It will guarantee loans to energy companies to bridge the gap between the cost of gas and electricity and the fixed price they charge customers. TheLocal Visitor Levy Billwill give local authorities
additional fiscal flexibility. This will help councils, if they so choose, to
fund activities related to tourism and related infrastructure. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will press the UK government to
speed up fundamental reform of the energy market and break the link between the
cost of gas and the price of renewable and low carbon electricity."" This autumn the Scottish government will seek approval
for the Fourth National Planning Framework, which will support the delivery of
renewable energy projects. There will also be an energy strategy and just transition plan to guide the path to net
zero. Solar
energy will be supported, as will the development of wave and tidal technologies. Plans for a further
expansion in onshore wind capacity will also be detailed, as will a finalised Hydrogen Action Plan and
Investment Proposition, backed by Â£100m of capital funding. Two greenports will be established and aCircular Economy Billwill be introduced. AWildlife Management Bill for
Grouseto reduce the negative impact of some grouse moor practices on
wildlife and the environment will also be introduced. Returning to business and the state of the economy, Ms Sturgeon says the government will continue to:  The government will support further
improvements to broadband infrastructure and establish a national
network of six new hubs for tech companies, the first minister says. She adds that Scottish
goods exports, excluding oil and gas, grew by more than 5% in the two years to
the end of March, compared with a fall elsewhere in the UK. ""Scotlandâs position as the most
successful location in the UK, outside of London, for inward investment
projects has also been strengthened,"" the FM says. What is 'not proven'?Scotland, unlike most of the world's legal systems, has three possible verdicts in criminal cases - guilty, not guilty and not proven.
The legal implications of a not proven verdict are exactly the same as a not guilty verdict - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law. Why is it used?Not proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused, ensuring they will not be convicted if the jury has any doubts.
But critics argue that it is confusing for juries and the public, can stigmatise an accused person by appearing not to clear them and fails to provide closure for victims. What is its history?In 2017, Prof James Chalmers and Prof Fiona Leverickpublished a blog,externallooking at its history.
They said there was a common misconception that the not guilty verdict was a later addition to the proven and not proven outcomes.
And they concluded not only is the verdict of ""not proven"" not Scots law's original verdict of acquittal but today's ""not proven"" is used for a very different purpose from that for which it was introduced. The first minister says a Criminal Justice
Bill will, among other measures, provide for the abolition of the Not Proven verdict. If approved by the Scottish Parliament, this will be ""a change of truly historic significance in Scotland, and one firmly
intended to improve access to justice for victims of crime"", Ms Sturgeon says. The bill will also deliver
statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases, she says. The government will also
consult on specific draft laws to effect the recommendations in Helena
Kennedyâs report on tackling misogynistic behaviours. Other bills to be introduced later in the parliament include: A newPublic Health Billto restrict promotions of less healthy food and
drink, and consult on proposals to restrict alcohol promotions, will be introduced. A Womenâs Health
Champion will be appointed. The government will work with Gillian
Mackay, and MSPs across the chamber to safeguard the access of women to
abortion services without harassment or intimidation. Ms Sturgeon says her government will also introduce legislation
for aPatient Safety Commissionerto
help improve safety and amplify the voice of patients. A new mental health and wellbeing strategy, and a refreshed
suicide prevention strategy will be published. The year ahead will also see the creation in law of the National
Care Service. The government will also focus on reducing drug deaths, with a
total investment of Â£250m by the end of this parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Olivia's shooting death cannot be in vain, says dadOlivia Pratt-Korbel is described by her father as a ""real bright spark who loved to laugh"".","This video can not be played The family of Olivia have released a video of the schoolgirl at a Christmas market The dad of a nine-year-old girl who was shot in her own home has paid tribute to her, saying she was a ""real bright spark who loved to laugh"". Olivia Pratt-Korbel was fatally wounded as her mum tried to stop a gunman chasing another man into their home in Liverpool on the evening of 22 August. Olivia's father John Francis Pratt said her death cannot be in vain as he urged those with information to come forward. A 34-year-old manarrested on suspicion of murder on Sundayremains in custody. Merseyside Police was given a further 36 hours on Monday evening to continue questioning the suspect, who was also arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. The same extension was also granted regarding two men, aged 29 and 41, who were held on suspicion of assisting an offender. A fourth man, arrested on Sunday night on suspicion of the same offence, is also being questioned. Olivia Pratt-Korbel's family say they do not want to see another family suffer In a statement from the wider family, Mr Francis Pratt said: ""Words can't express the pain we are going through after Olivia was so cruelly snatched away from us. ""Those responsible need to know what they have done."" He described his daughter as a ""real bright spark who knew her own mind"" and who ""loved to laugh and make people laugh"". ""She could be a proper wind-up merchant and loved to wind her nieces up, particularly those who were older than her. ""And when they didn't like it, she'd just laugh and say 'don't forget I'm your aunty'."" He thanked those who had helped with the police investigation but pleaded for anybody else with information to speak to officers. A tribute was paid to Olivia on the big screen at Goodison Park on Saturday He added: ""We know that most people on Merseyside are good-hearted and kind just like them and we all need to stand together. ""We don't want another child to lose their life in such horrendous circumstances and we don't want to see another family suffer like we are suffering now. ""Olivia's death cannot be in vain and we want people to feel safe and be safe.

How would a freeze on energy prices work?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

What can the new PM do to help people pay their bills?,"As Liz Truss traversed the UK racking up the votes to defeat Rishi Sunak, in the same towns where she wooed the membership hustings, including in leafy apparently affluent areas, the size of the challenge she was vying to inherit was getting notably worse. The situation on the ground has deteriorated for ordinary households and businesses, as prices continued to surge yet higher. And at the same time there has been an ominous turn in the markets for British government borrowing and in currency markets. The combination of these two changes alter the reality of the situation she now takes on as prime minister. The question is how much it changes the immediate solutions she has promised as campaigner. From Durham to Derbyshire and Stoke-on-Trent and beyond, the stories we have reported on in many local communities show the real life depths of this cost of living crisis, even at current energy prices. The surge in food prices is breaking the charitable model of food banks and food pantries that have emerged in almost every town and city. Not only has demand surged, turning many of last year's food charity donors into recipients of support, but supplies are now a problem. Many of these projects are reliant on surplus food stocks from supermarket supply chains. But supermarkets facing massive inflationary pressures, trying to avoid passing on all of those price hikes to consumers, have been trimming surplus stock, meaning there is less tinned goods available for donations. Demand up hugely, at a time when supply is a problem. This is just one manifestation of out-of-control inflation. Jo Yendole from Stone Community hub says some people have stopped using hot water We visited a facility in Stone, Staffordshire. Jo Yendole who helps run Stone Community hub said: ""One of the guys who's on licence from prison, sort of struggling to maintain his flat and the cost of his flat actually said he would prefer to go back to prison because it was easier because he just couldn't see how we were going to afford to live. ""And another lady who she was she's talking about the cost of gas and an energy prices said she'd completely turned her boiler off and wasn't using any hot water and was boiling a kettle. The gas price is not even affordable in the summer for her"". Truss vows action on energy ahead of first day as PM Government closes in on energy rescue plan What could be done to combat high energy costs? Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss At a pantry in Matlock, Derbyshire, which offers subsidised food at about a tenth of supermarket prices, Beverley Parker from Rural Action Derbyshire told me people were returning fresh food, because they could not afford refrigeration costs. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges and freezers because they can't afford the electricity. You're risking your own health and that of your family, by eating food that hasn't been stored correctly. ""A lot of people are choosing to either get rid of their cars or not use them. Public transport in the countryside is limited at best. So we've we've even heard of people walking six miles from the food bank, and then six miles back home, because they can't afford the bus fare."" At another community hub in Peterlee, County Durham, I met dual-income working families who had started to grow their own vegetables and heard the co-ordinators tell of clients pre-emptively cancelling energy bill direct debits. Much of this happened even before the move in prices up to Â£3,549. While the energy companies have tried to pre-empt the arrival of Liz Truss with a ready to go plan to cancel the rise in the energy cap, that might not require upfront borrowing, there are still huge amounts of support being relied upon, even at existing bills. One energy company boss, former government fuel poverty tsar Derek Lickorish who is chairman of Utilita, told me the reality for the poorest customers. A typical Â£50 on prepayment meters which would ordinarily last 12 days in winter, might only last two days from January. ""Liz Truss has said that she intends to solve this problem, and I welcome that. This is a war footing to my mind. It will affect government borrowing. ""If we don't, we're going to have major problems with customers having unaffordable bills. There'll be huge mental health problems, we will see businesses going broke, we'll see people losing their jobs and they want to have disposable income to spend with businesses. It really is Armageddon, if we don't deal with this, and that's what we've got to get on with it"". So as we head towards some version of the energy companies tariff deficit fund being announced imminently by the new prime minister, she faces further pressure from the markets. The dollar has been strong as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has indicated a sharper rise in interest rates. But sterling has fallen notably against the dollar and the euro. Long-term borrowing costs for the government have topped 3%, setting the floor for borrowing for mortgages and for businesses. The government will have to work closely with the Bank of England These are jitters rather than a crisis. In that context it was notable to see both Ms Truss and her likely Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, row back from her early campaign rhetoric criticising the Bank of England. The government and Bank will need to work very closely together in the coming months. An important difference with the pandemic bailout is there can be no expectation that the Bank will buy up most of the issuance of extra government borrowing. The Bank has already indicated it will do the opposite soon as part of ""reverse QE"". If the government needs to borrow more, it will have to find buyers for the debt among pension funds, insurers and foreign buyers, and pay a high price. If the PM wants to abide by her campaign promises to make tens of billions of tax cuts, and help launch an energy bailout for both households and businesses, at a time when energy prices in markets could go yet higher, borrowing will have to go up in the first instance. But if she does not help both sectors, disposable income will drain from the economy, and many small businesses will simply go bust, hiking up unemployment too. The new prime minister already faced a very tricky balancing act between inflation and recession. The past month means the room for manoeuvre has got even smaller.

Myles Sanderson died after experiencing ""medical distress"" after his arrest on Wednesday, police said, without giving further detail.

They said more would be revealed as the investigation continued, and urged the public to continue to share information pertaining to the case. Blackmore said it's traumatic for victims to recount memories. The investigation has included more than 100 interviews with victims and witnesses and members of the public.

UK to borrow billions to cut energy bills,"Prime Minister Liz Truss is understood to be planning to borrow billions to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500 with full details expected on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. The government's plans to subsidise bills means that customers will not be expected to repay the support. It is unclear how long the government support will last, but the overall government support package is expected to total around Â£100bn. The  ultimate figure will depend on gas and energy price movements in the highly volatile international energy markets as well as how much additional support is offered to the most vulnerable. Ms Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with details expected to be announced on Thursday. Energy bosses have insisted for some time that a government-backed superfund from which they could borrow to subsidise bills ""is the only game in town"". However, the government is understood to be reluctant to see money added to customer bills for up to 20 years so energy companies could pay back the loans. It is also thought to be reluctant to add the cost to general taxation, given their pledges to be a tax cutting government. What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? New PM Liz Truss expected to freeze energy bills Warning firms will close this winter without help What cost-of-living payments will I get? Kwasi Kwarteng - tipped to be the new chancellor - has already indicated the government is prepared to borrow to support the economy. This would be consistent with Ms Truss' position that the UK needs to break free of the Treasury's strict spending rules. Nevertheless, the estimated Â£100bn is a sizeable sum to borrow at the same time as cutting taxes and boosting spending on defence and it could end up costing more than that, given the fluctuating price of wholesale gas. ""One of the dangers here is that it could even be more expensive than Â£100bn,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, contrasting it with the Covid-prompted furlough scheme, which cost Â£60bn-Â£70bn. ""There has to be a risk that energy prices stay high for a long time, perhaps even up to three or four years,"" he said. ""Then this starts being baked into public spending long-term."" The cost of UK government borrowing hit its highest level for eight years on Tuesday, with the yield on ten-year bonds rising above 3%. That reflects the market's expectation that the government will have to borrow more and means any future borrowing will be more expensive. Mr Johnson said the plan to borrow to support energy bills was only one you would adopt ""if you can't think of anything else"" because it amounted to subsidising everybody's gas use, when the higher price suggested there was not enough gas available. That could lead to rationing, he suggested, and would mean high-income households would benefit by a much larger amount than those at the lower end. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Government sources say that over time, new energy supply measures - such as cutting the link between renewable sources and the gas price - will lower costs while a growing economy will shrink the proportion of overall debt to the size of the economy. Businesses are also expected to be offered some relief in the plan set to be announced on Thursday. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more. Thousands would go bust or cut their wage bills by firing staff. The precise mechanism to help business may be more complicated and would be reviewed more frequently but reports suggest it could see the government mandate energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy businesses use. Including businesses could easily push the cost of the government's energy plan over Â£100bn. Alex Veitch of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""It is encouraging that the government is seriously considering the support it can give to businesses during these very difficult times. ""But it remains to be seen whether these plans will go far enough in offering the help that many firms so desperately need."" Craig Beaumont from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""This commitment looks very promising, and arguably the best reassurance that small businesses need that some form of help with bills will follow - not just for households. ""The scope and reach of the help is going to be absolutely crucial to save hundreds of thousands of small businesses this winter."" What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills?

An emergency Scottish budget will be made in the coming weeks, once it becomes clear how Ms Truss intends to react Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says ""both governments need to tackle the cost of living crisis together"", but Ms Sturgeon is prioritising another independence referendum BBC Scotland News Nicola Sturgeon has announceda rent freeze for public and private rented propertiesas part of efforts to help people struggling with rising bills. The first minister's government is to table emergency legislation banning evictions during winter and freezing rents until spring. There are also plans to freeze rail fares and to boost the Scottish Child Payment to Â£25 per week from November. Ms Sturgeon has also written to new Prime Minister Liz Truss, asking her to convene a four-nation meeting of political leaders to focus on helping households. Other measures in the programme for government includedabolishing the controversial ""not proven"" verdict. This video can not be played Sturgeon announces Scottish rent freeze plan to tackle cost of living Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross accused the first minister of playing to her supporters. ""The SNP and the Greens are failing to put their party politics aside in the face of these massive challenges that we're facing,"" he said. ""They're failing to pause their priorities to focus on the national interest. ""And they're failing to rise to the challenge of this crisis and be bold in their action, which the public expect."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar welcomed the Scottish Government's ""change of heart"" on rent freezes. That's all from us here on the live page, have a good evening.

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says the programme for government is a âpoor readâ which
provides âvery thin gruelâ to anxious Scots looking for reassurance. He says freezing rail fare prices until March only delays a further increase by two months and after 15 years in power, the SNP government lacks the âhumility,
creativity and ambition necessaryâ to solve the problems facing the Scottish people. Mr Cole-Hamilton criticises the new prime minister Liz Truss, saying the UK population has ""no faith that the Conservative government has their best interests at
heart"". And he says the SNP's focus this summer has been on ""breaking up the UK and desperately passing the buck for things
they manifestly have the power to fix"". He hopes the FM felt a âprofound
sense of shameâ as she ""moved between venues at the Edinburgh Fringe"" while the bin strikes caused by ""year on year cuts to local council funding"" resulted in ""all that mess"", ""lost business"" and ""reputational damage"" to the city. ""Our capital was disgraced and diminished by the strikes,"" he says. Roz Foyer, the general secretary of the STUC (Scottish Trade Union Congress) says the Scottish government should be commended for freezing rents. She says that the powers of the Scottish Parliament can bring positive change and now tax powers should be used to bring in more income. ""The Scottish government could raise millions
from income, wealth and business taxes,"" she said. ""The Local Visitor Levy is a step in the
right direction in this regard."" Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor If there's to be a 'big bazooka' response to the energy
price crisis, no-one disputes that Westminster is the legislature with the
powers to do that. And that seems to be where new prime minister Liz Truss is heading this week. Scotland's First Minister made much of the powers she lacks
at Holyrood to address the challenges facing homes and businesses, planting
herself firmly on the side of public sector workers wanting pay to keep pace
with price inflation, but without the funds to ensure that happens. Much of Nicola Sturgeon's Programme for Government is about exhorting
others or getting them to take the strain; notably the Westminster government,
but also banks to go easy on mortgage non-payers, on ScotRail free fares
until next March, and for private landlords, a freeze on both rents and
evictions until next April, with immediate effect. Resulting from the deal with Scottish Green MSPs, the
Scottish government has been consulting on legislation for rent controls.
Today's announcement has a short-term look to it, but one that could be
extended. Landlords say they'll continue taking homes off the market,
meaning rising prices for those who rely on them and creating more homelessness
problems. The big and distinctive commitment from Nicola Sturgeon is
to the Scottish Child Payment, rising to Â£25 per week, from Â£10 less than a
year ago, and extending its reach from pre-school up to 16. It's seen as a powerful weapon against child poverty. But
with a Â£1.7bn hole burned in this year's Holyrood budget by the inflating
price of pay and government procurement, it means an ever tighter constraint on
other public services. Rent freeze a 'big win for hundreds of thousands of tenants' Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent This is a big win for
hundreds of thousands of tenants today. Many people have been enduring
skyrocketing rents at a time when they are being crippled by record household
energy and food bills. I met 26 year old Matthew who moved to Glasgow from Leeds a year ago. He told me this
afternoon he has already had to move flats after his landlord decided to hike
his monthly payments by Â£240. He described being uprooted from a community he
was beginning to settle in to. The reality for many tenants. 26 year old Matthew has already had to move flats due to a rent hike Landlords are furious at this announcement. They complain they are always seen as the âbaddiesâ and a small, greedy minority give the majority a bad name. But, they argue, they too are facing unprecedented costs and this freeze on how much they can charge will force many to leave the sector altogether. If that materialises, it could spell trouble as it would reduce overall availability in the market and may push rent prices up further. Anas Sarwar says there is
more the Scottish government could do to help with the cost of living crisis. He points to Scottish Labourâs
plans to:  Mr Sarwar maintains the first
minister increased rail fares earlier this year, and is now imposing a freeze
on those higher fares. He says the Scottish government could also introduce emergency reforms
to debt legislation, increase  funding for money advice services and cancel school
meal debt. As well as topping up the
welfare fund, offering a water charge rebate and increasing the business hardship fund, these would form the basis of ""an emergency cost of living act"" to ""change lives for the better"", he adds. For almost a year, Labour have been demanding action on the crisis and ""setting the
agenda from opposition"", Mr Sarwar says. ""Imagine what we could do in government,â he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anas Sarwar says the cost of living crisis is
a ânational emergency on the scale of the pandemic"". He says it was âshamefulâ, âimmoral"" and ""inhumaneâ that on the day the price cap increase was announced, with average bills were expected to rise to over Â£3,500, not a single Tory
minister was available to reassure the public. Mr Sarwar calls on the UK government to cancel the expected price increase, impose a cap on energy prices
for business, and introduce an enhanced windfall tax on ""energy companies making record
profits"". These measures will
bring down bills and reduce inflation, he says. The Scottish Labour leader maintains the Scottish government has been ""absent"" at times in the crisis and ""acted like commentators rather than recognising the powers
and responsibilities they have"". He points out that around a third of its income comes from taxes raised in
Scotland, and welcomes the ""change of heart"" from the SNP and Greens over rent freezes. ""I am glad a month of campaigning has paid off,"" he adds. Douglas Ross criticises the Scottish government for introducing another ""unwanted"" indyref2 bill. The Scottish Conservative leader says: ""That is unacceptable at the same time as people are struggling.

He says his party's priorities are the right ones for a national emergency and he concludes the programme for government does not meet Scotland's needs.

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says this programme for government ""falls woefully short of rising to the big challenges we all face here in Scotland, across the UK and around the world"". Mr Ross also congratulates the new prime minister, Liz Truss, and says that sadly it is the same first minister repeating her mantra of seeking grievance with the Westminster government. He calls on both governments to tackle the crisis by working together. Mr Ross says he has discussed this with the new prime minister and he says there are plans ready to be rolled out, but the SNP are not holding up their end of the deal. The Scottish government intends to introduce a further 18 bills over the course of the parliamentary year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been setting out her plans for the year to come, with a focus on the cost of living crisis. She told MSPs it was ""humanitarian emergency"" that was pushing millions into poverty and threatening the viability of businesses. Ms Sturgeon called on the UK government to take action to freeze energy prices and support for those already struggling to pay bills. She said she could not do everything that, in more normal times, she would want to do because of a lack of money but she wanted to provide an emergency safety net for those struggling to pay bills. Measures include:  The Programme for Government also includes: JUSTICE- The Not Proven verdict will be abolished as part of a Criminal Justice Bill.
The bill will also give statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases. A Children's Care and Justice Bill will finally end the practice of placing children under 18 in young offenders' institutions. EDUCATION- An Education Reform Bill will establish an independent education inspectorate and a new public body responsible for qualifications. HEALTH  TOURISM- A Local Visitor Levy Bill will be created to give local authorities a discretionary power to apply a levy on overnight visitor stays. ABORTION BUFFER ZONES- The Scottish government will support Green MSP Gillian Mackay with her proposed Member's Bill to protect safe access for women to healthcare facilities that provide abortion services. INDEPENDENCE- If the Supreme Court rules that a vote is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish government will legislate for a referendum on 19 October 2023.  Concluding her initial remarks on the programme for government, Nicola Sturgeon says that ""last, but by no means least"", is provision for a Scottish Independence Referendum
Bill. The first minister confirms that if the Supreme Court - starting on 11 October - rules that a consultative vote is within the competence
of the Scottish Parliament, legislation will be brought forward so indyref2 can take place on 19
October next year. The current cost of living crisis highlights ""the pressing need for independence"", she says. It is much worse in the UK, the FM maintains, ""because of a Brexit that Scotland voted
against but was powerless to stop"". While the response of the UK government has been ""woefully inadequate"", she says, the Scottish parliament ""stands
ready, willing and eager to act"". Independence would give Scotland ""the levers we desperately need to respond to
a crisis like this"" and  the ""wherewithal to build a better, wealthier, fairer future"", she adds. Promising to ""do everything possible to
support people and businesses through the difficult months ahead"", the government will ""continue to lay the foundations for a more equal and more
sustainable country"", she concludes. Meanwhile, soaring household energy bills are expected to be cut by energy companies using UK government-backed loans. It is thought energy bills could be frozen at their current level for roughly 18 months under the plans. Energy firms would use the loans to subsidise customer payments, with them repaid by additions to bills over 10 to 20 years or repaid via future taxation. Prime Minister Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with a price freeze widely expected. Energy bills are rocketing and the cap on prices will go up on 1 October, pushing a typical British household's gas and electricity bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549. However, the government is expected to announce on Thursday that it will step in before that rise. It will guarantee loans to energy companies to bridge the gap between the cost of gas and electricity and the fixed price they charge customers. TheLocal Visitor Levy Billwill give local authorities
additional fiscal flexibility. This will help councils, if they so choose, to
fund activities related to tourism and related infrastructure. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will press the UK government to
speed up fundamental reform of the energy market and break the link between the
cost of gas and the price of renewable and low carbon electricity."" This autumn the Scottish government will seek approval
for the Fourth National Planning Framework, which will support the delivery of
renewable energy projects. There will also be an energy strategy and just transition plan to guide the path to net
zero. Solar
energy will be supported, as will the development of wave and tidal technologies. Plans for a further
expansion in onshore wind capacity will also be detailed, as will a finalised Hydrogen Action Plan and
Investment Proposition, backed by Â£100m of capital funding. Two greenports will be established and aCircular Economy Billwill be introduced. AWildlife Management Bill for
Grouseto reduce the negative impact of some grouse moor practices on
wildlife and the environment will also be introduced. Returning to business and the state of the economy, Ms Sturgeon says the government will continue to:  The government will support further
improvements to broadband infrastructure and establish a national
network of six new hubs for tech companies, the first minister says. She adds that Scottish
goods exports, excluding oil and gas, grew by more than 5% in the two years to
the end of March, compared with a fall elsewhere in the UK. ""Scotlandâs position as the most
successful location in the UK, outside of London, for inward investment
projects has also been strengthened,"" the FM says. What is 'not proven'?Scotland, unlike most of the world's legal systems, has three possible verdicts in criminal cases - guilty, not guilty and not proven.
The legal implications of a not proven verdict are exactly the same as a not guilty verdict - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law. Why is it used?Not proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused, ensuring they will not be convicted if the jury has any doubts.
But critics argue that it is confusing for juries and the public, can stigmatise an accused person by appearing not to clear them and fails to provide closure for victims. What is its history?In 2017, Prof James Chalmers and Prof Fiona Leverickpublished a blog,externallooking at its history.
They said there was a common misconception that the not guilty verdict was a later addition to the proven and not proven outcomes.
And they concluded not only is the verdict of ""not proven"" not Scots law's original verdict of acquittal but today's ""not proven"" is used for a very different purpose from that for which it was introduced. The first minister says a Criminal Justice
Bill will, among other measures, provide for the abolition of the Not Proven verdict. If approved by the Scottish Parliament, this will be ""a change of truly historic significance in Scotland, and one firmly
intended to improve access to justice for victims of crime"", Ms Sturgeon says. The bill will also deliver
statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases, she says. The government will also
consult on specific draft laws to effect the recommendations in Helena
Kennedyâs report on tackling misogynistic behaviours. Other bills to be introduced later in the parliament include: A newPublic Health Billto restrict promotions of less healthy food and
drink, and consult on proposals to restrict alcohol promotions, will be introduced. A Womenâs Health
Champion will be appointed. The government will work with Gillian
Mackay, and MSPs across the chamber to safeguard the access of women to
abortion services without harassment or intimidation. Ms Sturgeon says her government will also introduce legislation
for aPatient Safety Commissionerto
help improve safety and amplify the voice of patients. A new mental health and wellbeing strategy, and a refreshed
suicide prevention strategy will be published. The year ahead will also see the creation in law of the National
Care Service. The government will also focus on reducing drug deaths, with a
total investment of Â£250m by the end of this parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says the programme for government is a âpoor readâ which
provides âvery thin gruelâ to anxious Scots looking for reassurance. He says freezing rail fare prices until March only delays a further increase by two months and after 15 years in power, the SNP government lacks the âhumility,
creativity and ambition necessaryâ to solve the problems facing the Scottish people. Mr Cole-Hamilton criticises the new prime minister Liz Truss, saying the UK population has ""no faith that the Conservative government has their best interests at
heart"". And he says the SNP's focus this summer has been on ""breaking up the UK and desperately passing the buck for things
they manifestly have the power to fix"". He hopes the FM felt a âprofound

Roz Foyer, the general secretary of the STUC (Scottish Trade Union Congress) says the Scottish government should be commended for freezing rents. She says that the powers of the Scottish Parliament can bring positive change and now tax powers should be used to bring in more income. ""The Scottish government could raise millions
from income, wealth and business taxes,"" she said. ""The Local Visitor Levy is a step in the
right direction in this regard."" Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor If there's to be a 'big bazooka' response to the energy
price crisis, no-one disputes that Westminster is the legislature with the
powers to do that. And that seems to be where new prime minister Liz Truss is heading this week. Scotland's First Minister made much of the powers she lacks
at Holyrood to address the challenges facing homes and businesses, planting
herself firmly on the side of public sector workers wanting pay to keep pace
with price inflation, but without the funds to ensure that happens. Much of Nicola Sturgeon's Programme for Government is about exhorting
others or getting them to take the strain; notably the Westminster government,
but also banks to go easy on mortgage non-payers, on ScotRail free fares
until next March, and for private landlords, a freeze on both rents and
evictions until next April, with immediate effect. Resulting from the deal with Scottish Green MSPs, the
Scottish government has been consulting on legislation for rent controls.
Today's announcement has a short-term look to it, but one that could be
extended. Landlords say they'll continue taking homes off the market,
meaning rising prices for those who rely on them and creating more homelessness
problems. The big and distinctive commitment from Nicola Sturgeon is
to the Scottish Child Payment, rising to Â£25 per week, from Â£10 less than a
year ago, and extending its reach from pre-school up to 16. It's seen as a powerful weapon against child poverty. But
with a Â£1.7bn hole burned in this year's Holyrood budget by the inflating
price of pay and government procurement, it means an ever tighter constraint on
other public services. Rent freeze a 'big win for hundreds of thousands of tenants' Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent This is a big win for
hundreds of thousands of tenants today. Many people have been enduring
skyrocketing rents at a time when they are being crippled by record household
energy and food bills. I met 26 year old Matthew who moved to Glasgow from Leeds a year ago. He told me this
afternoon he has already had to move flats after his landlord decided to hike
his monthly payments by Â£240. He described being uprooted from a community he
was beginning to settle in to. The reality for many tenants. 26 year old Matthew has already had to move flats due to a rent hike Landlords are furious at this announcement. They complain they are always seen as the âbaddiesâ and a small, greedy minority give the majority a bad name. But, they argue, they too are facing unprecedented costs and this freeze on how much they can charge will force many to leave the sector altogether. If that materialises, it could spell trouble as it would reduce overall availability in the market and may push rent prices up further. Anas Sarwar says there is
more the Scottish government could do to help with the cost of living crisis. He points to Scottish Labourâs
plans to:  Mr Sarwar maintains the first
minister increased rail fares earlier this year, and is now imposing a freeze
on those higher fares. He says the Scottish government could also introduce emergency reforms
to debt legislation, increase  funding for money advice services and cancel school
meal debt. As well as topping up the
welfare fund, offering a water charge rebate and increasing the business hardship fund, these would form the basis of ""an emergency cost of living act"" to ""change lives for the better"", he adds. For almost a year, Labour have been demanding action on the crisis and ""setting the
agenda from opposition"", Mr Sarwar says. ""Imagine what we could do in government,â he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anas Sarwar says the cost of living crisis is
a ânational emergency on the scale of the pandemic"". He says it was âshamefulâ, âimmoral"" and ""inhumaneâ that on the day the price cap increase was announced, with average bills were expected to rise to over Â£3,500, not a single Tory
minister was available to reassure the public. Mr Sarwar calls on the UK government to cancel the expected price increase, impose a cap on energy prices
for business, and introduce an enhanced windfall tax on ""energy companies making record
profits"". These measures will
bring down bills and reduce inflation, he says. The Scottish Labour leader maintains the Scottish government has been ""absent"" at times in the crisis and ""acted like commentators rather than recognising the powers
and responsibilities they have"". He points out that around a third of its income comes from taxes raised in
Scotland, and welcomes the ""change of heart"" from the SNP and Greens over rent freezes. ""I am glad a month of campaigning has paid off,"" he adds. Douglas Ross criticises the Scottish government for introducing another ""unwanted"" indyref2 bill. The Scottish Conservative leader says: ""That is unacceptable at the same time as people are struggling. ""This SNP government is prioritising their planning for a vote on separation, which they know will divide Scotland at exactly the point we should be coming together and uniting."" He says his party's priorities are the right ones for a national emergency and he concludes the programme for government does not meet Scotland's needs.

Anas Sarwar says the cost of living crisis is
a ânational emergency on the scale of the pandemic"". He says it was âshamefulâ, âimmoral"" and ""inhumaneâ that on the day the price cap increase was announced, with average bills were expected to rise to over Â£3,500, not a single Tory

for business, and introduce an enhanced windfall tax on ""energy companies making record

bring down bills and reduce inflation, he says. The Scottish Labour leader maintains the Scottish government has been ""absent"" at times in the crisis and ""acted like commentators rather than recognising the powers

Scotland, and welcomes the ""change of heart"" from the SNP and Greens over rent freezes. ""I am glad a month of campaigning has paid off,"" he adds.

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says this programme for government ""falls woefully short of rising to the big challenges we all face here in Scotland, across the UK and around the world"". Mr Ross also congratulates the new prime minister, Liz Truss, and says that sadly it is the same first minister repeating her mantra of seeking grievance with the Westminster government. He calls on both governments to tackle the crisis by working together. Mr Ross says he has discussed this with the new prime minister and he says there are plans ready to be rolled out, but the SNP are not holding up their end of the deal. The Scottish government intends to introduce a further 18 bills over the course of the parliamentary year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been setting out her plans for the year to come, with a focus on the cost of living crisis. She told MSPs it was ""humanitarian emergency"" that was pushing millions into poverty and threatening the viability of businesses. Ms Sturgeon called on the UK government to take action to freeze energy prices and support for those already struggling to pay bills. She said she could not do everything that, in more normal times, she would want to do because of a lack of money but she wanted to provide an emergency safety net for those struggling to pay bills. Measures include:  The Programme for Government also includes: JUSTICE- The Not Proven verdict will be abolished as part of a Criminal Justice Bill.
The bill will also give statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases. A Children's Care and Justice Bill will finally end the practice of placing children under 18 in young offenders' institutions. EDUCATION- An Education Reform Bill will establish an independent education inspectorate and a new public body responsible for qualifications. HEALTH  TOURISM- A Local Visitor Levy Bill will be created to give local authorities a discretionary power to apply a levy on overnight visitor stays. ABORTION BUFFER ZONES- The Scottish government will support Green MSP Gillian Mackay with her proposed Member's Bill to protect safe access for women to healthcare facilities that provide abortion services. INDEPENDENCE- If the Supreme Court rules that a vote is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish government will legislate for a referendum on 19 October 2023.  Concluding her initial remarks on the programme for government, Nicola Sturgeon says that ""last, but by no means least"", is provision for a Scottish Independence Referendum
Bill. The first minister confirms that if the Supreme Court - starting on 11 October - rules that a consultative vote is within the competence
of the Scottish Parliament, legislation will be brought forward so indyref2 can take place on 19
October next year. The current cost of living crisis highlights ""the pressing need for independence"", she says. It is much worse in the UK, the FM maintains, ""because of a Brexit that Scotland voted
against but was powerless to stop"". While the response of the UK government has been ""woefully inadequate"", she says, the Scottish parliament ""stands
ready, willing and eager to act"". Independence would give Scotland ""the levers we desperately need to respond to
a crisis like this"" and  the ""wherewithal to build a better, wealthier, fairer future"", she adds. Promising to ""do everything possible to
support people and businesses through the difficult months ahead"", the government will ""continue to lay the foundations for a more equal and more
sustainable country"", she concludes. Meanwhile, soaring household energy bills are expected to be cut by energy companies using UK government-backed loans. It is thought energy bills could be frozen at their current level for roughly 18 months under the plans. Energy firms would use the loans to subsidise customer payments, with them repaid by additions to bills over 10 to 20 years or repaid via future taxation. Prime Minister Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with a price freeze widely expected. Energy bills are rocketing and the cap on prices will go up on 1 October, pushing a typical British household's gas and electricity bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549. However, the government is expected to announce on Thursday that it will step in before that rise. It will guarantee loans to energy companies to bridge the gap between the cost of gas and electricity and the fixed price they charge customers. TheLocal Visitor Levy Billwill give local authorities
additional fiscal flexibility. This will help councils, if they so choose, to
fund activities related to tourism and related infrastructure. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will press the UK government to
speed up fundamental reform of the energy market and break the link between the
cost of gas and the price of renewable and low carbon electricity."" This autumn the Scottish government will seek approval
for the Fourth National Planning Framework, which will support the delivery of
renewable energy projects. There will also be an energy strategy and just transition plan to guide the path to net
zero. Solar
energy will be supported, as will the development of wave and tidal technologies. Plans for a further
expansion in onshore wind capacity will also be detailed, as will a finalised Hydrogen Action Plan and
Investment Proposition, backed by Â£100m of capital funding. Two greenports will be established and aCircular Economy Billwill be introduced. AWildlife Management Bill for
Grouseto reduce the negative impact of some grouse moor practices on
wildlife and the environment will also be introduced. Returning to business and the state of the economy, Ms Sturgeon says the government will continue to:  The government will support further
improvements to broadband infrastructure and establish a national
network of six new hubs for tech companies, the first minister says. She adds that Scottish
goods exports, excluding oil and gas, grew by more than 5% in the two years to
the end of March, compared with a fall elsewhere in the UK. ""Scotlandâs position as the most
successful location in the UK, outside of London, for inward investment
projects has also been strengthened,"" the FM says. What is 'not proven'?Scotland, unlike most of the world's legal systems, has three possible verdicts in criminal cases - guilty, not guilty and not proven.
The legal implications of a not proven verdict are exactly the same as a not guilty verdict - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law. Why is it used?Not proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused, ensuring they will not be convicted if the jury has any doubts.
But critics argue that it is confusing for juries and the public, can stigmatise an accused person by appearing not to clear them and fails to provide closure for victims. What is its history?In 2017, Prof James Chalmers and Prof Fiona Leverickpublished a blog,externallooking at its history.
They said there was a common misconception that the not guilty verdict was a later addition to the proven and not proven outcomes.
And they concluded not only is the verdict of ""not proven"" not Scots law's original verdict of acquittal but today's ""not proven"" is used for a very different purpose from that for which it was introduced. The first minister says a Criminal Justice
Bill will, among other measures, provide for the abolition of the Not Proven verdict. If approved by the Scottish Parliament, this will be ""a change of truly historic significance in Scotland, and one firmly
intended to improve access to justice for victims of crime"", Ms Sturgeon says. The bill will also deliver
statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases, she says. The government will also
consult on specific draft laws to effect the recommendations in Helena
Kennedyâs report on tackling misogynistic behaviours. Other bills to be introduced later in the parliament include: A newPublic Health Billto restrict promotions of less healthy food and
drink, and consult on proposals to restrict alcohol promotions, will be introduced. A Womenâs Health
Champion will be appointed. The government will work with Gillian
Mackay, and MSPs across the chamber to safeguard the access of women to
abortion services without harassment or intimidation. Ms Sturgeon says her government will also introduce legislation
for aPatient Safety Commissionerto
help improve safety and amplify the voice of patients. A new mental health and wellbeing strategy, and a refreshed
suicide prevention strategy will be published. The year ahead will also see the creation in law of the National
Care Service. The government will also focus on reducing drug deaths, with a
total investment of Â£250m by the end of this parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

provides âvery thin gruelâ to anxious Scots looking for reassurance. He says freezing rail fare prices until March only delays a further increase by two months and after 15 years in power, the SNP government lacks the âhumility,
creativity and ambition necessaryâ to solve the problems facing the Scottish people. Mr Cole-Hamilton criticises the new prime minister Liz Truss, saying the UK population has ""no faith that the Conservative government has their best interests at

Roz Foyer, the general secretary of the STUC (Scottish Trade Union Congress) says the Scottish government should be commended for freezing rents. She says that the powers of the Scottish Parliament can bring positive change and now tax powers should be used to bring in more income. ""The Scottish government could raise millions
from income, wealth and business taxes,"" she said. ""The Local Visitor Levy is a step in the
right direction in this regard."" Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor If there's to be a 'big bazooka' response to the energy
price crisis, no-one disputes that Westminster is the legislature with the
powers to do that. And that seems to be where new prime minister Liz Truss is heading this week. Scotland's First Minister made much of the powers she lacks
at Holyrood to address the challenges facing homes and businesses, planting
herself firmly on the side of public sector workers wanting pay to keep pace
with price inflation, but without the funds to ensure that happens. Much of Nicola Sturgeon's Programme for Government is about exhorting
others or getting them to take the strain; notably the Westminster government,
but also banks to go easy on mortgage non-payers, on ScotRail free fares
until next March, and for private landlords, a freeze on both rents and
evictions until next April, with immediate effect. Resulting from the deal with Scottish Green MSPs, the
Scottish government has been consulting on legislation for rent controls.
Today's announcement has a short-term look to it, but one that could be
extended. Landlords say they'll continue taking homes off the market,
meaning rising prices for those who rely on them and creating more homelessness
problems. The big and distinctive commitment from Nicola Sturgeon is
to the Scottish Child Payment, rising to Â£25 per week, from Â£10 less than a
year ago, and extending its reach from pre-school up to 16. It's seen as a powerful weapon against child poverty. But
with a Â£1.7bn hole burned in this year's Holyrood budget by the inflating
price of pay and government procurement, it means an ever tighter constraint on
other public services. Rent freeze a 'big win for hundreds of thousands of tenants' Connor GilliesConsumer Affairs Correspondent This is a big win for
hundreds of thousands of tenants today. Many people have been enduring
skyrocketing rents at a time when they are being crippled by record household
energy and food bills. I met 26 year old Matthew who moved to Glasgow from Leeds a year ago. He told me this
afternoon he has already had to move flats after his landlord decided to hike
his monthly payments by Â£240. He described being uprooted from a community he
was beginning to settle in to. The reality for many tenants. 26 year old Matthew has already had to move flats due to a rent hike Landlords are furious at this announcement. They complain they are always seen as the âbaddiesâ and a small, greedy minority give the majority a bad name. But, they argue, they too are facing unprecedented costs and this freeze on how much they can charge will force many to leave the sector altogether. If that materialises, it could spell trouble as it would reduce overall availability in the market and may push rent prices up further. Anas Sarwar says there is
more the Scottish government could do to help with the cost of living crisis. He points to Scottish Labourâs
plans to:  Mr Sarwar maintains the first
minister increased rail fares earlier this year, and is now imposing a freeze
on those higher fares. He says the Scottish government could also introduce emergency reforms
to debt legislation, increase  funding for money advice services and cancel school
meal debt. As well as topping up the
welfare fund, offering a water charge rebate and increasing the business hardship fund, these would form the basis of ""an emergency cost of living act"" to ""change lives for the better"", he adds. For almost a year, Labour have been demanding action on the crisis and ""setting the
agenda from opposition"", Mr Sarwar says. ""Imagine what we could do in government,â he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If that materialises, it could spell trouble as it would reduce overall availability in the market and may push rent prices up further. Anas Sarwar says there is
more the Scottish government could do to help with the cost of living crisis. He points to Scottish Labourâs
plans to:  Mr Sarwar maintains the first
minister increased rail fares earlier this year, and is now imposing a freeze
on those higher fares. He says the Scottish government could also introduce emergency reforms
to debt legislation, increase  funding for money advice services and cancel school
meal debt. As well as topping up the
welfare fund, offering a water charge rebate and increasing the business hardship fund, these would form the basis of ""an emergency cost of living act"" to ""change lives for the better"", he adds. For almost a year, Labour have been demanding action on the crisis and ""setting the
agenda from opposition"", Mr Sarwar says. ""Imagine what we could do in government,â he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Anas Sarwar says the cost of living crisis is
a ânational emergency on the scale of the pandemic"". He says it was âshamefulâ, âimmoral"" and ""inhumaneâ that on the day the price cap increase was announced, with average bills were expected to rise to over Â£3,500, not a single Tory
minister was available to reassure the public. Mr Sarwar calls on the UK government to cancel the expected price increase, impose a cap on energy prices
for business, and introduce an enhanced windfall tax on ""energy companies making record
profits"". These measures will
bring down bills and reduce inflation, he says. The Scottish Labour leader maintains the Scottish government has been ""absent"" at times in the crisis and ""acted like commentators rather than recognising the powers
and responsibilities they have"". He points out that around a third of its income comes from taxes raised in
Scotland, and welcomes the ""change of heart"" from the SNP and Greens over rent freezes. ""I am glad a month of campaigning has paid off,"" he adds. Douglas Ross criticises the Scottish government for introducing another ""unwanted"" indyref2 bill. The Scottish Conservative leader says: ""That is unacceptable at the same time as people are struggling. ""This SNP government is prioritising their planning for a vote on separation, which they know will divide Scotland at exactly the point we should be coming together and uniting."" He says his party's priorities are the right ones for a national emergency and he concludes the programme for government does not meet Scotland's needs. Mr Ross also criticises John Swinney, the deputy first minister who is also the interim finance secretary, for ""squirrelling away"" Â£20m for indyref2. Allow Twitter content?

Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross says this programme for government ""falls woefully short of rising to the big challenges we all face here in Scotland, across the UK and around the world"". Mr Ross also congratulates the new prime minister, Liz Truss, and says that sadly it is the same first minister repeating her mantra of seeking grievance with the Westminster government. He calls on both governments to tackle the crisis by working together. Mr Ross says he has discussed this with the new prime minister and he says there are plans ready to be rolled out, but the SNP are not holding up their end of the deal. The Scottish government intends to introduce a further 18 bills over the course of the parliamentary year. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been setting out her plans for the year to come, with a focus on the cost of living crisis. She told MSPs it was ""humanitarian emergency"" that was pushing millions into poverty and threatening the viability of businesses. Ms Sturgeon called on the UK government to take action to freeze energy prices and support for those already struggling to pay bills. She said she could not do everything that, in more normal times, she would want to do because of a lack of money but she wanted to provide an emergency safety net for those struggling to pay bills. Measures include:  The Programme for Government also includes: JUSTICE- The Not Proven verdict will be abolished as part of a Criminal Justice Bill.
The bill will also give statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases. A Children's Care and Justice Bill will finally end the practice of placing children under 18 in young offenders' institutions. EDUCATION- An Education Reform Bill will establish an independent education inspectorate and a new public body responsible for qualifications. HEALTH  TOURISM- A Local Visitor Levy Bill will be created to give local authorities a discretionary power to apply a levy on overnight visitor stays. ABORTION BUFFER ZONES- The Scottish government will support Green MSP Gillian Mackay with her proposed Member's Bill to protect safe access for women to healthcare facilities that provide abortion services. INDEPENDENCE- If the Supreme Court rules that a vote is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish government will legislate for a referendum on 19 October 2023.  Concluding her initial remarks on the programme for government, Nicola Sturgeon says that ""last, but by no means least"", is provision for a Scottish Independence Referendum
Bill. The first minister confirms that if the Supreme Court - starting on 11 October - rules that a consultative vote is within the competence
of the Scottish Parliament, legislation will be brought forward so indyref2 can take place on 19
October next year. The current cost of living crisis highlights ""the pressing need for independence"", she says. It is much worse in the UK, the FM maintains, ""because of a Brexit that Scotland voted
against but was powerless to stop"". While the response of the UK government has been ""woefully inadequate"", she says, the Scottish parliament ""stands
ready, willing and eager to act"". Independence would give Scotland ""the levers we desperately need to respond to
a crisis like this"" and  the ""wherewithal to build a better, wealthier, fairer future"", she adds. Promising to ""do everything possible to
support people and businesses through the difficult months ahead"", the government will ""continue to lay the foundations for a more equal and more
sustainable country"", she concludes. Meanwhile, soaring household energy bills are expected to be cut by energy companies using UK government-backed loans. It is thought energy bills could be frozen at their current level for roughly 18 months under the plans. Energy firms would use the loans to subsidise customer payments, with them repaid by additions to bills over 10 to 20 years or repaid via future taxation. Prime Minister Liz Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with a price freeze widely expected. Energy bills are rocketing and the cap on prices will go up on 1 October, pushing a typical British household's gas and electricity bill from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549. However, the government is expected to announce on Thursday that it will step in before that rise. It will guarantee loans to energy companies to bridge the gap between the cost of gas and electricity and the fixed price they charge customers. TheLocal Visitor Levy Billwill give local authorities
additional fiscal flexibility. This will help councils, if they so choose, to
fund activities related to tourism and related infrastructure. Ms Sturgeon says: ""We will press the UK government to
speed up fundamental reform of the energy market and break the link between the
cost of gas and the price of renewable and low carbon electricity."" This autumn the Scottish government will seek approval
for the Fourth National Planning Framework, which will support the delivery of
renewable energy projects. There will also be an energy strategy and just transition plan to guide the path to net
zero. Solar
energy will be supported, as will the development of wave and tidal technologies. Plans for a further
expansion in onshore wind capacity will also be detailed, as will a finalised Hydrogen Action Plan and
Investment Proposition, backed by Â£100m of capital funding. Two greenports will be established and aCircular Economy Billwill be introduced. AWildlife Management Bill for
Grouseto reduce the negative impact of some grouse moor practices on
wildlife and the environment will also be introduced. Returning to business and the state of the economy, Ms Sturgeon says the government will continue to:  The government will support further
improvements to broadband infrastructure and establish a national
network of six new hubs for tech companies, the first minister says. She adds that Scottish
goods exports, excluding oil and gas, grew by more than 5% in the two years to
the end of March, compared with a fall elsewhere in the UK. ""Scotlandâs position as the most
successful location in the UK, outside of London, for inward investment
projects has also been strengthened,"" the FM says. What is 'not proven'?Scotland, unlike most of the world's legal systems, has three possible verdicts in criminal cases - guilty, not guilty and not proven.
The legal implications of a not proven verdict are exactly the same as a not guilty verdict - the accused is acquitted and is innocent in the eyes of the law. Why is it used?Not proven is seen by some as offering additional protection to the accused, ensuring they will not be convicted if the jury has any doubts.
But critics argue that it is confusing for juries and the public, can stigmatise an accused person by appearing not to clear them and fails to provide closure for victims. What is its history?In 2017, Prof James Chalmers and Prof Fiona Leverickpublished a blog,externallooking at its history.
They said there was a common misconception that the not guilty verdict was a later addition to the proven and not proven outcomes.
And they concluded not only is the verdict of ""not proven"" not Scots law's original verdict of acquittal but today's ""not proven"" is used for a very different purpose from that for which it was introduced. The first minister says a Criminal Justice
Bill will, among other measures, provide for the abolition of the Not Proven verdict. If approved by the Scottish Parliament, this will be ""a change of truly historic significance in Scotland, and one firmly
intended to improve access to justice for victims of crime"", Ms Sturgeon says. The bill will also deliver
statutory protection of the anonymity of complainers in sexual offence cases, she says. The government will also
consult on specific draft laws to effect the recommendations in Helena
Kennedyâs report on tackling misogynistic behaviours. Other bills to be introduced later in the parliament include: A newPublic Health Billto restrict promotions of less healthy food and
drink, and consult on proposals to restrict alcohol promotions, will be introduced. A Womenâs Health
Champion will be appointed. The government will work with Gillian
Mackay, and MSPs across the chamber to safeguard the access of women to
abortion services without harassment or intimidation. Ms Sturgeon says her government will also introduce legislation
for aPatient Safety Commissionerto
help improve safety and amplify the voice of patients. A new mental health and wellbeing strategy, and a refreshed
suicide prevention strategy will be published. The year ahead will also see the creation in law of the National
Care Service. The government will also focus on reducing drug deaths, with a
total investment of Â£250m by the end of this parliament. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Pakistan fights to stop biggest lake from burstingA previous attempt to drain the lake failed and flood water levels are still dangerously high.,"Pakistan's biggest lake, Manchar Lake, is on the verge of bursting its banks and flooding surrounding areas Pakistani authorities are struggling to stop their biggest lake from bursting its banks after last-ditch attempts to lower water levels failed. Manchar Lake, in Sindh province, is dangerously full after record monsoons that inundated swathes of Pakistan. Three breaches of the lake's banks so far - two to protect areas nearby - have displaced over 100,000 people. But it could still overflow and rescue teams are racing to evacuate many more people who remain at risk of drowning. Floods in Pakistan have affected some 33 million people and killed at least 1,314, including 458 children, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Agency said. Estimates suggest the floods have caused at least $10bn (Â£8.5bn) of damage. Sindh province produces half of the country's food supply, exacerbating fears of serious food shortages in a country already struggling with an economic crisis. Pakistan's navy has been helping rescue some of those stranded - but many more remain at risk of drowning On Sunday, officials breached Manchar lake after it had flooded two rural towns. The hope was the move would prevent it from further bursting its banks and inundating more densely-populated areas. The move affected an estimated 400 villages - a total of 135,000 people. The decision to deliberately flood some villages is a controversial one - the lake straddles two districts, Dadu and Jamshoro, both home to hundreds of thousands of people, and about 80% of the region is underwater. Now residents near the lake are using government machinery to strengthen embankments to try to avoid a catastrophic, unplanned overspill. ""There are three breaches in the lake, two by plan, one is unplanned breach. It is our target that our big cities, towns, we can save them,"" Sindh's minister of irrigation Jam Khan Shoro told the BBC's Newshour programme. Villagers were warned to evacuate before the planned breaches. But local sources say not everyone was taken to safety in time - some didn't want to leave their homes or livestock, a lifeline for many in rural communities, and there are few places for them to go. The military has been brought in to help with evacuations but mostly locals are coming to each other's aid. Some who've left their homes in the last few days ahead of the Manchar breach were taken to a nearby government-run facility that's being used as a shelter for the displaced, but the conditions leave much to be desired. ON THE GROUND:'We spent the whole night running from the flood' IN PICTURES:Floods and fear in Pakistan WATCH:Bed frames used to pull victims over floodwaters Many displaced people are living on the roadside without shelter, food or clean drinking water. ""We have we got nothing here, we try to find food for our kids all day, some nights we sleep without food,"" one woman told the BBC. ""We are scared that the roof may collapse on us - it's damaged,"" another villager said. ""Our children are getting sick and we've been sleeping on the floor - there aren't beds for many of us."" Those who are not cut off are trying to make their way to higher ground Officials have said a little over a quarter of a million people are in shelters, a fraction of the 33 million Pakistanis affected. Relief efforts can't keep pace with demand - there is simply too much need and too few resources. Damaged infrastructure is also hampering aid and rescue operations. Some connecting roads in Sindh province have either collapsed, are flooded or are backed up for days with queuing traffic. Pakistan is facing one of its worst climate-induced natural disasters in years, as record torrential rainfall and melting glaciers in the country's northern mountains have caused devastating floods. Meanwhile, UN children's agency Unicef said more children were at risk of dying from disease in Pakistan due to the shortage of clean water. The disaster has also highlighted the stark disparity between countries that are the largest contributors towards climate change and countries that bear the brunt of its impact. Pakistan produces less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions but its geography makes itextremely vulnerable to climate change.

New shared banking hubs to open in 13 more places,"A trial bank hub, run by the Post Office and shared by five mainstream banks, opened in Essex last year Another 13 locations have been earmarked for shared banking hubs in areas where the last branch has closed. A swathe of branch closures have raised concerns about access to cash for those who need it, and difficulties for small businesses trying to deposit takings. Ten other areas were previously identified, but the doors have yet to open on any of their new hubs. Ministers have prepared legislation to ensure people can access cash locally, while experts say hubs are not enough. ""Cash is disappearing at a frightening rate, and so are ATMs and branches and it is not acceptable to leave communities without access to cash,"" John Howells, chief executive of Link - which is the biggest interbank network in the UK - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""There is real investment and effort going in by the banks nowâ¦But now that pace needs to be picked up,"" he added. At these hubs, customers of any bank can access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time. Trickier enquiries are dealt with by a representative from one of each of the major banks who each visit once a week. Among the 13 new proposed banking hub sites, four are in Scotland and, for the first time, one is in Northern Ireland, in Kilkeel. They will be in Brechin in Angus, Forres in Moray, Carluke in Lanarkshire, Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway, Axminster in Devon, Barton-upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, Lutterworth in Leicestershire, Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, Cheadle in Staffordshire, Belper in Derbyshire, Maryport in Cumbria, Hornsea in Yorkshire, and also in Kilkeel. Decline in cash use eases after pandemic slump 'A customer said we'd changed her life with bank hub' The BBC visiteda prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, and was told it had been ""a lifeline"" for many people living in the area after the last branch in town closed. Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it. Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Cash Action Group which is overseeing the project, said: ""Cash still matters hugely to millions of people across the UK and with the cost-of-living crisis biting, more and more people are turning to cash as a way of budgeting effectively. Banking Hubs are an important part of the solution."" Each time a core banking service such as a cash machine or bank branch is closed, an assessment is carried out by Link - the organisation which currently oversees the UK's ATM network. The review studies the cash needs of the community, such as how easy it is to travel to the nearest alternative service, as well as the demographics and vulnerability of local residents. The criteria are set by a group of banks and consumer representatives. The latest locations have been identified as part of that work. However, it can take months for these new hubs to open. As well as finding a suitable premise, often changes are needed to ensure it is fully accessible and secure enough for banking services. There has been some criticism that services have not yet started in any of the previously-announced locations for banking hubs, apart from the two trial premises in Rochford and Cambuslang, in Scotland. Ron Delnevo, a business consultant with years of experience in the ATM industry, said that ""the promised hubs don't even scratch the surface in terms of satisfying the banking needs of the UK"". Mark Aldred, of banking technology company Auriga, said: ""As we go into a cost of living crisis that's hitting households and businesses alike, these shared hubs are good on paper but could go further and faster."" A Financial Conduct Authority spokesperson said: ""Firms need to pick up the pace and deliver more banking hubs. We expect this to be done as a priority. ""Banks and building societies must treat their customers fairly and provide alternatives to branches where needed. Banking hubs are one of a range of tools they can use to ensure communities have easy access to bank services and cash."" In addition to the hubs, withdrawal and deposit machines - which are unstaffed but can allow businesses to cash in their takings - will be placed in libraries and community centres and available during their opening hours. They will be in Swanley and Faversham, both in Kent, Holywood in County Down, Shanklin on the Isle of Wight, Atherstone in Warwickshire, Billericay and Dunmow, both in Essex, Bourne in Lincolnshire, Holyhead on Anglesey, llfracombe in Devon, Swanage in Dorset, and Wallingford in Oxfordshire. The government has been planning to bring in new laws to ensure people only have to travel a relatively short distance to access cash withdrawal and deposit services. This is seen as vital to the future of cash, and particularly for its acceptance by businesses in rural communities who currently find they are shutting and travelling miles for their nearest banking services.

Boris Johnson's leaving speech fact-checked,"In his last speech as prime minister, Boris Johnson said his government was delivering on its ""huge manifesto commitments"". He made a series of claims - about its record on police, nurses, hospitals and, of course, Brexit. We've examined some of them. The government promised to build two major rail projects, High Speed 2 (HS2) and Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR). We asked the Department for Transport (DfT) about the third new high-speed rail line Mr Johnson referred to. It pointed us toa rail plan from November 2021,externalwhich counts the long-planned eastern and western legs of HS2 as two separate new lines. In that same announcement, the government cancelled most of the eastern section so it only ran from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway instead of all the way to Leeds. On NPR, while some had anticipated a wholly new high-speed rail line, the government's Integrated Rail Plan said it would only include 40 miles of new high-speed line between Warrington and Yorkshire. There won't be a whole new line all the way to Leeds - most of the project will consist of upgrades Henri Murison, chief executive of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told the BBC: ""HS2 East and Western Leg was always one line. Having cancelled most of the Eastern Leg and claiming that as a line - as it no longer serves Sheffield or Leeds - is spurious by any definition. ""Northern Powerhouse Rail has been reduced to a new line only as far as Marsden, and excludes Bradford entirely, and as the line was never high speed and parts of the upgrades, including to Hull were cancelled, to refer to this the way the PM did was misleading."" The DfT says the government has set aside Â£100m to look into ways of running HS2 trains to Leeds and will upgrade the Leeds-Bradford Calder Valley rail line. The government promised 20,000 more police for England and Wales by March 2023. The latest figures, up to 30 June 2022,do show an extra 13,790 police officers have been recruited,externalunder the government's Police Uplift scheme. But that doesn't make up for police numbers falling by20,545 between March 2010 and March 2019,external- under Conservative-led governments. This figure is correct - according to survey data from the Office for National Statistics - but it doesn't cover all types of crime people might experience in their neighbourhoods. The Home Office'sBeating Crime plan,externaldefines neighbourhood crime as ""vehicle-related theft, domestic burglary, theft from the person and robbery of personal property"". But it excludes crimes like arson and theft from outside the house (both up since June 2019 when Mr Johnson came to office) as well as bike theft and violent crime (which have both fallen). It also excludes fraud which has risen by almost 30% in the same period. Fraud accounts for nearly half the crime estimated to take place in England and Wales. Mr Johnson was criticised earlier in the year by the statistics regulator for claiming that crime had fallen (which was only true if you excluded fraud). PM wrong to claim crime has fallen, says watchdog This refers to a manifesto commitment to achieve these numbers in England by 2025. The latest figures show319,846 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in May 2022,external. That is up 23,753 since December 2019. So, there are still 26,247 posts to fill. But another government pledge - to recruit 6,000 more GPs by 2025 - wasn't mentioned by Mr Johnson. Progress on this pledge is much slower. There were 35,257 full-time equivalent GPs in post in July 2022. That's up by just 738 since the end of December 2019. While many people would assume this means brand new hospitals, the government's definition is different. Its description of ""new hospital"" includes new wings of existing hospitals, as well as refurbished hospitals. In December 2021,analysis done by Reality Check and the Nuffield Trustfound that of the 40 projects in England : three were entirely new hospitals three involved rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals 12 were new wings within existing hospitals 22 were rebuilding projects When asked for an update, on 6 September, a Department of Health spokesperson told us that one of the 40 hospitals opened for patients last year and a further six were under construction. What's happened to the 40 new hospitals pledge? Boris Johnson's track record as PM Fact-checking three years of Boris Johnson Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed This is a claim Mr Johnson has made many times and, in a literal sense, the UK did leave the EU on 31 January 2020. But if it was intended to mean Brexit was done and dusted, this has clearly not happened. A huge amount remains unresolved, from Northern Ireland to financial services. A large number of trade deals have been signed around the world (the majority of which simply replace the ones the UK already had as an EU member) but a deal with the US hasn't happened. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes economic judgements for the government, predicts that leaving the EU will reduce the UK's imports and exports by about 15% in the long term, with about a 4% hit to productivity. Supporters of Brexit say sovereignty has been restored, and unwanted regulations can now be cut. The UK was the first country to approve a Covid vaccine - on 2 December 2020. Its vaccine rollout began on 8 December 2020 - weeks before the EU's. The UK vaccine programme was the fastest in the EU until May 2021. After that, other EU countries caught up if you look at doses per 100 people in a country's population. Boris Johnson pledged to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"" when he entered Downing Street in 2019. In 2021, his government unveiled its plan to cap the costs that people in England pay for social care. From October 2023, this will be set at a maximum of Â£86,000 for care during their lifetime. What could care changes cost you and your family? What are the challenges facing social care? But this long-awaited reform of funding does not fix other problems in the sector - such as the shortage of care workers. The latest figures, from July 2022, show that the number of vacancies are now 165,000, up 55,000 from 2020/21. Research in May 2022 estimated that 500,000 adults in England were waiting for social care, up from 294,000 a year ago. This is only true if you look at the biggestConservativeparty majority since 1987 - which Mr Johnson's 80-seat majority in the 2019 election was. But it's not if you look at other political parties. Labour, under Tony Blair, won a 179-seat majority at the 1997 election. Johnson's Conservatives did win the highest share of the vote in the UK for any party since 1979 - 43.6%.

What happens today - and when?,"Liz Truss is appointing her new cabinet hours after becoming prime minister Kwasi Kwarteng has been named chancellor, James Cleverly is foreign secretary and Suella Braverman is home secretary For the first time, not a single white man will occupy one of the ""great offices of state"" - PM, home secretary, foreign secretary and chancellor Therese Coffey is the new health secretary and deputy PM, Jacob Rees-Mogg becomes business secretary and Kemi Badenoch is international trade secretary Earlier Truss said that her government would ""transform Britain into an aspiration nation"" and that ""together we can ride out the storm"" She is under pressure to tackle spiralling energy costs - and is expected to announce a package within days The BBC understands the annual price cap on household energy bills could be capped at around Â£2,500 - costing the government billions Francesca Gillett Thanks for following. For the latest on who's been moved in and out of the cabinet,head here. We'll be back in the morning with more live coverage of Liz Truss's first few days as prime minister - including her first prime minister's questions. Chris MasonPolitical editor It was gone half 10 on Tuesday and cabinet positions were still being filled - a self-imposed deadline from the prime minister approaching with the first meeting of the cabinet at 8.30 BST on Wednesday morning. There are a handful of striking things about its composition. There has been a near total purge of those who backed Rishi Sunak. The only one who I can spot is Michael Ellis, the new attorney general for England and Wales. And even he will attend cabinet rather than being a cabinet minister, subtle though that distinction is. This dominance of Truss campaign supporters around the Truss top table is already prompting grumbling among some Tory MPs, although we do await appointments to the more junior ranks in government. The prime minister's desire for loyalty and building a government in her own image runs the risk of provoking rebellion down the track. More from Chris here Liz Truss has given her allies top cabinet jobs in a major reshuffle hours after being appointed Britain's third female prime minister following a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle earlier. The new PM gave her first speech outside Downing Street where she said her three early priorities would be the economy, energy and the health service. Here are her main cabinet appointments so far: Read more:Who is in Liz Truss's top team? The UK's new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says his appointment is âthe honour of a lifetimeâ.

Donelan is known for speaking her mind. When she was universities minister, she
often talked about students being ""conned"" into getting into debt
doing degrees that might not be worthwhile. She was most recently promoted to education secretary, but only for two days. She resigned as part of the mass
walk out by ministers that led to Boris Johnson's departure. Donelan is now the eleventh culture
secretary in ten years. So whatâs in her in-tray? Media watchers will be scouring her
past pronouncements on Channel 4 and the BBC. Boris Johnson's government planned
to privatise Channel 4. Will Liz Truss feel a similar sense of urgency? The BBC's
funding is under review with Donelanâs predecessor, Nadine Dorries, previously
making clear she wanted to see an end to the licence fee. Then there is the Online Safety
Bill which seeks to lay down laws on how internet providers clamp down on
harmful content on their sites. Dorries
wrote she was proud of the bill which ""will hold tech giants to account"".
But it's on pause and Liz Truss's government must decide whether to get it back
on track. Graham Stuart has been appointed as climate minister and will attend cabinet, No 10 says. James Heappey has been appointed minister for armed forces and veterans, Downing Street says. He will attend cabinet. Heappey was previously armed forces minister - but his brief has now been extended to include veterans after Johnny Mercer, the former veterans minister, was sacked earlier. Tom Tugendhat has been made security minister in the home office and will attend cabinet. He reached the final five in the Conservative leadership race before endorsing Liz Truss. The former Territorial Army officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2017 but this is his first ministerial post. Tugendhat, who speaks Arabic, was also involved in reconstruction efforts in both countries and was highly critical of the withdrawal from Afghanistan by Western forces in 2021. He has worked as a journalist in Beirut and a management consultant in the UK. The father-of-two became an MP in 2015 â for the Kent constituency of Tonbridge, Edenbridge and Malling. Vicky Ford has been appointed as development minister in the foreign, commonwealth and development office in Liz Truss's government. Downing Street says she will attend cabinet. Edward Argar has been appointed paymaster general and minister for the cabinet office. Downing Street says he will attend cabinet and takes over from the new Attorney General Michael Ellis, who was appointed to the job in September 2021. Michael Ellis has been given the role of attorney general in Liz Truss's new government. He is the only supporter of Rishi Sunak who has made it into a top cabinet job. Chris Philp has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and takes over from new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke. The former digital minister initially backed Sajid Javid in the leadership race but endorsed Liz Truss in July. Philp, who has also held junior roles in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, has spoken of how the NHS saved the lives of his twins after they were born very prematurely at 25 weeks. He was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015. US President Joe Biden has spoken with Prime Minister Truss this
evening, Downing Street has said, Biden congratulating her on her appointment. ""The prime minister looked forward to working closely with
President Biden as leaders of free democracies to tackle shared challenges,
particularly the extreme economic problems unleashed by Putin's war,"" a
Downing Street spokeswoman said. They said Truss and Biden ""reflected on the enduring strength
of the special relationship"" and agreed build on those links, including by
furthering ""our deep defence alliance through Nato and Aukus"". ""The leaders reinforced their commitment to strengthening
global liberty, tackling the risks posed by autocracies and ensuring Putin
fails in Ukraine."" The two leaders also ""discussed a range of domestic issues""
and agreed on the importance of ""protecting the Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement"", adding that they look forward to meeting again soon. Katy AustinTransport Correspondent New Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan will have many issues to think about, including how to approach
the ongoing wave of industrial action hitting therailways, where strikes could
continue for months. Thereâs also a
decision to be made on whetherAvanti West Coastwill get a new contract to
operate trains on the West Coast mainline, after recently slashing its
schedules amid a staffing crunch. More government funding announced last month will
have saved some regionalbusservices for the next six months, but with passenger
usage still below pre-Covid levels and costs rising, what happens after that?
 And will the Â£2 cap on fares promised for all of England, from January to
March, only last for those 3 months? There's plenty to
think about regardingaviation, and not just working with industry to make sure
airlines and airports have enough staff for next summer. Sustainability
and how the goal of ""net zero"" in aviation by 2050 can be achieved
are a big focus for the industry. Other things on
the list include how the currentmotoring taxesshould be replaced as we move
away from petrol and diesel vehicles, and how to ensure theelectric vehicle
charginginfrastructure meets demand. Robert Buckland remains Welsh secretary, continuing in the role he took on after Simon Hartâs resignation in July. He had previously been in the cabinet, as justice secretary, between July 2019 and September 2021 and is also a former solicitor general. Buckland initially supported former Chancellor Rishi Sunak for the leadership but switched his endorsement to Liz Truss in the middle of August. The former barrister and Crown Court recorder was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority. Buckland, who has twin children, was born in Llanelli and says his interests include music, wine, political history and watching rugby and cricket. Alister Jack remains secretary of state for Scotland in Liz Trussâs first cabinet, a role he has held since Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019. The former government whip did not reveal who he supported in the leadership contest. Before entering parliament as MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017, Jack was a businessman who founded tent-hire and self-storage companies. Jack, who has three grown up children, is also a dairy farmer and grows Christmas trees. Downing Street has now confirmed that Chris Heaton-Harris has been promoted to the cabinet as Northern Ireland Secretary, as we reported earlier. He replaces Shailesh Vara who only took on the role in July. The former chief whip, who could attend cabinet in that role, did not say who he was supporting in the leadership race. He was previously a transport and foreign office minister. Before becoming a politician, Heaton-Harris ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. He is also a qualified football referee and referees on the Northamptonshire Combination League. The former MEP, who describes himself as a fierce Eurosceptic, was elected MP for Daventry in 2010. Michelle Donelan has been appointed secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport in Liz Truss's new government. The former higher and further education minister backed Liz Truss after initially supporting her former boss Nadhim Zahawi and then Penny Mordaunt in the leadership race. Previously a government whip, Donelan worked in the media and entertainment industry before entering parliament, including a period as communications manager at professional wrestling firm WWE. The MP for Chippenham, first elected in 2015, says she enjoys walking her dog in her limited spare time. Anne-Marie Trevelyan has been appointed transport secretary in Liz Truss's new government. She had previously been international development secretary but lost her place in the cabinet when the department was scrapped. An outspoken Brexiteer who resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in 2018 in protest at Theresa Mayâs Brexit withdrawal deal, she supported Truss in the leadership race. The former chartered accountant entered the Commons as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2015 and describes herself as having a passion for singing. Ranil Jayawardena has become environment secretary, taking over from George Eustice. He was previously a minister in the international trade department, working for Liz Truss before she became foreign secretary, and was an early supporter of her leadership bid. Jayawardena, who has three children, used to work for Lloyds Bank and was also a councillor in Hampshire. He entered the Commons as MP for North East Hampshire in 2015. Â© 2025 BBC.

Truss faces balancing act to tackle cost of living,"As Liz Truss traversed the UK racking up the votes to defeat Rishi Sunak, in the same towns where she wooed the membership hustings, including in leafy apparently affluent areas, the size of the challenge she was vying to inherit was getting notably worse. The situation on the ground has deteriorated for ordinary households and businesses, as prices continued to surge yet higher. And at the same time there has been an ominous turn in the markets for British government borrowing and in currency markets. The combination of these two changes alter the reality of the situation she now takes on as prime minister. The question is how much it changes the immediate solutions she has promised as campaigner. From Durham to Derbyshire and Stoke-on-Trent and beyond, the stories we have reported on in many local communities show the real life depths of this cost of living crisis, even at current energy prices. The surge in food prices is breaking the charitable model of food banks and food pantries that have emerged in almost every town and city. Not only has demand surged, turning many of last year's food charity donors into recipients of support, but supplies are now a problem. Many of these projects are reliant on surplus food stocks from supermarket supply chains. But supermarkets facing massive inflationary pressures, trying to avoid passing on all of those price hikes to consumers, have been trimming surplus stock, meaning there is less tinned goods available for donations. Demand up hugely, at a time when supply is a problem. This is just one manifestation of out-of-control inflation. Jo Yendole from Stone Community hub says some people have stopped using hot water We visited a facility in Stone, Staffordshire. Jo Yendole who helps run Stone Community hub said: ""One of the guys who's on licence from prison, sort of struggling to maintain his flat and the cost of his flat actually said he would prefer to go back to prison because it was easier because he just couldn't see how we were going to afford to live. ""And another lady who she was she's talking about the cost of gas and an energy prices said she'd completely turned her boiler off and wasn't using any hot water and was boiling a kettle. The gas price is not even affordable in the summer for her"". Truss vows action on energy ahead of first day as PM Government closes in on energy rescue plan What could be done to combat high energy costs? Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss At a pantry in Matlock, Derbyshire, which offers subsidised food at about a tenth of supermarket prices, Beverley Parker from Rural Action Derbyshire told me people were returning fresh food, because they could not afford refrigeration costs. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges and freezers because they can't afford the electricity. You're risking your own health and that of your family, by eating food that hasn't been stored correctly. ""A lot of people are choosing to either get rid of their cars or not use them. Public transport in the countryside is limited at best. So we've we've even heard of people walking six miles from the food bank, and then six miles back home, because they can't afford the bus fare."" At another community hub in Peterlee, County Durham, I met dual-income working families who had started to grow their own vegetables and heard the co-ordinators tell of clients pre-emptively cancelling energy bill direct debits. Much of this happened even before the move in prices up to Â£3,549. While the energy companies have tried to pre-empt the arrival of Liz Truss with a ready to go plan to cancel the rise in the energy cap, that might not require upfront borrowing, there are still huge amounts of support being relied upon, even at existing bills. One energy company boss, former government fuel poverty tsar Derek Lickorish who is chairman of Utilita, told me the reality for the poorest customers. A typical Â£50 on prepayment meters which would ordinarily last 12 days in winter, might only last two days from January. ""Liz Truss has said that she intends to solve this problem, and I welcome that. This is a war footing to my mind. It will affect government borrowing. ""If we don't, we're going to have major problems with customers having unaffordable bills. There'll be huge mental health problems, we will see businesses going broke, we'll see people losing their jobs and they want to have disposable income to spend with businesses. It really is Armageddon, if we don't deal with this, and that's what we've got to get on with it"". So as we head towards some version of the energy companies tariff deficit fund being announced imminently by the new prime minister, she faces further pressure from the markets. The dollar has been strong as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has indicated a sharper rise in interest rates. But sterling has fallen notably against the dollar and the euro. Long-term borrowing costs for the government have topped 3%, setting the floor for borrowing for mortgages and for businesses. The government will have to work closely with the Bank of England These are jitters rather than a crisis. In that context it was notable to see both Ms Truss and her likely Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, row back from her early campaign rhetoric criticising the Bank of England. The government and Bank will need to work very closely together in the coming months. An important difference with the pandemic bailout is there can be no expectation that the Bank will buy up most of the issuance of extra government borrowing. The Bank has already indicated it will do the opposite soon as part of ""reverse QE"". If the government needs to borrow more, it will have to find buyers for the debt among pension funds, insurers and foreign buyers, and pay a high price. If the PM wants to abide by her campaign promises to make tens of billions of tax cuts, and help launch an energy bailout for both households and businesses, at a time when energy prices in markets could go yet higher, borrowing will have to go up in the first instance. But if she does not help both sectors, disposable income will drain from the economy, and many small businesses will simply go bust, hiking up unemployment too. The new prime minister already faced a very tricky balancing act between inflation and recession. The past month means the room for manoeuvre has got even smaller. Given this hand, Rishi Sunak may not end up regretting his loss.

Anger over China lockdown during earthquake,"This video can not be played Watch: China earthquake rocks town in Sichuan Footage showing that some residents in the earthquake-hit Chinese city of Chengdu were stopped from fleeing their compounds due to a Covid lockdown has sparked anger and disbelief online. Some in Chengdu say they were told to stay inside through a 6.6-magnitude earthquake on Monday that has killed at least 65 people. Those that ran out say they found the exits shut due to Covid restrictions. Chengdu, home to 21 million people, is currently under strict lockdown rules. China has a so-called zero Covid-19 policy, meaning that lockdowns are routinely imposed in communities when cases of the virus are detected. In some instances, apartment buildings where at least one person has tested positive for Covid have been designated ""sealed areas"" - where residents are forbidden from setting foot outside their homes whether or not they have the virus. Videos shared on Douyin, China's TikTok platform,show panicked residents behind chained gates, shouting to be let out.,external In one, a man swears at security guard, rattling what appears to be his apartment gates and trying to open it, shouting:""Hurry up, open the door, it's an earthquake!"",externalIn response, the guards say: ""It's over, the earthquake's already over."" This video showed residents behind gates asking to be let out Another video claims to be an audio recording of a loudspeaker message that said: ""Go back home and do not gather here, it's just an earthquake. We [here in Sichuan] have a lot of experience [when it comes to earthquakes]."" One man told the BBC he had run out of his 30-floor building after feeling the earthquake's tremors. When he realised he was trapped, he raised complaints among the crowd gathered at the gates. ""Which one is more important? The lockdown or the earthquake?"" Lu Siwei, a lawyer in Chengdu, had shouted. He says his neighbour replied: ""Do not incite emotions and do not talk politics."" After several heated rounds, Mr Lu says the man then physically assaulted him. There have been no reports linking any fatalities from the quake to the restrictions on compounds, but such reports have sparked overwhelming criticism from those on microblogging site Weibo. ""It's a joke that we have to discuss such a question,"" said one commentator under a post from a local news site which quoted a lawyer saying citizens were ""constitutionally"" free to flee to safety. The post had received over 3.7 million views by Tuesday. ""I guess it's fine if I die inside the building, at least I didn't get infected,"" said another comment sarcastically. The Chengdu Health Commission later posted on its official WeChat account that ""priority should be given to safeguarding the lives of the public in the event of earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters"".

China's Covid policies require cities to enter strict lockdowns - even if just a handful of cases are reported. However, Beijing's drive to ensure ""zero Covid"" has prompted rare public dissent from citizens. China is the world's last major economy attempting to entirely stamp out Covid outbreaks, claiming this is necessary to prevent wider surges of the virus which could overwhelm hospitals.

Interest rate âriggerâ guilty plea thrown out,"A British former trader has had a conviction in the US for ""rigging"" interest rates overturned in spite of pleading guilty. Mike Curtler, formerly of Deutsche Bank, was among 38 former traders and brokers prosecuted after the US Department of Justice declared their conduct illegal 10 years ago. But earlier this year a US appeal court decided no rules had been broken. Mr Curtler's lawyer said they were ""extremely pleased"" with the decision. In the past eight years, 38 former brokers and traders have been prosecuted over emails and messages asking colleagues to tweak their estimates of the cost of borrowing cash to suit their bank's commercial interests - a practice which the US Department of Justice declared to be illegal interest rate ""rigging"" in 2012, when it fined Barclays Bank for it. The estimates of the interest rates banks were paying were submitted each morning as part of the process of arriving at Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate), the index that tracks the cost of borrowing cash. Just as the FTSE tracks the prices of shares, Libor tracks the interest rates banks are paying to borrow cash on the wholesale money markets. For the past 35 years, it has been used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. To work out Libor each day, 16 banks answer a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submit their answers and an average is taken. The evidence against Mike Curtler and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted ""high"" or ""low"". The whistleblowing bankers who were sent to jail Bankers' rate 'rigging' not criminal, says US The Lowball Tapes Mike Curtler admitted he had acted on the emailed requests and, faced with the risk of up to 15 years in a US jail if he went to trial, pleaded guilty. But in January this year a US appeal court ruled that the requests were not illegal after all, acquitting former Deutsche Bank traders Gavin Black from Middlesex and Matt Connolly from New Jersey. Now US courts are acquitting even those who pleaded guilty, such as Mike Curtler, saying they must be viewed as innocent. ""I'm very glad the US courts have decided that what we did was not criminal. The past decade has been horrible but hopefully we can now start to rebuild,"" Mr Curtler told the BBC. Mr Curtler's lawyer, David Krakoff, said: ""We are extremely pleased that Mike Curtler has been cleared and that the courts have decided that there was no wrongdoing whatsoever."" A month ago New York court threw out the conviction of former trader Tim Parietti, 56, who had also pleaded guilty, ordering the government to repay a Â£1m fine. It leaves the UK as the only country in the world where convictions for ""rigging"" interest rates have, so far, been sustained. Nine have been convicted in the UK, including Tom Hayes, Peter Johnson, Jonathan Mathew, Alex Pabon, Jay Merchant, Christian Bittar, Philippe Moryoussef, Carlo Palombo and Colin Bermingham.

Energy firms to bring down bills using state loans,"Prime Minister Liz Truss is understood to be planning to borrow billions to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around Â£2,500 with full details expected on Thursday. Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from Â£1,971 to Â£3,549 in October. The government's plans to subsidise bills means that customers will not be expected to repay the support. It is unclear how long the government support will last, but the overall government support package is expected to total around Â£100bn. The  ultimate figure will depend on gas and energy price movements in the highly volatile international energy markets as well as how much additional support is offered to the most vulnerable. Ms Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with details expected to be announced on Thursday. Energy bosses have insisted for some time that a government-backed superfund from which they could borrow to subsidise bills ""is the only game in town"". However, the government is understood to be reluctant to see money added to customer bills for up to 20 years so energy companies could pay back the loans. It is also thought to be reluctant to add the cost to general taxation, given their pledges to be a tax cutting government. What is the energy price cap and what will I actually pay? New PM Liz Truss expected to freeze energy bills Warning firms will close this winter without help What cost-of-living payments will I get? Kwasi Kwarteng - tipped to be the new chancellor - has already indicated the government is prepared to borrow to support the economy. This would be consistent with Ms Truss' position that the UK needs to break free of the Treasury's strict spending rules. Nevertheless, the estimated Â£100bn is a sizeable sum to borrow at the same time as cutting taxes and boosting spending on defence and it could end up costing more than that, given the fluctuating price of wholesale gas. ""One of the dangers here is that it could even be more expensive than Â£100bn,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, contrasting it with the Covid-prompted furlough scheme, which cost Â£60bn-Â£70bn. ""There has to be a risk that energy prices stay high for a long time, perhaps even up to three or four years,"" he said. ""Then this starts being baked into public spending long-term."" The cost of UK government borrowing hit its highest level for eight years on Tuesday, with the yield on ten-year bonds rising above 3%. That reflects the market's expectation that the government will have to borrow more and means any future borrowing will be more expensive. Mr Johnson said the plan to borrow to support energy bills was only one you would adopt ""if you can't think of anything else"" because it amounted to subsidising everybody's gas use, when the higher price suggested there was not enough gas available. That could lead to rationing, he suggested, and would mean high-income households would benefit by a much larger amount than those at the lower end. How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Government sources say that over time, new energy supply measures - such as cutting the link between renewable sources and the gas price - will lower costs while a growing economy will shrink the proportion of overall debt to the size of the economy. Businesses are also expected to be offered some relief in the plan set to be announced on Thursday. Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more. Thousands would go bust or cut their wage bills by firing staff. The precise mechanism to help business may be more complicated and would be reviewed more frequently but reports suggest it could see the government mandate energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy businesses use. Including businesses could easily push the cost of the government's energy plan over Â£100bn. Alex Veitch of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""It is encouraging that the government is seriously considering the support it can give to businesses during these very difficult times. ""But it remains to be seen whether these plans will go far enough in offering the help that many firms so desperately need."" Craig Beaumont from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""This commitment looks very promising, and arguably the best reassurance that small businesses need that some form of help with bills will follow - not just for households. ""The scope and reach of the help is going to be absolutely crucial to save hundreds of thousands of small businesses this winter."" What can Liz Truss do to help people pay their bills?

Truss vows action on energy on first day as PM,"This video can not be played Liz Truss promised to ""deliver"" a Tory victory at the next general election Liz Truss has promised to deal with surging energy costs and to cut taxes, after she won the Tory leadership contest to become the next PM. Her plan, set to be announced on Thursday, is likely to include a freeze on energy bills - though precisely how it would work is still unclear. Ms Truss will be formally appointed by the Queen at Balmoral Castle later, after a final speech by Boris Johnson. The 47-year-old, the UK's third woman PM, will then appoint her cabinet. In her victory speech, Ms Truss promised a ""bold"" programme of tax cuts to grow the flagging economy and to prevent the UK tipping into recession. She will officially take the reins of power on Tuesday, bringing Mr Johnson's turbulent premiership to an end less than three years after the Conservatives' resounding election victory in 2019. Dorries and Patel to go as Truss takes over as PM Day one as PM: From kissing hands to exploding pizzas Liz Truss: From teenage Lib Dem to Tory PM Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss Ms Truss's most pressing decision as premier will be how best to shield households and businesses from the soaring international price of energy. On Monday, Ms Truss told party activists at London's Queen Elizabeth II conference centre she would ""deliver on the energy crisis"" by dealing with bills and boosting the UK's domestic energy sources. Under her plans, it is understood energy firmswould be able to take out government-backed loans, which they would use to freeze or lower customers' bills. The loans would be repaid from bills over the next 10-20 years. Scottish Power, which proposed government-backed loans, has estimated that freezing bills for two years could cost nearly Â£100bn. Small business are also expected to be offered some energy bill relief, though the details may not be included in Thursday's announcement. There will be very little if any honeymoon period for Liz Truss, as the country clamours for answers to huge questions the caretaker government of Boris Johnson in recent months felt unempowered to take on. As you can read from my colleagues, there is inflation, Ukraine, energy security, the NHS with winter approaching, the contrails of Brexit and... a general election that isn't far away. The Conservatives have consistently been some way behind Labour in the polls all year. And there has to be an election by January 2025 at the latest. Politics is being reset, but it will continue to be competitive, noisy and unpredictable. Read more from Chris Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of the vote, a narrower win than expected. Those predicted to join her top team include Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor, former leadership rival Suella Braverman as home secretary and James Cleverly as foreign secretary.

Mr Johnson congratulated Ms Truss on her victory and said she had the right plan to ""unite our party"". Ms Truss paid tribute to her ""friend"" Mr Johnson in her victory speech, adding he would be ""admired from Kyiv to Carlisle"" for his record in office. ""Boris, you got Brexit done, you crushed Jeremy Corbyn, you rolled out the vaccine and you stood up to Vladimir Putin,"" she said. In a break with tradition, the outgoing and incoming prime ministers are expected totravel to Balmoral Castle in Scotlandfor the handover of power, rather than Buckingham Palace. The Queen has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements. I will stand again as an MP, says Sunak What will Prime Minister Truss mean for Scotland? How has Liz Truss dealt with Northern Ireland? Ms Truss has promised Â£30bn in tax cuts in an emergency Budget later this month, having blamed the tax burden for the UK's sluggish growth. Her proposed cuts include reversing the rise in National Insurance under Mr Johnson's tenure, temporarily ditching green levies on energy bills, and scrapping a planned rise to corporation tax. As well as the domestic agenda, her in-tray also includes continuing to support Ukraine after its invasion by Russia and repairing a fractious relationship with the EU over Northern Ireland. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who attacked her economic plans during the campaign, told the BBC he would offer her his ""full support"". He said he will stand again to be an MP at the next general election, but is not expected to be in Ms Truss's cabinet. Labour has called on Ms Truss to expand the windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to part-fund a six month freeze to domestic prices. The party followed the Liberal Democrats earlier this summer in backing a freeze, along with the SNP. Ms Truss, however, has ruled out further windfall taxes,saying during the campaignit ""sends the wrong message to international investors"". Speaking earlier, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pledged to work with Ms Truss to deliver a freeze, saying there was cross-party agreement on the idea. He criticised her approach on the economy, arguing she had talked more in her campaign about cutting taxes for businesses than the cost of living crisis. ""That shows that not only is she out of touch, but that she's not on the side of working people,"" he added. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Breakfast Ms Truss's reported plan was not a freeze on energy bills but a loan and said instead energy companies should pay via a one-off tax on profits. ""What they are saying is families and pensioners should be paying for this for years to come,"" he said. SNP leader and Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon called for the price freeze to include businesses, which are not normally covered by the UK'senergy price cap, and extra cash support.

Trussâs trapeze act on the economy,"As Liz Truss traversed the UK racking up the votes to defeat Rishi Sunak, in the same towns where she wooed the membership hustings, including in leafy apparently affluent areas, the size of the challenge she was vying to inherit was getting notably worse. The situation on the ground has deteriorated for ordinary households and businesses, as prices continued to surge yet higher. And at the same time there has been an ominous turn in the markets for British government borrowing and in currency markets. The combination of these two changes alter the reality of the situation she now takes on as prime minister. The question is how much it changes the immediate solutions she has promised as campaigner. From Durham to Derbyshire and Stoke-on-Trent and beyond, the stories we have reported on in many local communities show the real life depths of this cost of living crisis, even at current energy prices. The surge in food prices is breaking the charitable model of food banks and food pantries that have emerged in almost every town and city. Not only has demand surged, turning many of last year's food charity donors into recipients of support, but supplies are now a problem. Many of these projects are reliant on surplus food stocks from supermarket supply chains. But supermarkets facing massive inflationary pressures, trying to avoid passing on all of those price hikes to consumers, have been trimming surplus stock, meaning there is less tinned goods available for donations. Demand up hugely, at a time when supply is a problem. This is just one manifestation of out-of-control inflation. Jo Yendole from Stone Community hub says some people have stopped using hot water We visited a facility in Stone, Staffordshire. Jo Yendole who helps run Stone Community hub said: ""One of the guys who's on licence from prison, sort of struggling to maintain his flat and the cost of his flat actually said he would prefer to go back to prison because it was easier because he just couldn't see how we were going to afford to live. ""And another lady who she was she's talking about the cost of gas and an energy prices said she'd completely turned her boiler off and wasn't using any hot water and was boiling a kettle. The gas price is not even affordable in the summer for her"". Truss vows action on energy ahead of first day as PM Government closes in on energy rescue plan What could be done to combat high energy costs? Seven big questions now facing Liz Truss At a pantry in Matlock, Derbyshire, which offers subsidised food at about a tenth of supermarket prices, Beverley Parker from Rural Action Derbyshire told me people were returning fresh food, because they could not afford refrigeration costs. ""We've heard of people switching off their fridges and freezers because they can't afford the electricity. You're risking your own health and that of your family, by eating food that hasn't been stored correctly. ""A lot of people are choosing to either get rid of their cars or not use them. Public transport in the countryside is limited at best. So we've we've even heard of people walking six miles from the food bank, and then six miles back home, because they can't afford the bus fare."" At another community hub in Peterlee, County Durham, I met dual-income working families who had started to grow their own vegetables and heard the co-ordinators tell of clients pre-emptively cancelling energy bill direct debits. Much of this happened even before the move in prices up to Â£3,549. While the energy companies have tried to pre-empt the arrival of Liz Truss with a ready to go plan to cancel the rise in the energy cap, that might not require upfront borrowing, there are still huge amounts of support being relied upon, even at existing bills. One energy company boss, former government fuel poverty tsar Derek Lickorish who is chairman of Utilita, told me the reality for the poorest customers. A typical Â£50 on prepayment meters which would ordinarily last 12 days in winter, might only last two days from January. ""Liz Truss has said that she intends to solve this problem, and I welcome that. This is a war footing to my mind. It will affect government borrowing. ""If we don't, we're going to have major problems with customers having unaffordable bills. There'll be huge mental health problems, we will see businesses going broke, we'll see people losing their jobs and they want to have disposable income to spend with businesses. It really is Armageddon, if we don't deal with this, and that's what we've got to get on with it"". So as we head towards some version of the energy companies tariff deficit fund being announced imminently by the new prime minister, she faces further pressure from the markets. The dollar has been strong as the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, has indicated a sharper rise in interest rates. But sterling has fallen notably against the dollar and the euro. Long-term borrowing costs for the government have topped 3%, setting the floor for borrowing for mortgages and for businesses. The government will have to work closely with the Bank of England These are jitters rather than a crisis. In that context it was notable to see both Ms Truss and her likely Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, row back from her early campaign rhetoric criticising the Bank of England. The government and Bank will need to work very closely together in the coming months. An important difference with the pandemic bailout is there can be no expectation that the Bank will buy up most of the issuance of extra government borrowing. The Bank has already indicated it will do the opposite soon as part of ""reverse QE"". If the government needs to borrow more, it will have to find buyers for the debt among pension funds, insurers and foreign buyers, and pay a high price. If the PM wants to abide by her campaign promises to make tens of billions of tax cuts, and help launch an energy bailout for both households and businesses, at a time when energy prices in markets could go yet higher, borrowing will have to go up in the first instance. But if she does not help both sectors, disposable income will drain from the economy, and many small businesses will simply go bust, hiking up unemployment too. The new prime minister already faced a very tricky balancing act between inflation and recession. The past month means the room for manoeuvre has got even smaller. Given this hand, Rishi Sunak may not end up regretting his loss.

LiveLiveJohnson to give farewell speech before Truss takes over7 minutes ago,"Liz Truss is appointing her new cabinet hours after becoming prime minister Kwasi Kwarteng has been named chancellor, James Cleverly is foreign secretary and Suella Braverman is home secretary For the first time, not a single white man will occupy one of the ""great offices of state"" - PM, home secretary, foreign secretary and chancellor Therese Coffey is the new health secretary and deputy PM, Jacob Rees-Mogg becomes business secretary and Kemi Badenoch is international trade secretary Earlier Truss said that her government would ""transform Britain into an aspiration nation"" and that ""together we can ride out the storm"" She is under pressure to tackle spiralling energy costs - and is expected to announce a package within days The BBC understands the annual price cap on household energy bills could be capped at around Â£2,500 - costing the government billions Francesca Gillett Thanks for following. For the latest on who's been moved in and out of the cabinet,head here. We'll be back in the morning with more live coverage of Liz Truss's first few days as prime minister - including her first prime minister's questions. Chris MasonPolitical editor It was gone half 10 on Tuesday and cabinet positions were still being filled - a self-imposed deadline from the prime minister approaching with the first meeting of the cabinet at 8.30 BST on Wednesday morning. There are a handful of striking things about its composition. There has been a near total purge of those who backed Rishi Sunak. The only one who I can spot is Michael Ellis, the new attorney general for England and Wales. And even he will attend cabinet rather than being a cabinet minister, subtle though that distinction is. This dominance of Truss campaign supporters around the Truss top table is already prompting grumbling among some Tory MPs, although we do await appointments to the more junior ranks in government. The prime minister's desire for loyalty and building a government in her own image runs the risk of provoking rebellion down the track. More from Chris here Liz Truss has given her allies top cabinet jobs in a major reshuffle hours after being appointed Britain's third female prime minister following a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle earlier. The new PM gave her first speech outside Downing Street where she said her three early priorities would be the economy, energy and the health service. Here are her main cabinet appointments so far: Read more:Who is in Liz Truss's top team? The UK's new Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng says his appointment is âthe honour of a lifetimeâ. The long-time ally and political soulmate of new prime minister Liz Truss takes over at a critical time for the UK economy, with millions looking to him for help with soaring winter energy bills.

Donelan is known for speaking her mind. When she was universities minister, she
often talked about students being ""conned"" into getting into debt
doing degrees that might not be worthwhile. She was most recently promoted to education secretary, but only for two days. She resigned as part of the mass
walk out by ministers that led to Boris Johnson's departure. Donelan is now the eleventh culture
secretary in ten years. So whatâs in her in-tray? Media watchers will be scouring her
past pronouncements on Channel 4 and the BBC. Boris Johnson's government planned
to privatise Channel 4. Will Liz Truss feel a similar sense of urgency? The BBC's
funding is under review with Donelanâs predecessor, Nadine Dorries, previously
making clear she wanted to see an end to the licence fee. Then there is the Online Safety
Bill which seeks to lay down laws on how internet providers clamp down on
harmful content on their sites. Dorries
wrote she was proud of the bill which ""will hold tech giants to account"".
But it's on pause and Liz Truss's government must decide whether to get it back
on track. Graham Stuart has been appointed as climate minister and will attend cabinet, No 10 says. James Heappey has been appointed minister for armed forces and veterans, Downing Street says. He will attend cabinet. Heappey was previously armed forces minister - but his brief has now been extended to include veterans after Johnny Mercer, the former veterans minister, was sacked earlier. Tom Tugendhat has been made security minister in the home office and will attend cabinet. He reached the final five in the Conservative leadership race before endorsing Liz Truss. The former Territorial Army officer, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee since 2017 but this is his first ministerial post. Tugendhat, who speaks Arabic, was also involved in reconstruction efforts in both countries and was highly critical of the withdrawal from Afghanistan by Western forces in 2021. He has worked as a journalist in Beirut and a management consultant in the UK. The father-of-two became an MP in 2015 â for the Kent constituency of Tonbridge, Edenbridge and Malling. Vicky Ford has been appointed as development minister in the foreign, commonwealth and development office in Liz Truss's government. Downing Street says she will attend cabinet. Edward Argar has been appointed paymaster general and minister for the cabinet office. Downing Street says he will attend cabinet and takes over from the new Attorney General Michael Ellis, who was appointed to the job in September 2021. Michael Ellis has been given the role of attorney general in Liz Truss's new government. He is the only supporter of Rishi Sunak who has made it into a top cabinet job. Chris Philp has been appointed chief secretary to the Treasury and takes over from new Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke. The former digital minister initially backed Sajid Javid in the leadership race but endorsed Liz Truss in July. Philp, who has also held junior roles in the Home Office and Ministry of Justice, has spoken of how the NHS saved the lives of his twins after they were born very prematurely at 25 weeks. He was elected MP for Croydon South in 2015. US President Joe Biden has spoken with Prime Minister Truss this
evening, Downing Street has said, Biden congratulating her on her appointment. ""The prime minister looked forward to working closely with
President Biden as leaders of free democracies to tackle shared challenges,
particularly the extreme economic problems unleashed by Putin's war,"" a
Downing Street spokeswoman said. They said Truss and Biden ""reflected on the enduring strength
of the special relationship"" and agreed build on those links, including by
furthering ""our deep defence alliance through Nato and Aukus"". ""The leaders reinforced their commitment to strengthening
global liberty, tackling the risks posed by autocracies and ensuring Putin
fails in Ukraine."" The two leaders also ""discussed a range of domestic issues""
and agreed on the importance of ""protecting the Belfast (Good Friday)
Agreement"", adding that they look forward to meeting again soon. Katy AustinTransport Correspondent New Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan will have many issues to think about, including how to approach
the ongoing wave of industrial action hitting therailways, where strikes could
continue for months. Thereâs also a
decision to be made on whetherAvanti West Coastwill get a new contract to
operate trains on the West Coast mainline, after recently slashing its
schedules amid a staffing crunch. More government funding announced last month will
have saved some regionalbusservices for the next six months, but with passenger
usage still below pre-Covid levels and costs rising, what happens after that?
 And will the Â£2 cap on fares promised for all of England, from January to
March, only last for those 3 months? There's plenty to
think about regardingaviation, and not just working with industry to make sure
airlines and airports have enough staff for next summer. Sustainability
and how the goal of ""net zero"" in aviation by 2050 can be achieved
are a big focus for the industry. Other things on
the list include how the currentmotoring taxesshould be replaced as we move
away from petrol and diesel vehicles, and how to ensure theelectric vehicle
charginginfrastructure meets demand. Robert Buckland remains Welsh secretary, continuing in the role he took on after Simon Hartâs resignation in July. He had previously been in the cabinet, as justice secretary, between July 2019 and September 2021 and is also a former solicitor general. Buckland initially supported former Chancellor Rishi Sunak for the leadership but switched his endorsement to Liz Truss in the middle of August. The former barrister and Crown Court recorder was elected MP for South Swindon at the second attempt in 2010, overturning a Labour majority. Buckland, who has twin children, was born in Llanelli and says his interests include music, wine, political history and watching rugby and cricket. Alister Jack remains secretary of state for Scotland in Liz Trussâs first cabinet, a role he has held since Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019. The former government whip did not reveal who he supported in the leadership contest. Before entering parliament as MP for Dumfries and Galloway in 2017, Jack was a businessman who founded tent-hire and self-storage companies. Jack, who has three grown up children, is also a dairy farmer and grows Christmas trees. Downing Street has now confirmed that Chris Heaton-Harris has been promoted to the cabinet as Northern Ireland Secretary, as we reported earlier. He replaces Shailesh Vara who only took on the role in July. The former chief whip, who could attend cabinet in that role, did not say who he was supporting in the leadership race. He was previously a transport and foreign office minister. Before becoming a politician, Heaton-Harris ran his family's wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New Covent Garden Market. He is also a qualified football referee and referees on the Northamptonshire Combination League. The former MEP, who describes himself as a fierce Eurosceptic, was elected MP for Daventry in 2010. Michelle Donelan has been appointed secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport in Liz Truss's new government. The former higher and further education minister backed Liz Truss after initially supporting her former boss Nadhim Zahawi and then Penny Mordaunt in the leadership race. Previously a government whip, Donelan worked in the media and entertainment industry before entering parliament, including a period as communications manager at professional wrestling firm WWE. The MP for Chippenham, first elected in 2015, says she enjoys walking her dog in her limited spare time. Anne-Marie Trevelyan has been appointed transport secretary in Liz Truss's new government. She had previously been international development secretary but lost her place in the cabinet when the department was scrapped. An outspoken Brexiteer who resigned from a previous junior ministerial role in 2018 in protest at Theresa Mayâs Brexit withdrawal deal, she supported Truss in the leadership race. The former chartered accountant entered the Commons as MP for Berwick-upon-Tweed in 2015 and describes herself as having a passion for singing. Ranil Jayawardena has become environment secretary, taking over from George Eustice. He was previously a minister in the international trade department, working for Liz Truss before she became foreign secretary, and was an early supporter of her leadership bid. Jayawardena, who has three children, used to work for Lloyds Bank and was also a councillor in Hampshire. He entered the Commons as MP for North East Hampshire in 2015. Â© 2025 BBC.
