Nancy Pelosi's long history of opposing Beijing,"US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi is second in line for the presidency US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has arrived in Taiwan, defying warnings from China and concerns from the White House. But she has a long history of criticising the Chinese government. Most famously in 1991, two years after large-scale protests in Beijing were crushed by the Chinese government, she visited Tiananmen Square and displayed a banner honouring the deceased demonstrators. For its part, the Chinese government has made no secret of its disdain for Ms Pelosi, once labelling her ""full of lies and disinformation"". China sees self-ruled Taiwan as a breakaway province, and has not ruled out using force to unify it. It deploys significant pressure to dissuade other countries from recognising Taiwan's independence. Before her visit, China warned of serious consequences if Ms Pelosi went to Taiwan. China and Taiwan: A really simple guide She is second in line for the presidency after Vice-President Kamala Harris, and would be the most senior US politician to travel to the island since her predecessor Newt Gingrich in 1997. Her plans to visit the island were kept under wraps - however rumours were circulating about the plan, prompting the Chinese warnings. Her Asian tour also includes visits to Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan. This leg of the trip is not backed by US President Joe Biden, and with US-China tensions continuing to run high, even White House officials reportedly tried to dissuade her. Mr Biden recently told reporters ""the military thinks it's not a good idea"". Two years after protestors were crushed by Communist Party forces in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, the then-California representative visited the capital city. Slipping away from her official escorts along with two other members of Congress, she went to the city square without the permission of her Chinese hosts. There, they unfurled a small, hand-painted banner which read: ""To those who died for democracy in China."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The police closed in quickly, roughing up reporters who were covering the event and chasing the lawmakers out of the square. China's Foreign Ministry later denounced the incident as a ""premeditated farce"". Tiananmen Square: What happened in the protests of 1989? Some criticised Ms Pelosi's actions during that visit. Former CNN Beijing bureau chief Mike Chinoy wrote in an op-ed for Foreign Policy that she was the reason he got arrested at the scene. Mr Chinoy said he was not aware of what Ms Pelosi planned to do at the square, and was detained for several hours as the police were unable to target a visiting foreign dignitary. ""It was my first experience with Pelosi's penchant for high-profile gestures designed to poke China's communist rulers in the eye - regardless of the consequences,"" he wrote. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Pelosi, who also helped lead a resolution condemning China's actions in 1989, has continued to speak out about the ""massacre"" of demonstrators over the years. Most recently, she issued a statement to mark the 33rd anniversary of the protests this year, calling the demonstrations ""one of the greatest acts of political courage"" and slamming the Communist Party's ""oppressive regime"". At a meeting with then-Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao in 2002, Ms Pelosi tried to pass him four letters expressing concern over the detention and imprisonment of activists in China and Tibet, and calling for their release. Mr Hu refused to accept the letters. Seven years later, Ms Pelosi reportedly hand-delivered another letter to him - by then President of China - calling for the release ofpolitical prisoners including prominent dissident Liu Xiaobo. Liu was named the winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize but was not allowed to travel to Norway to accept the award. He died of cancer in 2017 while still in Chinese custody. Ms Pelosi has opposed China's bids to host the Olympic Games as far back as 1993 on the basis of its alleged human rights abuses. She was one of the lawmakers that unsuccessfully urged then-US President George W Bush to boycott China's Summer Olympics opening ceremony in 2008. This year, the Speaker of the House again led calls for a""diplomatic boycott""of Beijing's 2022 Winter Olympics over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China. ""For heads of state to go to China in light of a genocide that is ongoing - while you're sitting there in your seat - really begs the question, what moral authority do you have to speak again about human rights any place in the world?"" she said. In response, a spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said US politicians were in no position to make ""wanton groundless criticism"" against China. Over the years, Ms Pelosi has also pushed for China's trade status to be linked to its human rights record, and to attach conditions to China's entry to the World Trade Organization. The policy has been controversial: Mr Bush vetoed legislation related to this several times, while former President Bill Clinton initially supported but later abandoned it, saying broader American strategic interests justified the reversal.

Man charged under Treason Act after Windsor Castle incident,"A weapon was found on the man during a search, police said A man allegedly found with a crossbow in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Christmas Day has been charged under the Treason Act. Jaswant Singh Chail, 20, has also been charged with threats to kill and possession of an offensive weapon. Mr Chail, from Southampton, is in custody and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 17 August. The charges were brought after an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. Mr Chail was arrested at about 08:30 GMT on Christmas Day. The Met said he was stopped ""within moments"" of entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings. He has been charged with an offence under section 2 of the 1842 Treason Act, namely ""discharging or aiming firearms, or throwing or using any offensive matter or weapon, with intent to injure or alarm her Majesty"", said Scotland Yard. The Queen had been staying at Windsor Castle for Christmas, rather than spending it as usual on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Her Majesty was due to be joined for lunch by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Under the 1842 Treason Act, it is an offence to assault the Queen, or have a firearm or offensive weapon in her presence with intent to injure or alarm her or to cause a breach of peace. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was jailed for five years under the section of the Treason Act after he fired blank shots at the Queen while she was riding down The Mall in London during the Trooping the Colour parade.

Shock in Kabul as US kills al-Qaeda leader,"This is the suspected location of the strike in Kabul - green plastic sheeting has been draped over the balconies The first signs of an operation that was months in the making erupted when an attack rocked the centre of Kabul in the early hours of Sunday morning: we heard two thunderous blasts on our street nearby. Speculation swirled around who or what had hit this ""empty house"" in Sherpur. It is a neighbourhood which became notorious over the past two decades for its garish multi-storey villas, mocked by Kabul residents as the stronghold of corrupt warlords and officials, a gaudy symbol of the spoils of an ugly war. Kabulis called it Choorpur, the town of thieves. The Taliban took over some of the empty villas, close to some high-walled Western embassies, which also slammed shut when the Taliban took charge. With every day, new pieces of this puzzle surfaced: of a possible strike on an Islamic State target; the use of a US drone which raised even more questions; the involvement of US forces on the ground. The mystery ended early on Tuesday morning. As Kabul woke to the news thatthe US had killed the leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a drone strike, we tried to approach the area on a main road leading into the street threading past Spinney's luxury supermarket and the Afghan Ghazanfar bank. A single Taliban guard angrily crossed his arms to warn us away. From a side street, we reached the back of the villa on foot. Guards and workers in adjacent buildings confirmed which house had been hit on Sunday; balconies protruding from the top floor were now covered with green plastic sheeting. Had anyone seen any activity, any residents, at this place? ""The house was empty,"" was the refrain. Was this a reply rehearsed in advance, an echo of the Taliban's official statement? Owners of nearby buildings told us they had been ordered, hours earlier, to shut their rooftops to everyone, even their own workers. As news of Zawahiri's killing shot like an electric current through social media, the scene of this explosive moment seemed strangely quiet. Traffic flowed on surrounding tree-lined streets on this warm summer's day. But as minutes ticked by, more journalists arrived, more passers-by stopped, more Taliban guards showed up. ""If you don't listen to me, I'll speak to you through my gun,"" one armed Talib warned a colleague as we stood on the main street. A group of Afghan and foreign journalists approached us, one journalist in tears after an angry altercation on the main road which led to the front of the house. Her equipment had been forcefully taken away. It was then returned. Now what had only been whispers grew louder. There was talk that Arabs had been seen, in recent months, moving through these streets. No one dared speak much about it. A local journalist living nearby told us: ""We've seen non-Afghan residents in this neighbourhood in the past couple of months. They don't speak the local languages. We don't know who they are."" Now there are many questions, conspiracies and a range of possible consequences. The death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top target on America's wanted list, had been reported many times before including last year when he was said to have died of illness. Zawahiri was al-Qaeda's most prominent spokesman and ideologue If he was alive, he was said be a recluse in the rugged terrain along Afghan-Pakistan border. But now it emerges that he was a guest of the Taliban leadership, living in that villa smack in the centre of Kabul and said to belong to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting Taliban interior minister, who is under US terrorism sanctions. PROFILE:Who was Ayman al-Zawahiri? BACKGROUND:Al-Qaeda leader killed in US drone strike There is an echo of the 2011 US killing of Zawahiri's brother-in-arms, Osama Bin Laden, who had been hiding in plain sight in a villa in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, down the street from a Pakistani military academy. There is an echo too of the Taliban's rejoinder to the US after the 9/11 attacks that Bin Laden had only been their honoured guest, in Afghan Pashtun tradition. The 2020 US-Taliban deal, signed after nearly two years of tortuous negotiations in the Gulf state of Qatar, was meant to sort out this crucial question. During the talks, we were repeatedly told that the Taliban commitment not to allow Afghanistan to be a safe haven again would be spelled out clearly, in black and white. But the deal which emerged, with secret annexes, was not so clearcut. The Taliban vowed to prevent any attacks on US soil from their territory. But they never explicitly agreed to sever ties with their fellow jihadis including Zawahiri who, like other al-Qaeda leaders, had sworn allegiance to the Taliban leader, or emir, Haibatullah Akhundzada. Since the Taliban swept into Kabul on 15 August last year, there have been repeated and credible reports of al-Qaeda fighters crossing the Pakistan border into Afghanistan but there have also been repeated Taliban pledges to fight against terrorism. The Taliban also accuse the US of violating their deal in their attack against a residential neighbourhood of Kabul. A statement from a Taliban spokesman warned that ""repeating such actions will damage the existing opportunities"". This watershed moment comes at a time when the Taliban, one year after seizing power, are still struggling to establish international legitimacy and recognition. They may not wish to endanger any fragile progress. The US and other Western powers have also been trapped in a bind: how do they help the people of Afghanistan, mired in a deepening humanitarian crisis, when many Taliban leaders are still under US terrorism sanctions? American interests in this region also include the fight against extremist groups like Islamic State, an enemy they share with the Taliban The Taliban have been walking a political high wire ever since they took charge in Kabul. How do they maintain their standing in the global jihadi community, including their long-standing relations with al-Qaeda? Social media is now buzzing with accusations of another US war crime with another alleged extrajudicial killing. How do they complete their transformation from an insurgency to an internationally respected government but still keep their ultra-conservative credentials? That high wire is now wobbling. The world is watching. This video can not be played Biden on Zawahiri killing: 'Justice has been delivered' US kills al-Qaeda leader in Afghanistan drone strike Who was Ayman al-Zawahiri?

Fears some renters will miss out on Â£400 payment,"Tenants whose bills are included in their rent could miss out on the government's Â£400 energy rebate because it is paid to their landlord, charities have warned. Housing charity Shelter said this group were ""at the mercy of their landlord passing on this much-needed support"". An estimated 585,000 households,external- 13% of private renters - have energy bills included in their rent. The government said it expected landlords to pass on the discount. The National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) also said that where tenants incurred the cost of increased energy bills, the discount should be passed on to them by their landlord. However, a spokesperson pointed out there would be cases where all-inclusive rents had been set without reflecting the recent surge in energy costs. ""The government needs to ensure that its scheme recognises such cases where it is the landlord who is ultimately paying the cost of increased bills, rather than the tenant,"" the spokesperson added. How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? The typical household energy bill could hit Â£3,615 a year in January, up from Â£1,400 a year in October 2021,according to a forecast from consultancy Cornwall Insight. The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills. Last week the government revealed detailsof how people in England, Scotland and Wales would receive the payment. The Treasury is still in discussion with Stormont ministers about how to make the payment to households in Northern Ireland. The money will be paid in six instalments, with a discount of Â£66 applied to energy bills in October and November, and Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. How the money is received will depend on how you pay your bill. However, for tenants whose energy bills are included in their rent, their landlord would receive the discount as they are the bill payer. Helen, 25, rents a room in a four-bed house in Leicester with bills included. She is worried that if she asks her landlord to pass the Â£400 payment on to her he will increase her rent when her contract is up for renewal later this year. ""I'm leaning towards not rocking the boat because I'm dreading that conversation about renewing and what my new rent will be for the next six months,"" she told the BBC. Helen, who did not want to give her surname, is a PhD student and her stipend will increase by just 2% in September - well below the rate prices are rising, with UK inflation hitting 9.4% in June. If her rent increased she said it would be ""a real stretch"" to cover her other living costs. As she shares a house with strangers, Helen said it was also difficult to discuss the situation with her housemates, who she would have to share the payment with. She did not know if they would feel the same as her. When it comes to utility bills,government guidance,externalstates that landlords who have a domestic electricity contract with a licensed supplier and then resell the electricity to their tenant, based on usage, must comply with maximum resale price rules. This means landlords are not allowed to make a profit on energy they are reselling. Landlords with a domestic electricity connection where a fixed cost for energy is included in the rent ""should also be passing on the discounted payments to tenants"", the government said. But charities have raised concerns that landlords will not pass on the saving to their tenants. Are you a renter worried about missing out on the Â£400 energy rebate?

You can also get in touch viaWhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,externalandTwitter:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external ""There's no specific legal obligation for landlords to pass on this support but they aren't allowed to overcharge tenants for the energy they've used or make a profit on it,"" Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said. ""This could be the case if they pocket the government support and continue to charge the same rate for utilities."" ""Landlords can only charge for energy used, the standing charge and VAT. So, it's worth making a note of how much energy you're using to make sure you're not paying more than you should,"" she added. Ms Neate said it was ""unfair that those at the sharp end of this crisis could miss out on this much-needed support"" and urged the government to make sure it went ""to the people who need it the most"". Gillian Cooper, head of energy policy at Citizens Advice, said there was no clear guidance on how landlords should pass on the discount ""or any law to make sure they do"". ""We're worried that renters could fall through the cracks and miss out on extra cash,"" she added. Dan Wilson Craw, deputy director of campaign group Generation Rent, said: ""A lot of landlords have already raised the rent to take account of higher energy bills and there's no easy way for tenants to ask them to pass on the Â£400 grant if they don't want to - threatening to move out is one approach but that is difficult when rent on a new property could be much higher."" He suggested tenants could ask their landlord to take into account the Â£400 rebate the next time they tried to increase their rent. But he added that until Parliament passed the Renters Reform Bill, tenants could still be evicted without reason if they complained. Landlord Annette Munro hasn't increased the rent on her flat, despite soaring energy costs However, some landlords who have not increased their tenants' rent said they did not think they should have to pass on the Â£400 discount. Annette Munro, 59, rents out a flat in London with bills included and believes landlords should only have to pass on the rebate if they have hiked rents due to rising energy costs. She said the monthly energy bill for her property had increased from Â£90 to Â£267 but she has not put up the rent for several years because her tenants are ""already struggling"". ""If landlords haven't put [the rent] up and have absorbed that cost because they like their tenants and they want to keep them, then I think that they should be able to take the Â£400,"" she told the BBC.

"16,000 firms go bust owing millions in Covid loans","A total of 1.5 million bounce back loans were granted during the pandemic More than 16,000 businesses which took out a type of government-backed Covid loan have gone bust without paying the money back, the BBC has found. Hundreds of directors, who got loans they were not entitled to, have also been disqualified. The cost to the taxpayer of these insolvencies could be as much as Â£500m, and is likely to grow as more companies go under. Questions are now being asked about what is being done to recoup the money. The figures, obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request, have been described as ""shocking"" by a former head of the Serious Fraud Office. Sir David Green QC describes checks the government required banks to do on bounce back loan applicants as ""hopelessly inadequate"". Sir David Green QC says checks carried out on bounce back loan applicants were ""hopelessly inadequate"" A total of 1.5 million loans worth Â£47bn were handed out. One of several measures designed to help businesses survive the pandemic, the loans were supposed to be paid back within 10 years. But in the rush to save the economy, checks on borrowers were limited. Under the scheme any small company could apply for a loan of up to Â£50,000 depending on its turnover. Applicants were allowed to ""self-certify"" the figures. ""You wouldn't send an army into battle without assessing the risks. And just the same in this situation, the risks, which were obvious, should have been assessed and addressed,"" said Sir David, who is now chairman of the Fraud Advisory Panel. He believes bounce back loan money must be recovered wherever possible. The government has said it will ""not tolerate"" people defrauding taxpayers. The BBC has been investigating what will happen to the hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer money given to companies which have since become insolvent. The majority of those businesses went bust for legitimate reasons, however there is increasing evidence that a proportion of bounce back loans were misused. The BBC has discovered that hundreds of company directors have so far been disqualified from running businesses. And many of those companies were not eligible to receive the loans in the first place. Previousresearch shows,externalthat 45% of successful applicants to two banks showed no evidence of trading at the relevant period. With festivals cancelled, Peter Ferguson's events companies struggled during the pandemic. And so he turned to the government's bounce back loan scheme. Mr Ferguson took out a Â£50,000 loan through a dormant company called Beautiful Digital Events Ltd. He gave a turnover figure which overstated the true amount and used the money to buy himself two cars. Peter Ferguson took out a Â£50,000 bounce back loan through a dormant company Mr Ferguson has since been censured by the Insolvency Service and banned from being a company director for six years. But another of his companies is putting on one of Scotland's biggest festivals, Party at the Palace, on 13 and 14 August. Mr Ferguson is no longer allowed to be a director, but is listed as a ""person with significant control"" and promotes the festival line-up on his Facebook page. And, earlier this year, on holiday in Las Vegas, Mr Ferguson won more than Â£200,000 playing poker. The terms of the bounce back loan state that the dormant company is liable to pay it back, not him personally - and that company has now been dissolved. Mr Ferguson responded in a statement: ""With the in-person events industry in Scotland wiped out overnight, I sought a loan to move into the digital events space. ""Despite our best efforts and much to my deep sorrow, this service failed. I was advised to liquidate the company, having been willing to repay the loan up to that point."" He has confirmed that he took out a total of five bounce back loans, including the one for Beautiful Digital Events. As for the four others, he said ""one has already been paid back in full and a payment has not been missed on the others"". Scrolling through the website of the Insolvency Service, we found scores of company directors who took out loans with, it seems, little or no prospect of being able to repay them. In fact, a request under the Freedom of Information Act reveals that so far 260 directors have been disqualified with their companies still owing a bounce back loan. The loans were spent on everything from gambling debts and cryptocurrency schemes - to cars, house renovations, even flying lessons. The rules state that if there's no money left in the business the loan can't be paid back. So it's not clear how much the government will eventually be able to recover. Several agencies have been tasked by the government with investigating Covid loans and getting back the money. The Insolvency Service has brought only one prosecution to date but claims it has another 30 cases pending. Its website is updated almost daily with new examples of directors being banned from running a business after obtaining bounce back loans they weren't entitled to. The maximum ban lasts 15 years. But the service has no record of how much money has been recovered because each case is handled separately by a private insolvency practitioner. The government has also asked the National Investigation Service (Natis) - a law enforcement organisation which usually investigates local authority corruption - to look into the scheme. The latest figures show Natis, which has a Â£6m budget, made 49 arrests and recovered just Â£4.1m. It has identified 673 suspects of whom 559 used the bounce back loan scheme. It's now thoughtÂ£17bn could be lost,externalto fraud, mistakes and companies going under. Sir David Green QC from the Fraud Advisory Panel believes organised criminal groups have had a field day. ""Fraud is opportunistic and organised crime groups are experts at that opportunism."" But he thinks with limited resources, police should target the worst offenders, while company directors who did not play by the rules should be pursued through the civil courts. ""It's important to concentrate on those areas where you get most bang for your buck, and that, I would suggest, is in relation to the most egregious organised frauds rather than individuals,"" he said. Raitis Dzerkalis claimed a Â£40,000 bounce back loan he wasn't entitled to Raitis Dzerkalis had a car repair company in the West Midlands. He claimed a Â£40,000 bounce back loan - he wasn't entitled to it. The Insolvency Service said he exaggerated turnover and didn't spend the money on the business. The company became insolvent and, like Peter Ferguson, he was banned from being a director - in this case for 10 years. But Mr Dzerkalis has another company, which he transferred into the name of a housemate. Now Mr Dzerkalis seems to work as a part-time DJ. We caught up with him at home in Coventry but he didn't want to talk. So we have no idea if he has attempted to pay any of the loan back. Business Minister Lord Callanan said in a statement that ""tough new powers"" had been introduced allowing the Insolvency Service to disqualify directors for dissolving companies to avoid repaying bounce back loans.

What's behind China-Taiwan tensions?,"Many Taiwanese see their island as separate nation China has launched major military drills around Taiwan for the second time this year, simulating a full-scale attack on the island - just days after the Taiwanese President William Lai delivered his first National Day speech. They come months after drills held, days after Lai was sworn in. The exercises reinforce what is at the heart of the issue: China's claim over self-governed Taiwan. Beijing sees the island as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. But many Taiwanese consider themselves to be part of a separate nation - although most are in favour of maintaining the status quo where Taiwan neither declares independence from China nor unites with it. Taiwan's first known settlers were Austronesian tribal people, believed to have come from modern day southern China. Chinese records appear to first mention the island in AD239, when an emperor dispatched an expeditionary force to it - a fact Beijing uses to back its territorial claim. After a relatively brief spell as a Dutch colony, Taiwan was administered by China's Qing dynasty, before it was ceded to Tokyo after Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War. After World War Two, Japan surrendered and relinquished control of territory it had taken from China. Afterwards, Taiwan was officially considered occupied by the Republic of China (ROC), which began ruling with the consent of its allies, the US and UK. But in the next few years a civil war broke out in China, and then-leader Chiang Kai-shek's troops were defeated by Mao Zedong's Communist army. Chiang, the remnants of his Kuomintang (KMT) government and their supporters - about 1.5m people -  fled to Taiwan in 1949. Chiang established a dictatorship that ruled Taiwan until the 1980s. Following his death, Taiwan began a transition to democracy and held its first elections in 1996. There is disagreement about the status of Taiwan. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang's ROC government-in-exile at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. Chiang Kai-shek, once the leader in China, fled with his supporters to Taiwan But by the 1970s some countries began to argue that the Taipei government could no longer be considered a genuine representative of the people living in mainland China. In 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing.  Once China began opening up its economy in 1978, the US recognised opportunities for trade and the need to develop relations. It formally established diplomatic ties with Beijing in 1979. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government has fallen drastically with only 12 countries recognising the island today. China exerts considerable diplomatic pressure on other countries not to recognise Taiwan. Relations started improving in the 1980s as Taiwan relaxed rules on visits to and investment in China. In 1991, the ROC proclaimed that the war with the People's Republic of China was over. China proposed the so-called ""one country, two systems"" option, which it said would allow Taiwan significant autonomy if it agreed to come under Beijing's control. This system underpinned Hong Kong's return to China in 1997 and the manner in which it was governed until recently, when Beijing has sought to increase its influence. Taiwan rejected the offer, leading Beijing to insist the Taiwan's ROC government was illegitimate - but unofficial representatives from China and Taiwan still held limited talks. Then in 2000, Taiwan elected Chen Shui-bian as president, much to Beijing's alarm. Chen and his party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), had openly backed Taiwan ""independence"". A year after Chen was re-elected in 2004, China passed a so-called anti-secession law, declaring China's right to use ""non-peaceful means"" against Taiwan if it tried to ""secede"" from China. Chen was later succeeded by the KMT, which favours closer relations with the PRC. In 2016,Tsai Ing-wen,from the DPP, was elected to the presidency. Under her, cross-strait relations have soured. China also cut off official communications with Taiwan after Ms Tsai took over, saying it was because of her refusal to endorse the concept of a single Chinese nation. Tsai has never said she will formally declare Taiwan's independence, insisting that it is already independent. Under Ms Tsai, cross-Straits relations soured again But Tai's term also coincided with that of Xi Jinping, under whom Chinese claims have grown more aggressive. He has reiterated the message that China will ""surely be reunified"" with Taiwan, and has set 2049 as a target date for ""achieving the Chinese dream"". In January 2024, Taiwan elected Tsai's vice-president, William Lai, as president - a man China has branded a ""separatist"". China's drills- dubbed Joint Sword 2024A - came in his first week in office - which Beijing said were a ""strong punishment"" for ""separatist acts"". It also singled out Lai as the ""worst of all"" DPP presidents so far. The second round of drills - titled Joint Sword 2024B - came days after Lai pledged to uphold Taiwan's self-governing status during a national day speech on 10 October. The US maintains official ties with Beijing, and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" - but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter. Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and US President Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily - breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity. The island has long been one of the most contentious issue in US-China relations, with Beijing condemning any perceived support from Washington for Taipei. In 2022, after a visit to Taiwan by US Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China responded with an unprecedented show of force, carrying out military exercises around Taiwan in retaliation. Under President Xi, China hasramped up this ""grey zone warfare""- sending record numbers of Chinese fighter jets near Taiwan and holding military drills in response to political exchanges between the US and Taiwan. In 2022, China's warplane incursions into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) nearly doubled. The results of the elections will shape the course of US-China relations - and no matter who walks away the winner, will have an indelible impact on the delicate relationship between the US, China and Taiwan.

Airbnb bookings hit record high as travel recovers,"Airbnb says its business will be resilient, even in the event of economic downturn Airbnb said travel demand remains strong, despite concerns about economic slowdown and rising prices hitting households. Nearly 104 million nights and experiences were booked on the platform in the April through June period, a record high for the lodging website. Long-term stays continued to be the fastest growing type of travel, a shift driven by the rise of remote work. But international and city travel, which had lagged, have also recovered. The company said it was now in the middle of its strongest peak summer travel season yet, and it assured investors that it was well poised for whatever may hit the economy. US economy shrinks again sparking recession fears Airbnb permanently bans parties around the world Airbnb to quit China as lockdowns restrict tourism In fact, a slowdown may actually help the company, executives said. ""Airbnb was founded during the recession,"" chief executive Brian Chesky said in a conference call with analysts to discuss the company's results. In the event of another slowdown, he said, ""we think a lot of people may turn to hosting once again, so this is a big opportunity for us"". Overall, bookings in the April-June period rose 25% from last year to 103.7 million and up 24% from 2019. Higher prices helped lift the company's revenue, which surged 58% from last year to $2.1bn. Nearly half of the company's reservations are for a week or longer, the company said. Travel demand remains strongest in North America, where bookings are up 37% compared to 2019. Growth in Europe - while travel has recovered from the pandemic - is lagging that recovery, hurt by factors such as the weaker pound. The company, which announced in May that it was pulling out of China, said demand remained below pre-pandemic levels in the Asia Pacific region, as Covid restrictions keep Chinese tourists at home. Despite the removal of China listings in July, Airbnb still has more than 6 million active listings on the platform. Mr Chesky said the company had now achieved ""growth and profitability at scale"" and said the firm would both continue to invest in the business, and spend $2bn on buying its own shares, which have fallen this year. Executives said the buyback programme was a sign of their confidence in the company's future. The company reported a profit of $379m, compared to a loss of $68m last year.

Cost of filling a tank falls by Â£5 in July,"The price of petrol fell in July, knocking nearly Â£5 off the cost of filling a tank, according to the RAC. Average petrol prices dropped by nearly 9p over the month to 182.69p per litre, while diesel fell by almost 7p to 192.38p per litre. But the motoring group warned the reductions still don't fairly reflect the fall in the wholesale price of fuel. It said major retailers should be cutting pump prices much further. Petrol prices drop from record highs Petrol pricing is cause for concern, warns watchdog Refineries cash in as petrol prices soar Fuel prices have soared in recent months, driven by the war in Ukraine and moves to reduce Europe's dependence on oil from Russia, a major supplier. With food andenergy bills also surging, many households are feeling financial strain. Wholesale petrol prices peaked at the start of June, but have since fallen as the price of oil has dropped back.Fears of a recession in the US and elsewhere have hit demand for oil, and the price of Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil - has fallen to around $100 a barrel, after soaring when Russia invaded Ukraine. The RAC said nearly Â£5 was shaved off the cost of a 55-litre tank of petrol in July, from Â£105.29 down to Â£100.48, as retailers lowered their prices. The cost of filling up a diesel tank dropped by Â£3.68 over the month. These are the third and fourth biggest monthly reductions, respectively, in the last 20 years. However, the RAC says the falls are still too slow, given the significant reductions in the wholesale price of fuel. Wholesale petrol prices have fallen by 20p over the last eight weeks, whereas the average price paid for unleaded by drivers has only dropped by 9p in July. Based on average wholesale prices last week, the RAC says petrol should be around 167p per litre, not 183p. It warned that the failure of major retailers to slash petrol pump prices in line with the fall in wholesale costs of unleaded is costing drivers, who are paying nearly Â£9 a tank more than they should be. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the biggest retailers should have ""cut their prices more significantly on a daily basis"", given the steady and consistent fall in the wholesale price of petrol. He said their unwillingness to do this made July ""an unnecessarily tough month for drivers"". Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined However, some fuel analysts argue that is not a fair comparison. ""Over the last eight weeks, prices have jumped around; it's understandable if retailers have tried to smooth those differences out in their prices,"" said Steve Irwin, director at Portland Analytics. ""There is often a lag between wholesale prices dropping and a drop in prices at the pump. I expect we will see further price drops in petrol in forecourts over the next week or so of a further 5, 6 or even 7p a litre."" While the drop in petrol prices is good news for drivers, Mr Irwin warned it is not necessarily a good sign for the economy. ""The market is clearly worried about a downturn, with people cutting back this autumn and winter, and that is being factored into the wholesale price,"" he said. ""If signs of that downturn don't materialise, prices may go back up again. If the market thinks they are, they could fall further.""

Stephen King testifies against publishing merger,"American horror novelist Stephen King is taking on a new monster: corporate consolidation. The author was the star witness in an anti-trust trial to block the two biggest US publishers' $2.2bn merger. The US Department of Justice called on King to testify about how the proposed tie-up of Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster could affect authors. King, 75, told the court in Washington DC that he felt ""the move would be bad for competition in the industry"". Both publishing houses have argued the merger would not hinder competition because the companies would continue to bid against each other for the rights to publish novels, even after the transaction is finalised. Stephen King: Are you afraid of the dark? King - who has 50 years' experience in publishing - called that idea ""a little bit ridiculous"". ""You might as well say you're going to have a husband and wife bidding against each other for the same house,"" the novelist quipped, according to journalists in the court. Since publishing his first novel, Carrie, in 1974, King has penned more than 70 novels - including other cult classics like The Shining, and It - that have sold over 350m copies. In the last decade, King has also become more outspoken on social media, interacting with fans and often encouraging his 6.8 million Twitter followers to support local and independent bookstores. In November 2020, Penguin Random House and Paramount Global, Simon & Schuster's parent company, announced plans for a merger. A year later, the justice department sued to block the acquisition. US President Joe Biden's administration has vowed to increase competition as a central part of its economic policy. ""American authors and consumers will pay the price of this anticompetitive merger - lower advances for authors and ultimately fewer books and less variety for consumers,"" US Attorney General Merrick Garland saidfollowing the announcement of the lawsuit,external. Attorneys representing the merger have denied these allegations and argue that stopping the transaction ""would harm the very authors DOJ purports to protect"". The ""DOJ has not found, nor does it allege, that the combination will reduce competition in the sale of books"", Daniel Petrocelli, Penguin's lead attorney in the trial,said in a statement,external. ""We are confident that the robust and competitive landscape that exists will ensure a decision that the acquisition will promote, not harm, competition."" Anti-trust legal action seeks to ensure acquisitions and mergers do not create market monopolies, or anti-competitive practices such as price-fixing.

BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soar,"BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year. It comes as typical household energy bills have been forecast tohit more than Â£3,600 a yearthis winter. The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills. BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history. It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies andBritish Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices. Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies. ""Clearly there are exceptional windfall profits in the oil and gas sector, and clearly there's a problem in the energy market, and we should fix one with the other,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Campaign groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats also called for a tougher windfall tax on oil and gas firm profits. Professor Nick Butler, a former vice president of BP, said he believed the energy giant was ""very sensitive to the reputational problems of making money at this level"". He told the BBC there was a ""real case"" for the government calling together the industry ""to find a plan to get us through the winter"". ""You have Europe as a whole now cutting back gas use by 15% immediately, which is not happening here, and actually going out around the world to secure as much of the supply as they possibly can through the winter,"" he said. The government has introduced a package of measures to help people with energy bills, such as a Â£400 discount, and following political pressure, ministersannounced in Maythat oil and gas firms would pay anextra 25% on profits made in the UK. The tax applies from 26 May to profit made in the UK, which for most oil and gas companies is a small part of their operations. For BP, it accounts for a tenth of overall oil and gas production. BP will therefore not be required to pay the levy on the majority of the profits it made between April and June. The Treasury said it did not comment on ""individual taxpayers"", but added it expected the windfall tax, called the Energy Profits Levy, to raise about Â£5bn in its first year. Critics of a windfall tax argue it might hit pension funds invested in energy firms. However, pension funds are invested across different countries and industries, so a tax in one sector is unlikely to make a noticeable difference. The huge increase in profits for firms has been fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. Higher oil prices have also led to the price of petrol and diesel reaching record highs at the pumps in recent months,although prices have started to fall slightly. How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, told the BBC's Today programme that energy bills ""at this point in time"" looked set to stay high across 2023 and into 2024 and warned higher bills was ""a long-term problem for households."" He said current government help would make a ""dent"" in higher bills but was ""not going to offset this."" BP said its bumper profit results were driven by strong refining margins and oil trading. It announced it would boost shareholder payouts by 10% as well as buy back shares as a result of its higher earnings. Last year, chief executive Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"". But on Tuesday he said the company's staff had helped to solve an ""energy trilemma"" which he added was ""secure, affordable and lower carbon energy"". In a conference call he added: ""In terms of cost of living we all have to recognise that it's a very, very difficult place for people, not just, by the way, in the UK but across of the world right now. ""We understand that, we get it. Our people inside the company get it, they want to help."" Mr Looney said BP was ""backing Britain"" by investing Â£18bn in the country this decade. The company said its half-year figures were affected by a massive Â£19.9bn hit from its move to ditch the its near-20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war. Richard Hunter, head of markets at online investment firm Interactive Investor, said BP had ""already made some strong progress"" in recouping the financial pain of its Russian exit, adding BP's latest results were an ""early indication of the company's ability to repair such damage"". The contrast is stark but inevitable. The same high oil and gas prices emptying the pockets of consumers are filling those of the companies that sell it. BP's profit from April to June was triple the amount than last year and is the second highest in the company's long history. The company said it would increase its payments to shareholders by Â£3.6bn in the next three months. Those shareholders include most pension funds but these numbers sit uncomfortably alongside new estimates that average annual energy bills will cost over Â£3,600 a year. Insiders at BP and Shell, which announced record results last week, point out that a couple of years ago, both companies were losing billions and no-one was offering to subsidise their losses. Both companies have profited from soaring internationally-set oil and gas prices as a rise in post-Covid global demand has been exacerbated by attempts to cut Russia out of the international energy market.

NI Assembly recalled in tribute to Lord Trimble,"Lord Trimble died last week, aged 77 Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland have gathered at Stormont to pay tribute to Lord Trimble. The assembly was recalled for a special sitting on Tuesday afternoon. MLAs were given the opportunity to remember the former Ulster Unionist Party leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who died last week aged 77. UK and Irish prime ministers were among mournersat his funeral in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. Lord Trimble led the UUP from 1995 to 2005 and was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreement in 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. Lord Trimble's extraordinary life of ups and downs Trimble had 'considerable strength of character' Tuesday's sitting was led by Speaker Alex Maskey. He opened with his own tribute to Lord Trimble, describing him as a ""complex and thoughtful character"" who carried a heavy burden as the leader of unionism. ""There is no doubt David Trimble took risks and took decisions often in the face of fierce opposition when it would have been personally easier for him not to do so,"" Mr Maskey said. ""David and his family made sacrifices and paid a personal price for the leadership he showed, but the Good Friday Agreement and this Assembly do exist because of him."" Ulster Unionist Party leader, Doug Beattie, said that before 1998 unionists and nationalists would not have been seen in the same room together, ""never mind share a handshake or form a government with joint responsibilities"". He contrasted that to scenes at Lord Trimble's funeral on Monday where political leaders from across the divide came together. ""At David's humble and dignified funeral, handshakes and pats on the shoulder were offered freely from every political corner with warm words of condolence - that's progress,"" he said. ""David's life was one of service...he had a vision focused on peace and on ending the sectarian divide while protecting Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom."" Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), laid a wreath under the portrait of the party""s former leader at Stormont Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, paid tribute to Lord Trimble's ""courage and generosity"", as she recognised the personal risks he took to achieve peace. But Ms O'Neill also noted that 2023 will mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. ""It would be a travesty if the political accommodation which the agreement is, the political institutions, and the relationships north-south and east-west are not reset between now and then,"" she added. ""History will be kind to David Trimble for the huge part he played, but it will be unforgiving to those of you who obstruct progress or refuse to show leadership."" DUP minister Edwin Poots noted that he was one of only four current MLAs left, who was elected to the Assembly of 1998 and shared the chamber with Lord Trimble. ""His ability and intellect was evident for all to see,"" Mr Poots said. ""His attention to detail was second to none. Actually, so much focused on the detail sometimes he didn't focus on the message, but he was so focused on the detail. ""He was brave, in that he took on the challenges that came his way and they weren't easy, particularly in a constituency like Upper Bann where the unionist population is very strong unionist population and they were certainly uneasy with much of what he was doing, and that transpired in future elections. But he was a dedicated unionist."" Alliance Party MLA Andrew Muir described Lord Trimble as a ""complex character"", and said that while he would not have agreed with him on some matters, he said he had made a ""significant, substantial and positive contribution"". ""Northern Ireland is, thankfully, a very different place now than it was back in 1998, but we should not kid our self that we don't have much further to travel. We do,"" he said. ""The prize of a truly reconciled people, a place where everyone is proud to call home, and fully functioning institutions sadly remains yet to be achieved. ""With so many of the giants of the peace process now no longer with us, current and future generations turn to us all here to take the baton on and complete the journey set out in 1998."" SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said ""very few politicians are able to claim a record of achievement as profound as that of David Trimble"". He noted successive leaders of unionism ""struggling to deliver meaningful compromise without the demon accusations of Lundyism and treason"". ""Trimble faced these accusations too, but stuck at it,"" he said. ""Dogged, diffident, sometimes difficult. He used a legal mind and remarkable tenacity to achieve - and then implement - a deal which esteemed both historic traditions and constitutional aspirations and acknowledged the interconnectedness of this island, and of both islands."" Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey signs the book of condolence for Lord Trimble at the Great Hall, Stormont, on Tuesday Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister started off by saying he disagreed with Lord Trimble on the Good Friday Agreement. He said the assembly had been failing and dysfunctional since it was set up in 1998. However, Mr Allister paid tribute to Lord Trimble as ""more honest politically"" than ""those who supplanted him as the leader of unionism"". ""I'm happy that in latter times I found common cause with Lord Trimble in opposing the [Northern Ireland] Protocol, and he was of course a joint applicant in the ongoing judicial review challenge to that protocol."" Mr Allister also recalled Lord Trimble as a law academic at Queen's University when he was a student, and described him as a ""supreme academic and someone who was an intellectual of giant proportions"". MLAs have also signed a book of condolence. Speaking afterwards, former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Mike Nesbitt, said the only fitting tribute to Lord Trimble would be ""to get the institutions at Stormont back up and running again"" to deal with issues that remain, including the protocol. ""What we are dealing with are challenges but they are nothing like the challenges that David Trimble had to overcome 25 years ago,"" he said. The assembly will also sit again on Wednesday to try again to elect a new Speaker. Mr Nesbitt said his party questions the point of the assembly recall on Wednesday, adding that ""it is not going to go anywhere"". He urged urged party leaders to get together ""quietly and privately to resolve the differences"". The assembly has not been sitting becausethe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to vote for a Speaker. The party is refusing to re-enter power sharing as part of its protest overthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Without a Speaker, the assembly cannot function, but a Speaker can only be elected with support from a majority of unionist and nationalist members and this is not possible without the DUP. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party would not be supporting the election of a new Speaker.

Snorkeler suffers 'suspected shark bite',"The company said it offered ""the chance to have up close and interactive encounters with blue sharks in their natural environment"" A snorkeler has suffered a leg injury after reportedly being bitten by a blue shark off the coast of Cornwall. The incident is believed to have happened during an organised trip at lunchtime on Thursday 28 July. A Maritime Coastguard Agency spokesperson said a coastguard team went to Penzance Harbour to pass the casualty into the care of an ambulance. Blue Shark Snorkel, the company that organised the tour, said such incidents were ""extremely rare"". The casualty was handed over to an ambulance crew at Penzance Harbour It reported that the person injured had found it ""very scary"" and had ""thanked everyone for their amazing actions"" to get them quickly and calmly back to shore. On its Facebook page Blue Shark Snorkel said: ""As we know, these things can happen when we choose to interact with wild animals in their own environment."" On its website, the company said it offered ""the chance to have up close and interactive encounters with blue sharks in their natural environment"". The statement added: ""We immediately enacted our emergency response plan, with first aid being carried out on the person involved. ""Following advice and assessment from the coastguard, the person walked off the boat and received further treatment ashore."" An MCA spokesperson said: ""HM Coastguard sent Penzance Coastguard Rescue Team to meet a snorkeler who suffered a suspected shark bite... It is believed the swimmer suffered a leg injury. ""The coastguard team met the casualty at Penzance harbour to assist with passing them into the care of the ambulance service."" The snorkelling company said it was ""trying to understand why it happened and were in continued talks with shark experts"". The firm also shared a statement from the victim, who said: ""I don't for a second want this freak event to tarnish the reputation of an already persecuted species. ""We all take these risks when we enter the habitat of a predator and we can never completely predict the reactions of a wild animal."" Blue sharks visit the UK during the summer months from the Caribbean, and are known to mainly feed on small fish and squid, but have been known to attack seabirds and other small sharks, according to the Wildlife Trusts. UK-based charity the Shark Trust says there have been no ""unprovoked"" shark bites in British waters since 1847, when records began.

Child services concerns remain after boy's murder,"Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was removed from the Child Protection Register a month before his death There are still ""serious concerns"" about children's services in the area where a five-year-old boy was murdered by his family, inspectors have said. Despite themurder of Logan Mwangi in July 2021, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) said ""urgent action"" was needed in Bridgend. It noted some improvements since its April 2021 inspection. Logan was murdered by his mother, step-father and a teenage boy. Bridgend council said it had an ongoing action plan for improvements. The Welsh government said it was disappointed that such improvements were needed. The routine inspection took place between 23 and 27 May 2022, nearly a year after Logan was killed and his body was dumped in the River Ogmore close to his home in Sarn. His mother Angharad Williamson, step-father John Cole and Craig Mulliganwere given life sentences for his murder. Mum who drowned son, 2, given hospital order Independent review needed of Wales' social services Mulligan was not biologically related to any of them, but Cole had raised him since he was nine months old and considered himself a father figure. Angharad Williamson, 31, Craig Mulligan, 14, and John Cole, 40, were all given life sentences for Logan's murder On 16 August 2020, Logan was taken to hospital by Williamson who said he dislocated his shoulder when he fell down the stairs the day before. Doctors discovered Logan had a broken arm and the hospital made a referral to social services. The following June, social workers in Bridgend removed Logan and his younger sibling from the child protection register - meaning they were no longer considered to be at significant risk of harm. A child practice review looking at the circumstances around Logan's death and the involvement of professionals in his and his family's life is due to be published in the autumn. Logan's death came a month before two-year-old Reid Steelewas drowned in the bath at his home by his ""devoted"" mother, just over three miles away from where Logan was murdered. Natalie Steele, 32,admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibilityafter killing her son while suffering paranoid delusions and was given a hospital order. Reid Steele's family said he was caring and was always asking everyone if they were OK The inspection report said there were concerns with Bridgend's Information Advice and Assistance (IAA) service and its ability to protect and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children and families. Inspectors said there were problems with recruiting and retaining staff, as well as staff absence. They said this had led to the loss of experienced staff and an ""over reliance"" on newly qualified and agency social workers. Logan's body was found 250m away from the home he shared with his family Chief inspector of CIW Gillian Baranski said she was pleased to see that some improvements had been made. She added: ""However, further urgent action must be taken to secure and sustain improvement in the care and support for children and families in Bridgend. ""This work must be prioritised to ensure the best possible outcomes for children. We will continue to liaise with the local authority's senior leaders and are closely monitoring the local authority's performance."" Logan's dinosaur pyjama top was found with a tear down one side The inspection also found records of missing children and children at risk of exploitation were not ""sufficiently detailed"" to ensure appropriate action had been taken in a timely way. Inspectors said analysis of risks such as a history of domestic abuse and exploitation needed to be strengthened, while a drop in the number of council foster carers and foster placements led to delays in providing foster carers with relevant information. The report said: ""The workforce is striving relentlessly to support children and families, however, it is clear demand is outstripping available resource."" CIW said it expected the council to address the concerns as soon as practicable and it would be closely monitoring its progress. It'll worry many that there are still serious concerns about children's services in an area where five-year-old Logan Mwangi and two-year-old Reid Steele died in the summer of 2021. Some of the problems reflected by inspectors are ones already well reported in councils across Wales during, and prior to, the Covid-19 pandemic. Recruitment and retention of employees, staff absences and high demand are well-known problems which have led to calls for an independent review of Welsh children's services. But there are additional, and significant, problems in Bridgend that aren't just a result of the pandemic. We'll have to wait to find out more about the involvement of professionals - including social workers - in Logan's life when the child practice review is published later this year. The council's cabinet member for social services Jane Gebbie said the authority would continue working closely with inspectors to make further improvements and that management oversight and decision making had improved. She added: ""We are actively recruiting new employees and are carefully redeploying existing staff to provide additional support in areas experiencing the most pressure. ""I would like to thank our children's services workforce for the commitment and dedication that they have demonstrated during the considerable challenges of the pandemic and beyond."" Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds, who worked as a child protection social worker for more than 25 years, said this report re-emphasised the need for a Wales-wide inquiry as is happening in England and Scotland. ""The report lacks context and does not tell me as a Senedd Member how Bridgend are doing in comparison to Wales as a whole and how they could be supported with good practice from other local authorities."" The Welsh Conservatives reiterated the call for a Wales-wide review of children services. Welsh Conservative spokesperson Gareth Davies MS said: ""Logan's murder was a tragedy and policy makers must focus on preventing anything like this horrific killing happen again"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan said: ""We will expect to see improvements and, of course, we are very concerned that we need to do the very best for the most vulnerable children."" She added that an independent inquiry would distract the government from its day job, of making sure that services are improved.

Slave owner picture returns in bid to reframe past,"This video can not be played Gesiye worked in collaboration with musicians, designers, filmmakers and photographers to create the work A portrait of slave owner Sir Thomas Picton has been put back on display, albeit boxed up-and alongside new artworks and information that ""reframes"" his place in history. Theportrait was removedfrom National Museum Cardiff in November following scrutiny of memorials to slave owners. The museum commissioned two artworks from Trinidadian artists to reframe his legacy and give a voice to his victims. Young people also worked with curators to provide additional context. Previously, information accompanying the portrait of Picton, who was from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire,hailed him as a hero of the Battle of Waterloo. It had not included his brutal treatment of the people of Trinidad, including thetorture of 14-year-old Luisa Calderon. Reframing Picton opens at National Museum Cardiff on 1 August One of the new artworks - an installation called The Wound is a Portal - is by multidisciplinary artist Gesiye who is from Trinidad and Tobago and has Nigerian heritage. Eight photographic portraits of Trinidadians baring tattoos and a short film adorn the walls of a dark room. Artist Gesiye drew on the ""cathartic process of tattooing to explore generational trauma"" Gesiye said she found black Trinidadians who were willing for her to tattoo them by placing adverts in newspapers and putting up flyers on all the streets in Trinidad named after Picton. ""I'm using tattooing to kind of bring people together to share this connected story, but also to create a space where we feel safe to have these conversations about things that are usually quite painful and that we might otherwise avoid talking about,"" she said. Gesiye worked in collaboration with musicians, designers, filmmakers and photographers ""My mother actually grew up on Picton Street - it is something that is very present in national consciousness"". Gesiye, who had travelled from Trinidad to see her installation at the museum, said she was struck by the size of Picton's portrait. ""It's massive, you can see the intention to make him very grandiose and to minimise some of the pain that he may have caused,"" she said. When asked what should happen to other portraits, statues and streets named after Picton and other slave owners, she said there was ""no one answer"" which applied to all. ""History is really a story that's been told by someone who had power at that time,"" she said. ""It feels very important to do it like this"". Artists Mary-Anne Roberts, Miguela Gonzalez and Adeola Dewis all have Trinidadian heritage and live in Cardiff The second newly commissioned artwork - Spirited 2022 - is described as an ancestral work that honours African traditions, inspired by the Ol' Mas' traditions of the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. Visitors make their way through a walkway of metal sculpture, bamboo frames, twisted paper, found objects and audio-visual elements. It was created by collective of four artists Laku Neg. Artist Miguela Gonzalez said: ""This is not a response to Picton himself, this is our understanding of our history and this is us filling in the gaps of a story."" She said they set out to tell the story of Luisa Calderon, the best-known of Picton's victims, as well as two other slaves - Present and Thisbe. ""We know that he pretty much tortured a 14-year-old girl for days and that was the legacy that he left for us in Trinidad,"" she said. ""That's our understanding of who he was and we know across the Atlantic that legacy is quite different."" She said Present was a slave who was caught trying to escape and hanged. ""She was a child who never had a childhood so we're trying to give her back her childhood through this art,"" she said. ""We're also representing Thisbe, who was accused of crimes and tortured in front of Luisa as a threat for Luisa to see 'if you don't confess this is what will happen to you'. ""She was tortured, after her death she was dismembered."" Spirited 2022 tells the story of three of Picton's victims She said their focus had been on Picton's victims, rather than the man himself. ""If we were to be really frank we don't have any strong opinions about what should happen to the portrait - that has its context and if you explain what it means and you give a nuanced understanding of who that man was then that's fine,"" she said. ""Everyone should understand all the different variations of history, it is not black and white."" Artist Mary-Anne Roberts added: ""This is the  beginning of conversations with all sorts of communities and remembering that the museum is a palace of the people - let's get the people into our palace."" Dr Kath Davies says the long-term future of the Picton portrait is yet to be decided The Picton portrait is one of 209 memorials in Wales to people with links to slavery,identified by a 2020 audit. The new exhibition came about after the museum called on the Sub-Sahara Advisory Panel (SSAP) to decide the future of the portrait, which had hung in the museum's Faces of Wales gallery. The group said the painting should remain on display but with added detail about Picton's actions as a slave owner. Dr Kath Davies, National Museum Wales' director of collections, said they had listened to community partners to gain different stories and different perspectives. ""There are no neat narratives to the story,"" she said. ""I think what you'll see here today is an exhibition which tries to cover all the aspects of Picton's life and Picton's activity, and I think it'll be up to the audience to make their minds up."" 'Time for decisions' on slave owner statues and street names Goldsmiths University to keep statues linked to slave trade WATCH: What do we do with statues linked to slave-traders? She said seeing the exhibition come to fruition had been joyful, adding: ""It will underpin the way that the museum works in future."" Asked about the future for the still boxed-up portrait, she said: ""Where the story goes next I think is the best question. The young people we've been working with haven't decided. ""And that's what's in some ways been so exciting or maybe challenging for this project - we've had to just take everything a step at a time and really listen, and we'll listen again about what the future of Picton will be.""

Truss: Best to ignore attention-seeking SturgeonThe Tory leadership hopeful also ruled out a second independence referendum.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Liz Truss criticised Scotland's first minister before ruling out a second independence referendum Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has claimed it is best to ignore ""attention seeker"" Nicola Sturgeon. The foreign secretary criticised Scotland's first minister before ruling out a second independence referendum. Speaking at a hustings event in Exeter, Ms Truss described herself as ""a child of the Union"", having spent some of her youth living in Paisley. Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney said her comments were ""completely and utterly unacceptable"". Talking to voters at the hustings event, Ms Truss said: ""I really believe we're a family and we're better together."" Tory party members then cheered and applauded as she said: ""I think the best thing to do with Nicola Sturgeon is ignore her. ""She's an attention seeker, that's what she is. ""What we need to do is show the people of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales what we're delivering for them and making sure that all of our government policies apply right across the United Kingdom."" Nicola Sturgeon was accused by Liz Truss of being an attention seeker Ms Truss later replied ""no, no, no"" when asked about whether she would support another independence referendum in Scotland if she becomes prime minister. Mr Swinney toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programmethat Scotland had been ""ridden roughshod over"" by the attitudes of the Conservative party over the last few years. He cited theUK Internal Market Billas an example of an ""erosion"" to democracy in Scotland. He said: ""When people are saying to us we would like our two governments to work more closely together, this comment from Liz Truss demonstrates what we are up against. ""I come across this frequently when I'm dealing with the UK government - a contempt for Scotland, a desire to belittle Scotland and not hear our voice. ""And if you don't believe me on this just listen to what Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, says - he says exactly the same thing about how Wales is treated."" This video can not be played John Swinney: ""People in Scotland, whatever their politics, will be absolutely horrified by the obnoxious remarks."" However MSP Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives said he would ignore Mr Swinney's ""manufactured outrage"" on the issue. He told the BBC that while he was not sure of the whole context of Ms Truss' remarks, he believed she was referring to Nicola Sturgeon's ""incessant and increasingly tiresome demands"" for another referendum. He said: ""Liz Truss is far more in tune on Scottish opinion on this issue than Nicola Sturgeon. I think Liz Truss is absolutely right to say this is not the time for another referendum. ""There are other priorities the Scottish government should be focussing on - not least the NHS, the appalling rate of drugs deaths, trying to rebuild our economy post-Covid."" Ms Truss and Rishi Sunak are vying to win over Conservative Party members, whose votes will determine which of them will become the next Tory leader and British prime minister. Nine Scottish Conservative MSPs, including Murdo Fraser, Rachael Hamilton, Liam Kerr and Oliver Mundell, declared their support for Liz Truss on Monday. Meanwhile eight Conservative MSPs declared their support for Rishi Sunak in a joint letter in the Telegraph on Tuesday. They are Donald Cameron, Liz Smith, Miles Briggs, Jackson Carlaw, Maurice Golden, Jeremy Balfour, Dean Lockhart and Alexander Stewart. MPs John Lamont and Andrew Bowie have also backed Mr Sunak. Welcome to the era of muscular unionism. If, as expected, Liz Truss enters 10 Downing Street, it's clear she will ditch the cautious constitutional approach of the Johnson administration which addressed the issue of a second independence referendum by simply repeating the mantra: ""now is not the time."" Ms Truss is adopting a far more robust attitude. It's not quite the ""never, never, never!"" with which Ulster's Ian Paisley denounced the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement but ""no, no, no!"" is not a million miles away from it. This is already being cheered by staunch unionists who had been longing for more robust engagement, some of whom, not coincidentally, are currently deciding whether to vote for Ms Truss or Rishi Sunak as their leader. Hours before her comments theSpectator's Stephen Daisley,external, for example, argued that the constitutional debate had become ""a one-sided war, and one that Westminster is losing."" But there is a reason this approach â and particularly sharp personal attacks â was on the whole rejected by Boris Johnson and his team. They feared that an all-out assault on Nicola Sturgeon wouldplay directly into the Scottish government's hands,externalas it would be cast as an attack not just on the first minister but on the nation which elected her. It is true that polls suggest a majority of voters in Scotland are not keen on a referendum any time soon. It is also true that last year voters in Scotland elected a majority of MSPs who had made manifesto commitments to hold another independence referendum - returning Ms Sturgeon as first minister in yet another landslide election victory in the process. There is a fine line between insulting a political opponent you dislike and dismissing the people who voted for her, including those whose support you one day, presumably, hope to win for yourself.

"Man charged under Treason Act after Windsor Castle incidentTwenty-year-old accused of intending to injure or alarm the Queen, and having an offensive weapon.","A weapon was found on the man during a search, police said A man allegedly found with a crossbow in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Christmas Day has been charged under the Treason Act. Jaswant Singh Chail, 20, has also been charged with threats to kill and possession of an offensive weapon. Mr Chail, from Southampton, is in custody and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 17 August. The charges were brought after an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. Mr Chail was arrested at about 08:30 GMT on Christmas Day. The Met said he was stopped ""within moments"" of entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings. He has been charged with an offence under section 2 of the 1842 Treason Act, namely ""discharging or aiming firearms, or throwing or using any offensive matter or weapon, with intent to injure or alarm her Majesty"", said Scotland Yard. The Queen had been staying at Windsor Castle for Christmas, rather than spending it as usual on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Her Majesty was due to be joined for lunch by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Under the 1842 Treason Act, it is an offence to assault the Queen, or have a firearm or offensive weapon in her presence with intent to injure or alarm her or to cause a breach of peace. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was jailed for five years under the section of the Treason Act after he fired blank shots at the Queen while she was riding down The Mall in London during the Trooping the Colour parade.

Pelosi - the most senior American to visit the self-ruled island in 25 years - said she had reiterated ""iron-clad"" support for Taiwan's democracy.

Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan For Taiwan this trip by Nancy Pelosi is about support, but also legitimacy. Taiwan needs America's support, military and otherwise. But it craves legitimacy. It craves recognition that this is not some ""renegade province"" as Beijing calls it, but a proud country, with its own democratic government and a determination to keep it that way. That is why a visit by the Speaker of the US House of Representatives means so much. America is what Taiwan looks up to, not China. You can see it in the excited way Pelosi's arrival here is being reported on Taiwan's many TV news channels.

their criticism of the US during the visit. In the last three days,Zhang Meifang,external,
the consul-general in Belfast, remained the most active
diplomat on Twitter, posting several tweets on Taiwan. Sheflagged up,externalForeign Minister Wang Yi's warning on 2 August that
the US ""making themselves an enemy of the 1.4 billion Chinese people
will not end up well"". The former Global Times
editor-in-chief Hu Xijinâs Twitter account had beenbriefly locked,externallast
week after he tweeted that the Chinese army had the right to shoot down
Pelosi's plane if she visited. He has now criticised the US Speaker for causing a lockdown of Taiwanâs main ports, which will be effectively blocked during Chinaâs drills. âThis
is what Pelosiâs visit has brought to Taiwan,""  he tweeted. The antagonists in the Russia-Ukraine war have
also been following the visit closely with Ukrainian commentators drawing parallels between Russia âthe bullyâ and China. Former Ukrainian Foreign MinisterPavlo Klimkin said,externalthe
USA ""showed its teeth""
and noted that the Kremlin had probably noticed this. Many Russian commentators
donât expect a major crisis to arise from the trip as they believe neither
China nor the US has the appetite to further escalate tensions. State-ownedRossiyskaya
Gazeta,externalsaid it was simply a case of both sides flexing their
muscles. A report in RussiaâsNezavisimaya
Gazeta,externalsaid Beijing may instead increase support for Russia and
North Korea. Joshua CheethamBBC News As Chinese military drills are due to get started following Pelosi's visit, what is the chance that tensions over Taiwan could spill into full-scale war? Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, believes it unlikely that war will
break out â at least for now. âThe Chinese do not as yet have the capability to take
Taiwan and to take on the Americans and be certain they would win,â says Tsang. âThe Taiwanese for obvious reasons really donât want a war.
They are not stupid. They will be the theatre of any military operations and
will be most devastated by it.â Michael OâHanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute,
a US-based think tank, agrees that open conflict is in neither side's interest. âNobody could predict where it would go,â he tells the BBC. âIt
could very easily become global, it could very easily escalate, it could very
easily involve nuclear threats. âChina is a major concern for the United States but it is
less of an acute threat to the world than Russia,â he adds. âPutin values disruption and heâs proved that heâs willing
to take huge risks in pursuit of that goal. I donât think China would pursue
that unless they had absolutely no other choice on the Taiwan matter,â O'Hanlon tells BBC News. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who's on the plane to her next destination in the region - has been tweeting about her visit to Taiwan, calling the meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen a ""privilege"". She also said it was an honour to be awarded Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai. Pelosi finished her twitter thread,externalby saying ""America remains unwavering in our commitment to the people of Taiwan - now and for decades to come"". Allow Twitter content?

on Washington to honour a deal to reduce US arms sales to Taiwan, and
says these promises have been broken. In 1982, President
Ronald Reagan agreed to a gradual reduction in military sales, butadded a condition,externalthat this would depend on ""the commitment of
China to a peaceful solution"" with Taiwan, which China considers to be a
breakaway province. No agreement was
reached on the timescale for this reduction or the form it would take. Over
the decades, the value of US arms sales to Taiwan has fluctuated widely. The
single biggest purchase was made in 1992 by former Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, following a policy to enhance Taiwanâs
independent defence capabilities. In 2007 Taiwan significantly
increased its defence budget, leading to a significant increase in
arms purchased from the US. Former US President Barack Obama (in office between 2009-2017) approved three separate arms deals, with a total value of $12bn over eight years. His
successor Donald Trump signed deals worth at least $14bn during his four years
in office. President
Joe Biden has so far signed deals worth just over $1bn. Jeremy Huai-Che Chiang - formerly a researcher at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation - has said that Nancy Pelosi was received positively by people in Taiwain, with a large crowd at the
airport. Bakeries in Taiwan were giving out free food for every hour of her visit. He told BBC News: This visit sends a strong signal that both Taiwan and the US will not be intimidated by Beijingâs increased aggression. If Speaker Pelosi had abandoned the visit it would have sent the wrong signal to Beijing, but also to other democratic allies. They would also feel that they needed to refrain from supporting Taiwan which would have led to a domino effect.  If
you're just joining us, here's the latest on top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Chinese Foreign
MinisterWang Yimade several strongly worded statements during
Pelosiâs trip to Taiwan, accusing US politicians of ""playing with
fire"". Calling the visit a âfarceâ, Wang Yi said that the US was âviolating
China's sovereignty under the guise of so-called ""democracy"". He
also accused Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen of ""clinging to the US"" and ""turning her back on national justice"". Meanwhile, White House national security spokespersonJohn Kirbysaid that the US was ""not going to be intimidated"" by China's threats or bellicose rhetoric and that there was no reason Pelosiâs visit should precipitate a conflict between the two countries. Kirby also warned that China might engage in ""economic coercion"" toward Taiwan and said that US-China relations would depend on Chinese behaviour and actions going forward. Nancy Pelosi is on her way - what happens now after the first visit by such a senior US official for decades? China is retaliating to the top Democrat's visit by holding military drills in the areas in the map below around Taiwan. The drills will begin on Thursday and last until Sunday, Beijing says. This time three of the six zones intrude into
Taiwanâs 12-mile limit and our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Taiwan says that is unprecedented. The US House Speaker's plane has taken off from Songshan airport, ending a visit of less than 24 hours to the island. She's travelling on to South Korea and Japan. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi waves as she leaves Taiwan after short visit Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Within mainland
China, there is a fierce propaganda drive today to promote the message that
there is ""only one China in the world"" amid US House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's visit. Posters with
slogans are common when the Chinese government wants to make a bold statement.
The official CCTV broadcaster has today published a poster with the
message: ""China - There is only One China in the World"" on major
social media platforms including the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Within 24 hours,
the posterhas been shared more than six million times,external, including by other
prominent media outlets with millions of followers. The hashtag
#OnlyOneChinaInTheWorld is currently trending on the platform. Read moreabout Washington's One China policy and Beijing's One China principle -they are not the same thing TV pictures are showing the US House Speaker on the tarmac at Songshan airport near Taipei. She will be continuing her visit of the region, travelling to South Korea and Japan next. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen drastically to about 15. Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has virtually all of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting about top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit, saying it sends a message to the world that ""democracies stand together"" in the face of common challenges.

Pelosi spoke with activists in a closed-door meeting at the National Human Rights Museum in New Taipei City on Wednesday afternoon. Those she met included: In an interview with Reuters before the meeting, Lam said he wanted to ask Pelosi whether the White House could help those in Taiwan who could not return to Hong Kong yet were also unable to obtain Taiwanese identity cards go to the US. Lam was one of five booksellers detained in 2015 after selling material critical of the Chinese political elite Ms Pelosi is now the most senior US elected official to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years. Inan op-ed defending the visit,externalas an act of diplomacy, she called on Americans to remember their commitment to supporting democracy in Taiwan, and around the world. At 82 years old, Ms Pelosi is one of the most powerful politicians in the United States. She was re-elected to a fourth term as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2021, making her second in line to the presidency after Vice-President Kamala Harris. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Ms Pelosi may view her trip to Taiwan as a means to burnish her political legacy, in the twilight of her long political career. Although she has not announced her retirement, a Republican win in November's mid-term elections could usher her out of power for the last time. Ending her tenure as speaker with a historic trip - setting down a marker for democracy over autocracy, as she has framed it - could be her way of exiting the stage with a flourish. Read more here She was given Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai Ing-wen The two leaders held talks She later visited Taipei's Jingmei Human Rights Cultural Park Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan It is clear now that Beijing is not going to be satisfied by
venting its anger at Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan with mere words, or even
some targeted sanctions on Taiwan companies. The announcement of six large
exclusion zones around Taiwan starting on Thursday, and lasting for four days, has
the potential to turn this into a full-scale crisis. Beijing did the same thing
back in 1996, the last time there was a so called âTaiwan Straits Crisisâ. But
then the exclusion zones were all well outside Taiwanâs territorial waters. This time three of the six zones intrude into Taiwanâs 12-mile limit. That is
unprecedented. Taiwanâs defence ministry has already called the move a breach
of UN conventions, and said it amounts to an air and sea blockade against the
island. If China were to move ships or aircraft into those areas, it would
amount and invasion of Taiwan territory. This makes the stakes much higher as Taiwan may feel compelled to defend
its own territorial waters. The US Navy is watching all of this very
closely, and already has the USS Ronald Reagan carrier battle group sailing
nearby in the Philippine Sea. In 1996 the
then US President Bill Clinton moved two carrier battle groups close to Taiwan,
to make it clear the US was ready to intervene if China attacked the island. But the military balance today is very different from 1996. China has its own
carrier battle groups, both of which are reported to be heading towards the
Taiwan Strait. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Shock in Kabul as US kills al-Qaeda leaderHow two thunderous blasts led the BBC's Lyse Doucet to Ayman al-Zawahiri's villa in the ""town of thieves"".AsiaArchie family loses Supreme Court appealSupreme Court verdict says the Court of Appeal ""made the correct decision"" over the 12-year-old's care.Essex","This is the suspected location of the strike in Kabul - green plastic sheeting has been draped over the balconies The first signs of an operation that was months in the making erupted when an attack rocked the centre of Kabul in the early hours of Sunday morning: we heard two thunderous blasts on our street nearby. Speculation swirled around who or what had hit this ""empty house"" in Sherpur. It is a neighbourhood which became notorious over the past two decades for its garish multi-storey villas, mocked by Kabul residents as the stronghold of corrupt warlords and officials, a gaudy symbol of the spoils of an ugly war. Kabulis called it Choorpur, the town of thieves. The Taliban took over some of the empty villas, close to some high-walled Western embassies, which also slammed shut when the Taliban took charge. With every day, new pieces of this puzzle surfaced: of a possible strike on an Islamic State target; the use of a US drone which raised even more questions; the involvement of US forces on the ground. The mystery ended early on Tuesday morning. As Kabul woke to the news thatthe US had killed the leader of al-Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a drone strike, we tried to approach the area on a main road leading into the street threading past Spinney's luxury supermarket and the Afghan Ghazanfar bank. A single Taliban guard angrily crossed his arms to warn us away. From a side street, we reached the back of the villa on foot. Guards and workers in adjacent buildings confirmed which house had been hit on Sunday; balconies protruding from the top floor were now covered with green plastic sheeting. Had anyone seen any activity, any residents, at this place? ""The house was empty,"" was the refrain. Was this a reply rehearsed in advance, an echo of the Taliban's official statement? Owners of nearby buildings told us they had been ordered, hours earlier, to shut their rooftops to everyone, even their own workers. As news of Zawahiri's killing shot like an electric current through social media, the scene of this explosive moment seemed strangely quiet. Traffic flowed on surrounding tree-lined streets on this warm summer's day. But as minutes ticked by, more journalists arrived, more passers-by stopped, more Taliban guards showed up. ""If you don't listen to me, I'll speak to you through my gun,"" one armed Talib warned a colleague as we stood on the main street. A group of Afghan and foreign journalists approached us, one journalist in tears after an angry altercation on the main road which led to the front of the house. Her equipment had been forcefully taken away. It was then returned. Now what had only been whispers grew louder. There was talk that Arabs had been seen, in recent months, moving through these streets. No one dared speak much about it. A local journalist living nearby told us: ""We've seen non-Afghan residents in this neighbourhood in the past couple of months. They don't speak the local languages. We don't know who they are."" Now there are many questions, conspiracies and a range of possible consequences. The death of Ayman al-Zawahiri, a top target on America's wanted list, had been reported many times before including last year when he was said to have died of illness. Zawahiri was al-Qaeda's most prominent spokesman and ideologue If he was alive, he was said be a recluse in the rugged terrain along Afghan-Pakistan border. But now it emerges that he was a guest of the Taliban leadership, living in that villa smack in the centre of Kabul and said to belong to Sirajuddin Haqqani, the acting Taliban interior minister, who is under US terrorism sanctions. PROFILE:Who was Ayman al-Zawahiri? BACKGROUND:Al-Qaeda leader killed in US drone strike There is an echo of the 2011 US killing of Zawahiri's brother-in-arms, Osama Bin Laden, who had been hiding in plain sight in a villa in the Pakistan city of Abbottabad, down the street from a Pakistani military academy. There is an echo too of the Taliban's rejoinder to the US after the 9/11 attacks that Bin Laden had only been their honoured guest, in Afghan Pashtun tradition. The 2020 US-Taliban deal, signed after nearly two years of tortuous negotiations in the Gulf state of Qatar, was meant to sort out this crucial question. During the talks, we were repeatedly told that the Taliban commitment not to allow Afghanistan to be a safe haven again would be spelled out clearly, in black and white. But the deal which emerged, with secret annexes, was not so clearcut. The Taliban vowed to prevent any attacks on US soil from their territory. But they never explicitly agreed to sever ties with their fellow jihadis including Zawahiri who, like other al-Qaeda leaders, had sworn allegiance to the Taliban leader, or emir, Haibatullah Akhundzada. Since the Taliban swept into Kabul on 15 August last year, there have been repeated and credible reports of al-Qaeda fighters crossing the Pakistan border into Afghanistan but there have also been repeated Taliban pledges to fight against terrorism. The Taliban also accuse the US of violating their deal in their attack against a residential neighbourhood of Kabul. A statement from a Taliban spokesman warned that ""repeating such actions will damage the existing opportunities"". This watershed moment comes at a time when the Taliban, one year after seizing power, are still struggling to establish international legitimacy and recognition. They may not wish to endanger any fragile progress. The US and other Western powers have also been trapped in a bind: how do they help the people of Afghanistan, mired in a deepening humanitarian crisis, when many Taliban leaders are still under US terrorism sanctions? American interests in this region also include the fight against extremist groups like Islamic State, an enemy they share with the Taliban The Taliban have been walking a political high wire ever since they took charge in Kabul. How do they maintain their standing in the global jihadi community, including their long-standing relations with al-Qaeda? Social media is now buzzing with accusations of another US war crime with another alleged extrajudicial killing. How do they complete their transformation from an insurgency to an internationally respected government but still keep their ultra-conservative credentials? That high wire is now wobbling.

"Snorkeler suffers 'suspected shark bite'The ""extremely rare"" incident is believed to have involved a blue shark off the coast of Cornwall.Cornwall","The company said it offered ""the chance to have up close and interactive encounters with blue sharks in their natural environment"" A snorkeler has suffered a leg injury after reportedly being bitten by a blue shark off the coast of Cornwall. The incident is believed to have happened during an organised trip at lunchtime on Thursday 28 July. A Maritime Coastguard Agency spokesperson said a coastguard team went to Penzance Harbour to pass the casualty into the care of an ambulance. Blue Shark Snorkel, the company that organised the tour, said such incidents were ""extremely rare"". The casualty was handed over to an ambulance crew at Penzance Harbour It reported that the person injured had found it ""very scary"" and had ""thanked everyone for their amazing actions"" to get them quickly and calmly back to shore. On its Facebook page Blue Shark Snorkel said: ""As we know, these things can happen when we choose to interact with wild animals in their own environment."" On its website, the company said it offered ""the chance to have up close and interactive encounters with blue sharks in their natural environment"". The statement added: ""We immediately enacted our emergency response plan, with first aid being carried out on the person involved. ""Following advice and assessment from the coastguard, the person walked off the boat and received further treatment ashore."" An MCA spokesperson said: ""HM Coastguard sent Penzance Coastguard Rescue Team to meet a snorkeler who suffered a suspected shark bite... It is believed the swimmer suffered a leg injury. ""The coastguard team met the casualty at Penzance harbour to assist with passing them into the care of the ambulance service."" The snorkelling company said it was ""trying to understand why it happened and were in continued talks with shark experts"". The firm also shared a statement from the victim, who said: ""I don't for a second want this freak event to tarnish the reputation of an already persecuted species. ""We all take these risks when we enter the habitat of a predator and we can never completely predict the reactions of a wild animal."" Blue sharks visit the UK during the summer months from the Caribbean, and are known to mainly feed on small fish and squid, but have been known to attack seabirds and other small sharks, according to the Wildlife Trusts. UK-based charity the Shark Trust says there have been no ""unprovoked"" shark bites in British waters since 1847, when records began.

"16,000 firms go bust owing millions in Covid loansWhile most went broke for legitimate reasons, 260 directors have been disqualified for misuse of money.Business","A total of 1.5 million bounce back loans were granted during the pandemic More than 16,000 businesses which took out a type of government-backed Covid loan have gone bust without paying the money back, the BBC has found. Hundreds of directors, who got loans they were not entitled to, have also been disqualified. The cost to the taxpayer of these insolvencies could be as much as Â£500m, and is likely to grow as more companies go under. Questions are now being asked about what is being done to recoup the money. The figures, obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request, have been described as ""shocking"" by a former head of the Serious Fraud Office. Sir David Green QC describes checks the government required banks to do on bounce back loan applicants as ""hopelessly inadequate"". Sir David Green QC says checks carried out on bounce back loan applicants were ""hopelessly inadequate"" A total of 1.5 million loans worth Â£47bn were handed out. One of several measures designed to help businesses survive the pandemic, the loans were supposed to be paid back within 10 years. But in the rush to save the economy, checks on borrowers were limited. Under the scheme any small company could apply for a loan of up to Â£50,000 depending on its turnover. Applicants were allowed to ""self-certify"" the figures. ""You wouldn't send an army into battle without assessing the risks. And just the same in this situation, the risks, which were obvious, should have been assessed and addressed,"" said Sir David, who is now chairman of the Fraud Advisory Panel. He believes bounce back loan money must be recovered wherever possible. The government has said it will ""not tolerate"" people defrauding taxpayers. The BBC has been investigating what will happen to the hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer money given to companies which have since become insolvent. The majority of those businesses went bust for legitimate reasons, however there is increasing evidence that a proportion of bounce back loans were misused. The BBC has discovered that hundreds of company directors have so far been disqualified from running businesses. And many of those companies were not eligible to receive the loans in the first place. Previousresearch shows,externalthat 45% of successful applicants to two banks showed no evidence of trading at the relevant period. With festivals cancelled, Peter Ferguson's events companies struggled during the pandemic. And so he turned to the government's bounce back loan scheme. Mr Ferguson took out a Â£50,000 loan through a dormant company called Beautiful Digital Events Ltd. He gave a turnover figure which overstated the true amount and used the money to buy himself two cars. Peter Ferguson took out a Â£50,000 bounce back loan through a dormant company Mr Ferguson has since been censured by the Insolvency Service and banned from being a company director for six years. But another of his companies is putting on one of Scotland's biggest festivals, Party at the Palace, on 13 and 14 August. Mr Ferguson is no longer allowed to be a director, but is listed as a ""person with significant control"" and promotes the festival line-up on his Facebook page. And, earlier this year, on holiday in Las Vegas, Mr Ferguson won more than Â£200,000 playing poker. The terms of the bounce back loan state that the dormant company is liable to pay it back, not him personally - and that company has now been dissolved. Mr Ferguson responded in a statement: ""With the in-person events industry in Scotland wiped out overnight, I sought a loan to move into the digital events space. ""Despite our best efforts and much to my deep sorrow, this service failed. I was advised to liquidate the company, having been willing to repay the loan up to that point."" He has confirmed that he took out a total of five bounce back loans, including the one for Beautiful Digital Events. As for the four others, he said ""one has already been paid back in full and a payment has not been missed on the others"". Scrolling through the website of the Insolvency Service, we found scores of company directors who took out loans with, it seems, little or no prospect of being able to repay them. In fact, a request under the Freedom of Information Act reveals that so far 260 directors have been disqualified with their companies still owing a bounce back loan. The loans were spent on everything from gambling debts and cryptocurrency schemes - to cars, house renovations, even flying lessons. The rules state that if there's no money left in the business the loan can't be paid back. So it's not clear how much the government will eventually be able to recover. Several agencies have been tasked by the government with investigating Covid loans and getting back the money. The Insolvency Service has brought only one prosecution to date but claims it has another 30 cases pending. Its website is updated almost daily with new examples of directors being banned from running a business after obtaining bounce back loans they weren't entitled to. The maximum ban lasts 15 years. But the service has no record of how much money has been recovered because each case is handled separately by a private insolvency practitioner. The government has also asked the National Investigation Service (Natis) - a law enforcement organisation which usually investigates local authority corruption - to look into the scheme. The latest figures show Natis, which has a Â£6m budget, made 49 arrests and recovered just Â£4.1m. It has identified 673 suspects of whom 559 used the bounce back loan scheme. It's now thoughtÂ£17bn could be lost,externalto fraud, mistakes and companies going under. Sir David Green QC from the Fraud Advisory Panel believes organised criminal groups have had a field day. ""Fraud is opportunistic and organised crime groups are experts at that opportunism."" But he thinks with limited resources, police should target the worst offenders, while company directors who did not play by the rules should be pursued through the civil courts. ""It's important to concentrate on those areas where you get most bang for your buck, and that, I would suggest, is in relation to the most egregious organised frauds rather than individuals,"" he said. Raitis Dzerkalis claimed a Â£40,000 bounce back loan he wasn't entitled to Raitis Dzerkalis had a car repair company in the West Midlands. He claimed a Â£40,000 bounce back loan - he wasn't entitled to it. The Insolvency Service said he exaggerated turnover and didn't spend the money on the business. The company became insolvent and, like Peter Ferguson, he was banned from being a director - in this case for 10 years. But Mr Dzerkalis has another company, which he transferred into the name of a housemate. Now Mr Dzerkalis seems to work as a part-time DJ. We caught up with him at home in Coventry but he didn't want to talk. So we have no idea if he has attempted to pay any of the loan back. Business Minister Lord Callanan said in a statement that ""tough new powers"" had been introduced allowing the Insolvency Service to disqualify directors for dissolving companies to avoid repaying bounce back loans.

Uber drivers at record high as people seek more cash,"The number of people driving for Uber has hit an all time high, as concerns about the rising cost of living push people to find new ways to make money. Almost 5 million people are now picking up passengers or making food deliveries for the company, 31% more than last year, boss Dara Khosrowshahi said. Uber has been struggling with a driver shortage since the pandemic, leading to longer waiting times for customers. High petrol prices also make it harder to earn money on the platform. But Mr Khosrowshahi said interest in driving for the company was accelerating despite those costs. ""That's right: more people are earning on Uber today than before the pandemic,"" he said in prepared remarks for investors to discuss the firm's financial performance. ""Against the backdrop of elevated gas prices globally, this is a resounding endorsement of the value drivers continue to see in Uber."" Uber has  been criticised for the treatment of its drivers. In the UK, the Supreme Court ruled last year that the company must count them as workers. But in many countries, including key markets such as the US, Uber classifies drivers as self-employed contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits such as minimum wage or holiday pay. Uber has said drivers value the flexibility to choose their own schedules. But it has also responded to concerns, for example introducing a fuel surcharge that customers pay to help offset driver costs. It also recently unveiled other changes, including allowing drivers to see how much they will make before agreeing to take a ride, aimed at making their platform more appealing to drivers. ""Rather than relying solely on financial incentives, our goal has been to improve drivers' overall experience,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. Higher demand, which had plunged when the pandemic hit in 2020, is also helping to attract drivers back. Uber said there were 1.87 billion trips on the platform in the April-June period - an average of roughly 21 million per day - up 24% from last year, and 12% more than were taken in 2019 before the pandemic hit. The rise in demand helped push gross bookings up 33% to $29.1bn (Â£24bn) Revenue more than doubled to $8.1bn, though some of that was due to a change to how the company accounts for its UK business. Despite the gains, the company lost $2.6bn. It said more than half of that was due to a decline in the value of its stakes in overseas companies such as Zomato, Grab and Aurora. Uber shares jumped more than 13% after the better than expected results. The numbers suggest a path for Uber to become profitable, despite inflationary pressures and lingering driver shortages in some cities, said Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""In a nutshell, despite rising ride share prices throughout the US/Europe clearly consumers are still moving to the Uber platform especially as travel, shifting to the office, and other post pandemic trends take hold globally with Uber poised to benefit into 2023,"" he said.

"16,000 firms go bust owing millions in Covid loansWhile most went broke for legitimate reasons, 260 directors have been disqualified for misuse of money.","A total of 1.5 million bounce back loans were granted during the pandemic More than 16,000 businesses which took out a type of government-backed Covid loan have gone bust without paying the money back, the BBC has found. Hundreds of directors, who got loans they were not entitled to, have also been disqualified. The cost to the taxpayer of these insolvencies could be as much as Â£500m, and is likely to grow as more companies go under. Questions are now being asked about what is being done to recoup the money. The figures, obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request, have been described as ""shocking"" by a former head of the Serious Fraud Office. Sir David Green QC describes checks the government required banks to do on bounce back loan applicants as ""hopelessly inadequate"". Sir David Green QC says checks carried out on bounce back loan applicants were ""hopelessly inadequate"" A total of 1.5 million loans worth Â£47bn were handed out. One of several measures designed to help businesses survive the pandemic, the loans were supposed to be paid back within 10 years. But in the rush to save the economy, checks on borrowers were limited. Under the scheme any small company could apply for a loan of up to Â£50,000 depending on its turnover. Applicants were allowed to ""self-certify"" the figures. ""You wouldn't send an army into battle without assessing the risks. And just the same in this situation, the risks, which were obvious, should have been assessed and addressed,"" said Sir David, who is now chairman of the Fraud Advisory Panel. He believes bounce back loan money must be recovered wherever possible. The government has said it will ""not tolerate"" people defrauding taxpayers. The BBC has been investigating what will happen to the hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer money given to companies which have since become insolvent. The majority of those businesses went bust for legitimate reasons, however there is increasing evidence that a proportion of bounce back loans were misused. The BBC has discovered that hundreds of company directors have so far been disqualified from running businesses. And many of those companies were not eligible to receive the loans in the first place. Previousresearch shows,externalthat 45% of successful applicants to two banks showed no evidence of trading at the relevant period. With festivals cancelled, Peter Ferguson's events companies struggled during the pandemic. And so he turned to the government's bounce back loan scheme.

House prices climb 11% despite squeeze,"House prices are continuing to rise despite the growing cost of living crisis. The Nationwide said prices climbed 11% in the last 12 months, although the rise over the last month was just 0.1%. ""The housing market has retained a surprising degree of momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. But he said that there were ""tentative signs of a slowdown in activity"". The July figure was slightly ahead of June's annual rise of 10.7% and left the average house at Â£271,209. ""Demand continues to be supported by strong labour market conditions, where the unemployment rate remains near 50-year lows and with the number of job vacancies close to record highs,"" said Mr Gardner. ""At the same time, the limited stock of homes on the market has helped keep upward pressure on house prices."" The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates by as much as 0.5% on Thursday when and that could ""exert a cooling impact on the market"" he said. ""We continue to expect the market to slow as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set to reach double digits towards the end of the year."" Five charts that explain the cost of living crisis UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices First-timer buyer mortgage completions remain around 5% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Nationwide, despite the rising affordability pressures caused by the cost of living squeeze. ""First-time buyer numbers remain strong but that is likely to reflect significant financial input from the Bank of Mum and Dad, as deposit levels rise along with house prices and interest rates,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. Borrowers remained extremely keen to secure a fixed-rate mortgage before rates go up again, as they are expected to later this week, he said. ""Minds are focused on getting deals done before the cost of borrowing inevitably rises further still."" ""Today's market is being fuelled by people's desperation to find a home before interest rates rise further and the cost of living crisis bites deeper,"" said Nicholas Finn, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. Thursday's expected bank rate rise to 1.75% will have a ""dampening effect on the market,"" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest. She predicted the effects of soaring inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze will ""add more pressure on the property sector"". ""There are a barrage of challenges to come - from the surge in energy prices in October, to runaway inflation continuing to outstrip wage growth - and the pressure on household finances will intensify."" Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said rises in mortgage rates will cause buyer demand to cool further. ""The rate for a two-year 75% loan-to-value fixed-rate mortgage already has increased to 2.88% in June from 1.57% in December - the fastest six-monthly increase since at least 1995,"" she said. That could rise to about 3.1% by the end of the year if the Bank of England increased rates in line with current market expectations, she added. If the recession many are predicting sees unemployment rise sharply, the property market will invariably take a hit, said Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco. ""Even then, though, the impact on prices will be limited due to the abject lack of supply and homes being built.""

Pelosi - the most senior American to visit the self-ruled island in 25 years - said she had reiterated ""iron-clad"" support for Taiwan's democracy. China, which claims the island as its territory, responded to the visit by announcing three days of live-fire exercises around its coast, starting on Thursday. You can read our full news story about Pelosi's visithere. We are now finishing our live coverage - thank you for following along. Wednesday's live page was edited in Singapore and London by Thomas Spender and Claudia Allen and written by Jack Burgess, Laura Gozzi, Aoife Walsh, Frances Mao and Melissa Zhu. Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan For Taiwan this trip by Nancy Pelosi is about support, but also legitimacy. Taiwan needs America's support, military and otherwise. But it craves legitimacy. It craves recognition that this is not some ""renegade province"" as Beijing calls it, but a proud country, with its own democratic government and a determination to keep it that way. That is why a visit by the Speaker of the US House of Representatives means so much. America is what Taiwan looks up to, not China. You can see it in the excited way Pelosi's arrival here is being reported on Taiwan's many TV news channels. They have been studying everything from the colour of her outfits to the height of her heels - very high for an 82-year-old, apparently - and the fact that she ""looked like Audrey Hepburn in that photo of her with President John F. Kennedy back in 1961"". Read morehere. BBC Monitoring Several journalists and commentators in China
have been tweeting their condemnation of Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan. Chinaâs diplomats also used social media to sharpen
their criticism of the US during the visit. In the last three days,Zhang Meifang,external,
the consul-general in Belfast, remained the most active
diplomat on Twitter, posting several tweets on Taiwan. Sheflagged up,externalForeign Minister Wang Yi's warning on 2 August that
the US ""making themselves an enemy of the 1.4 billion Chinese people
will not end up well"". The former Global Times
editor-in-chief Hu Xijinâs Twitter account had beenbriefly locked,externallast
week after he tweeted that the Chinese army had the right to shoot down
Pelosi's plane if she visited. He has now criticised the US Speaker for causing a lockdown of Taiwanâs main ports, which will be effectively blocked during Chinaâs drills. âThis
is what Pelosiâs visit has brought to Taiwan,""  he tweeted. The antagonists in the Russia-Ukraine war have
also been following the visit closely with Ukrainian commentators drawing parallels between Russia âthe bullyâ and China. Former Ukrainian Foreign MinisterPavlo Klimkin said,externalthe
USA ""showed its teeth""
and noted that the Kremlin had probably noticed this. Many Russian commentators
donât expect a major crisis to arise from the trip as they believe neither
China nor the US has the appetite to further escalate tensions. State-ownedRossiyskaya
Gazeta,externalsaid it was simply a case of both sides flexing their
muscles. A report in RussiaâsNezavisimaya
Gazeta,externalsaid Beijing may instead increase support for Russia and
North Korea. Joshua CheethamBBC News As Chinese military drills are due to get started following Pelosi's visit, what is the chance that tensions over Taiwan could spill into full-scale war? Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, believes it unlikely that war will
break out â at least for now. âThe Chinese do not as yet have the capability to take
Taiwan and to take on the Americans and be certain they would win,â says Tsang. âThe Taiwanese for obvious reasons really donât want a war.
They are not stupid. They will be the theatre of any military operations and
will be most devastated by it.â Michael OâHanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute,
a US-based think tank, agrees that open conflict is in neither side's interest. âNobody could predict where it would go,â he tells the BBC. âIt
could very easily become global, it could very easily escalate, it could very
easily involve nuclear threats. âChina is a major concern for the United States but it is
less of an acute threat to the world than Russia,â he adds. âPutin values disruption and heâs proved that heâs willing
to take huge risks in pursuit of that goal. I donât think China would pursue
that unless they had absolutely no other choice on the Taiwan matter,â O'Hanlon tells BBC News. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who's on the plane to her next destination in the region - has been tweeting about her visit to Taiwan, calling the meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen a ""privilege"". She also said it was an honour to be awarded Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai. Pelosi finished her twitter thread,externalby saying ""America remains unwavering in our commitment to the people of Taiwan - now and for decades to come"". Allow Twitter content?

on Washington to honour a deal to reduce US arms sales to Taiwan, and
says these promises have been broken. In 1982, President
Ronald Reagan agreed to a gradual reduction in military sales, butadded a condition,externalthat this would depend on ""the commitment of
China to a peaceful solution"" with Taiwan, which China considers to be a
breakaway province. No agreement was
reached on the timescale for this reduction or the form it would take. Over
the decades, the value of US arms sales to Taiwan has fluctuated widely. The
single biggest purchase was made in 1992 by former Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, following a policy to enhance Taiwanâs
independent defence capabilities. In 2007 Taiwan significantly
increased its defence budget, leading to a significant increase in
arms purchased from the US. Former US President Barack Obama (in office between 2009-2017) approved three separate arms deals, with a total value of $12bn over eight years. His
successor Donald Trump signed deals worth at least $14bn during his four years
in office. President
Joe Biden has so far signed deals worth just over $1bn. Jeremy Huai-Che Chiang - formerly a researcher at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation - has said that Nancy Pelosi was received positively by people in Taiwain, with a large crowd at the
airport. Bakeries in Taiwan were giving out free food for every hour of her visit. He told BBC News: This visit sends a strong signal that both Taiwan and the US will not be intimidated by Beijingâs increased aggression. If Speaker Pelosi had abandoned the visit it would have sent the wrong signal to Beijing, but also to other democratic allies. They would also feel that they needed to refrain from supporting Taiwan which would have led to a domino effect.  If
you're just joining us, here's the latest on top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Chinese Foreign
MinisterWang Yimade several strongly worded statements during
Pelosiâs trip to Taiwan, accusing US politicians of ""playing with
fire"". Calling the visit a âfarceâ, Wang Yi said that the US was âviolating
China's sovereignty under the guise of so-called ""democracy"". He
also accused Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen of ""clinging to the US"" and ""turning her back on national justice"". Meanwhile, White House national security spokespersonJohn Kirbysaid that the US was ""not going to be intimidated"" by China's threats or bellicose rhetoric and that there was no reason Pelosiâs visit should precipitate a conflict between the two countries. Kirby also warned that China might engage in ""economic coercion"" toward Taiwan and said that US-China relations would depend on Chinese behaviour and actions going forward. Nancy Pelosi is on her way - what happens now after the first visit by such a senior US official for decades? China is retaliating to the top Democrat's visit by holding military drills in the areas in the map below around Taiwan. The drills will begin on Thursday and last until Sunday, Beijing says. This time three of the six zones intrude into
Taiwanâs 12-mile limit and our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Taiwan says that is unprecedented. The US House Speaker's plane has taken off from Songshan airport, ending a visit of less than 24 hours to the island. She's travelling on to South Korea and Japan. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi waves as she leaves Taiwan after short visit Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Within mainland
China, there is a fierce propaganda drive today to promote the message that
there is ""only one China in the world"" amid US House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's visit. Posters with
slogans are common when the Chinese government wants to make a bold statement.
The official CCTV broadcaster has today published a poster with the
message: ""China - There is only One China in the World"" on major
social media platforms including the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Within 24 hours,
the posterhas been shared more than six million times,external, including by other
prominent media outlets with millions of followers. The hashtag
#OnlyOneChinaInTheWorld is currently trending on the platform. Read moreabout Washington's One China policy and Beijing's One China principle -they are not the same thing TV pictures are showing the US House Speaker on the tarmac at Songshan airport near Taipei. She will be continuing her visit of the region, travelling to South Korea and Japan next. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen drastically to about 15. Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has virtually all of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting about top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit, saying it sends a message to the world that ""democracies stand together"" in the face of common challenges.

Pelosi spoke with activists in a closed-door meeting at the National Human Rights Museum in New Taipei City on Wednesday afternoon. Those she met included: In an interview with Reuters before the meeting, Lam said he wanted to ask Pelosi whether the White House could help those in Taiwan who could not return to Hong Kong yet were also unable to obtain Taiwanese identity cards go to the US. Lam was one of five booksellers detained in 2015 after selling material critical of the Chinese political elite Ms Pelosi is now the most senior US elected official to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years. Inan op-ed defending the visit,externalas an act of diplomacy, she called on Americans to remember their commitment to supporting democracy in Taiwan, and around the world. At 82 years old, Ms Pelosi is one of the most powerful politicians in the United States. She was re-elected to a fourth term as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2021, making her second in line to the presidency after Vice-President Kamala Harris. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Ms Pelosi may view her trip to Taiwan as a means to burnish her political legacy, in the twilight of her long political career. Although she has not announced her retirement, a Republican win in November's mid-term elections could usher her out of power for the last time. Ending her tenure as speaker with a historic trip - setting down a marker for democracy over autocracy, as she has framed it - could be her way of exiting the stage with a flourish. Read more here She was given Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai Ing-wen The two leaders held talks She later visited Taipei's Jingmei Human Rights Cultural Park Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan It is clear now that Beijing is not going to be satisfied by
venting its anger at Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan with mere words, or even
some targeted sanctions on Taiwan companies. The announcement of six large
exclusion zones around Taiwan starting on Thursday, and lasting for four days, has
the potential to turn this into a full-scale crisis. Beijing did the same thing
back in 1996, the last time there was a so called âTaiwan Straits Crisisâ. But
then the exclusion zones were all well outside Taiwanâs territorial waters. This time three of the six zones intrude into Taiwanâs 12-mile limit. That is
unprecedented. Taiwanâs defence ministry has already called the move a breach
of UN conventions, and said it amounts to an air and sea blockade against the
island. If China were to move ships or aircraft into those areas, it would
amount and invasion of Taiwan territory. This makes the stakes much higher as Taiwan may feel compelled to defend
its own territorial waters. The US Navy is watching all of this very
closely, and already has the USS Ronald Reagan carrier battle group sailing
nearby in the Philippine Sea. In 1996 the
then US President Bill Clinton moved two carrier battle groups close to Taiwan,
to make it clear the US was ready to intervene if China attacked the island. But the military balance today is very different from 1996. China has its own
carrier battle groups, both of which are reported to be heading towards the
Taiwan Strait. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soarThe firm's profits between April and June more than tripled as oil and gas prices jumped.BusinessComments,"BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year. It comes as typical household energy bills have been forecast tohit more than Â£3,600 a yearthis winter. The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills. BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history. It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies andBritish Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices. Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies. ""Clearly there are exceptional windfall profits in the oil and gas sector, and clearly there's a problem in the energy market, and we should fix one with the other,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Campaign groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats also called for a tougher windfall tax on oil and gas firm profits. Professor Nick Butler, a former vice president of BP, said he believed the energy giant was ""very sensitive to the reputational problems of making money at this level"". He told the BBC there was a ""real case"" for the government calling together the industry ""to find a plan to get us through the winter"". ""You have Europe as a whole now cutting back gas use by 15% immediately, which is not happening here, and actually going out around the world to secure as much of the supply as they possibly can through the winter,"" he said. The government has introduced a package of measures to help people with energy bills, such as a Â£400 discount, and following political pressure, ministersannounced in Maythat oil and gas firms would pay anextra 25% on profits made in the UK. The tax applies from 26 May to profit made in the UK, which for most oil and gas companies is a small part of their operations. For BP, it accounts for a tenth of overall oil and gas production. BP will therefore not be required to pay the levy on the majority of the profits it made between April and June. The Treasury said it did not comment on ""individual taxpayers"", but added it expected the windfall tax, called the Energy Profits Levy, to raise about Â£5bn in its first year. Critics of a windfall tax argue it might hit pension funds invested in energy firms. However, pension funds are invested across different countries and industries, so a tax in one sector is unlikely to make a noticeable difference. The huge increase in profits for firms has been fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. Higher oil prices have also led to the price of petrol and diesel reaching record highs at the pumps in recent months,although prices have started to fall slightly. How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, told the BBC's Today programme that energy bills ""at this point in time"" looked set to stay high across 2023 and into 2024 and warned higher bills was ""a long-term problem for households."" He said current government help would make a ""dent"" in higher bills but was ""not going to offset this."" BP said its bumper profit results were driven by strong refining margins and oil trading. It announced it would boost shareholder payouts by 10% as well as buy back shares as a result of its higher earnings. Last year, chief executive Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"". But on Tuesday he said the company's staff had helped to solve an ""energy trilemma"" which he added was ""secure, affordable and lower carbon energy"". In a conference call he added: ""In terms of cost of living we all have to recognise that it's a very, very difficult place for people, not just, by the way, in the UK but across of the world right now. ""We understand that, we get it. Our people inside the company get it, they want to help."" Mr Looney said BP was ""backing Britain"" by investing Â£18bn in the country this decade. The company said its half-year figures were affected by a massive Â£19.9bn hit from its move to ditch the its near-20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war. Richard Hunter, head of markets at online investment firm Interactive Investor, said BP had ""already made some strong progress"" in recouping the financial pain of its Russian exit, adding BP's latest results were an ""early indication of the company's ability to repair such damage"". The contrast is stark but inevitable. The same high oil and gas prices emptying the pockets of consumers are filling those of the companies that sell it. BP's profit from April to June was triple the amount than last year and is the second highest in the company's long history. The company said it would increase its payments to shareholders by Â£3.6bn in the next three months. Those shareholders include most pension funds but these numbers sit uncomfortably alongside new estimates that average annual energy bills will cost over Â£3,600 a year. Insiders at BP and Shell, which announced record results last week, point out that a couple of years ago, both companies were losing billions and no-one was offering to subsidise their losses. Both companies have profited from soaring internationally-set oil and gas prices as a rise in post-Covid global demand has been exacerbated by attempts to cut Russia out of the international energy market.

BP sees biggest profit in 14 years as bills soarThe firm's profits between April and June more than tripled as oil and gas prices jumped.,"BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year. It comes as typical household energy bills have been forecast tohit more than Â£3,600 a yearthis winter. The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills. BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history. It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies andBritish Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices. Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies. ""Clearly there are exceptional windfall profits in the oil and gas sector, and clearly there's a problem in the energy market, and we should fix one with the other,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Campaign groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats also called for a tougher windfall tax on oil and gas firm profits. Professor Nick Butler, a former vice president of BP, said he believed the energy giant was ""very sensitive to the reputational problems of making money at this level"". He told the BBC there was a ""real case"" for the government calling together the industry ""to find a plan to get us through the winter"". ""You have Europe as a whole now cutting back gas use by 15% immediately, which is not happening here, and actually going out around the world to secure as much of the supply as they possibly can through the winter,"" he said.

LiveLivePelosi visits Taiwan in defiance of Chinese warningsLess than a minute ago,"Top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi leaves Taiwan after meeting its President Tsai Ing-wen, despite warnings from China not to do so She praised Taiwan as an island of resilience and said the US commitment to democracy there was iron-clad China says it will hold a series of live-fire military drills in the air and sea around the island from Thursday Taiwan says the move violates the island's sovereignty and amounts to a blockade The US speaker's trip, which was not backed by President Biden, was the first by such a senior US official in 25 years Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan - which lies 100 miles from the Chinese mainland - as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control Edited by Claudia Allen and Tom Spender The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has left Taiwan after a high-profile visit that infuriated China. Pelosi - the most senior American to visit the self-ruled island in 25 years - said she had reiterated ""iron-clad"" support for Taiwan's democracy. China, which claims the island as its territory, responded to the visit by announcing three days of live-fire exercises around its coast, starting on Thursday. You can read our full news story about Pelosi's visithere. We are now finishing our live coverage - thank you for following along. Wednesday's live page was edited in Singapore and London by Thomas Spender and Claudia Allen and written by Jack Burgess, Laura Gozzi, Aoife Walsh, Frances Mao and Melissa Zhu. Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan For Taiwan this trip by Nancy Pelosi is about support, but also legitimacy. Taiwan needs America's support, military and otherwise. But it craves legitimacy. It craves recognition that this is not some ""renegade province"" as Beijing calls it, but a proud country, with its own democratic government and a determination to keep it that way. That is why a visit by the Speaker of the US House of Representatives means so much. America is what Taiwan looks up to, not China. You can see it in the excited way Pelosi's arrival here is being reported on Taiwan's many TV news channels. They have been studying everything from the colour of her outfits to the height of her heels - very high for an 82-year-old, apparently - and the fact that she ""looked like Audrey Hepburn in that photo of her with President John F. Kennedy back in 1961"". Read morehere. BBC Monitoring Several journalists and commentators in China
have been tweeting their condemnation of Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan. Chinaâs diplomats also used social media to sharpen
their criticism of the US during the visit. In the last three days,Zhang Meifang,external,
the consul-general in Belfast, remained the most active
diplomat on Twitter, posting several tweets on Taiwan. Sheflagged up,externalForeign Minister Wang Yi's warning on 2 August that
the US ""making themselves an enemy of the 1.4 billion Chinese people
will not end up well"". The former Global Times
editor-in-chief Hu Xijinâs Twitter account had beenbriefly locked,externallast
week after he tweeted that the Chinese army had the right to shoot down
Pelosi's plane if she visited. He has now criticised the US Speaker for causing a lockdown of Taiwanâs main ports, which will be effectively blocked during Chinaâs drills. âThis
is what Pelosiâs visit has brought to Taiwan,""  he tweeted. The antagonists in the Russia-Ukraine war have
also been following the visit closely with Ukrainian commentators drawing parallels between Russia âthe bullyâ and China. Former Ukrainian Foreign MinisterPavlo Klimkin said,externalthe
USA ""showed its teeth""
and noted that the Kremlin had probably noticed this. Many Russian commentators
donât expect a major crisis to arise from the trip as they believe neither
China nor the US has the appetite to further escalate tensions. State-ownedRossiyskaya
Gazeta,externalsaid it was simply a case of both sides flexing their
muscles. A report in RussiaâsNezavisimaya
Gazeta,externalsaid Beijing may instead increase support for Russia and
North Korea. Joshua CheethamBBC News As Chinese military drills are due to get started following Pelosi's visit, what is the chance that tensions over Taiwan could spill into full-scale war? Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, believes it unlikely that war will
break out â at least for now. âThe Chinese do not as yet have the capability to take
Taiwan and to take on the Americans and be certain they would win,â says Tsang. âThe Taiwanese for obvious reasons really donât want a war.
They are not stupid. They will be the theatre of any military operations and
will be most devastated by it.â Michael OâHanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute,
a US-based think tank, agrees that open conflict is in neither side's interest. âNobody could predict where it would go,â he tells the BBC. âIt
could very easily become global, it could very easily escalate, it could very
easily involve nuclear threats. âChina is a major concern for the United States but it is
less of an acute threat to the world than Russia,â he adds. âPutin values disruption and heâs proved that heâs willing
to take huge risks in pursuit of that goal. I donât think China would pursue
that unless they had absolutely no other choice on the Taiwan matter,â O'Hanlon tells BBC News. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who's on the plane to her next destination in the region - has been tweeting about her visit to Taiwan, calling the meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen a ""privilege"". She also said it was an honour to be awarded Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai. Pelosi finished her twitter thread,externalby saying ""America remains unwavering in our commitment to the people of Taiwan - now and for decades to come"". Allow Twitter content?

on Washington to honour a deal to reduce US arms sales to Taiwan, and
says these promises have been broken. In 1982, President
Ronald Reagan agreed to a gradual reduction in military sales, butadded a condition,externalthat this would depend on ""the commitment of
China to a peaceful solution"" with Taiwan, which China considers to be a
breakaway province. No agreement was
reached on the timescale for this reduction or the form it would take. Over
the decades, the value of US arms sales to Taiwan has fluctuated widely. The
single biggest purchase was made in 1992 by former Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, following a policy to enhance Taiwanâs
independent defence capabilities. In 2007 Taiwan significantly
increased its defence budget, leading to a significant increase in
arms purchased from the US. Former US President Barack Obama (in office between 2009-2017) approved three separate arms deals, with a total value of $12bn over eight years. His
successor Donald Trump signed deals worth at least $14bn during his four years
in office. President
Joe Biden has so far signed deals worth just over $1bn. Jeremy Huai-Che Chiang - formerly a researcher at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation - has said that Nancy Pelosi was received positively by people in Taiwain, with a large crowd at the
airport. Bakeries in Taiwan were giving out free food for every hour of her visit. He told BBC News: This visit sends a strong signal that both Taiwan and the US will not be intimidated by Beijingâs increased aggression. If Speaker Pelosi had abandoned the visit it would have sent the wrong signal to Beijing, but also to other democratic allies. They would also feel that they needed to refrain from supporting Taiwan which would have led to a domino effect.  If
you're just joining us, here's the latest on top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Chinese Foreign
MinisterWang Yimade several strongly worded statements during
Pelosiâs trip to Taiwan, accusing US politicians of ""playing with
fire"". Calling the visit a âfarceâ, Wang Yi said that the US was âviolating
China's sovereignty under the guise of so-called ""democracy"". He
also accused Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen of ""clinging to the US"" and ""turning her back on national justice"". Meanwhile, White House national security spokespersonJohn Kirbysaid that the US was ""not going to be intimidated"" by China's threats or bellicose rhetoric and that there was no reason Pelosiâs visit should precipitate a conflict between the two countries. Kirby also warned that China might engage in ""economic coercion"" toward Taiwan and said that US-China relations would depend on Chinese behaviour and actions going forward. Nancy Pelosi is on her way - what happens now after the first visit by such a senior US official for decades? China is retaliating to the top Democrat's visit by holding military drills in the areas in the map below around Taiwan. The drills will begin on Thursday and last until Sunday, Beijing says. This time three of the six zones intrude into
Taiwanâs 12-mile limit and our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Taiwan says that is unprecedented. The US House Speaker's plane has taken off from Songshan airport, ending a visit of less than 24 hours to the island. She's travelling on to South Korea and Japan. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi waves as she leaves Taiwan after short visit Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Within mainland
China, there is a fierce propaganda drive today to promote the message that
there is ""only one China in the world"" amid US House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's visit. Posters with
slogans are common when the Chinese government wants to make a bold statement.
The official CCTV broadcaster has today published a poster with the
message: ""China - There is only One China in the World"" on major
social media platforms including the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Within 24 hours,
the posterhas been shared more than six million times,external, including by other
prominent media outlets with millions of followers. The hashtag
#OnlyOneChinaInTheWorld is currently trending on the platform. Read moreabout Washington's One China policy and Beijing's One China principle -they are not the same thing TV pictures are showing the US House Speaker on the tarmac at Songshan airport near Taipei. She will be continuing her visit of the region, travelling to South Korea and Japan next. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen drastically to about 15. Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has virtually all of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting about top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit, saying it sends a message to the world that ""democracies stand together"" in the face of common challenges.

Pelosi spoke with activists in a closed-door meeting at the National Human Rights Museum in New Taipei City on Wednesday afternoon. Those she met included: In an interview with Reuters before the meeting, Lam said he wanted to ask Pelosi whether the White House could help those in Taiwan who could not return to Hong Kong yet were also unable to obtain Taiwanese identity cards go to the US. Lam was one of five booksellers detained in 2015 after selling material critical of the Chinese political elite Ms Pelosi is now the most senior US elected official to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years. Inan op-ed defending the visit,externalas an act of diplomacy, she called on Americans to remember their commitment to supporting democracy in Taiwan, and around the world. At 82 years old, Ms Pelosi is one of the most powerful politicians in the United States. She was re-elected to a fourth term as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2021, making her second in line to the presidency after Vice-President Kamala Harris. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Ms Pelosi may view her trip to Taiwan as a means to burnish her political legacy, in the twilight of her long political career. Although she has not announced her retirement, a Republican win in November's mid-term elections could usher her out of power for the last time. Ending her tenure as speaker with a historic trip - setting down a marker for democracy over autocracy, as she has framed it - could be her way of exiting the stage with a flourish. Read more here She was given Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai Ing-wen The two leaders held talks She later visited Taipei's Jingmei Human Rights Cultural Park Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan It is clear now that Beijing is not going to be satisfied by
venting its anger at Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan with mere words, or even
some targeted sanctions on Taiwan companies. The announcement of six large
exclusion zones around Taiwan starting on Thursday, and lasting for four days, has
the potential to turn this into a full-scale crisis. Beijing did the same thing
back in 1996, the last time there was a so called âTaiwan Straits Crisisâ. But
then the exclusion zones were all well outside Taiwanâs territorial waters. This time three of the six zones intrude into Taiwanâs 12-mile limit. That is
unprecedented. Taiwanâs defence ministry has already called the move a breach
of UN conventions, and said it amounts to an air and sea blockade against the
island. If China were to move ships or aircraft into those areas, it would
amount and invasion of Taiwan territory. This makes the stakes much higher as Taiwan may feel compelled to defend
its own territorial waters. The US Navy is watching all of this very
closely, and already has the USS Ronald Reagan carrier battle group sailing
nearby in the Philippine Sea. In 1996 the
then US President Bill Clinton moved two carrier battle groups close to Taiwan,
to make it clear the US was ready to intervene if China attacked the island. But the military balance today is very different from 1996. China has its own
carrier battle groups, both of which are reported to be heading towards the
Taiwan Strait. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

"LiveLivePelosi visits Taiwan in defiance of Chinese warningsThe top US Democrat arrives in Taiwan as part of a tour of Asia, despite sharp warnings from China.Asia","Top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi leaves Taiwan after meeting its President Tsai Ing-wen, despite warnings from China not to do so She praised Taiwan as an island of resilience and said the US commitment to democracy there was iron-clad China says it will hold a series of live-fire military drills in the air and sea around the island from Thursday Taiwan says the move violates the island's sovereignty and amounts to a blockade The US speaker's trip, which was not backed by President Biden, was the first by such a senior US official in 25 years Beijing sees self-ruled Taiwan - which lies 100 miles from the Chinese mainland - as a breakaway province that will eventually be under its control Edited by Claudia Allen and Tom Spender The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, has left Taiwan after a high-profile visit that infuriated China. Pelosi - the most senior American to visit the self-ruled island in 25 years - said she had reiterated ""iron-clad"" support for Taiwan's democracy. China, which claims the island as its territory, responded to the visit by announcing three days of live-fire exercises around its coast, starting on Thursday. You can read our full news story about Pelosi's visithere. We are now finishing our live coverage - thank you for following along. Wednesday's live page was edited in Singapore and London by Thomas Spender and Claudia Allen and written by Jack Burgess, Laura Gozzi, Aoife Walsh, Frances Mao and Melissa Zhu. Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan For Taiwan this trip by Nancy Pelosi is about support, but also legitimacy. Taiwan needs America's support, military and otherwise. But it craves legitimacy. It craves recognition that this is not some ""renegade province"" as Beijing calls it, but a proud country, with its own democratic government and a determination to keep it that way. That is why a visit by the Speaker of the US House of Representatives means so much. America is what Taiwan looks up to, not China. You can see it in the excited way Pelosi's arrival here is being reported on Taiwan's many TV news channels. They have been studying everything from the colour of her outfits to the height of her heels - very high for an 82-year-old, apparently - and the fact that she ""looked like Audrey Hepburn in that photo of her with President John F. Kennedy back in 1961"". Read morehere. BBC Monitoring Several journalists and commentators in China
have been tweeting their condemnation of Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan. Chinaâs diplomats also used social media to sharpen
their criticism of the US during the visit. In the last three days,Zhang Meifang,external,
the consul-general in Belfast, remained the most active
diplomat on Twitter, posting several tweets on Taiwan. Sheflagged up,externalForeign Minister Wang Yi's warning on 2 August that
the US ""making themselves an enemy of the 1.4 billion Chinese people
will not end up well"". The former Global Times
editor-in-chief Hu Xijinâs Twitter account had beenbriefly locked,externallast
week after he tweeted that the Chinese army had the right to shoot down
Pelosi's plane if she visited. He has now criticised the US Speaker for causing a lockdown of Taiwanâs main ports, which will be effectively blocked during Chinaâs drills. âThis
is what Pelosiâs visit has brought to Taiwan,""  he tweeted. The antagonists in the Russia-Ukraine war have
also been following the visit closely with Ukrainian commentators drawing parallels between Russia âthe bullyâ and China. Former Ukrainian Foreign MinisterPavlo Klimkin said,externalthe
USA ""showed its teeth""
and noted that the Kremlin had probably noticed this. Many Russian commentators
donât expect a major crisis to arise from the trip as they believe neither
China nor the US has the appetite to further escalate tensions. State-ownedRossiyskaya
Gazeta,externalsaid it was simply a case of both sides flexing their
muscles. A report in RussiaâsNezavisimaya
Gazeta,externalsaid Beijing may instead increase support for Russia and
North Korea. Joshua CheethamBBC News As Chinese military drills are due to get started following Pelosi's visit, what is the chance that tensions over Taiwan could spill into full-scale war? Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies, believes it unlikely that war will
break out â at least for now. âThe Chinese do not as yet have the capability to take
Taiwan and to take on the Americans and be certain they would win,â says Tsang. âThe Taiwanese for obvious reasons really donât want a war.
They are not stupid. They will be the theatre of any military operations and
will be most devastated by it.â Michael OâHanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute,
a US-based think tank, agrees that open conflict is in neither side's interest. âNobody could predict where it would go,â he tells the BBC. âIt
could very easily become global, it could very easily escalate, it could very
easily involve nuclear threats. âChina is a major concern for the United States but it is
less of an acute threat to the world than Russia,â he adds. âPutin values disruption and heâs proved that heâs willing
to take huge risks in pursuit of that goal. I donât think China would pursue
that unless they had absolutely no other choice on the Taiwan matter,â O'Hanlon tells BBC News. US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - who's on the plane to her next destination in the region - has been tweeting about her visit to Taiwan, calling the meeting with President Tsai Ing-wen a ""privilege"". She also said it was an honour to be awarded Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai. Pelosi finished her twitter thread,externalby saying ""America remains unwavering in our commitment to the people of Taiwan - now and for decades to come"". Allow Twitter content?

on Washington to honour a deal to reduce US arms sales to Taiwan, and
says these promises have been broken. In 1982, President
Ronald Reagan agreed to a gradual reduction in military sales, butadded a condition,externalthat this would depend on ""the commitment of
China to a peaceful solution"" with Taiwan, which China considers to be a
breakaway province. No agreement was
reached on the timescale for this reduction or the form it would take. Over
the decades, the value of US arms sales to Taiwan has fluctuated widely. The
single biggest purchase was made in 1992 by former Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui, following a policy to enhance Taiwanâs
independent defence capabilities. In 2007 Taiwan significantly
increased its defence budget, leading to a significant increase in
arms purchased from the US. Former US President Barack Obama (in office between 2009-2017) approved three separate arms deals, with a total value of $12bn over eight years. His
successor Donald Trump signed deals worth at least $14bn during his four years
in office. President
Joe Biden has so far signed deals worth just over $1bn. Jeremy Huai-Che Chiang - formerly a researcher at the Taiwan-Asia Exchange Foundation - has said that Nancy Pelosi was received positively by people in Taiwain, with a large crowd at the
airport. Bakeries in Taiwan were giving out free food for every hour of her visit. He told BBC News: This visit sends a strong signal that both Taiwan and the US will not be intimidated by Beijingâs increased aggression. If Speaker Pelosi had abandoned the visit it would have sent the wrong signal to Beijing, but also to other democratic allies. They would also feel that they needed to refrain from supporting Taiwan which would have led to a domino effect.  If
you're just joining us, here's the latest on top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. Chinese Foreign
MinisterWang Yimade several strongly worded statements during
Pelosiâs trip to Taiwan, accusing US politicians of ""playing with
fire"". Calling the visit a âfarceâ, Wang Yi said that the US was âviolating
China's sovereignty under the guise of so-called ""democracy"". He
also accused Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen of ""clinging to the US"" and ""turning her back on national justice"". Meanwhile, White House national security spokespersonJohn Kirbysaid that the US was ""not going to be intimidated"" by China's threats or bellicose rhetoric and that there was no reason Pelosiâs visit should precipitate a conflict between the two countries. Kirby also warned that China might engage in ""economic coercion"" toward Taiwan and said that US-China relations would depend on Chinese behaviour and actions going forward. Nancy Pelosi is on her way - what happens now after the first visit by such a senior US official for decades? China is retaliating to the top Democrat's visit by holding military drills in the areas in the map below around Taiwan. The drills will begin on Thursday and last until Sunday, Beijing says. This time three of the six zones intrude into
Taiwanâs 12-mile limit and our correspondent Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Taiwan says that is unprecedented. The US House Speaker's plane has taken off from Songshan airport, ending a visit of less than 24 hours to the island. She's travelling on to South Korea and Japan. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi waves as she leaves Taiwan after short visit Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Within mainland
China, there is a fierce propaganda drive today to promote the message that
there is ""only one China in the world"" amid US House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi's visit. Posters with
slogans are common when the Chinese government wants to make a bold statement.
The official CCTV broadcaster has today published a poster with the
message: ""China - There is only One China in the World"" on major
social media platforms including the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. Within 24 hours,
the posterhas been shared more than six million times,external, including by other
prominent media outlets with millions of followers. The hashtag
#OnlyOneChinaInTheWorld is currently trending on the platform. Read moreabout Washington's One China policy and Beijing's One China principle -they are not the same thing TV pictures are showing the US House Speaker on the tarmac at Songshan airport near Taipei. She will be continuing her visit of the region, travelling to South Korea and Japan next. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province which it has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. But Taiwan's leaders say it is clearly much more than a province, arguing that it is a sovereign state. It has its own constitution, democratically-elected leaders, and about 300,000 active troops in its armed forces. Chiang Kai-shek's Republic of China (ROC) government, which fled the mainland to Taiwan in 1949, at first claimed to represent the whole of China, which it intended to re-occupy. It held China's seat on the United Nations Security Council and was recognised by many Western nations as the only Chinese government. But in 1971, the UN switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing and the ROC government was forced out. Since then the number of countries that recognise the ROC government diplomatically has fallen drastically to about 15. Given the huge divide between these two positions, most other countries seem happy to accept the current ambiguity, whereby Taiwan has virtually all of the characteristics of an independent state, even if its legal status remains unclear. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has been tweeting about top US Democrat Nancy Pelosi's visit, saying it sends a message to the world that ""democracies stand together"" in the face of common challenges.

Pelosi spoke with activists in a closed-door meeting at the National Human Rights Museum in New Taipei City on Wednesday afternoon. Those she met included: In an interview with Reuters before the meeting, Lam said he wanted to ask Pelosi whether the White House could help those in Taiwan who could not return to Hong Kong yet were also unable to obtain Taiwanese identity cards go to the US. Lam was one of five booksellers detained in 2015 after selling material critical of the Chinese political elite Ms Pelosi is now the most senior US elected official to visit Taiwan in more than 25 years. Inan op-ed defending the visit,externalas an act of diplomacy, she called on Americans to remember their commitment to supporting democracy in Taiwan, and around the world. At 82 years old, Ms Pelosi is one of the most powerful politicians in the United States. She was re-elected to a fourth term as Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2021, making her second in line to the presidency after Vice-President Kamala Harris. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher says Ms Pelosi may view her trip to Taiwan as a means to burnish her political legacy, in the twilight of her long political career. Although she has not announced her retirement, a Republican win in November's mid-term elections could usher her out of power for the last time. Ending her tenure as speaker with a historic trip - setting down a marker for democracy over autocracy, as she has framed it - could be her way of exiting the stage with a flourish. Read more here She was given Taiwan's highest civilian honour by President Tsai Ing-wen The two leaders held talks She later visited Taipei's Jingmei Human Rights Cultural Park Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Taiwan It is clear now that Beijing is not going to be satisfied by
venting its anger at Nancy Pelosiâs visit to Taiwan with mere words, or even
some targeted sanctions on Taiwan companies. The announcement of six large
exclusion zones around Taiwan starting on Thursday, and lasting for four days, has
the potential to turn this into a full-scale crisis. Beijing did the same thing
back in 1996, the last time there was a so called âTaiwan Straits Crisisâ. But
then the exclusion zones were all well outside Taiwanâs territorial waters. This time three of the six zones intrude into Taiwanâs 12-mile limit. That is
unprecedented. Taiwanâs defence ministry has already called the move a breach
of UN conventions, and said it amounts to an air and sea blockade against the
island. If China were to move ships or aircraft into those areas, it would
amount and invasion of Taiwan territory. This makes the stakes much higher as Taiwan may feel compelled to defend
its own territorial waters. The US Navy is watching all of this very
closely, and already has the USS Ronald Reagan carrier battle group sailing
nearby in the Philippine Sea. In 1996 the
then US President Bill Clinton moved two carrier battle groups close to Taiwan,
to make it clear the US was ready to intervene if China attacked the island. But the military balance today is very different from 1996. China has its own
carrier battle groups, both of which are reported to be heading towards the
Taiwan Strait. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Pay public workers in regions differently - Truss,"Liz Truss has said she wants to save taxpayers' money by ending national pay deals for civil servants' pay. The Tory leadership candidate wants to link civil servants' salaries to living standards where they work, meaning similar jobs could have different salaries depending on location. Ms Truss says the scheme could be rolled out to other public sector areas, saving Â£8.8bn a year. Labour called her plan ""a fantasy recipe for levelling down"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said it would reduce ""the pay of Northerners, worsening the divide which already exists"". Some Conservative MPs in the south-west of England have also come out strongly against the proposals, with Steve Double, a Rishi Sunak ally, saying it would be ""hugely damaging to public services in Cornwall"". And Ben Houchen - mayor of Tees Valley and another supporter of Mr Sunak - said: ""There is simply no way you can do this without a massive pay cut for 5.5 million people including nurses, police officers and our armed forces outside London."" But minister and Truss backer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""Anyone who currently works for the civil service will remain on their current terms but new people will be paid the market rate in the area in which they live - and that's quite rightly taking care of taxpayers' money."" He added that ""if the government is the highest payer, it then crowds out private sector investment."" Ms Truss is competing with former Chancellor Mr Sunak to become the next Conservative leader, and prime minister. The party's 160,000 or so members are voting on which of the two they want to replace Boris Johnson, and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Sunak vows to take 4p off income tax Ministers condemn knife image shared by Dorries Truss courts Johnson loyalists as Sunak faces jibes Ms Truss has also proposed scrapping jobs aimed at increasing inclusion and diversity in the public sector. In addition to introducing regional pay, Ms Truss has said she would save Â£137m by banning union representatives from getting paid time off to focus on union work. The foreign secretary also wants to reduce average civil service annual leave from 27 days to 25 and scrap Whitehall's diversity officers - something her team estimates could save Â£12m a year. Along with the proposed reforms to public sector pay, she says the total savings to the taxpayer would be up to Â£11bn. There are bits of tinkering here and there in Ms Truss's plans, like saving Â£12m a year from cutting civil service diversity officers. But the only way these plans will save ""billions"" is if they not only pay civil servants less in poorer areas - but other public sector workers too. Ms Truss says she'll only do this if it ""works"" when they introduce it for civil servants. Economically, the argument is that it's harder for private companies to hire people where public pay is higher and harder to compete with. But politically - it's very hard to see how she sells this. To save billions, she's arguing you'd need a situation where nurses, police, teachers - for example - would be paid less in Sunderland than ones in Surrey. Lots of policy has been pumped out in this campaign with headlines like 'Whitehall waste' to appeal to members. But dig in to the detail, and there are loads of questions about how some of these would work in practice. The foreign secretary has also been criticised fordescribingScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as an ""attention-seeker"". Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney said he was ""absolutely horrified"" and described the comments as ""obnoxious"". At a question session on Monday evening, Mr Sunak told party members he was the candidate for change. He was introduced to the stage in Exeter by former International Trade Secretary Liam Fox who said Mr Sunak had the ""character, courage, experience intellect and downright decency"" to win over swing voters. Ms Truss received her own campaign boost when she received the endorsement of trade minister Penny Mordaunt. Ms Mordaunt - who was knocked out of the race after finishing third in the polling among MPs - described Ms Truss as the ""hope candidate"". The FDA - the union for senior civil servants - said it was ""astounding"" Ms Truss was planning to move jobs out of London while at the same time cutting regional pay. Alex Thomas of the Institute for Government think tank said the idea of regional pay ""comes around every few years"". ""The reason why chancellors and prime ministers have previously tended to abandon it is the benefits are pretty marginal - both in terms of the cost you can save and the benefits to the local economy."" But the Taxpayers' Alliance argues it would help boost economic growth in regions such as the north-east of England and the Midlands by reducing inflated labour costs and thereby encouraging the private sector to invest in these areas.

Truss: Best to ignore attention-seeking Sturgeon,"This video can not be played Liz Truss criticised Scotland's first minister before ruling out a second independence referendum Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has claimed it is best to ignore ""attention seeker"" Nicola Sturgeon. The foreign secretary criticised Scotland's first minister before ruling out a second independence referendum. Speaking at a hustings event in Exeter, Ms Truss described herself as ""a child of the Union"", having spent some of her youth living in Paisley. Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney said her comments were ""completely and utterly unacceptable"". Talking to voters at the hustings event, Ms Truss said: ""I really believe we're a family and we're better together."" Tory party members then cheered and applauded as she said: ""I think the best thing to do with Nicola Sturgeon is ignore her. ""She's an attention seeker, that's what she is. ""What we need to do is show the people of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales what we're delivering for them and making sure that all of our government policies apply right across the United Kingdom."" Nicola Sturgeon was accused by Liz Truss of being an attention seeker Ms Truss later replied ""no, no, no"" when asked about whether she would support another independence referendum in Scotland if she becomes prime minister. Mr Swinney toldBBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programmethat Scotland had been ""ridden roughshod over"" by the attitudes of the Conservative party over the last few years. He cited theUK Internal Market Billas an example of an ""erosion"" to democracy in Scotland. He said: ""When people are saying to us we would like our two governments to work more closely together, this comment from Liz Truss demonstrates what we are up against. ""I come across this frequently when I'm dealing with the UK government - a contempt for Scotland, a desire to belittle Scotland and not hear our voice. ""And if you don't believe me on this just listen to what Mark Drakeford, the Labour first minister of Wales, says - he says exactly the same thing about how Wales is treated."" This video can not be played John Swinney: ""People in Scotland, whatever their politics, will be absolutely horrified by the obnoxious remarks."" However MSP Murdo Fraser of the Scottish Conservatives said he would ignore Mr Swinney's ""manufactured outrage"" on the issue. He told the BBC that while he was not sure of the whole context of Ms Truss' remarks, he believed she was referring to Nicola Sturgeon's ""incessant and increasingly tiresome demands"" for another referendum. He said: ""Liz Truss is far more in tune on Scottish opinion on this issue than Nicola Sturgeon. I think Liz Truss is absolutely right to say this is not the time for another referendum. ""There are other priorities the Scottish government should be focussing on - not least the NHS, the appalling rate of drugs deaths, trying to rebuild our economy post-Covid."" Ms Truss and Rishi Sunak are vying to win over Conservative Party members, whose votes will determine which of them will become the next Tory leader and British prime minister. Nine Scottish Conservative MSPs, including Murdo Fraser, Rachael Hamilton, Liam Kerr and Oliver Mundell, declared their support for Liz Truss on Monday. Meanwhile eight Conservative MSPs declared their support for Rishi Sunak in a joint letter in the Telegraph on Tuesday. They are Donald Cameron, Liz Smith, Miles Briggs, Jackson Carlaw, Maurice Golden, Jeremy Balfour, Dean Lockhart and Alexander Stewart. MPs John Lamont and Andrew Bowie have also backed Mr Sunak. Welcome to the era of muscular unionism. If, as expected, Liz Truss enters 10 Downing Street, it's clear she will ditch the cautious constitutional approach of the Johnson administration which addressed the issue of a second independence referendum by simply repeating the mantra: ""now is not the time."" Ms Truss is adopting a far more robust attitude. It's not quite the ""never, never, never!"" with which Ulster's Ian Paisley denounced the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement but ""no, no, no!"" is not a million miles away from it. This is already being cheered by staunch unionists who had been longing for more robust engagement, some of whom, not coincidentally, are currently deciding whether to vote for Ms Truss or Rishi Sunak as their leader. Hours before her comments theSpectator's Stephen Daisley,external, for example, argued that the constitutional debate had become ""a one-sided war, and one that Westminster is losing."" But there is a reason this approach â and particularly sharp personal attacks â was on the whole rejected by Boris Johnson and his team. They feared that an all-out assault on Nicola Sturgeon wouldplay directly into the Scottish government's hands,externalas it would be cast as an attack not just on the first minister but on the nation which elected her. It is true that polls suggest a majority of voters in Scotland are not keen on a referendum any time soon. It is also true that last year voters in Scotland elected a majority of MSPs who had made manifesto commitments to hold another independence referendum - returning Ms Sturgeon as first minister in yet another landslide election victory in the process.

Truss: Fast-track career of foreign secretary,"Liz Truss has resigned as prime minister after a chaotic 45 days in Downing Street. But where did she come from and what makes her tick? A Remain supporter who became the darling of the Brexit-backing Conservative right wing. A former Liberal Democrat activist, who marched against Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, but claimed to be the keeper of the Thatcherite flame. It is fair to say that Mary Elizabeth Truss has been on a political journey. She was not a household name, like her predecessor Boris Johnson, when she became PM. But she leaves having made history; serving the shortest tenure of any UK prime minister. During the leadership election this summer, her promise to return to fundamental Conservative values - cutting taxes and shrinking the state - proved to be exactly what party members, who got the final say over who took over from Mr Johnson, wanted to hear. And, crucially, as foreign secretary she had remained loyal to Mr Johnson until the bitter end, as other ministers deserted him. It won her favour with Johnson loyalists. Grassroots Tory supporters of Liz Truss saw in her the steadfast, tenacious and determined qualities they admired in Margaret Thatcher - an image Ms Truss herself has tried to cultivate. But despite her shifting political positions and allegiances over the years, these words also come up frequently when friends and family are asked to describe her character - along with ""ambitious"". Age:47 Place of birth:Oxford Home:London and Norfolk Education:Roundhay School in Leeds, Oxford University Family:Married to accountant Hugh O'Leary with two teenage daughters Parliamentary constituency:South West Norfolk ""She's a very opinionated person in terms of what she wants,"" said her brother Francis in 2017, when recalling his older sister's teenage dalliance with vegetarianism. ""When you go to a restaurant, you might be 14 but she was precocious about what she wants, what she didn't want."" When the family played Cluedo or Monopoly, ""she was someone who had to win,"" added Francis ina BBC Radio 4 profile of Truss. ""She would create some special system to work out how she could win."" Maurizio Giuliano, a university contemporary who first met her at a Liberal Democrat event, says she stood out from the other students. ""I remember her being very well-dressed compared to other 18 to 19-year-olds. She also had the demeanour of a real adult compared to what we were at that age. ""She was forceful and opinionated and she had very strong views."" Serious political debate was the order of the day in the Truss household, according to Francis, the youngest of her three younger brothers. ""You didn't sit around talking about the latest Megadrive game at the dinner table, it was much more issues, political campaigns etc,"" he told Radio 4's Profile programme. It must have felt inevitable that she would get involved in politics in some capacity when she grew up, but no-one in her family would have predicted the path she eventually took. Born in Oxford in 1975, Ms Truss has described her father, a mathematics professor, and her mother, a nurse, as ""left-wing"". As a young girl, her mother took her on marches for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, an organisation vehemently opposed to the Thatcher government's decision to allow US nuclear warheads to be installed at RAF Greenham Common, west of London. Though she is now proudly a Conservative from Leeds, back then she was a Scottish liberal. The family moved to Paisley, just west of Glasgow, when Ms Truss was four-years-old. In a BBC interview, she recalled shouting ""Maggie, Maggie, Maggie - oot, oot, oot,"" in a Scottish accent, as she took part in marches. The Truss family campaigned for nuclear disarmament The Truss family later decamped to Leeds, where she attended Roundhay, a state secondary school. She has described seeing ""children who failed and were let down by low expectations"" during her time there. Some of Ms Truss's contemporaries at Roundhay have disputed her account of the school, includingGuardian journalist Martin Pengelly,external, who wrote: ""Perhaps she is selectively deploying her upbringing, and casually traducing the school and teachers who nurtured her, for simple political gain."" One Roundhay school mate, who did not want to be named, told the BBC:  ""It was a really good school, really supportive teachers. Quite a lot of us have gone on to good universities and good careers."" Although not part of her friendship group, he has clear memories of the young Truss. ""She was quite studious, serious,"" he says, with a ""heavy social conscience"" and part of a group that were into environmentalism. ""I remember a school trip to Sellafield and her asking difficult questions and giving them a grilling. I remember that quite distinctly."" At Oxford University, Ms Truss read philosophy, politics and economics. Friends recall a well-liked, if frenetic student. The teenage Truss caused a stir at the Lib Dem conference with her anti-monarchy stance ""I remember her determination which was very impressive for me,"" says Jamshid Derakhshan, who was studying for a postgrad degree in mathematics when Truss was an undergraduate. ""She was very quick with everything. Going around the college quickly, being everywhere."" As to what sort of prime minister his old friend will make, Dr Derakhshan says: ""My feeling is she's not going to be stuck with one particular idea, she's very flexible in her mind and what will be best for the time."" Ms Truss was involved in many campaigns and causes at Oxford but devoted much of her time to politics, becoming president of the university's Liberal Democrats. At the party's 1994 conference, she spoke in favour of abolishing the monarchy, telling delegates in Brighton: ""We Liberal Democrats believe in opportunity for all. We do not believe people are born to rule."" She also campaigned for the decriminalisation of cannabis. ""Liz had a very strong radical liberal streak to her,"" said fellow Lib Dem student Alan Renwick in 2017. ""We were setting up the Freshers Fair stall, Liz was there with a pile of posters, saying 'Free the Weed' and she just wanted the whole stall to be covered with these posters. ""I was scurrying around after Liz trying to take these down and put up a variety of messages, rather than just this one message all over the stall."" Her Instagram posts have seen a transformation, from candid shots posing with rhubarb... to striding out of high-level meetings flanked by assistants Her conversion to conservatism, towards the end of her time at Oxford is said to have shocked her left-leaning parents, but for Mark Littlewood, a fellow Oxford Lib Dem, it was a natural progression. ""She's been a market liberal all of her adult life,"" according to Mr Littlewood, who is now director general of the libertarian, free market think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs. ""Her political career reflects her ideology - she has always been highly sceptical of big government and privileged institutions who think they know best,"" Mr Littlewood said. She clearly changed parties, but that ""was a judgement about what's the best and most likely vehicle for her to succeed in politics and get what she wants to get done,"" Mr Littlewood said. Nevertheless, what she has described as her ""dubious past"" came back to haunt her as she tried to convince Tory members she was truly one of them. At a leadership hustings in Eastbourne, some in the audience jeered, as she told them: ""We all make mistakes, we all had teenage misadventures, and that was mine. ""Some people have sex, drugs and rock and roll, I was in the Liberal Democrats. I'm sorry."" She had become a Conservative because she had met like-minded people who shared her commitment to ""personal freedom, the ability to shape your own life and shape your own destiny,"" she explained. After graduating from Oxford she worked as an accountant for Shell, and Cable & Wireless, and married fellow accountant Hugh O'Leary in 2000. The couple have two children. Ms Truss stood as the Tory candidate for Hemsworth, West Yorkshire, in the 2001 general election, but lost. She suffered another defeat in Calder Valley, also in West Yorkshire, in 2005. But, her political ambitions undimmed, she was elected as a councillor in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2006, and from 2008 also worked for the right-of-centre Reform think tank. Liz Truss became an MP in 2010 Conservative leader David Cameron put Ms Truss on his ""A-list"" of priority candidates for the 2010 election and she was selected to stand for the safe seat of South West Norfolk. But she quickly faced a battle against de-selection by the constituency Tory association, after it was revealed she had had an affair with Tory MP Mark Field some years earlier. The effort to oust her failed and Ms Truss went on to win the seat by more than 13,000 votes. She co-authored a book, Britannia Unchained, with four other Conservative MPs elected in 2010, which recommended stripping back state regulation to boost the UK's position in the world, marking her out as a prominent advocate of free market policies on the Tory benches. During a BBC leadership debate, she was challenged about a comment in Britannia Unchained, describing British workers as ""among the worst idlers in the world"". She insisted she had not written it. In 2012, just over two years after becoming an MP, she entered government as an education minister and in 2014 was promoted to environment secretary. At the 2014 Conservative conference, she made a speech in which she said, in an impassioned voice:""We import two-thirds of our cheese.That. Is. A. Disgrace."" The speech was little noticed at the time, but it has taken on a life of its own on social media, attracting much mockery and becoming widely shared. Two years later came arguably the biggest political event in a generation - the EU referendum. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain,writing in the Sun newspaper,externalthat Brexit would be ""a triple tragedy - more rules, more forms and more delays when selling to the EU"". However, after her side lost, she changed her mind, arguing that Brexit provided an opportunity to ""shake up the way things work"". Becoming the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 Under Theresa May's premiership, she became the first female Lord Chancellor and justice secretary, but she had several high-profile clashes with the judiciary. Her initial failure to defend judges after they werebranded ""enemies of the people"" by the Daily Mail,external, when they ruled Parliament had to be given a vote on triggering Brexit, upset the legal establishment. She later issued a statement supporting the judges, but she was criticised by Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd as ""completely and absolutely wrong"" for not speaking out sooner. After 11 months as justice secretary, she was demoted to chief secretary to the Treasury. When Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019, Ms Truss was moved to international trade secretary - a job which meant meeting global political and business leaders to promote UK PLC. Liz Truss held a frosty joint press conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in the weeks before the invasion of Ukraine In 2021, aged 46, she moved to one of the most senior jobs in government, taking over from Dominic Raab as foreign secretary. In this role she has sought to solve the knotty problem of the Northern Ireland Protocol, by scrapping parts of a post-Brexit EU-UK deal - a move the EU fiercely criticised. She secured the release of two British-Iranian nationals who had both been arrested and detained in Iran. And when Russia invaded Ukraine in February she took a hard line, insisting all of Vladimir Putin's forces should be driven from the country. But shefaced criticismfor backing people from the UK who wanted to fight in Ukraine. Her decision to pose for photographs in a tank while visiting British troops in Estonia, was seen as an attempt to emulate Margaret Thatcher, who had famously been pictured aboard a Challenger tank in 1986. It also fuelled speculation that she was on leadership manoeuvres. Claims she was deliberately trying to channel Thatcher grew even louder when she posed for a photograph in a white pussy bow collar of the kind favoured by the Iron Lady. But she has always dismissed such criticism, telling GB News: ""It is quite frustrating that female politicians always get compared to Margaret Thatcher while male politicians don't get compared to Ted Heath."" Liz Truss posed for official shots in a tank whilst visiting British troops in Estonia last year Ms Truss's campaign for the party leadership was not free of controversy. Pressed on how she would tackle the cost-of-living crisis, she said she would focus her efforts on ""lowering the tax burden, not giving out handouts"". She has been forced to scrap a plan to link public sector pay to regional living costs by a backlash from senior Tories who said it would mean lower pay for millions of workers outside London. And she called Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an ""attention seeker"", adding it was best to ""ignore her"". She also got intoa spat with French President Emmanuel Macron, who accused her of ""playing to the gallery"" at a leadership hustings. Asked if Mr Macron was a ""friend or foe"", she had said the jury was still out. But it was domestic issues, or rather one domestic issue, that dominated the sometimes fractious leadership contest with Rishi Sunak. Ms Truss's response to the cost-of-living crisis was always likely to define her premiership. And ultimately her time in Downing Street began to rapidly unravel following her disastrous ""mini-budget"". Liz Truss now becomes the shortest-serving prime minister in UK history.

Treason Act charge after Windsor Castle incident,"A weapon was found on the man during a search, police said A man allegedly found with a crossbow in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Christmas Day has been charged under the Treason Act. Jaswant Singh Chail, 20, has also been charged with threats to kill and possession of an offensive weapon. Mr Chail, from Southampton, is in custody and will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 17 August. The charges were brought after an investigation by the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command. Mr Chail was arrested at about 08:30 GMT on Christmas Day. The Met said he was stopped ""within moments"" of entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings. He has been charged with an offence under section 2 of the 1842 Treason Act, namely ""discharging or aiming firearms, or throwing or using any offensive matter or weapon, with intent to injure or alarm her Majesty"", said Scotland Yard. The Queen had been staying at Windsor Castle for Christmas, rather than spending it as usual on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. Her Majesty was due to be joined for lunch by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, as well as the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Under the 1842 Treason Act, it is an offence to assault the Queen, or have a firearm or offensive weapon in her presence with intent to injure or alarm her or to cause a breach of peace. In 1981, Marcus Sarjeant was jailed for five years under the section of the Treason Act after he fired blank shots at the Queen while she was riding down The Mall in London during the Trooping the Colour parade.

Arrest warrant issued for arena bomber's brother,"Ismail Abedi has refused to answer questions about the Manchester Arena attack An arrest warrant has been issued for the Manchester Arena bomber's brother. Ismail Abedi, 29, was convicted in his absence in July offailing to appear at the Manchester Arena Inquiryafter being ordered to give evidence. Abedi, who uses the name Ben Romdhan, had refused to answer questions on the grounds he could incriminate himself and later fled the UK. His younger brother Salman Abedi killed 22 people and injured hundreds more in the terror attack on 22 May 2017. His other brother Hashem Abedi, who helped plan the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, was jailed in August 2020 after beingconvicted of murdering all those who died. Sir John Saunders, the chairman of the public inquiry, had demanded Ismail Abedi appear at the hearing. In May 2020, Ismail Abedi was asked to provide a witness statement but, in July of that year, he responded in writing, saying he would not provide a witness statement, ""because I am concerned about the risk of self-incrimination"". He was told that failure to comply was a criminal offence, to which he replied he did not wish to answer the questions and asserted he wished to claim privilege against self-incrimination. What is the Manchester Arena Inquiry? Arena bomb brother leaves UK before court hearing Bomber's brother convicted over inquiry no-show The inquiry pointed out that such privilege could only ever be claimed on a question by question basis, not in blanket form. He then asked for immunity from prosecution from the attorney general before he would agree to give evidence, but the inquiry chairman refused the application. A formal notice was then issued requiring the defendant to attend the inquiry on 21 October 2021, but he did not attend. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the attack Last month, he was convicted at Manchester Magistrates' Court of failing to comply with a legal notice to attend the inquiry as a witness. District Judge Jack McGarva said he was ""satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"" he had ""no reasonable excuse for not attending"" and he was ""guilty of the offence as charged"". Prosecutor Sophie Cartwright QC told the court that notification of Tuesday's hearing had been sent to Ismail Abedi's last known address, an email address he had previously used and his former solicitors. The judge said he was satisfied that Ismail Abedi was aware of the hearing and also noted that the proceedings had had a ""great deal of publicity"". Issuing a warrant without bail, he said: ""We will now have to wait for him to be apprehended."" He faces a jail term of up to 51 weeks for the offence. The news of the warrant has been welcomed by a number of the victims' families. Kim Harrison, whose firm Slater and Gordon has represented 11 families at the inquiry, said they remained ""gravely concerned as to why Abedi was able to leave the country before giving evidence"". ""The families deserve to know the truth about what happened that night and the contempt Ismail Abedi has shown them is truly despicable,"" she added.

What happened on 9/11?,"On Tuesday 11 September 2001, suicide attackers seized US passenger jets and crashed them into two New York skyscrapers, killing thousands of people. What unfolded that day has had profound consequences across the globe. Twenty-three years later, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other men accused of plotting the attack - known as 9/11 - are expected to plead guilty in a military court. Four planes flying over the eastern US were seized simultaneously by small teams of hijackers. They were then used as giant, guided missiles to crash into landmark buildings in New York and Washington. Two planes hit the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York, with the second strike 17 minutes after the first. The buildings were set on fire, trapping people on the upper floors, and enveloping the city in smoke. In less than two hours, both 110-storey towers collapsed in massive clouds of dust. A third plane destroyed the western face of the Pentagon - the giant headquarters of the US military just outside the nation's capital, Washington DC. The fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. It is thought the hijackers had meant to attack Washington's Capitol Building. New Yorkers fleeing the debris from the attack In all, 2,977 people (not counting the 19 hijackers) lost their lives, most of them in New York. All 246 passengers and crew aboard the four planes were killed At the Twin Towers, 2,606 people died - at the time or later from the injuries sustained At the Pentagon, 125 people were killed The youngest victim was two-year-old Christine Lee Hanson and the oldest was 82-year-old Robert Norton, who were both passengers on planes. When the first plane struck, an estimated 17,400 people were in the towers. Nobody survived above the impact zone in the North Tower, but 18 managed to escape from the floors above the impact zone in the South Tower. Citizens of 77 different countries were among the casualties. New York City lost 441 first responders. Thousands of people were injured or later developed illnesses connected to the attacks, including firefighters who had worked in toxic debris. Emotional tributes paid to 9/11 lives lost In pictures: Silence and tears as US remembers 9/11 attacks An Islamist extremist network called al-Qaeda planned the attacks from Afghanistan. Led by Osama Bin Laden, al-Qaeda blamed the US and its allies for conflicts in the Muslim world. Nineteen people carried out the hijackings, working in three teams of five and one of four (on the plane which crashed in Pennsylvania). Each group included someone who had received pilot training. This was carried out at flying schools in the US itself. Fifteen hijackers were Saudis like Bin Laden. Two were from the United Arab Emirates, one was from Egypt and one was from Lebanon. Less than a month after the attacks, President George W Bush led an invasion of Afghanistan - supported by an international coalition - to eradicate al-Qaeda and hunt down Bin Laden. However, it was not until 2011 that US troops finally located and killed Bin Laden in neighbouring Pakistan. The moment then US President George W Bush was told about the 9/11 attacks by former White House aide Andy Card The alleged planner of the 9/11 attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was arrested in Pakistan in 2003. Al-Qaeda still exists. It is strongest in Sub-Saharan Africa but even now has members inside Afghanistan. US troops left Afghanistan in 2022 after nearly 20 years, stoking fears from many that the Islamist network could make a comeback. He is considered by prosecutors to be the 9/11 mastermind, taking his hijacked planes idea to Bin Laden and later helping to recruit the pilots. Born in Kuwait, he studied engineering in the US before fighting in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Even before 9/11, the FBI were on his trail as they believed him to be behind other bombings and thwarted attacks. In 2006, three years after being captured, he was sent to the US Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and has been held there since. One reason he was not put on trial during that period was the fear that the brutal interrogation techniques used on him could have undermined the prosecution's case. Now he and two others held there have agreed to plead guilty to the murder of the 2,976 people listed in the charge sheet. In exchange they will not receive the death penalty. The other two men are Walid Muhammad Salih Mubarak Bin Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al-Hawsawi. Some relatives of those killed on 9/11 are deeply unhappy about the plea deal, describing it as a victory for the conspirators. The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty. Why is the US trying to stop him? How '9/11 mastermind' slipped through FBI's fingers A collection of photos of the victims of 11 September 2001, in the 9/11 museum in New York Flight safety was tightened around the world in the years following the 9/11 attacks. In the US, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to beef up security at airports and on planes. It took more than eight months to clean up ""Ground Zero"" - the site of the fallen Twin Towers. A memorial and a museum now stands on the site, and buildings have risen up again, to a different design. The completed centrepiece - One World Trade Center, or ""Freedom Tower"" - stands even higher (1,776ft (541m) than the original North Tower, which was 1,368ft. Reconstruction at the Pentagon took just under a year, with staff back in their offices by August 2002.

NI Assembly recalled in tribute to Lord TrimbleMLAs are remembering the former UUP leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner who died a week ago.Northern Ireland,"Lord Trimble died last week, aged 77 Politicians from across the political divide in Northern Ireland have gathered at Stormont to pay tribute to Lord Trimble. The assembly was recalled for a special sitting on Tuesday afternoon. MLAs were given the opportunity to remember the former Ulster Unionist Party leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, who died last week aged 77. UK and Irish prime ministers were among mournersat his funeral in Lisburn, County Antrim, on Monday. Lord Trimble led the UUP from 1995 to 2005 and was the first person to serve as first minister of Northern Ireland. This video can not be played ""David leaves this world with the blessing of a good name here on earth."" He was instrumental in the negotiations and signing of theGood Friday Agreement in 1998, which brought to an end the worst of 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. Lord Trimble's extraordinary life of ups and downs Trimble had 'considerable strength of character' Tuesday's sitting was led by Speaker Alex Maskey. He opened with his own tribute to Lord Trimble, describing him as a ""complex and thoughtful character"" who carried a heavy burden as the leader of unionism. ""There is no doubt David Trimble took risks and took decisions often in the face of fierce opposition when it would have been personally easier for him not to do so,"" Mr Maskey said. ""David and his family made sacrifices and paid a personal price for the leadership he showed, but the Good Friday Agreement and this Assembly do exist because of him."" Ulster Unionist Party leader, Doug Beattie, said that before 1998 unionists and nationalists would not have been seen in the same room together, ""never mind share a handshake or form a government with joint responsibilities"". He contrasted that to scenes at Lord Trimble's funeral on Monday where political leaders from across the divide came together. ""At David's humble and dignified funeral, handshakes and pats on the shoulder were offered freely from every political corner with warm words of condolence - that's progress,"" he said. ""David's life was one of service...he had a vision focused on peace and on ending the sectarian divide while protecting Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom."" Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), laid a wreath under the portrait of the party""s former leader at Stormont Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, paid tribute to Lord Trimble's ""courage and generosity"", as she recognised the personal risks he took to achieve peace. But Ms O'Neill also noted that 2023 will mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. ""It would be a travesty if the political accommodation which the agreement is, the political institutions, and the relationships north-south and east-west are not reset between now and then,"" she added. ""History will be kind to David Trimble for the huge part he played, but it will be unforgiving to those of you who obstruct progress or refuse to show leadership."" DUP minister Edwin Poots noted that he was one of only four current MLAs left, who was elected to the Assembly of 1998 and shared the chamber with Lord Trimble. ""His ability and intellect was evident for all to see,"" Mr Poots said. ""His attention to detail was second to none. Actually, so much focused on the detail sometimes he didn't focus on the message, but he was so focused on the detail. ""He was brave, in that he took on the challenges that came his way and they weren't easy, particularly in a constituency like Upper Bann where the unionist population is very strong unionist population and they were certainly uneasy with much of what he was doing, and that transpired in future elections. But he was a dedicated unionist."" Alliance Party MLA Andrew Muir described Lord Trimble as a ""complex character"", and said that while he would not have agreed with him on some matters, he said he had made a ""significant, substantial and positive contribution"". ""Northern Ireland is, thankfully, a very different place now than it was back in 1998, but we should not kid our self that we don't have much further to travel. We do,"" he said. ""The prize of a truly reconciled people, a place where everyone is proud to call home, and fully functioning institutions sadly remains yet to be achieved. ""With so many of the giants of the peace process now no longer with us, current and future generations turn to us all here to take the baton on and complete the journey set out in 1998."" SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said ""very few politicians are able to claim a record of achievement as profound as that of David Trimble"". He noted successive leaders of unionism ""struggling to deliver meaningful compromise without the demon accusations of Lundyism and treason"". ""Trimble faced these accusations too, but stuck at it,"" he said. ""Dogged, diffident, sometimes difficult. He used a legal mind and remarkable tenacity to achieve - and then implement - a deal which esteemed both historic traditions and constitutional aspirations and acknowledged the interconnectedness of this island, and of both islands."" Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey signs the book of condolence for Lord Trimble at the Great Hall, Stormont, on Tuesday Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister started off by saying he disagreed with Lord Trimble on the Good Friday Agreement. He said the assembly had been failing and dysfunctional since it was set up in 1998. However, Mr Allister paid tribute to Lord Trimble as ""more honest politically"" than ""those who supplanted him as the leader of unionism"". ""I'm happy that in latter times I found common cause with Lord Trimble in opposing the [Northern Ireland] Protocol, and he was of course a joint applicant in the ongoing judicial review challenge to that protocol."" Mr Allister also recalled Lord Trimble as a law academic at Queen's University when he was a student, and described him as a ""supreme academic and someone who was an intellectual of giant proportions"". MLAs have also signed a book of condolence. Speaking afterwards, former Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader, Mike Nesbitt, said the only fitting tribute to Lord Trimble would be ""to get the institutions at Stormont back up and running again"" to deal with issues that remain, including the protocol. ""What we are dealing with are challenges but they are nothing like the challenges that David Trimble had to overcome 25 years ago,"" he said. The assembly will also sit again on Wednesday to try again to elect a new Speaker. Mr Nesbitt said his party questions the point of the assembly recall on Wednesday, adding that ""it is not going to go anywhere"". He urged urged party leaders to get together ""quietly and privately to resolve the differences"". The assembly has not been sitting becausethe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to vote for a Speaker. The party is refusing to re-enter power sharing as part of its protest overthe Northern Ireland Protocol. Without a Speaker, the assembly cannot function, but a Speaker can only be elected with support from a majority of unionist and nationalist members and this is not possible without the DUP. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said his party would not be supporting the election of a new Speaker.

"Child services concerns remain after boy's murderInspectors says ""urgent action"" is needed in the area where Logan Mwangi was murdered by his family.Wales","Five-year-old Logan Mwangi was removed from the Child Protection Register a month before his death There are still ""serious concerns"" about children's services in the area where a five-year-old boy was murdered by his family, inspectors have said. Despite themurder of Logan Mwangi in July 2021, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) said ""urgent action"" was needed in Bridgend. It noted some improvements since its April 2021 inspection. Logan was murdered by his mother, step-father and a teenage boy. Bridgend council said it had an ongoing action plan for improvements. The Welsh government said it was disappointed that such improvements were needed. The routine inspection took place between 23 and 27 May 2022, nearly a year after Logan was killed and his body was dumped in the River Ogmore close to his home in Sarn. His mother Angharad Williamson, step-father John Cole and Craig Mulliganwere given life sentences for his murder. Mum who drowned son, 2, given hospital order Independent review needed of Wales' social services Mulligan was not biologically related to any of them, but Cole had raised him since he was nine months old and considered himself a father figure. Angharad Williamson, 31, Craig Mulligan, 14, and John Cole, 40, were all given life sentences for Logan's murder On 16 August 2020, Logan was taken to hospital by Williamson who said he dislocated his shoulder when he fell down the stairs the day before. Doctors discovered Logan had a broken arm and the hospital made a referral to social services. The following June, social workers in Bridgend removed Logan and his younger sibling from the child protection register - meaning they were no longer considered to be at significant risk of harm. A child practice review looking at the circumstances around Logan's death and the involvement of professionals in his and his family's life is due to be published in the autumn. Logan's death came a month before two-year-old Reid Steelewas drowned in the bath at his home by his ""devoted"" mother, just over three miles away from where Logan was murdered. Natalie Steele, 32,admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibilityafter killing her son while suffering paranoid delusions and was given a hospital order. Reid Steele's family said he was caring and was always asking everyone if they were OK The inspection report said there were concerns with Bridgend's Information Advice and Assistance (IAA) service and its ability to protect and promote the wellbeing of vulnerable children and families. Inspectors said there were problems with recruiting and retaining staff, as well as staff absence. They said this had led to the loss of experienced staff and an ""over reliance"" on newly qualified and agency social workers. Logan's body was found 250m away from the home he shared with his family Chief inspector of CIW Gillian Baranski said she was pleased to see that some improvements had been made. She added: ""However, further urgent action must be taken to secure and sustain improvement in the care and support for children and families in Bridgend. ""This work must be prioritised to ensure the best possible outcomes for children. We will continue to liaise with the local authority's senior leaders and are closely monitoring the local authority's performance."" Logan's dinosaur pyjama top was found with a tear down one side The inspection also found records of missing children and children at risk of exploitation were not ""sufficiently detailed"" to ensure appropriate action had been taken in a timely way. Inspectors said analysis of risks such as a history of domestic abuse and exploitation needed to be strengthened, while a drop in the number of council foster carers and foster placements led to delays in providing foster carers with relevant information. The report said: ""The workforce is striving relentlessly to support children and families, however, it is clear demand is outstripping available resource."" CIW said it expected the council to address the concerns as soon as practicable and it would be closely monitoring its progress. It'll worry many that there are still serious concerns about children's services in an area where five-year-old Logan Mwangi and two-year-old Reid Steele died in the summer of 2021. Some of the problems reflected by inspectors are ones already well reported in councils across Wales during, and prior to, the Covid-19 pandemic. Recruitment and retention of employees, staff absences and high demand are well-known problems which have led to calls for an independent review of Welsh children's services. But there are additional, and significant, problems in Bridgend that aren't just a result of the pandemic. We'll have to wait to find out more about the involvement of professionals - including social workers - in Logan's life when the child practice review is published later this year. The council's cabinet member for social services Jane Gebbie said the authority would continue working closely with inspectors to make further improvements and that management oversight and decision making had improved. She added: ""We are actively recruiting new employees and are carefully redeploying existing staff to provide additional support in areas experiencing the most pressure. ""I would like to thank our children's services workforce for the commitment and dedication that they have demonstrated during the considerable challenges of the pandemic and beyond."" Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds, who worked as a child protection social worker for more than 25 years, said this report re-emphasised the need for a Wales-wide inquiry as is happening in England and Scotland. ""The report lacks context and does not tell me as a Senedd Member how Bridgend are doing in comparison to Wales as a whole and how they could be supported with good practice from other local authorities."" The Welsh Conservatives reiterated the call for a Wales-wide review of children services. Welsh Conservative spokesperson Gareth Davies MS said: ""Logan's murder was a tragedy and policy makers must focus on preventing anything like this horrific killing happen again"". Health Minister Eluned Morgan said: ""We will expect to see improvements and, of course, we are very concerned that we need to do the very best for the most vulnerable children."" She added that an independent inquiry would distract the government from its day job, of making sure that services are improved.

Arrest warrant issued for arena bomber's brotherIsmail Abedi was convicted after failing to appear to give evidence to the Manchester Arena Inquiry.,"Ismail Abedi has refused to answer questions about the Manchester Arena attack An arrest warrant has been issued for the Manchester Arena bomber's brother. Ismail Abedi, 29, was convicted in his absence in July offailing to appear at the Manchester Arena Inquiryafter being ordered to give evidence. Abedi, who uses the name Ben Romdhan, had refused to answer questions on the grounds he could incriminate himself and later fled the UK. His younger brother Salman Abedi killed 22 people and injured hundreds more in the terror attack on 22 May 2017. His other brother Hashem Abedi, who helped plan the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, was jailed in August 2020 after beingconvicted of murdering all those who died. Sir John Saunders, the chairman of the public inquiry, had demanded Ismail Abedi appear at the hearing. In May 2020, Ismail Abedi was asked to provide a witness statement but, in July of that year, he responded in writing, saying he would not provide a witness statement, ""because I am concerned about the risk of self-incrimination"". He was told that failure to comply was a criminal offence, to which he replied he did not wish to answer the questions and asserted he wished to claim privilege against self-incrimination. What is the Manchester Arena Inquiry? Arena bomb brother leaves UK before court hearing Bomber's brother convicted over inquiry no-show The inquiry pointed out that such privilege could only ever be claimed on a question by question basis, not in blanket form. He then asked for immunity from prosecution from the attorney general before he would agree to give evidence, but the inquiry chairman refused the application. A formal notice was then issued requiring the defendant to attend the inquiry on 21 October 2021, but he did not attend. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the attack Last month, he was convicted at Manchester Magistrates' Court of failing to comply with a legal notice to attend the inquiry as a witness. District Judge Jack McGarva said he was ""satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"" he had ""no reasonable excuse for not attending"" and he was ""guilty of the offence as charged"". Prosecutor Sophie Cartwright QC told the court that notification of Tuesday's hearing had been sent to Ismail Abedi's last known address, an email address he had previously used and his former solicitors. The judge said he was satisfied that Ismail Abedi was aware of the hearing and also noted that the proceedings had had a ""great deal of publicity"". Issuing a warrant without bail, he said: ""We will now have to wait for him to be apprehended."" He faces a jail term of up to 51 weeks for the offence. The news of the warrant has been welcomed by a number of the victims' families. Kim Harrison, whose firm Slater and Gordon has represented 11 families at the inquiry, said they remained ""gravely concerned as to why Abedi was able to leave the country before giving evidence"". ""The families deserve to know the truth about what happened that night and the contempt Ismail Abedi has shown them is truly despicable,"" she added.

Warning energy bills to rise by more than expected,"The price cap is expected to go up again in October Typical domestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,600 a year this winter, according to a new forecast. Consultancy Cornwall Insight said the typical gas and electricity bill in England, Wales and Scotland could reach Â£3,615 in the new year - hundreds of pounds more than previous predictions. The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living. However, some have called for more support for families. The average energy bill was Â£1,400 a year in October 2021. The last energy price cap increase, in April 2022, saw that rise to around Â£2,000. The price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales - is expected to go up again in October. Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem Cost of living: Share your experiences Cornwall Insight told BBC Breakfast that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,358 a year from October, then Â£3,615 a year from January. That is much higher than earlier predictions. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said rising wholesale gas prices and concerns over Russian supply were behind the big leap, and warned the government help announced ""will only scratch the surface of this problem."" ""However, while the rise in forecasts for October and January is a pressing concern, it is not only the level - but the duration - of the rises that makes these new forecasts so devastating,"" he said. ""Given the current level of the wholesale price, this level of household energy bills currently shows little sign of abating into 2024. In May, energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household should expect to see an Â£800 increase in October, to Â£2,800 a year. However, it subsequently admitted that""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"". Last month, BFY, a management consultancy, predicted a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January. Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe One-in-five nightclubs closed since pandemic began The energy price cap sets a limit on the amount that can be paid for each unit of energy. It is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. This has risen sharply, fuelled by the war in Ukraine whichhas threatened supplies from Russia. Many families are already facing soaring costs, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising -at the highest in 40 years. Last week, personal finance expert Martin Lewis said people would be ""panicking"" over their energy bills, andwarned it would ""be desperate"" when bills rise this winter. ""It's going to throw many households into a terribly difficult financial situation,"" he told the BBC. Mr Lewis said that more needed to be done now to help the poorest households. A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""While no government can control global gas prices, we are providing Â£37bn of help for households including the Â£400 discount on energy bills, and Â£1,200 of direct support for the most vulnerable households to help with the cost of living."" Last week, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive that Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumnwith the money paid in six instalments. The energy bill discount is part of awider package of measures to tackle soaring prices. Other measures include a Â£650 payment to more than eight million low-income households. The first instalment of payments to those on benefits started being made from 14 July. How much are energy bills going up?

House prices climb 11% despite squeezeBut the Nationwide says there are signs of a slowdown and interest rate rises could cool the market.,"House prices are continuing to rise despite the growing cost of living crisis. The Nationwide said prices climbed 11% in the last 12 months, although the rise over the last month was just 0.1%. ""The housing market has retained a surprising degree of momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. But he said that there were ""tentative signs of a slowdown in activity"". The July figure was slightly ahead of June's annual rise of 10.7% and left the average house at Â£271,209. ""Demand continues to be supported by strong labour market conditions, where the unemployment rate remains near 50-year lows and with the number of job vacancies close to record highs,"" said Mr Gardner. ""At the same time, the limited stock of homes on the market has helped keep upward pressure on house prices."" The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates by as much as 0.5% on Thursday when and that could ""exert a cooling impact on the market"" he said. ""We continue to expect the market to slow as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set to reach double digits towards the end of the year."" Five charts that explain the cost of living crisis UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices First-timer buyer mortgage completions remain around 5% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Nationwide, despite the rising affordability pressures caused by the cost of living squeeze. ""First-time buyer numbers remain strong but that is likely to reflect significant financial input from the Bank of Mum and Dad, as deposit levels rise along with house prices and interest rates,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients. Borrowers remained extremely keen to secure a fixed-rate mortgage before rates go up again, as they are expected to later this week, he said. ""Minds are focused on getting deals done before the cost of borrowing inevitably rises further still."" ""Today's market is being fuelled by people's desperation to find a home before interest rates rise further and the cost of living crisis bites deeper,"" said Nicholas Finn, managing director of Garrington Property Finders. Thursday's expected bank rate rise to 1.75% will have a ""dampening effect on the market,"" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest. She predicted the effects of soaring inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze will ""add more pressure on the property sector"". ""There are a barrage of challenges to come - from the surge in energy prices in October, to runaway inflation continuing to outstrip wage growth - and the pressure on household finances will intensify."" Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said rises in mortgage rates will cause buyer demand to cool further. ""The rate for a two-year 75% loan-to-value fixed-rate mortgage already has increased to 2.88% in June from 1.57% in December - the fastest six-monthly increase since at least 1995,"" she said. That could rise to about 3.1% by the end of the year if the Bank of England increased rates in line with current market expectations, she added. If the recession many are predicting sees unemployment rise sharply, the property market will invariably take a hit, said Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco. ""Even then, though, the impact on prices will be limited due to the abject lack of supply and homes being built.""

Truss pledges civil service pay shake-up,"Liz Truss has said she wants to save taxpayers' money by ending national pay deals for civil servants' pay. The Tory leadership candidate wants to link civil servants' salaries to living standards where they work, meaning similar jobs could have different salaries depending on location. Ms Truss says the scheme could be rolled out to other public sector areas, saving Â£8.8bn a year. Labour called her plan ""a fantasy recipe for levelling down"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said it would reduce ""the pay of Northerners, worsening the divide which already exists"". Some Conservative MPs in the south-west of England have also come out strongly against the proposals, with Steve Double, a Rishi Sunak ally, saying it would be ""hugely damaging to public services in Cornwall"". And Ben Houchen - mayor of Tees Valley and another supporter of Mr Sunak - said: ""There is simply no way you can do this without a massive pay cut for 5.5 million people including nurses, police officers and our armed forces outside London."" But minister and Truss backer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""Anyone who currently works for the civil service will remain on their current terms but new people will be paid the market rate in the area in which they live - and that's quite rightly taking care of taxpayers' money."" He added that ""if the government is the highest payer, it then crowds out private sector investment."" Ms Truss is competing with former Chancellor Mr Sunak to become the next Conservative leader, and prime minister. The party's 160,000 or so members are voting on which of the two they want to replace Boris Johnson, and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Sunak vows to take 4p off income tax Ministers condemn knife image shared by Dorries Truss courts Johnson loyalists as Sunak faces jibes Ms Truss has also proposed scrapping jobs aimed at increasing inclusion and diversity in the public sector. In addition to introducing regional pay, Ms Truss has said she would save Â£137m by banning union representatives from getting paid time off to focus on union work. The foreign secretary also wants to reduce average civil service annual leave from 27 days to 25 and scrap Whitehall's diversity officers - something her team estimates could save Â£12m a year. Along with the proposed reforms to public sector pay, she says the total savings to the taxpayer would be up to Â£11bn. There are bits of tinkering here and there in Ms Truss's plans, like saving Â£12m a year from cutting civil service diversity officers. But the only way these plans will save ""billions"" is if they not only pay civil servants less in poorer areas - but other public sector workers too. Ms Truss says she'll only do this if it ""works"" when they introduce it for civil servants. Economically, the argument is that it's harder for private companies to hire people where public pay is higher and harder to compete with. But politically - it's very hard to see how she sells this. To save billions, she's arguing you'd need a situation where nurses, police, teachers - for example - would be paid less in Sunderland than ones in Surrey. Lots of policy has been pumped out in this campaign with headlines like 'Whitehall waste' to appeal to members. But dig in to the detail, and there are loads of questions about how some of these would work in practice. The foreign secretary has also been criticised fordescribingScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as an ""attention-seeker"". Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney said he was ""absolutely horrified"" and described the comments as ""obnoxious"". At a question session on Monday evening, Mr Sunak told party members he was the candidate for change. He was introduced to the stage in Exeter by former International Trade Secretary Liam Fox who said Mr Sunak had the ""character, courage, experience intellect and downright decency"" to win over swing voters. Ms Truss received her own campaign boost when she received the endorsement of trade minister Penny Mordaunt. Ms Mordaunt - who was knocked out of the race after finishing third in the polling among MPs - described Ms Truss as the ""hope candidate"". The FDA - the union for senior civil servants - said it was ""astounding"" Ms Truss was planning to move jobs out of London while at the same time cutting regional pay. Alex Thomas of the Institute for Government think tank said the idea of regional pay ""comes around every few years"". ""The reason why chancellors and prime ministers have previously tended to abandon it is the benefits are pretty marginal - both in terms of the cost you can save and the benefits to the local economy."" But the Taxpayers' Alliance argues it would help boost economic growth in regions such as the north-east of England and the Midlands by reducing inflated labour costs and thereby encouraging the private sector to invest in these areas.

BA halts sales of short-haul tickets from HeathrowThe airline suspends sales for a week in response to the airport's cap on passenger numbers.,"British Airways has suspended ticket sales for short-haul flights from Heathrow Airport for a further week until 15 August. On Monday, the airline said it had stopped selling the tickets until 8 August, but now it has gone a step further. The move is due to the cap on daily passenger numbers that the UK's biggest airport has imposed over the summer. The suspension will affect BA's flights to domestic and European destinations. Thousands of air travellers have been hit by disruption in recent months, including last-minute cancellations, which have been caused largely by staff shortages. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have found it difficult to recruit enough staff as demand for holidays has returned. Heathrow Airport has struggled to cope with the rebound in air travel and problems with its baggage handling systems have also led to passengers seeing huge delays in reclaiming their luggage. Will my summer holiday flights be cancelled? Don't expect great summer experience, warns airport boss Going on a summer holiday? Become a BBC Travel Watcher Last month,Heathrow told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as it said it would limit the number of passengers departing each day to 100,000 - 4,000 fewer than previously scheduled. The cap on numbers is set to remain in place until 11 September. As BA is the largest airline at Heathrow it is affected by the limit more than other carriers. It is understood the airline was close to reaching the number of passengers it could carry under the current limit. In a statement, BA said it had taken ""pre-emptive action to reduce our schedule this summer to give customers certainty about their travel plans"". ""When Heathrow introduced its passenger cap, we took a small number of additional flights from our schedule and to continue to comply with the cap, we've been taking responsible action by limiting sales or all the available fares on some of our Heathrow services to ensure more seats are available to rebook customers,"" the company said. The company added that it would ""continue to manage bookings to be within the Heathrow imposed cap"". BA could limit or suspend sales again while Heathrow's cap is in place. The impact will be mainly on short-haul flights, though long-haul routes could sometimes be affected. Aviation consultant John Strickland said BA's short-haul flights over the next week would effectively be full, leaving ""almost no room to manoeuvre to rebook passengers"" in the case of unforeseen problems such as bad weather. ""It therefore has little choice but to take seats off sale to protect for this eventuality and sacrifice last minute high price ticket sales,"" he said. Mr Strickland added that most last-minute sales go to business travellers, for which volume is lowest in August, ""so the sacrifice is minimal"". Consumer group Which? said the move by BA would reduce customer choice and lead to ""significant price increases"". On Tuesday evening, a direct flight from Heathrow to Frankfurt this coming Saturday cost a minimum of Â£617, compared with Â£243 in two weeks time, according to flight comparison website Skyscanner. Stopping selling some tickets from Britain's biggest airport in the lucrative summer peak, when demand is strong, is not something you'd normally expect an airline to be doing. But this isn't a normal summer. The decision follows Heathrow's extraordinary decision to limit traffic to a level the system can cope with, given ongoing resourcing challenges. It's understood British Airways was close to reaching the number of passengers it could carry under that cap this week. The decision is meant to prevent last-minute bookings. And it should leave some leeway in the system for where rebooking is needed. This isn't about cancellations - existing bookings aren't affected. But it will limit passengers' last-minute options at a time when capacity has been squeezed and many prices have risen. And it might not be the end - BA has made it clear that while Heathrow's passenger cap is in place, it may have to pause sales again. BA has cut nearly 30,000 flightsfrom its April-to-October schedule in response to staffing problems. On Friday, BA owner IAG reported itsfirst profit since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, despite facing what it called a ""challenging"" environment at Heathrow Airport. The company said the problems at Heathrow had forced British Airways to limit its capacity to 69.1% of pre-pandemic levels between April and June, and this was expected to increase to about 75% between July and October. A row broke out last weekbetween Ryanair and Heathrow, after the airline said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do"". But Heathrow hit back at the criticism, describing it as ""bizarre"". ""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots,"" said Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye. Virgin Atlantic also criticised the airport, claiming it was responsible for failures which were contributing to the chaos. Emirates Airlines had initially rejected Heathrow's request to cut flight capacity but lateragreed to cap salesfollowing talks between the two companies. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority and Civil Aviation Authority issued a joint letter to carriers raising concerns that some airlines may not be doing everything they could to avoid harmful practices, including selling more tickets for flights than they could reasonably expect to supply. Airports outside the UK have also faced issues. On Tuesday Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which has faced staff shortages, said it would continue to limit passengers in September and October to ensure safety and a reliable service.

"Truss pledges civil service pay shake-upBut Labour described her plans as a ""fantasy"" which would see pay cuts for those living outside London.","Liz Truss has said she wants to save taxpayers' money by ending national pay deals for civil servants' pay. The Tory leadership candidate wants to link civil servants' salaries to living standards where they work, meaning similar jobs could have different salaries depending on location. Ms Truss says the scheme could be rolled out to other public sector areas, saving Â£8.8bn a year. Labour called her plan ""a fantasy recipe for levelling down"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner said it would reduce ""the pay of Northerners, worsening the divide which already exists"". Some Conservative MPs in the south-west of England have also come out strongly against the proposals, with Steve Double, a Rishi Sunak ally, saying it would be ""hugely damaging to public services in Cornwall"". And Ben Houchen - mayor of Tees Valley and another supporter of Mr Sunak - said: ""There is simply no way you can do this without a massive pay cut for 5.5 million people including nurses, police officers and our armed forces outside London."" But minister and Truss backer Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ""Anyone who currently works for the civil service will remain on their current terms but new people will be paid the market rate in the area in which they live - and that's quite rightly taking care of taxpayers' money."" He added that ""if the government is the highest payer, it then crowds out private sector investment."" Ms Truss is competing with former Chancellor Mr Sunak to become the next Conservative leader, and prime minister. The party's 160,000 or so members are voting on which of the two they want to replace Boris Johnson, and the winner will be announced on 5 September. Sunak vows to take 4p off income tax Ministers condemn knife image shared by Dorries Truss courts Johnson loyalists as Sunak faces jibes Ms Truss has also proposed scrapping jobs aimed at increasing inclusion and diversity in the public sector. In addition to introducing regional pay, Ms Truss has said she would save Â£137m by banning union representatives from getting paid time off to focus on union work. The foreign secretary also wants to reduce average civil service annual leave from 27 days to 25 and scrap Whitehall's diversity officers - something her team estimates could save Â£12m a year. Along with the proposed reforms to public sector pay, she says the total savings to the taxpayer would be up to Â£11bn. There are bits of tinkering here and there in Ms Truss's plans, like saving Â£12m a year from cutting civil service diversity officers. But the only way these plans will save ""billions"" is if they not only pay civil servants less in poorer areas - but other public sector workers too. Ms Truss says she'll only do this if it ""works"" when they introduce it for civil servants. Economically, the argument is that it's harder for private companies to hire people where public pay is higher and harder to compete with. But politically - it's very hard to see how she sells this. To save billions, she's arguing you'd need a situation where nurses, police, teachers - for example - would be paid less in Sunderland than ones in Surrey. Lots of policy has been pumped out in this campaign with headlines like 'Whitehall waste' to appeal to members. But dig in to the detail, and there are loads of questions about how some of these would work in practice. The foreign secretary has also been criticised fordescribingScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as an ""attention-seeker"". Scotland's deputy first minister John Swinney said he was ""absolutely horrified"" and described the comments as ""obnoxious"". At a question session on Monday evening, Mr Sunak told party members he was the candidate for change. He was introduced to the stage in Exeter by former International Trade Secretary Liam Fox who said Mr Sunak had the ""character, courage, experience intellect and downright decency"" to win over swing voters. Ms Truss received her own campaign boost when she received the endorsement of trade minister Penny Mordaunt. Ms Mordaunt - who was knocked out of the race after finishing third in the polling among MPs - described Ms Truss as the ""hope candidate"". The FDA - the union for senior civil servants - said it was ""astounding"" Ms Truss was planning to move jobs out of London while at the same time cutting regional pay. Alex Thomas of the Institute for Government think tank said the idea of regional pay ""comes around every few years"". ""The reason why chancellors and prime ministers have previously tended to abandon it is the benefits are pretty marginal - both in terms of the cost you can save and the benefits to the local economy."" But the Taxpayers' Alliance argues it would help boost economic growth in regions such as the north-east of England and the Midlands by reducing inflated labour costs and thereby encouraging the private sector to invest in these areas.

"Rural thefts rise linked to cost-of-living crisisThe cost-of-living crisis has seen a rise in thefts of farm animals, vehicles and fuel, a report says.","Farm thefts last year were valued at Â£40.5m Theft of farmers' livestock, vehicles and fuel is on the rise due to the UK's cost-of-living crisis, according to a new countryside crime report. Rural crime claims payouts between January and March were over 40% higher than in 2021, insurer NFU Mutual says. It warned rising food prices could see livestock thefts increase further and contaminated meat enter the food chain. The NFU wants the government to launch a national taskforce to deal with rural crime. David Exwood, the NFU's vice-president, said: ""Taking a joined-up approach and establishing a cross-governmental task force - including Defra, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Chiefs Council and the Association of Police & Crime Commissioners - will be crucial if we are to prevent further impacts from crime on farm businesses, both financially and emotionally."" The NFU Mutual report warns that an increase in rustling - which saw an estimated Â£2.4m worth of farm animals stolen in 2021 - could see animals slaughtered in unhygienic conditions and sold on, threatening food security, animal welfare and people's health. Meanwhile, it said its claims data from the first half of this year indicate that fuel theft has more than doubled compared to the same period in 2021. Its survey found 49% of respondents felt fuel theft was now their greatest crime concern. The total cost of rural crime was estimated at Â£40.5m across the UK last year, an overall decrease on previous years and the second annual fall during the pandemic. Security measures, rural crime initiatives, quieter roads and community vigilance all played their part in suppressing countryside crime, the report found. But Rebecca Davidson, NFU Mutual's rural affairs specialist, said that this year farm theft is ""quickly gathering momentum as criminals make up for time lost over the past two pandemic years"" and that was having an impact on farmers' mental health. ""Crime in the countryside causes high levels of anxiety and disruption, with many farmers and rural home owners feeling vulnerable due to their isolated location,"" she added. ""The knowledge that determined thieves are scouring the countryside looking for targets, and returning to carry out night-time raids can lead to sleepless nights for people in remote areas.""

"Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,615 this winter","The price cap is expected to go up again in October Typical domestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,600 a year this winter, according to a new forecast. Consultancy Cornwall Insight said the typical gas and electricity bill in England, Wales and Scotland could reach Â£3,615 in the new year - hundreds of pounds more than previous predictions. The government has announced a package of measures to help households with the rising cost of living. However, some have called for more support for families. The average energy bill was Â£1,400 a year in October 2021. The last energy price cap increase, in April 2022, saw that rise to around Â£2,000. The price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for average energy usage in England, Scotland and Wales - is expected to go up again in October. Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem Cost of living: Share your experiences Cornwall Insight told BBC Breakfast that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,358 a year from October, then Â£3,615 a year from January. That is much higher than earlier predictions. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said rising wholesale gas prices and concerns over Russian supply were behind the big leap, and warned the government help announced ""will only scratch the surface of this problem."" ""However, while the rise in forecasts for October and January is a pressing concern, it is not only the level - but the duration - of the rises that makes these new forecasts so devastating,"" he said. ""Given the current level of the wholesale price, this level of household energy bills currently shows little sign of abating into 2024. In May, energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household should expect to see an Â£800 increase in October, to Â£2,800 a year. However, it subsequently admitted that""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"". Last month, BFY, a management consultancy, predicted a typical energy bill could hit Â£3,850 a year by January. Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe One-in-five nightclubs closed since pandemic began The energy price cap sets a limit on the amount that can be paid for each unit of energy. It is based on the price energy suppliers pay producers for electricity and gas. This has risen sharply, fuelled by the war in Ukraine whichhas threatened supplies from Russia. Many families are already facing soaring costs, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices are rising -at the highest in 40 years. Last week, personal finance expert Martin Lewis said people would be ""panicking"" over their energy bills, andwarned it would ""be desperate"" when bills rise this winter. ""It's going to throw many households into a terribly difficult financial situation,"" he told the BBC. Mr Lewis said that more needed to be done now to help the poorest households. A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""While no government can control global gas prices, we are providing Â£37bn of help for households including the Â£400 discount on energy bills, and Â£1,200 of direct support for the most vulnerable households to help with the cost of living."" Last week, the government announced how households in England, Scotland and Waleswill receive that Â£400 to help with rising fuel bills this autumnwith the money paid in six instalments. The energy bill discount is part of awider package of measures to tackle soaring prices. Other measures include a Â£650 payment to more than eight million low-income households. The first instalment of payments to those on benefits started being made from 14 July. How much are energy bills going up?

Rural thefts rise linked to cost-of-living crisis,"Farm thefts last year were valued at Â£40.5m Theft of farmers' livestock, vehicles and fuel is on the rise due to the UK's cost-of-living crisis, according to a new countryside crime report. Rural crime claims payouts between January and March were over 40% higher than in 2021, insurer NFU Mutual says. It warned rising food prices could see livestock thefts increase further and contaminated meat enter the food chain. The NFU wants the government to launch a national taskforce to deal with rural crime. David Exwood, the NFU's vice-president, said: ""Taking a joined-up approach and establishing a cross-governmental task force - including Defra, the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice, the National Police Chiefs Council and the Association of Police & Crime Commissioners - will be crucial if we are to prevent further impacts from crime on farm businesses, both financially and emotionally."" The NFU Mutual report warns that an increase in rustling - which saw an estimated Â£2.4m worth of farm animals stolen in 2021 - could see animals slaughtered in unhygienic conditions and sold on, threatening food security, animal welfare and people's health. Meanwhile, it said its claims data from the first half of this year indicate that fuel theft has more than doubled compared to the same period in 2021. Its survey found 49% of respondents felt fuel theft was now their greatest crime concern. The total cost of rural crime was estimated at Â£40.5m across the UK last year, an overall decrease on previous years and the second annual fall during the pandemic. Security measures, rural crime initiatives, quieter roads and community vigilance all played their part in suppressing countryside crime, the report found. But Rebecca Davidson, NFU Mutual's rural affairs specialist, said that this year farm theft is ""quickly gathering momentum as criminals make up for time lost over the past two pandemic years"" and that was having an impact on farmers' mental health. ""Crime in the countryside causes high levels of anxiety and disruption, with many farmers and rural home owners feeling vulnerable due to their isolated location,"" she added. ""The knowledge that determined thieves are scouring the countryside looking for targets, and returning to carry out night-time raids can lead to sleepless nights for people in remote areas.""

One-in-five nightclubs closed since pandemic began,"Boarded up nightclubs are appearing more and more in towns and cities across Britain Britain has 20% fewer nightclubs than it had when the country first went into lockdown in March 2020. Nightclubs have been in decline for the last 15 years or so and figures given to BBC News by the Night Time Industries Association - a trade body promoting the sector - highlight that the trend of closures is continuing. That's despite the government offering billions of pounds in grants and loans throughout the pandemic to support hospitality businesses which were forced to shut down. The NTIA recorded the lowest number of nightclubs on record - 1,130 - in its latest set of data, based on the situation in England, Wales and Scotland. In March 2020, when the figures were last published, the number was 1,418. The body is now warning that the ""culmination of pandemic debt, growing energy bills, workforce challenges, supply chain, increased insurance premiums, landlord pressures and product cost increases have created a perfect storm"". Some parts of the country fared worse than others, such as the Midlands in England, where nearly 30% of nightclubs have closed since the first lockdown just over two years ago. On Saturday night, Rosie Saveedra travelled from Halifax to Loughborough for a night out with her cousin Holly Jarram. ""I've never seen as many shutters on a Saturday as you do now,"" Holly told BBC News. ""The nightlife has certainly changed from 10 years ago, it used to be booming and full of people but now there's barely anybody in sight."" Since all social restrictionsin England were lifted, in July 2021, she's coming out ""a lot less"" than before Covid-19 ""purely because we used to work in the office and you'd go for drinks after work and it would turn into a night."" Rosie Saavedra and Holly Jarram describe the streets as ""being dead"" on a Saturday night now Working from home, and a change in routine for millions, is one of the major factors the hospitality industry hasn't fully recovered. Rosie thinks it's more noticeable in towns than cities, especially in Yorkshire. ""Venues are closing at quite a rapid rate,"" she told the BBC. ""The economy is going downhill so it's to be expected."" The NTIA said in a statement: ""Operating cost pressures coupled with consumers with less disposable income have seen the early stages of a recession with slowing ticket sales and visitor frequency."" Mohammed Abib's takeaway shop used to be opposite a nightclub - but it's closed down now The situation is also having a knock-on effect on other businesses. ""The price is going up and everyone is trying to save some money because the cost of living is going up day by day and we're struggling now,"" explained kebab shop manager Mohammed Abib in Loughborough town centre. He says the rate at which nightclubs are closing is having a direct impact on his business and he's worried about things getting worse. At 22:30 on Saturday night there were no customers in his Peri Peri Delight takeaway, next door to a building society that has ""where people make the difference"" printed on its front. Why are prices rising so quickly? Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,615 a year ""We used to have so many people queuing but now you can't see anybody,"" Mohammed explained to the BBC. Over the next hour there were never any more than three customers at one time in his shop. ""It's really hard and I've spoken to a few of my other friends who are running businesses and they're all struggling because the cost of the food products is almost double now,"" he said. ""We used to buy a box of wings for Â£13 and now it's Â£25 and we can't put our prices much higher because people can't afford it."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise that nightclubs are important cultural institutions and key drivers of local night time economies, but no national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy and other business costs."" Alice Wilde says ""nothing"" about the clubbing experience is the same price as it was before the pandemic What Mohammed describes is mirrored in other parts of the country, like in Stockton-on-Tees where 23-year-old Alice Wilde lives. She told BBC News she's going out clubbing a lot less with her friends and it's ""been a while"" since they went out. ""At the club we used to go to, a double used to be Â£2, now it's Â£3.50,"" she explained to the BBC. ""We all prefer staying in now because we can choose the music and we can walk to each other's houses. ""I can buy a bottle of vodka and a bottle of lemonade for half the price of a night out now and it'll probably last me to the next drinks gathering with my mates."" Now on the ""rare occasion"" Alice goes out it's for ""people's birthdays or celebrations"" and they'll drink more at home before heading to a club, rather than pay for alcohol in a bar or pub. Shaun O'Donnell has been a bouncer for 12 years but the venue he worked at before Covid hit didn't re-open Bouncer Shaun O'Donnell says, in his experience, customers are now more likely to avoid clubs and are instead choosing smaller venues where ""the drinks are slightly cheaper"". He told BBC News that the industry is struggling to recruit staff who want to do the late hours at the weekend as people found alternative employment when clubs were shut between March 2020 and July 2021 in England. ""Numbers are really low and the money's not great either so it's putting people off,"" he explained. ""Everyone's been off getting used to normal bed times and now you're asking people to work until 4 o'clock in the morning. Who really wants to do that?"" 'Catastrophic blow' as business rates appeals denied O'Donnell predicts ""smaller venues will survive"" but bigger ones won't when premisesstop benefiting from financial supportoffered to help non-essential retail premises in England as a result of social restrictions. Hospitality businesses were exempt from paying business rates up until June this year in order to ""grow and recover from unprecedented disruption"", but they now receive a third off the normal charge for the rest of the financial year. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We've stood behind the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic with a Â£400bn package of economy-wide support that saved millions of jobs and offered a lifeline to hundreds of night-time businesses up and down the country."" But NTIA CEO Michael Kill said: ""The government needs to recognise the economic, cultural, and community value of clubs and the wider night-time economy. We must protect these businesses, using every means possible, and recognise their importance before it's too late."" Hospitality businesses 'at risk' as costs soar Pub numbers fall to lowest on record How will hospitality survive after summer?

BP reports huge profits as energy bills soar,"BP has reported its biggest quarterly profit for 14 years after oil and gas prices soared. The energy giant saw underlying profits hit $8.45bn (Â£6.9bn) between April and June - more than triple the amount it made in the same period last year. It comes as typical household energy bills have been forecast tohit more than Â£3,600 a yearthis winter. The bumper profits have prompted calls for the government to tax firms further to help families with rising bills. BP's profits were the second highest for the second quarter in the firm's history. It follows a host of profit announcements from other firms including Shell, Equinor, TotalEnergies andBritish Gas owner Centrica, which have been reaping the benefits of higher gas and oil prices. Dale Vince, the founder of energy supplier Ecotricity said BP was ""holding a shedload of money that is coming from hard-pressed bill-payers in our country"", adding he believed it was time to increase taxation on the profits of oil and gas companies. ""Clearly there are exceptional windfall profits in the oil and gas sector, and clearly there's a problem in the energy market, and we should fix one with the other,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Campaign groups Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats also called for a tougher windfall tax on oil and gas firm profits. Professor Nick Butler, a former vice president of BP, said he believed the energy giant was ""very sensitive to the reputational problems of making money at this level"". He told the BBC there was a ""real case"" for the government calling together the industry ""to find a plan to get us through the winter"". ""You have Europe as a whole now cutting back gas use by 15% immediately, which is not happening here, and actually going out around the world to secure as much of the supply as they possibly can through the winter,"" he said. The government has introduced a package of measures to help people with energy bills, such as a Â£400 discount, and following political pressure, ministersannounced in Maythat oil and gas firms would pay anextra 25% on profits made in the UK. The tax applies from 26 May to profit made in the UK, which for most oil and gas companies is a small part of their operations. For BP, it accounts for a tenth of overall oil and gas production. BP will therefore not be required to pay the levy on the majority of the profits it made between April and June. The Treasury said it did not comment on ""individual taxpayers"", but added it expected the windfall tax, called the Energy Profits Levy, to raise about Â£5bn in its first year. Critics of a windfall tax argue it might hit pension funds invested in energy firms. However, pension funds are invested across different countries and industries, so a tax in one sector is unlikely to make a noticeable difference. The huge increase in profits for firms has been fuelled by higher prices for oil and gas, which have risen sharply due to the war in Ukraine. In recent months, Russia has reduced supplies to Europe following the invasion and fears are growing it may switch off the taps altogether. The potential of gas supply problems has led to the wholesale price soaring, which has led to energy firms passing those costs onto customers - pushing up household energy bills by unprecedented amounts. Higher oil prices have also led to the price of petrol and diesel reaching record highs at the pumps in recent months,although prices have started to fall slightly. How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? Could my energy bills go above Â£3,000? Energy giants see profits soar as bills rise Gas prices jump as Russia cuts German supply Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, told the BBC's Today programme that energy bills ""at this point in time"" looked set to stay high across 2023 and into 2024 and warned higher bills was ""a long-term problem for households."" He said current government help would make a ""dent"" in higher bills but was ""not going to offset this."" BP said its bumper profit results were driven by strong refining margins and oil trading. It announced it would boost shareholder payouts by 10% as well as buy back shares as a result of its higher earnings. Last year, chief executive Bernard Looney described the energy market as ""a cash machine"". But on Tuesday he said the company's staff had helped to solve an ""energy trilemma"" which he added was ""secure, affordable and lower carbon energy"". In a conference call he added: ""In terms of cost of living we all have to recognise that it's a very, very difficult place for people, not just, by the way, in the UK but across of the world right now. ""We understand that, we get it. Our people inside the company get it, they want to help."" Mr Looney said BP was ""backing Britain"" by investing Â£18bn in the country this decade. The company said its half-year figures were affected by a massive Â£19.9bn hit from its move to ditch the its near-20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft in response to the Ukraine war. Richard Hunter, head of markets at online investment firm Interactive Investor, said BP had ""already made some strong progress"" in recouping the financial pain of its Russian exit, adding BP's latest results were an ""early indication of the company's ability to repair such damage"". The contrast is stark but inevitable. The same high oil and gas prices emptying the pockets of consumers are filling those of the companies that sell it. BP's profit from April to June was triple the amount than last year and is the second highest in the company's long history. The company said it would increase its payments to shareholders by Â£3.6bn in the next three months. Those shareholders include most pension funds but these numbers sit uncomfortably alongside new estimates that average annual energy bills will cost over Â£3,600 a year. Insiders at BP and Shell, which announced record results last week, point out that a couple of years ago, both companies were losing billions and no-one was offering to subsidise their losses. Both companies have profited from soaring internationally-set oil and gas prices as a rise in post-Covid global demand has been exacerbated by attempts to cut Russia out of the international energy market.
