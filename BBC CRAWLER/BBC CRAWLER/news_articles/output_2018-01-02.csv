Iran's ruler blames unrest on 'enemies',"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people are taking to the streets Iran's supreme leader has accused the country's enemies of stirring days of protests that have claimed at least 21 lives. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking for the first time since people protesting at Iran's economic troubles clashed with security forces last Thursday. Nine people, including a child, died overnight in violence in central Iran, state media say. The protests are the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. They began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad, initially against price rises and corruption, but have since spread amid wider anti-government sentiment. In a post on his official website, Iran's supreme leader was quoted as saying: ""In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence services to create troubles for the Islamic Republic.""

He said he would address the nation about the recent events ""when the time was right"". Why are there protests in Iran? An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Analysts say the supreme leader's reference to ""enemies"" is a swipe at Israel, the US and regional rival Saudi Arabia. Tasnim news quoted Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, as warning Saudi Arabia that there would be a response from Iran ""and they know how serious it can be"". Musa Ghazanfarabadi, the head of Tehran's Revolutionary Court, in turn warned that the ringleaders of the protests would face harsh punishment. President Hassan Rouhani's words have been more measured. He has called the protests an ""opportunity, not a threat"", recognised economic discontent and said people had a right to take to the streets. However, he has also vowed to crack down on ""lawbreakers"". This video can not be played State TV shows protesters in the city of Qahderijan attacking a police station Reformist and moderate MPs have released a statement urging the authorities to be open to criticism and to be tolerant of the right to protest which, they said, was enshrined in the constitution. But they also accused the US of trying to take advantage of the situation. The Islamic Propagation Co-ordination Council, which organises state rallies, has called on people to turn out on Wednesday for pro-government events in Kermanshah, Alborz, Isfahan and Hormozgan provinces. Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs US warns Iran: The world is watching Who is Hassan Rouhani? There were reports on social media on Tuesday of more unrest, although it is not possible to confirm it independently or the exact timing. The reports spoke of shots being fired in Sanandaj, in Kurdistan province; a video showed protesters and security forces on the streets of the city of Hamedan; a second video appeared to show flash bombs or grenades being thrown in Rasht and a third showed street fires in Karaj. Other unrest was reported in Gohardasht and Eslamabad-e-Gharb. Nine deaths were reported overnight into Tuesday: Six protesters died in an apparent attempt to seize guns from a police station in the town of Qahderijan in the central province of Isfahan, state TV reported An 11-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were reported killed in the town of Khomeinishahr A member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards was fatally wounded in nearby Kahrizsang, state media say US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Iran's allegation that foreign enemies were behind the protests was ""complete nonsense"". She said the US also planned to call an emergency session at the UN. This video can not be played Nikki Haley: ""We must not be silent on Iran protests"" President Donald Trump has posted a string of tweets in support of the protesters and against Iran's leaders, the latest one on Tuesday.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, responded by saying Mr Trump should focus on ""the domestic issues of his own country, such as daily killings of dozens of people... and the existence of millions of homeless and hungry people"". In other reaction: The EU called on Iran to guarantee its citizens' right to peaceful protest, saying it had been in touch with the Iranian authorities and was monitoring the situation Turkey expressed concern at the unrest spreading and warned against any escalation France said it was concerned at the number of victims and arrests By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor When the protests started last Thursday, they were about the current economic crisis but as they spread, pent-up frustrations spilled out and politics became a big part of them. President Rouhani has been widely criticised. He has disappointed voters who hoped he would do more to turn round an economy that has been damaged by years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. Iran's role in conflicts across the Middle East has also been criticised as it is an expensive foreign policy at a time when people in Iran are getting poorer. Leading figures in the Islamic Republic have also been targeted by protesters, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. He has responded by blaming foreigners. Iran has suffered in the past from foreign interference, so his words will strike a chord among some - and could also signal a much tougher response from the security forces. The demonstrations do not seem to have recognisable leaders, unlike the last big protests after the disputed presidential election in 2009. At that time, the elite of the Islamic Republic was divided. It is not at the moment, so that will make it harder for the protests to be sustained, and they may run out of steam. But the fact they are happening at all is very significant. They show how discontented Iranians are with increasing poverty, after years of repression. Mass demonstrations - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the disputed election victory of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds in Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

Virgin Trains apologises for 'sexist' tweet,"Virgin Trains passenger Emily Cole said the tweet was ""patronising and belittling"" Virgin Trains has ""apologised unreservedly"" for a tweet which some social media users described as ""sexist"". In response to a passenger complaint about being referred to as ""honey"", the official Virgin Trains East Coast Twitter account asked if she would ""prefer 'pet' or 'love' next time"". The passenger, Emily Lucinda Cole, 27, said she was ""stunned"" by the response. Virgin Trains East Coast subsequently deleted their original tweet. Ms Cole was travelling on a busy train from Edinburgh, where she had been visiting friends and family for Hogmanay, to her home in London. ""They were telling passengers at the front desk and on the platform that they can sit in the basically empty first class coach and pay the weekend upgrade,"" she told the BBC. ""It was only after the train set off that they told us they'd all made a mistake and we had to move to try and find seats with all our luggage in the packed train. ""The first person to check my ticket was very abrasive. His response to my explaining the situation, politely and honestly, and that I wanted to complain, was 'you go ahead honey'. ""In the context and given his aggressive tone I can only assume he didn't like being challenged by a woman. ""I wouldn't have complained if he'd used the term in a familial or affectionate way. It definitely wasn't that."" At that point Ms Cole tweeted Virgin Trains East Coast. ""Their response was patronising and belittling,"" she said. ""Just the behaviour I was complaining about. ""It wasn't about the use of the term in isolation that's the problem but when these words are appropriated in such a passive aggressive way in response to a service complaint. ""They become part of a wider systemic issue of women being patronised and belittled."" Rail fare rises: Commuters 'priced off' UK trains, protesters say Clarks in sexism row over Dolly Babe girls' shoe Cara Delevigne Jimmy Choo advert called 'sexist' The tweet sparked a debate on social media. Journalists Owen Jones and Rebecca Manning Reid were among those to comment in support of Ms Cole's stance. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

AI could save heart and cancer patients,"Sir John Bell believes that artificial intelligence can save the NHS Researchers at an Oxford hospital have developed artificial intelligence (AI) that can diagnose scans for heart disease and lung cancer. The systems will save billions of pounds by enabling the diseases to be picked up much earlier. The heart disease technology will start to be available to NHS hospitals for free this summer. The government's healthcare tsar, Sir John Bell, has told BBC News that AI could ""save the NHS"". ""There is about Â£2.2bn spent on pathology services in the NHS. You may be able to reduce that by 50%. AI may be the thing that saves the NHS,"" he said. Currently cardiologists can tell from the timing of the heartbeat in scans if there is a problem. But even the best doctors get it wrong in one in five cases. Patients are either sent home and have a heart attack or they undergo an unnecessary operation. An artificial intelligence system developed at the John Radcliffe Hospital diagnoses heart scans much more accurately. It can pick up details in the scans that doctors can't see. It then gives a recommendation - positive - which means that it believes that there is a risk of the patient having a heart attack The system has been tested in clinical trials in six cardiology units. The results are due to be published this year in a peer-reviewed journal after they have been checked by experts, but Prof Paul Leeson, a cardiologist who developed the system, says that the data indicates that the system has greatly outperformed his fellow heart specialists. If confirmed, it will be available for free to NHS hospitals across the country. ""As cardiologists, we accept that we don't always get it right at the moment. But now there is a possibility that way may be able to do better."" The results from the clinical trials indicate that the system can do a lot better than consultants. There are 60,000 heart scans carried out each year and 12,000 of these are misdiagnosed. This is estimated to cost the NHS Â£600m in unnecessary operations and the treatment of people who had heart attacks following an all-clear scan. The AI system assesses the risk of heart disease and makes clinical recommendations The trial results suggest that the AI system could save the NHS more than Â£300m a year. The system, called Ultromics, was trained to identify potential problems by being fed the scans of 1,000 patients who Prof Leeson had treated over the past seven years, along with information about whether they went on to have heart problems. The lung cancer system can give very early warning of the disease. Another AI system is looking for signs of lung cancer. It searches for large clumps of cells called nodules. Doctors can't tell whether these clumps are harmless or will go on to become cancerous and so patients go on to have several more scans to see how the nodules develop. However, clinical trials have shown that this AI system can rule out the harmless cases - saving the NHS money and patients several months of anxiety. And it can also diagnose lung cancer much earlier. The system is also being commercialised by a start-up company called Optellum. Its chief science and technology officer, Dr Timor Kadir, says the resources freed up by the system could be redirected to early lung cancer screening, which would allow more than 4,000 cancer patients a year to be diagnosed much earlier and so have a greater chance of survival. ""Rather than focus on cost savings, within a resource-constrained system such as the NHS, we're really looking at how to offer better healthcare to more people for the same proportion of GDP. This is the potential of AI in the UK."" Dr Kadir estimates that the lung cancer diagnosis system could save Â£10bn if it was adopted in the US and the European Union.

Chef said she 'spiked' vegan meal,"Mike Gayle and Laura Goodman co-own Italian restaurant Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire An ""ill-judged"" Facebook comment in which a chef said she had ""spiked"" a diner's vegan meal has provoked an angry response from those fearing meat or other non-vegan food had been added. Shropshire Council said it was investigating complaints about Carlini in Albrighton, Shropshire. The restaurant denied anything untoward had been included in the food. Michael Gale, who co-owns the venue said ""spiked"" was ""poorly chosen"" language. Mr Gale, said his fiancÃ©e, Laura Goodman, had not ""fully realised the consequence of what it meant"". The year veganism went mainstream Midlands Live: Flood alerts issued as at least one person injured by fallen tree during storms Ms Goodman, also a co-owner of the restaurant, made the comments in a Facebook group called ""The Boring Group"" in the early hours of Saturday morning. The post initially mentioned a ""pious, judgemental vegan"", before Ms Goodman later wrote ""spiked a vegan a few hours ago"". The comments have since been removed. People responded to the post telling her that it was ""mean"" and ""disgusting and unacceptable"". Since the post was shared on social media, people have left angry reviews on Google causing the Italian restaurant in Albrighton, which has another branch in Shifnal, Shropshire, to be rated as one-star. Mr Gale added: ""In no way does this excuse the comment and we totally understand the anger it has subsequently caused. No meat was used in any of the dishes."" A spokesperson for the Food Standards Agency said: ""People should be confident about the food they buy and be able to choose according to their particular requirements, whether for diet and health or for personal taste and preference reasons.

Gaming addiction classified as disorder,"According to an Oxford University study, boys are more likely to spend time gaming than girls Gaming addiction is to be listed as a mental health condition for the first time by the World Health Organization. Its 11th International Classification of Diseases (ICD) will include the condition ""gaming disorder"". The draft document describes it as a pattern of persistent or recurrent gaming behaviour so severe that it takes ""precedence over other life interests"". Some countries had already identified it as a major public health issue. Many, including the UK, have private addiction clinics to ""treat"" the condition. The last version of the ICD was completed in 1992, with the new guide due to be published in 2018. The guide contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms and is used by doctors and researchers to track and diagnose disease. It will suggest that abnormal gaming behaviour should be in evidence over a period of at least 12 months ""for a diagnosis to be assigned"" but added that period might be shortened ""if symptoms are severe"". Symptoms include: impaired control over gaming (frequency, intensity, duration) increased priority given to gaming continuation or escalation of gaming despite negative consequences Dr Richard Graham, lead technology addiction specialist at the Nightingale Hospital in London, welcomed the decision to recognise the condition. ""It is significant because it creates the opportunity for more specialised services. It puts it on the map as something to take seriously."" But he added that he would have sympathy for those who do not think the condition should be medicalised. ""It could lead to confused parents whose children are just enthusiastic gamers."" He said he sees about 50 new cases of digital addiction each year and his criteria is based on whether the activity is affecting basic things such as sleep, eating, socialising and education. He said one question he asked himself was: ""Is the addiction taking up neurological real-estate, dominating thinking and preoccupation?"" Many psychiatrists refer to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the fifth edition of which was published in 2013. In that, internet gaming disorder is listed as a ""condition for further study"", meaning it is not officially recognised. Lots of countries are grappling with the issue and in South Korea the government has introduced a law banning access for children under 16 from online games between midnight and 06:00. In Japan, players are alerted if they spend more than a certain amount of time each month playing games and in China, internet giant Tencent has limited the hours that children can play its most popular games. A recent study from the University of Oxford suggested that, although children spend a lot of time on their screens, they generally managed to intertwine their digital pastimes with daily life. The research - looking at children aged eight to 18 - found that boys spent longer playing video games than girls. Researcher Killian Mullan said: ""People think that children are addicted to technology and in front of these screens 24/7, to the exclusion of other activities - and we now know that is not the case."" ""Our findings show that technology is being used with and in some cases perhaps to support other activities, like homework for instance, and not pushing them out,"" he added. ""Just like we adults do, children spread their digital tech use throughout the day, while doing other things.""

Commuters 'priced out' by fare rises,"This video can not be played Commuters react as rail fare rises take effect: ""It's gone up every year, relentlessly"" Average rail ticket prices have risen by 3.4% across the UK, in the biggest increase to fares since 2013. Many commuters have seen their season tickets go up by more than Â£100, while campaigners and unions warn many people were being ""priced off"" UK railways. Andy McDonald, the shadow transport secretary, said the railway network was ""fractured, expensive and complex"". The Department for Transport said price rises were capped in line with inflation and improved the network. Commuter routes that are now more expensive include Liverpool to Manchester (up Â£108 to Â£3,152), Maidenhead to London (up Â£104 to Â£3,092) and Elgin to Inverness (up Â£100 to Â£2,904). This video can not be played How do UK rail fares compare to Europe? Fare increases to regulated fares - which comprise about half of all tickets - are calculated using the previous July's Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure of inflation. Since 2007 the financial burden of running the rail system has increasingly fallen on passengers, after the government decided taxpayers as a whole should pay less via subsidies. Why are train fares going up? Are you joining the 'Â£5k commuter club'? Network Rail generates Â£4.8m from toilets Conservative MP Martin Vickers, a member of Parliament's transport select committee, sympathised with season ticket holders, but told Radio 4's World at One programme that it is appropriate for rail passengers to make their contribution to the system. ""The reality is that someone has to pay and it's either the tax payer or the users of the system,"" he said. He said the system of privatisation is ""far from perfect"" but added that it was the failings of Network Rail - which is nationalised - that is leading to the system's ""lack of capacity"". Campaigners have planned protests at busy rail stations, including Kings Cross in London Fares used to account for about half the cost of running our trains, whereas now it is about 70%. Paul Plummer, chief executive of industry trade body the Rail Delivery Group, said fare changes would provide cash for better services and investment, including the Thameslink and Great Northern rail upgrades. Speaking from London Bridge station,where five revamped platforms have been opened, he said fares were ""underpinning massively required investment"". Grayling 'in hiding' over fare rises Train fault cancels Labour fare rise protest Bruce Williamson, of campaign group Railfuture, says the lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation measure should be used for regulated fare increases. He argued that if CPI had been used rather than RPI since 2004, rail fares would be 17% lower. Transport Secretary Chris Graylingis out of the country for a ministerial visit to Qatar, but a government spokesman said the way fares were calculated was ""under review"". The spokesman said the government ""carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change"". Labour's Mr McDonald said his plans to join protests across the country were ""interrupted""after his train to Leeds broke down. Hetweeted,externala video message on board, saying: ""Let's take our railway back into public ownership."" Passenger Sarah Beer, from Lingfield in Surrey, pays nearly Â£4,000 a year for her rail commute to London, which she describes as an ""extortionate amount of money"". ""It is like watching the Great Train Robbery all over again,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""What I cannot grasp, in this day and age, is that all we ask for is a reliable train service."" Robin Keenan, from Waltham Abbey in Essex, said he has been priced out of his London-based job due to ticket costs. ""I'm starting a new job tomorrow that's a lot closer to home - so no more trains,"" he told BBC News. ""I've taken a Â£2,000 hit in my wages but I'll be saving that amount due to a short bike journey."" Many commuters expressed their frustration with the increases on social media.

Stephen Joseph, chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport (CBT), accused the government of choosing to ""snub rail passengers"" while fuel duty continued to be frozen. ""The extra money that season ticket holders will have to fork out this year is almost as much as drivers will save,"" Mr Joseph said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who hasfrozen fares across the capital's TfL network until 2020, questioned why ticket prices were going up elsewhere. ""It's a scandal that the government are allowing failing private train companies to increase rail fares again,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) union, warned people were being ""priced off"" UK railways. He told BBC News that public ownership of the railways was a ""necessary"" step. The union has staged fare protests in stations across England and Wales, with separate protests planned for 3 January in Scotland where it is a bank holiday. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said it was investing in the ""biggest modernisation of our railways since the Victorian times"". He said: ""This includes the first trains running though London on the Crossrail project, an entirely new Thameslink rail service, and continuing work on the transformative Great North Rail Project."" Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, said passengers would see a ""huge change"" in the coming year due to investment in rail networks. ""We all share the desire to try to keep fares as low as possible,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""My job is to run the network as efficiently as possible.""

'Dozens die' in Peru coach cliff plungeMore than 40 passengers are reported killed on a notorious coastal road north of Lima.3m3 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played Peru Pasamayo: Bus plunges off cliff At least 48 people have been killed after a coach plummeted 100m (330ft) down a cliff and landed upside down on a beach in Peru, officials say. The health ministry said six people had survived the accident, one of whom had jumped from the bus before it fell. The accident happened on a notorious stretch of road known as Curva del Diablo (devil's bend) in Pasamayo, north of the capital Lima. The coach, with more than 50 people on board, collided with a lorry. Transit police said the lorry driver had been detained for questioning. The bus, which belongs to the San MartÃ­n de Porres transport company, was travelling to Lima from Huacho, about 130km (80 miles) north of the capital. The stretch of road winding alongside the Pacific Ocean where the accident happened is considered one of the most dangerous in Peru. It has no barriers separating it from a sheer drop to the ocean and the sea spray and frequent fog can make it particularly slippery. The bus company that said its driver was very experienced and was travelling with an assistant. The company also said that the bus had passed a mechanical check before leaving Huacho. Footage showed rescue workers struggling to reach the bus, with a helicopter winching down some emergency workers while others were lowered down the cliff with ropes. The coach fell 100m down a cliff after colliding with a truck Rescue workers were lowered onto the beach by helicopters The coach landed on its roof Five people have been pulled from the wreckage alive - a sixth managed to jump out of a window Rescue work had to be halted overnight as the tide rose and engulfed parts of the coach. A Peruvian navy boat helped get the rescuers off the beach. Local media reported that one of the passengers managed to survive by jumping out of the coach before it plunged down the cliff. The doctor in the hospital where 24-year-old MÃ¡ximo JimÃ©nez Vilcayaure was being treated for a broken arm said the man had jumped out of a window with seconds to spare. Five other survivors were pulled from the wreckage and are being treated for multiple fractures. Twenty-four bodies have so far been recovered. Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said it was ""painful for the whole country to suffer an accident of this magnitude"". He sent a message of ""deep solidarity"" to the families of the victims.

"Footballer admits girlfriend attackJon Flanagan was seen kicking his girlfriend in Liverpool city centre, a court hears.3h3 hours agoLiverpool","Jon Flanagan admitted assault when he appeared before magistrates Liverpool footballer Jon Flanagan has pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend. The 25-year-old defender appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday accused of kicking Rachael Wall. He was charged following an incident at 03:20 GMT in Duke Street, in Liverpool city centre, on 22 December. He will be sentenced later this month. Liverpool-born Flanagan has made more than 50 first-team appearances for the club since making his debut aged 18. The court heard he had been seen on CCTV assaulting his partner, who he has been in a relationship with for 18 months. Lionel Greig, mitigating, said the victim had not provided a statement and there had been no previous instances of domestic violence in their relationship. Both parties were under the influence of alcohol at the time, he added. The judge told Flanagan he would face a community penalty District Judge Wendy Lloyd said she had been given a breakdown of the CCTV, which showed Flanagan assaulting his partner on ""several occasions"" and kicking her at one point. The case was adjourned to 17 January when Flanagan will be sentenced. Flanagan was a standby for England's 2014 World Cup squad, but has only played once for Liverpool this season and spent last season on loan at Burnley after a 20-month injury lay off. He has one England cap.

Parts of NHS in England on high alertHospitals in England are told to delay pre-planned operations and outpatient appointments this month.9m9 minutes agoHealth,"Tens of thousands of non-urgent NHS operations and procedures in England may be deferred until 31 January, due to winter pressures. Officials also told hospitals to delay routine outpatient appointments to concentrate on emergency care. Separately, a doctor apologised on Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in the hospital where he works in Stoke. NHS England's acute care director said hospitals were being given the ""time and space"" to manage January pressures. Officials reiterated that cancer operations and time-critical procedures should go ahead as planned. The advice comes as Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment. BBC reporter Dominic Johnson said Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre is asking patients to avoid its emergency department as it is on black alert, after seeing 140 patients at its peak on Tuesday evening.

Two ambulance trusts in England, east and north-east, say they are on the highest alert. NHS England's National Emergency Pressures Panel, which met on Tuesday, said it had extended the deadline for deferral of all non-urgent inpatient elective care - such as hip or knee replacements - to 31 January, to free up capacity for the sickest of patients. NHS England also gave hospitals the green light to put patients in mixed sex wards. Director of acute care Professor Keith Willett said that the delay of non-urgent operations was not a crisis, and added the NHS in England was reacting to concerns from doctors and nurses over a rise in flu incidents, as well as predicted cold weather. He said: ""With the incidents of flu rising in the community and in our hospitals, and the pressures that we always see in the first few weeks of January... that it's important we give the hospitals time and space to manage the demand that we anticipate will come through."" Each year the service comes under increased pressure in the winter, largely as a result of an increase in certain illnesses over this period, such as flu. It is too early to judge how bad this year's pressures are compared with previous years. The NHS does release regular statistics, but these are not real-time - meaning there is always a lag of a week or two to learn the full picture. NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter Milton Keynes University Hospital said it was facing pressure as a result of ""very high numbers of patients seeking emergency medical care"". It said the hospital had opened an ""unprecedented number of escalation [extra] beds"" in order to provide care for acutely unwell patients and warned that patients attending its emergency department would be treated in order of clinical priority. The hospital's chief executive, Prof Joe Harrison, said: ""We are seeing very high numbers of very sick patients in the emergency department and fewer patients being able to be discharged - many because they also remain in need of acute care. ""I would urge people to avoid the hospital's emergency department unless it is a genuine emergency. ""Staff are working under incredible pressure to look after the patients in our care. I cannot overstate that. We are doing our best in extraordinarily difficult circumstances."" BBC News health editor Hugh Pym The NHS is always under great pressure in the New Year - with some patients holding off over the festive season before going into A&E. Hospitals have planned intensively for the higher anticipated demand over winter. But the service seems under even more strain than previous years. The fact that NHS England has felt the need to call for further restrictions on non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments underlines concerns at the highest level. It has decided to give the green light to hospitals to put patients in mixed sex wards if they have to. NHS England notes a higher number of flu cases and can only hope that its own warnings about a flu outbreak don't materialise. Meanwhile, Dr Richard Fawcett, whose Twitter profile lists him as a consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, apologised via Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department.

Monkeys killed in safari park fire,"This video can not be played Woburn Safari Park: 'Nothing could be done' to save monkeys Thirteen monkeys have died in a fire at Woburn Safari Park. The roof of the patas monkey house, within the African Forest drive-through enclosure, collapsed as a result of the blaze, which Bedfordshire Fire Service believes was caused by a generator. Fire crews arrived at 02:37 GMT to find the outbuilding ""well alight"" and spent two hours putting out the flames. ""Devastatingly"", the park said, none of the animals could be saved despite the efforts of staff and crews. In a statement, the park said all the other animals in the jungle drive-through enclosure were being monitored, but early signs suggested they had not been affected. Fire crews were called to Woburn Safari Park in Bedfordshire in the early hours of Tuesday morning Fire crews were called to the enclosure at 02:37 GMT A member of the park's security staff spotted the fire during a routine patrol, Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said. It took fire crews two hours to put it out and the attraction opened to the public later in the morning, with the jungle enclosure remaining sealed off. Woburn's managing director, Drew Mullin, said some of the keepers were in tears as they tried to deal with what had happened. ""People come here in their cars and the monkey will climb over the top of the car. For them, that's a joyous, fun moment,"" he said. ""But behind the scenes, you've got animal keepers who know each and every one of those monkeys, they know them by name and every day when they come in, they go to see them. This morning they didn't."" At the scene: Sarah Jenkins, BBC News Online When I entered the park I was told ticket prices had been reduced due to ""an incident in the monkey enclosure"". The rest of the safari park is operating as usual. It's a quiet day at the park, and visitors I spoke to at the popular attraction said they were not aware of the blaze. The road leading to the enclosure has been cordoned off and it is difficult to see any evidence of the blaze. While I've been at the park, I have seen a police car on the grounds but it is unclear whether it is related to the fire. Mr Mullin told Sky News that on fire crews' arrival, the building's roof had already collapsed. Station commander Paul Goddard said crews were ""surprised at the amount of animals still in the cage [which] couldn't get out"" while they were putting out the blaze. ""The staff at the site were devastated,"" he added. Patas monkeys can grow as long as 85cm (33in) and can live up to 20 years It followsa fire at London Zoo on 23 December, in which an aardvark and four meerkats died.

Murder charge over Finsbury Park death,"The body of Iuliana Tudos was discovered near the sports ground in Finsbury Park A man has been charged with the murder of a woman who went missing on Christmas Eve. Iuliana Tudos, 22, was found in a disused building inside Finsbury Park, London, on 27 December. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a stab wound to the abdomen and a head injury. Kasim Lewis, 31, from north London, was charged on Tuesday and will appear before Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. He was taken into custody from an address in Dalston, east London, on Monday. Pub worker Ms Tudos, known by friends as Julie or Lili, was last seen as she headed for a bus home from Camden. She was due to meet friends in Enfield, north London, later that evening before spending Christmas Day there, but never arrived. She had been working at World's End pub for eight months before she disappeared. Brendan Lucey, operations manager, said Ms Tudos was ""a brilliant, bright, kind, funny young lady, loved by us all and the wider Camden community which she served"". He added: ""We are devastated and our family at World's End are grieving for the loss of our friend. ""Our thoughts are with Julie's own family and friends at this unimaginably sad time."" One card to Ms Tudos said she was a ""happy and bubbly girl who would always make me laugh"" Cards and flowers were attached to a sign in Finsbury Park near the police cordon. One note described Ms Tudos as ""beautiful"" and said: ""I will miss all the memories and the laughs we had together."" Another said she was a ""happy and bubbly girl who would always make me laugh"". A drive to raise Â£4,000 to help Ms Tudos's family cover the cost of the funeral has led to more than Â£16,400 in donations.

Footballer admits girlfriend attack,"Jon Flanagan admitted assault when he appeared before magistrates Liverpool footballer Jon Flanagan has pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend. The 25-year-old defender appeared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday accused of kicking Rachael Wall. He was charged following an incident at 03:20 GMT in Duke Street, in Liverpool city centre, on 22 December. He will be sentenced later this month. Liverpool-born Flanagan has made more than 50 first-team appearances for the club since making his debut aged 18. The court heard he had been seen on CCTV assaulting his partner, who he has been in a relationship with for 18 months. Lionel Greig, mitigating, said the victim had not provided a statement and there had been no previous instances of domestic violence in their relationship. Both parties were under the influence of alcohol at the time, he added. The judge told Flanagan he would face a community penalty District Judge Wendy Lloyd said she had been given a breakdown of the CCTV, which showed Flanagan assaulting his partner on ""several occasions"" and kicking her at one point. The case was adjourned to 17 January when Flanagan will be sentenced. Flanagan was a standby for England's 2014 World Cup squad, but has only played once for Liverpool this season and spent last season on loan at Burnley after a 20-month injury lay off. He has one England cap.

Thousands raised after donations stolen,"The hospice is based in the Grade I-listed Thorpe Hall in Longthorpe, Peterborough A charity says it has had an ""overwhelming"" response after a thief stole a donation box from one of its hospices on Christmas Day. About Â£250 was taken from Sue Ryder's Thorpe Hall centre in Peterborough. Afterwards, the charitywrote an open letter,externalto the thief on its website, prompting more than Â£1,000 in donations to be delivered in person, with more raised online. ""So many people have helped,"" said Hospice director Allison Mann. It is believed the suspect got in through a door which had been left unlocked so ""the family of a patient who had just died could come in and say their final goodbyes"". ""A golf club have arranged some impromptu fundraising at one of their events, while another supporter has pledged to do a [sponsored] sky dive,"" said Ms Mann, speaking toBBC Radio Cambridgeshire. A local mosque has donated Â£500 and anonymous person handed staff Â£250. Thorpe Hall said it had also had a pledged made by a woman from New Zealand who had read about the theft. Sue Ryder said it could not be certain how much has been raised specifically for Thorpe Hall by online donations on its website. No-one has been arrested in connection to the theft, which took place at around 05:30 GMT, and police are continuing to appeal for information. Addressing the person responsible, the charity wrote: ""Obviously we hope you never need us but we'll be here for you too if you do.""

Grayling 'in hiding' over fare rises,"Chris Grayling has insisted he is not ""shirking"" his job by travelling to Qatar on the day the biggest rise in UK rail fares since 2013 came into effect. The transport secretary told the BBC he regrets the level of fare increase and wishes ""it wasn't as high as it is"". But he said he was ""trying to win jobs for Britain"" by going to the Gulf. Labour said Mr Grayling had ""gone into hiding"" as protests took place at 40 stations against the fare rises. Many commuters have seen their season tickets go up by more than Â£100. The government has insisted Mr Grayling's trip to Qatar was ""pre-planned"", but it has been seized upon by opposition parties, who claim it shows his disregard for commuters. Speaking to Radio 5 Live from the Middle East, Mr Grayling - who is MP for Epsom and Ewell - said he cannot ""unpick decades of arrangements within the rail industry"". ""It's not fair to say to tax payers who use the railways you have to pay the cost of running the network. All this is part of giving the passengers a better system,"" he said. ""We have to give staff a pay rise. We want to see the industry come in to line with CPI, we can't guarantee there won't be a rise in fares."" Commuters 'priced out' by fare rises Train fault cancels fare rise protest Train fares: Why are they still going up? He defended his absence from the UK and his decision to travel to the Gulf state on a two-day trade visit. ""I make no apology for trying to win jobs for Britain,"" he said. In an earlier interview with LBC radio, he said: ""This increase was announced a month ago, and I've done radio interviews about it and answered questions in the House of Commons, so I don't think I've shirked the issue."" Downing Street said ""we've known [the fare rises] were coming for a while"" and a full response had been issued. But Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Mr Grayling had gone ""into hiding"" because he was ""unable to defend"" the fare hike, and was also ""refusing to explain the Â£2bn taxpayer bailout of Virgin East Coast"". ""Passengers deserve better than this,"" he added. Mr McDonald said he had been forced to cancel plans to take part in a protest against the rail fare in Leeds after his train from London Kings Cross broke down. ""If anything ever demonstrated just how broken this system is it's this today,"" he added. Mr Grayling's visit to Qatar will be followed by a day in Turkey. Asked about the purpose of the visit, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""There are ministers visiting a whole host of countries spreading the message that Britain is a very good place to invest and to do business in. Chris Grayling obviously plays an important part in that."" A government spokesman said the way fares were calculated was ""under review"" and the transport department ""carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change"". Campaigners have planned protests at busy rail stations, including Kings Cross in London Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""Rail passengers are shivering on platforms angered by the biggest fare increase in years while Chris Grayling is off globetrotting. ""It's very difficult to see what useful function he can perform in Qatar and Turkey that our excellent trade officials could not."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said passengers forking out more for train travel will ""draw their own conclusions"" from Mr Grayling's decision to take a ""trip to the Qatari sunshine"". Mr Grayling is one of a number of ministers mentioned in press speculation over the weekend about a possible cabinet reshuffle. Asked whether he would remain transport secretary for the foreseeable future, the PM's spokesman said: ""Chris Grayling is working hard and doing a good job as transport secretary.""

Why are fares still going up?,"Millions of rail passengers will have to pay up to 3.6% more for their train tickets from next January, following the release of the latest inflation figures. The current version of the fares system lets so-called regulated fares rise by the annual rate of inflation, as measured each July by the Retail Prices Index (RPI). About 45% of fares in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated. Broadly speaking they are season tickets, some off-peak returns, some standard returns, and commuter fares into and out of the London area. Yes. About 55% in fact. These include all first class tickets, all advance purchase ones, and some off-peak fares. For these, the train operating companies can decide their own increases, which can be more or less than the regulated ones. The government must agree to the rise being implemented. It will not come in automatically. But assuming the government gives its blessing, the increases will affect fares from 1 January next year. The train companies do not in fact have to implement the increase if they do not want to. It is a ceiling. But obviously the chances are they will go the whole hog. Not quite. In Wales rail fare increases are also capped at July's RPI figure. But in Scotland the maximum increase affects some regulated peak fares, including Anytime and Season tickets. However, regulated off-peak fare increases are set at 1% below RPI. The train companies say that some of their most important costs go up each year in the same way. These include the track access charges, which they must pay to Network Rail for the right to run trains on its rails, and to use its stations and signals. Also, under the various franchise agreements which govern the economics of each train operating company, payments they make to the government are also linked each year to the RPI. Regulation of some fares has existed since the old British Rail was privatised and split up into many separate companies in the mid-1990s. The point of regulation was to stop the new regional rail franchises abusing their near monopolies to overcharge their passengers. However, since 2007 it has been explicit government policy for passengers to pay more of the overall cost of running the country's rail system, and for taxpayers as a whole to pay less via subsidies. The coalition government continued the policy of shifting the financial burden to the wallets of passengers, though with less aggressive price increases than before. A research paper, published earlier this year by theHouse of Commons Library,external, cited earlier figures from the rail regulator in March 2016 showing that ""passengers have contributed an increasing proportion of the rail industry's income relative to taxpayers over the past four years - up from 55.6% in 2010-11 to 65% in 2014-15."" No, according to the rail industry trade body the Rail Delivery Group. But any fare increases which are implemented should be made public by individual train operating companies this November or December. Not necessarily at all. According to theannual analysis published by the Office of Rail and Road (ORR),external, in January this year average fares across the rail system - regulated and unregulated - rose by only 1.2%. It was ""the second year in succession when fares have risen below inflation,"" said the ORR. How come? Because train firms in fact chose to keep the lid on unregulated ticket increases, limiting them to just 0.8%. And even the regulated rises averaged just 1.8%, slightly below the cap of 1.9% set by the July 2016 RPI figure. Are you joining the 'Â£5k commuter club'?

The 'Â£5k commuter club',"Agatha Carter is in the Â£5k commuter club - and her husband Alistair almost is Rail fares are set to rise next year, meaning more of us are joining the so-called Â£5k commuter club - workers who pay that sum getting to and from work each year. So who are its members and where do they live? Season tickets to London are already above Â£5,000 from places such as Milton Keynes (Â£5,028 to London) and Portsmouth and Southsea in Hampshire (Â£5,048). When fares increase in January 2018, London commuters in Oxford, Colchester in Essex and Hastings in East Sussex are also set to join the club. Alistair Carter, from Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire, avoids the Â£5k commuter club - but only because he cycles the final leg to his Mayfair office. His wife Agatha is already a member - she pays Â£5,092 every year, including Tube travel. ""I have said to my boss that when my fare hits Â£5,000 I will be looking for a new job,"" says Alistair, a recruiter, whose ticket to London currently costs Â£4,094 a year. To compound matters, he says their 45-minute journey is normally delayed by 10 to 15 minutes. ""There is only one line in and one line out - whenever there's a problem with a train the whole line grinds to a halt,"" he says. Rail fares face biggest rise for five years Train fares: Why are they still going up? The couple moved out of London in 2013 to buy a bigger house, but are now considering staying in hotels a few days a week instead of buying a season ticket. ""We went to an Adele concert recently and stayed in a hotel for Â£42,"" he says. ""I said to my wife it would be cheaper to stay in London."" Train operators in England and Wales are expected to hike season ticket fares by up to 3.6% from January 2018. Therises are pegged to inflationfigures from July, but we will not know the exact price rises until later this year. Oxford to London Terminals NOW: Â£4,920 (+3.6% = Â£5,097) Colchester to London Terminals NOW: Â£4,928 (+3.6% = Â£5,105) Crowhurst, East Sussex to London St Pancras NOW: Â£4,952 (+3.6% = Â£5,130) Chichester to London Terminals NOW: Â£4,836 (+3.6% = Â£5,010) Based on annual National Rail season ticket to London Terminals The Â£5k club's growth is in part due to people travelling further and longer to get to work. Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more - but this has increased to 3.7 million today, according to the Office for National Statistics. In the club is Matt Blackwell, a sub-editor from Leicester, who combines a 70-minute train journey and two-mile cycle to get to his office in London. He says next year's fare increase is ""not an ideal situation"" as he already pays Â£9,000 a year. In the club: Matt Blackwell, who lives in Leicester with partner Niki Matt, 27, says: ""My partner is a teacher and works in Leicester. I work in the media, which is largely London-based. ""I lose a crippling Â£750 from my salary each month in repayments to my company, which covered the upfront cost of my ticket."" He adds: ""Even if the increase is minor come next January - when my season ticket runs out - I'm really not sure that I can afford to accommodate it, especially when I am far from guaranteed a rise in my salary."" But in the darkness, there is a chink of light - because the price rise takes effect from 1 January, commuters who buy an annual season ticket before 31 December pay this year's price.

Triple killer admits murdering ex-partnerTheodore Johnson already had convictions for killing two women he had been in relationships with.2h2 hours agoLondon,"Theodore Johnson beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord A man who already had convictions for killing his wife and a former partner has pleaded guilty to murdering his ex-girlfriend. Theodore Johnson, 64, beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord after she met another man, the Old Bailey heard. Johnson has two previous manslaughter convictions, for pushing his wife over a balcony in 1981 and strangling a partner in 1993. He will be sentenced on Friday. After attacking Ms Best, 51, at his Islington home on 15 December 2016, the garage worker threw himself in front of an express train. He survived but severed his right arm and left hand. Police only discovered Ms Best's body when they called at Johnson's north London flat to find his next of kin after the incident at Cheshunt railway station. The defendant, who now uses a wheelchair, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-four and grandmother Ms Best on the first day of his trial. Johnson's long-term relationship with Ms Best ended in 2016 when she met someone else. A post-mortem examination established her cause of death to be neck compression by strangulation with a ligature and blunt force trauma to the head. Johnson uses a wheelchair as a result of the injuries he sustained when trying to kill himself In 1981, Johnson was jailed for three years after he was found guilty of wife Yvonne Johnson's manslaughter. He hit her over the head with a vase during a row before pushing her over the balcony of their ninth-floor flat in Wolverhampton. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, after attacking former partner Yvonne Bennett. He was sent to a secure hospital indefinitely after killing her while their baby daughter slept nearby. The couple, who had been living in Finsbury Park in north London, had recently separated after Ms Bennett had an affair. When she rejected a box of chocolates Johnson bought, he strangled her with a belt. Johnson phoned police to confess, tried to hang himself from a tree and then gave himself up, prosecutors said at the time. Doctors agreed he had been suffering from a depressive illness. Johnson met Ms Best after he was released from a psychiatric unit in the mid-1990s. She and her children had moved from Manchester to Tottenham, north London. Ms Best's two sisters were in court as Johnson entered his guilty plea. Speaking after the guilty plea, Det Sgt Danny Yeoman from the Met Police said: ""This was a vicious attack and I hope the conviction gives Angela's family some measure of comfort and closure."" The murder of Ms Best has raised questions about how Johnson was able to kill for a second and third time. Suzanne Jacob has questioned how it was possible that Johnson was able to kill three times The chief executive of domestic abuse charity Safe Lives, Suzanne Jacob, said she feared not enough information had been shared between police and mental health services to determine what kind of risk Johnson posed. ""Our hearts go out to Angela's family but also the families of the other two women,"" she said. ""After two such serious convictions, how was it possible that this was allowed to happen again? ""Multiple agencies are going to have to look at what they did and didn't do."" Assistant Chief Constable Jacqueline Sebire of Bedfordshire Police voiced the same concern. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""We must look at ways to improve risk assessment and information sharing."" More than 100 women were killed last year by partners or ex-partners, according to Safe Lives.

Parts of NHS in England on high alert,"Tens of thousands of non-urgent NHS operations and procedures in England may be deferred until 31 January, due to winter pressures. Officials also told hospitals to delay routine outpatient appointments to concentrate on emergency care. Separately, a doctor apologised on Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in the hospital where he works in Stoke. NHS England's acute care director said hospitals were being given the ""time and space"" to manage January pressures. Officials reiterated that cancer operations and time-critical procedures should go ahead as planned. The advice comes as Milton Keynes University Hospital is telling people only to attend for emergency treatment. BBC reporter Dominic Johnson said Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre is asking patients to avoid its emergency department as it is on black alert, after seeing 140 patients at its peak on Tuesday evening. He adds 80-100 patients is considered ""very busy"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two ambulance trusts in England, east and north-east, say they are on the highest alert. NHS England's National Emergency Pressures Panel, which met on Tuesday, said it had extended the deadline for deferral of all non-urgent inpatient elective care - such as hip or knee replacements - to 31 January, to free up capacity for the sickest of patients. NHS England also gave hospitals the green light to put patients in mixed sex wards. Director of acute care Professor Keith Willett said that the delay of non-urgent operations was not a crisis, and added the NHS in England was reacting to concerns from doctors and nurses over a rise in flu incidents, as well as predicted cold weather. He said: ""With the incidents of flu rising in the community and in our hospitals, and the pressures that we always see in the first few weeks of January... that it's important we give the hospitals time and space to manage the demand that we anticipate will come through."" Each year the service comes under increased pressure in the winter, largely as a result of an increase in certain illnesses over this period, such as flu. It is too early to judge how bad this year's pressures are compared with previous years. The NHS does release regular statistics, but these are not real-time - meaning there is always a lag of a week or two to learn the full picture. NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area Winter pressure health campaign launched NHS to cancel ops to cope with winter Milton Keynes University Hospital said it was facing pressure as a result of ""very high numbers of patients seeking emergency medical care"". It said the hospital had opened an ""unprecedented number of escalation [extra] beds"" in order to provide care for acutely unwell patients and warned that patients attending its emergency department would be treated in order of clinical priority. The hospital's chief executive, Prof Joe Harrison, said: ""We are seeing very high numbers of very sick patients in the emergency department and fewer patients being able to be discharged - many because they also remain in need of acute care. ""I would urge people to avoid the hospital's emergency department unless it is a genuine emergency. ""Staff are working under incredible pressure to look after the patients in our care. I cannot overstate that. We are doing our best in extraordinarily difficult circumstances."" BBC News health editor Hugh Pym The NHS is always under great pressure in the New Year - with some patients holding off over the festive season before going into A&E. Hospitals have planned intensively for the higher anticipated demand over winter. But the service seems under even more strain than previous years. The fact that NHS England has felt the need to call for further restrictions on non-urgent surgery and outpatient appointments underlines concerns at the highest level. It has decided to give the green light to hospitals to put patients in mixed sex wards if they have to. NHS England notes a higher number of flu cases and can only hope that its own warnings about a flu outbreak don't materialise. Meanwhile, Dr Richard Fawcett, whose Twitter profile lists him as a consultant at University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, apologised via Twitter for ""third world conditions"" in his hospital department.

The hospital trust responded by saying it had been under ""severe and sustained pressure over the Christmas period"" and this had ""continued into the new year"". The trust's medical director, Dr John Oxtoby, added: ""Our staff want the very best for our patients and at times they find the situation frustrating, which can be reflected on social media. ""However, we are a leading trauma, stroke and cardiac centre and have been regularly praised by external independent commentators for the quality of compassionate care provided at our hospitals despite all our pressures."" Ambulance services in the north-east and east of England said they had reached their highest operational alert level - number four. The North East Ambulance Service said it had been hit by ""unprecedented levels of demand"" over the Christmas and new year period. It said it was ""asking some patients, where appropriate, if they have alternative transport options, such as a family member"". Between 23 December and 1 January, it took more than 40,000 NHS 111 calls and more than 16,000 999 calls - compared to around 28,000 NHS 111 calls and 15,000 999 calls in the same period last year. It advised members of the public to consult a GP, pharmacist, local walk-in centre or to call NHS 111 if they did not require emergency care. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said it had been at level three since Friday. A spokesman added: ""We are experiencing a high call demand, but that is not unusual at this time of year."" A spokesman for the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service said Northern Ireland used a different system. There are four major hospitals served by the ambulance service and GP and 999 calls are being redirected away from the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, County Down to the other three major hospitals, which are currently operating normally.

Iran's ruler blames unrest on 'enemies'Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says Iran's enemies stirred protests that have claimed more than 20 lives.1han hour agoMiddle East,"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people are taking to the streets Iran's supreme leader has accused the country's enemies of stirring days of protests that have claimed at least 21 lives. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking for the first time since people protesting at Iran's economic troubles clashed with security forces last Thursday. Nine people, including a child, died overnight in violence in central Iran, state media say. The protests are the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. They began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad, initially against price rises and corruption, but have since spread amid wider anti-government sentiment. In a post on his official website, Iran's supreme leader was quoted as saying: ""In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence services to create troubles for the Islamic Republic.""

He said he would address the nation about the recent events ""when the time was right"". Why are there protests in Iran? An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Analysts say the supreme leader's reference to ""enemies"" is a swipe at Israel, the US and regional rival Saudi Arabia. Tasnim news quoted Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, as warning Saudi Arabia that there would be a response from Iran ""and they know how serious it can be"". Musa Ghazanfarabadi, the head of Tehran's Revolutionary Court, in turn warned that the ringleaders of the protests would face harsh punishment. President Hassan Rouhani's words have been more measured. He has called the protests an ""opportunity, not a threat"", recognised economic discontent and said people had a right to take to the streets. However, he has also vowed to crack down on ""lawbreakers"". This video can not be played State TV shows protesters in the city of Qahderijan attacking a police station Reformist and moderate MPs have released a statement urging the authorities to be open to criticism and to be tolerant of the right to protest which, they said, was enshrined in the constitution. But they also accused the US of trying to take advantage of the situation. The Islamic Propagation Co-ordination Council, which organises state rallies, has called on people to turn out on Wednesday for pro-government events in Kermanshah, Alborz, Isfahan and Hormozgan provinces. Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs US warns Iran: The world is watching Who is Hassan Rouhani? There were reports on social media on Tuesday of more unrest, although it is not possible to confirm it independently or the exact timing. The reports spoke of shots being fired in Sanandaj, in Kurdistan province; a video showed protesters and security forces on the streets of the city of Hamedan; a second video appeared to show flash bombs or grenades being thrown in Rasht and a third showed street fires in Karaj. Other unrest was reported in Gohardasht and Eslamabad-e-Gharb. Nine deaths were reported overnight into Tuesday: Six protesters died in an apparent attempt to seize guns from a police station in the town of Qahderijan in the central province of Isfahan, state TV reported An 11-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were reported killed in the town of Khomeinishahr A member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards was fatally wounded in nearby Kahrizsang, state media say US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Iran's allegation that foreign enemies were behind the protests was ""complete nonsense"". She said the US also planned to call an emergency session at the UN. This video can not be played Nikki Haley: ""We must not be silent on Iran protests"" President Donald Trump has posted a string of tweets in support of the protesters and against Iran's leaders, the latest one on Tuesday.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, responded by saying Mr Trump should focus on ""the domestic issues of his own country, such as daily killings of dozens of people... and the existence of millions of homeless and hungry people"". In other reaction: The EU called on Iran to guarantee its citizens' right to peaceful protest, saying it had been in touch with the Iranian authorities and was monitoring the situation Turkey expressed concern at the unrest spreading and warned against any escalation France said it was concerned at the number of victims and arrests By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor When the protests started last Thursday, they were about the current economic crisis but as they spread, pent-up frustrations spilled out and politics became a big part of them. President Rouhani has been widely criticised. He has disappointed voters who hoped he would do more to turn round an economy that has been damaged by years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. Iran's role in conflicts across the Middle East has also been criticised as it is an expensive foreign policy at a time when people in Iran are getting poorer. Leading figures in the Islamic Republic have also been targeted by protesters, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. He has responded by blaming foreigners. Iran has suffered in the past from foreign interference, so his words will strike a chord among some - and could also signal a much tougher response from the security forces. The demonstrations do not seem to have recognisable leaders, unlike the last big protests after the disputed presidential election in 2009. At that time, the elite of the Islamic Republic was divided. It is not at the moment, so that will make it harder for the protests to be sustained, and they may run out of steam. But the fact they are happening at all is very significant. They show how discontented Iranians are with increasing poverty, after years of repression. Mass demonstrations - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the disputed election victory of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds in Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

London Bridge opens new platforms,"Engineers have remodelled tracks through and around the station to allow more trains through the capital and reduce delays One of Britain's busiest railways stations has almost doubled its passenger capacity with the reopening of five platforms. London Bridge can now serve 96 million people a year, up from about 50 million. The works form part of a Â£1bn redevelopment of the capital's oldest station, which opened in 1836. Network Rail said the project, which was started in 2013, was a ""shining example"" of investment. Unions have said ""greedy"" private companies will make money out of the station, which it says has suffered""life-threatening chaos"" due to overcrowding at rush hour. The opening of the new concourse means all 15 platforms are accessible for the first time since 2012 Network Rail hopes the new station will become a desirable shopping spot For the first time since 2012, passengers had access to all 15 platforms earlier as the final section of a new concourse opened. Engineers have remodelled tracks to help reduce delays and allow for more trains, and Thameslink services at the station are set to increase to 18 trains per hour from May. Network Rail hopes the opening of 90 new retail units will also make the station an attractive place to spend time, ""like London St Pancras"". There are two new entrances for the station An initial aim for 24 trains an hour to run through the station by the end of 2018 was recently pushed back to December 2019. Mark Carne, chief executive of Network Rail, said the opening is ""a shining example of the investment we are making in the railway"". The Rail, Maritime and Transport union said private companies will make money out of the taxpayer-funded project. Its general secretary Mick Cash added: ""The financial beneficiaries will be the greedy private train companies who jack up fares and max out profits and leave the passenger holding the bill for investment. ""It's a racket and reinforces our case for public ownership of the whole railway.""

Triple killer admits murdering ex-partner,"Theodore Johnson beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord A man who already had convictions for killing his wife and a former partner has pleaded guilty to murdering his ex-girlfriend. Theodore Johnson, 64, beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord after she met another man, the Old Bailey heard. Johnson has two previous manslaughter convictions, for pushing his wife over a balcony in 1981 and strangling a partner in 1993. He will be sentenced on Friday. After attacking Ms Best, 51, at his Islington home on 15 December 2016, the garage worker threw himself in front of an express train. He survived but severed his right arm and left hand. Police only discovered Ms Best's body when they called at Johnson's north London flat to find his next of kin after the incident at Cheshunt railway station. The defendant, who now uses a wheelchair, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-four and grandmother Ms Best on the first day of his trial. Johnson's long-term relationship with Ms Best ended in 2016 when she met someone else. A post-mortem examination established her cause of death to be neck compression by strangulation with a ligature and blunt force trauma to the head. Johnson uses a wheelchair as a result of the injuries he sustained when trying to kill himself In 1981, Johnson was jailed for three years after he was found guilty of wife Yvonne Johnson's manslaughter. He hit her over the head with a vase during a row before pushing her over the balcony of their ninth-floor flat in Wolverhampton. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, after attacking former partner Yvonne Bennett. He was sent to a secure hospital indefinitely after killing her while their baby daughter slept nearby. The couple, who had been living in Finsbury Park in north London, had recently separated after Ms Bennett had an affair. When she rejected a box of chocolates Johnson bought, he strangled her with a belt. Johnson phoned police to confess, tried to hang himself from a tree and then gave himself up, prosecutors said at the time. Doctors agreed he had been suffering from a depressive illness. Johnson met Ms Best after he was released from a psychiatric unit in the mid-1990s. She and her children had moved from Manchester to Tottenham, north London. Ms Best's two sisters were in court as Johnson entered his guilty plea. Speaking after the guilty plea, Det Sgt Danny Yeoman from the Met Police said: ""This was a vicious attack and I hope the conviction gives Angela's family some measure of comfort and closure."" The murder of Ms Best has raised questions about how Johnson was able to kill for a second and third time. Suzanne Jacob has questioned how it was possible that Johnson was able to kill three times The chief executive of domestic abuse charity Safe Lives, Suzanne Jacob, said she feared not enough information had been shared between police and mental health services to determine what kind of risk Johnson posed. ""Our hearts go out to Angela's family but also the families of the other two women,"" she said. ""After two such serious convictions, how was it possible that this was allowed to happen again? ""Multiple agencies are going to have to look at what they did and didn't do."" Assistant Chief Constable Jacqueline Sebire of Bedfordshire Police voiced the same concern. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""We must look at ways to improve risk assessment and information sharing."" More than 100 women were killed last year by partners or ex-partners, according to Safe Lives.

Anger over YouTuber's dead man video,"The video was posted to his 15 million subscribers An American YouTube star has prompted a barrage of criticism after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The video showed Logan Paul and friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the ""haunted"" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. Online comments have called the video ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". The video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down. Logan Paul, who has more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube, posted an apology,externalon Twitter, saying he had been ""misguided by shock and awe"". He later uploaded a video apology, and said: ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through."" ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world. Aokigahara has a tragic reputation in Japan and internationally as a destination for people who want to kill themselves. Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their own lives. The 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends. They go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the ""haunted"" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body. The group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out. A member of the group is heard off camera saying he ""doesn't feel good"". Paul then asks him: ""What, you never stand next to a dead guy?"" He then laughs. The identity of the deceased man is not known.

In an apology posted on his Twitter page, Paul, of Westlake, Ohio, said: ""I'm surrounded by good people and believe I make good decisions, but I'm still a human being. I can be wrong."" He goes on to say he wanted to ""make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity"", by raising awareness of suicide and suicide prevention.

Children's snacks 'should be low-calorie',"Children between the ages of four and 10 eat more than 120 cakes, buns and pastries a year, figures show Half of the sugar young children in England consume comes from unhealthy snacks and sweet drinks, figures show. On average, primary school children have at least three sugary snacks a day, Public Health England found. This means they can easily consume three times more sugar than the recommended maximum. PHE has launched a campaign to encourage parents to look for healthier snacks of no more than 100 calories - and to limit them to two a day. The eight-weekChange4Life,externalcampaign will offer money-off vouchers towards items including malt loaf, lower-sugar yoghurt and drinks with no added sugar in some supermarkets. How much sugar is hidden in your food? Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate Sugar warning over fruit snacks Children between the ages of four and 10 consumed 51.2% of their sugar from unhealthy snacks, including biscuits, cakes, pastries, buns, sweets, juice and fizzy drinks, PHE's National Diet and Nutritional Survey found. Each year children consume, on average, some 400 biscuits, 120 cakes, buns and pastries, 100 portions of sweets, 70 chocolate bars and ice creams and 150 juice drink pouches and cans of fizzy drink, the data shows. Too much sugar can cause tooth decay and obesity. Manufacturers are being challenged to cut sugar by 20% in their products by 2020 An ice cream - about 175 calories A pack of crisps - 190 calories A chocolate bar - 200 calories A pastry - 270 calories Source: Kantar research group Soreen malt lunchbox loaves (apple, banana or original malt) Petits Filous fromage frais (strawberry and raspberry, strawberry, strawberry and apricot, strawberry and banana) Fruit Shoot hydro water in apple and blackcurrant flavour Fresh or tinned fruit salad Chopped vegetables and lower fat hummus Plain rice cakes or crackers with lower fat cheese Sugar-free jelly One crumpet One scotch pancake Source: Public Health England The Change4Life campaign now wants parents to give their children a maximum of two snacks a day containing no more than 100 calories each, not including fruit and vegetables. The campaign will offer parents special offers on a range of healthier snacks - ones with 100 calories or fewer - at selected supermarkets, Public Health England said. Healthier suggested snacks include packs of chopped vegetables and fruit, malt loaf, sugar-free jelly, and plain rice crackers. Public Health England said it had also improved itsapp that reveals the content of sugar, salt and saturated fat in food and drink,external. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, told the BBC she hoped the campaign would help to ""empower"" parents to make healthier snacking choices for their children. ""If you wander through a supermarket you see many more things being sold as snacks than ever before,"" she said. ""What has changed is kids' lunch boxes are getting full of snacking products. It leads to a lot of calories for lunch. ""Our research showed us that parents appreciated a rule of thumb. They were surprised how much sugar their children were consuming in snacks."" Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, said: ""The volume of sugar kids are getting from snacks and sugary drinks alone is pretty mind blowing, and it can often be difficult to distinguish which snacks are healthy and which aren't. ""This rule of thumb from Change4Life will help parents make healthier choices, which can only be a good thing."" Public Health England has previously called on businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020, and by 5% in 2017, but experts have questioned how the targets can be enforced. A sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industryhas already been announced and will come into force next April. Follow Alex onTwitter,external.

South Korea offers North Olympics talks,"Only two North Korean athletes qualify for this year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea has offered high-level talks with North Korea next Tuesday to discuss its possible participation in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, said earlier he was considering sending a team to Pyeongchang in South Korea for the Games in February. He said the two sides should ""urgently meet to discuss the possibility"". South Korea's president said he saw the offer as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations. At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Moon Jae-in also said the North's nuclear programme would be the backdrop of any sporting discussions. US President Donald Trump said sanctions ""and other pressures"" were beginning to have an impact on North Korea. Referring to the possible North-South dialogue he tweeted: ""Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon proposed a meeting at Panmunjom, the so-called ""truce village"". This video can not be played Tensions are high between the two warring countries The village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border, is where the Koreas have historically held talks. It is not yet known who, if anyone, will attend the proposed talks as North Korea has yet to respond. President Moon said he wanted his ministers to act fast to ensure the North's delegation attended. If the two countries do meet, Hyung Eun Kim from the BBC's Korean service says, they are expected to talk logistics: What route the North might take into the host country Whether the athletes would come with a cheer-leading squad Whether the two countries would issue a joint declaration The last high-level talks, in December 2015 in the Kaesong joint industrial zone, ended without any agreement and the agenda was not made public.

Neither happened and instead the North continued to test-fire missiles.

North Korea has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes, despite increasing international sanctions. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent A step back from the brink of potential war, or an effort to open a rift in the already bumpy relationship between South Korea and the United States? Kim Jong-un's sudden willingness to talk could be both these things. It raises intriguing possibilities in the wake of a year where the drift has been entirely negative: Pyongyang making significant strides in its nuclear and missile programmes Growing external pressure to isolate North Korea Genuine fears that the Trump administration might be on the path to a new conflict on the Korean peninsula South Korea's President Moon has responded positively, eager to bolster his own diplomatic hand. But given that the North sees its nuclear programme as a permanent fixture and President Donald Trump insists that Pyongyang will not be allowed to have a credible means of striking US territory, it is hard to see this crisis abating any time soon. The only two North Korean athletes who qualified for the Games are figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik. Although the North has missed the official deadline to confirm their participation, the skaters could still compete via an invitation from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In a statement, the IOC welcomed the ""mutual intention"" of the two sides to start direct talks about the participation of North Korea's athletes. ""In this context, the IOC continues its discussions with the NOC (national Olympic committee) of DPRK (North Korea),"" it said. ""To allow for such a participation in respect of the Olympic Charter, the IOC is keeping its invitation for a delegation of the NOC of DPRK open and will take the final decision in due time."" This video can not be played North Korea's star ice-skating duo have qualified for the Winter Olympics The president of the Pyeongchang Games' organising committee, Lee Hee-beom, told South Korea's news agency Yonhap that the North's potential participation was ""like a New Year's gift"".

Ex-England star admits drink driving,"Trevor Sinclair played 12 times for England Former England footballer Trevor Sinclair has admitted drink driving and racially abusing a police officer. Sinclair was arrested in Lytham and became agitated and accused police of being racist, a court was told. Blackpool Magistrates' Court heard he racially abused the officer who arrested him, but has since accepted the police were not racist towards him. Sinclair has been sentenced to 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from driving for 20 months. He has also been ordered to pay Â£500 compensation to the police officer he abused. Solicitor Nick Freeman said Sinclair was ""totally appalled by his behaviour, embarrassed and contrite"". The court also heard that Sinclair, 44, urinated in a police car during the arrest in his hometown on 12 November. After Sinclair pleaded guilty to drink driving and a racially aggravated public order offence, the prosecution dropped other charges including assault on a police officer, failing to provide a specimen and criminal damage. Trevor Sinclair has done frequent work as a pundit for the BBC The court heard police were called to his home and told he had left in his car and might have been drinking. Officers found the BBC pundit's car stopped on Clifton Drive, Blackpool after he was involved in a collision with a woman getting out of a taxi. He was breathalysed and found to be twice the legal alcohol limit, the court was told. A statement from the officer who arrested him was read to the court. PC Gareth Evans said the former footballer had been ""calm, polite and courteous"" before his arrest but started ""getting more confrontational"". When Sinclair was put in the back of the police van, he made racist comments. He continued to be ""obnoxious, aggressive and racist while being booked in"", the officer said. Mr Freeman said the ""catalyst"" for his client's behaviour was being subjected to racism in front of his family while out having a meal hours earlier. Sinclair played 12 times for England, winning four caps during the 2002 World Cup. His clubs included Blackpool, QPR, West Ham, Cardiff and Manchester City. Since retiring from football, he has worked as a football spokesman on shows for the BBC. A BBC spokesman said: ""We currently have no scheduled plans to use him on our programmes.""

Triple killer admits murdering ex-partnerTheodore Johnson beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord.8m9 minutes agoLondon,"Theodore Johnson beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord A man who already had convictions for killing his wife and a former partner has pleaded guilty to murdering his ex-girlfriend. Theodore Johnson, 64, beat Angela Best with a claw hammer and throttled her with a dressing gown cord after she met another man, the Old Bailey heard. Johnson has two previous manslaughter convictions, for pushing his wife over a balcony in 1981 and strangling a partner in 1993. He will be sentenced on Friday. After attacking Ms Best, 51, at his Islington home on 15 December 2016, the garage worker threw himself in front of an express train. He survived but severed his right arm and left hand. Police only discovered Ms Best's body when they called at Johnson's north London flat to find his next of kin after the incident at Cheshunt railway station. The defendant, who now uses a wheelchair, pleaded guilty to murdering mother-of-four and grandmother Ms Best on the first day of his trial. Johnson's long-term relationship with Ms Best ended in 2016 when she met someone else. A post-mortem examination established her cause of death to be neck compression by strangulation with a ligature and blunt force trauma to the head. Johnson uses a wheelchair as a result of the injuries he sustained when trying to kill himself In 1981, Johnson was jailed for three years after he was found guilty of wife Yvonne Johnson's manslaughter. He hit her over the head with a vase during a row before pushing her over the balcony of their ninth-floor flat in Wolverhampton. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter, on the grounds of diminished responsibility, after attacking former partner Yvonne Bennett. He was sent to a secure hospital indefinitely after killing her while their baby daughter slept nearby. The couple, who had been living in Finsbury Park in north London, had recently separated after Ms Bennett had an affair. When she rejected a box of chocolates Johnson bought, he strangled her with a belt. Johnson phoned police to confess, tried to hang himself from a tree and then gave himself up, prosecutors said at the time. Doctors agreed he had been suffering from a depressive illness. Johnson met Ms Best after he was released from a psychiatric unit in the mid-1990s. She and her children had moved from Manchester to Tottenham, north London. Ms Best's two sisters were in court as Johnson entered his guilty plea. Speaking after the guilty plea, Det Sgt Danny Yeoman from the Met Police said: ""This was a vicious attack and I hope the conviction gives Angela's family some measure of comfort and closure."" The murder of Ms Best has raised questions about how Johnson was able to kill for a second and third time. Suzanne Jacob has questioned how it was possible that Johnson was able to kill three times The chief executive of domestic abuse charity Safe Lives, Suzanne Jacob, said she feared not enough information had been shared between police and mental health services to determine what kind of risk Johnson posed. ""Our hearts go out to Angela's family but also the families of the other two women,"" she said. ""After two such serious convictions, how was it possible that this was allowed to happen again? ""Multiple agencies are going to have to look at what they did and didn't do."" Assistant Chief Constable Jacqueline Sebire of Bedfordshire Police voiced the same concern. Shewrote on Twitter,external: ""We must look at ways to improve risk assessment and information sharing."" More than 100 women were killed last year by partners or ex-partners, according to Safe Lives.

Row over Toby Young education role,"Writer Toby Young says his appointment to the board of a new higher education watchdog is being criticised largely because he is an ""outspoken Tory"".

The Spectator columnistsaid his efforts to widen access,externalto education meant he was ""tangentially qualified"". He said he was a target for the left because he supported the government. Mr Young, who co-founded the West London Free School in 2011 and runs the New School Network, is one of six new appointments to the regulator's board. Itsremit,externalis to hold universities to account on issues like vice chancellors' pay and free speech on campus, with powers to fine universities which fail to meet the required standards. The Department for Education has spoken of the ""vital insights"" his record as the founder of a free school will bring to the role but his lack of direct experience and past comments on educational issues have attracted criticism.

I thought it was New Year's Day not April Fool's Day."" Critics have highlighted Mr Young's description of working class students as ""stains"" in a 1988 book about class. Left-wing journalist Paul Mason accused him of ""despising"" working class children - but Mr Young hit back on Twitter, saying he had ""helped set up four state schools that when full will educate nearly 2,000 children"". At the secondary school, he went on, more than 33% of pupils ""are eligible for the pupil premium and we reserve 20% of the places at the primaries for same"". In a subsequent interview with the Spectator's Coffee House podcast, he suggested he was being targeted because of his political leanings. ""One of the reasons that my appointment has caused such a fuss is because I am an outspoken Tory and a defender of the government's education reforms,"" he said. ""This is a sector, and I think there is no secret, which is completely dominated by the left."" He conceded claims that he did not have much direct experience of working in higher education were ""broadly true"", he suggested it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest only those who did were entitled to do the job. ""If that were the case, the regulator would just be a case of the sector marking its own homework."" Comments the right-wing journalist made ina Spectator column in 2012,externalhave also come under fire on social media, with some calling for the journalist's appointment to be blocked by higher education minister Jo Johnson. He wrote: ""Schools have got to be 'inclusive' these days. That means wheelchair ramps, the complete works of Alice Walker in the school library (though no Mark Twain) and a Special Educational Needs Department that can cope with everything from Dyslexia to Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy."" He called on the government to ""repeal the Equality Act because any exam that isn't 'accessible' to a functionally illiterate troglodyte with a mental age of six will be judged to be 'elitist' and therefore forbidden by Harman's Law"". He later added a clarification to the column, saying ""I'm using 'inclusive' in the broad sense to mean a dumbed down, one-size-fits-all curriculum, rather than the narrow sense of providing equal access to mainstream education for people with disabilities"". He had not used the word ""troglodyte"" as a synonym for children with special educational needs, he added. A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Toby Young's diverse experience includes posts at Harvard and Cambridge as well as co-founding the successful West London Free School. ""This experience will be vital in encouraging new providers and ensuring more universities are working effectively with schools."" Mr Young worked as a teaching fellow - a postgraduate student who does some lecturing - at Harvard and a teaching assistant at Cambridge. The Office for Students board, which includes an engineering student and the managing director of high street chemist Boots, as well as other figures from industry and education, reflects ""the diverse needs of the higher education sector"", the spokesman added.

Ex-England star admits drink drivingTrevor Sinclair also admits racially abusing a police officer following his arrest.19m20 minutes agoLancashire,"Trevor Sinclair played 12 times for England Former England footballer Trevor Sinclair has admitted drink driving and racially abusing a police officer. Sinclair was arrested in Lytham and became agitated and accused police of being racist, a court was told. Blackpool Magistrates' Court heard he racially abused the officer who arrested him, but has since accepted the police were not racist towards him. Sinclair has been sentenced to 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from driving for 20 months. He has also been ordered to pay Â£500 compensation to the police officer he abused. Solicitor Nick Freeman said Sinclair was ""totally appalled by his behaviour, embarrassed and contrite"". The court also heard that Sinclair, 44, urinated in a police car during the arrest in his hometown on 12 November. After Sinclair pleaded guilty to drink driving and a racially aggravated public order offence, the prosecution dropped other charges including assault on a police officer, failing to provide a specimen and criminal damage. Trevor Sinclair has done frequent work as a pundit for the BBC The court heard police were called to his home and told he had left in his car and might have been drinking. Officers found the BBC pundit's car stopped on Clifton Drive, Blackpool after he was involved in a collision with a woman getting out of a taxi. He was breathalysed and found to be twice the legal alcohol limit, the court was told. A statement from the officer who arrested him was read to the court. PC Gareth Evans said the former footballer had been ""calm, polite and courteous"" before his arrest but started ""getting more confrontational"". When Sinclair was put in the back of the police van, he made racist comments. He continued to be ""obnoxious, aggressive and racist while being booked in"", the officer said. Mr Freeman said the ""catalyst"" for his client's behaviour was being subjected to racism in front of his family while out having a meal hours earlier. Sinclair played 12 times for England, winning four caps during the 2002 World Cup. His clubs included Blackpool, QPR, West Ham, Cardiff and Manchester City. Since retiring from football, he has worked as a football spokesman on shows for the BBC. A BBC spokesman said: ""We currently have no scheduled plans to use him on our programmes.""

Tony Walsh's poem became a symbol of defiance when he read it before a crowd of thousands ata vigil for the Manchester Arena attack victims. He said future royalties would go to Forever Manchester, which originally commissioned the piece. The full-time poet said it was a way to ""give something back"" to the city. He said it was ""an honour and a privilege"" to be asked to perform at the vigil the day after the 22 May terrorist attack that killed 22 people. The poem became a symbol of defiance after it was read at the Albert Square vigil ""People ask me if I wrote it (the poem) on the day, but I didn't, it was commissioned by Forever Manchester to sum up the passion, the history of Greater Manchester. ""The version I did in the square has about 12 or 16 lines missing which say 'if you feel like this about our city then we're the charity for you'. ""But at the end of the poem where I say 'This is the place, we should give something back', this is me trying to do that now with the poem."" Thousands of people who gathered outside Manchester Town Hall for the vigil heard the recital He said so far the poem had raised about Â£160,000, mainly from theThis Is The Place book which is raising money for three charities,external. Mr Walsh, who writes as Longfella, said: ""Literally not a day has gone by when people haven't asked me can they use the poem in all sorts of different ways, from schools to restaurants wanting to paint it on the wall. ""People think they don't like poetry, the equate it with classical music. But there are as many types of poetry as there are types of music and I try and make my poetry both easy to understand and make people feel something with it.""

Outrage over YouTuber's dead body video,"The video was posted to his 15 million subscribers An American YouTube star has prompted a barrage of criticism after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The video showed Logan Paul and friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the ""haunted"" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. Online comments have called the video ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". The video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down. Logan Paul, who has more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube, posted an apology,externalon Twitter, saying he had been ""misguided by shock and awe"".

Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world. Aokigahara has a tragic reputation in Japan and internationally as a destination for people who want to kill themselves. Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their own lives. The 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends. They go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the ""haunted"" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body. The group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out. A member of the group is heard off camera saying he ""doesn't feel good"". Paul then asks him: ""What, you never stand next to a dead guy?"" He then laughs. The identity of the deceased man is not known.

"Start Christmas saving now, says charity","Low-earning households are being urged to start saving money now in time for next Christmas. The Money Advice Trust (MAT) debt charity is advising consumers who struggle with savings to budget for the year ahead. One idea, it says, is to join a credit union. An internet survey conducted for the MAT also suggests that more people will struggle with their finances this January than was the case last year. Some 16% of people questioned said they were likely - or very likely - to fall behind with their finances in January, as a result of Christmas spending. That amounts to 7.9 million people, the MAT said, and compares with 11% in a similar poll last year. The majority - 68% - said they would cope sufficiently during the month. The poll suggested that more than half of households in the country only started saving for Christmas in December. The MAT says one option is to save throughout the year with a credit union - community-owned organisations that tend to offer low-cost loans and savings accounts. ""At the start of this New Year, when resolutions are being made, I would encourage everyone to look at their personal finances and make a plan if they can for 2018 - set a household budget, look at joining a credit union in preparation for next Christmas, and seek free advice atwww.nationaldebtline.org,externalif you are struggling to cope,"" said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the MAT. Those who open Christmas savings accounts with credit unions can only access their money later in the year. ""Credit unions across the country help their members to save towards the costs of Christmas with dedicated Christmas savings accounts which lock funds away and make them available as the festivities approach,"" said Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited. The MAT urges households to: Make a plan for 2018, by budgeting for each month Join a credit union.A list can be found here,external Deal with any debts as soon as possible Meanwhile, the government-backed Money Advice Service suggested that the new year squeeze on finances could be mitigated by having a clear out at home and selling unwanted items and switching to cheaper deals on household bills. This was particularly important if it had not been done for some time. Nick Hill, from the service, said: ""If you're worried about money you owe, then it's best to get advice as early as you can.""

Mr Trump has criticised Pakistan for offering a ""safe haven"" to terrorists in the past.

""It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace"", he added. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has suggested Pakistan could lose US privileges US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also put pressure on Pakistan over its perceived backing for the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US is a key ally to the country, which enjoys a special status as a non-Nato alliance partner.

South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon proposed a meeting at Panmunjom, the so-called ""truce village"". This video can not be played Tensions are high between the two warring countries The village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border, is where the Koreas have historically held talks. It is not yet known who, if anyone, will attend the proposed talks as North Korea has yet to respond. President Moon said he wanted his ministers to act fast to ensure the North's delegation attended. If the two countries do meet, Hyung Eun Kim from the BBC's Korean service says, they are expected to talk logistics: What route the North might take into the host country Whether the athletes would come with a cheer-leading squad Whether the two countries would issue a joint declaration The last high-level talks, in December 2015 in the Kaesong joint industrial zone, ended without any agreement and the agenda was not made public.

Neither happened and instead the North continued to test-fire missiles. Kim Jong-un's New Year speech took an unexpectedly conciliatory tone with South Korea North Korea's leader took many people by surprise when hesaid he was ""open to dialogue"" with his neighbours in his New Year's Day speech.

North Korea has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes, despite increasing international sanctions. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent A step back from the brink of potential war, or an effort to open a rift in the already bumpy relationship between South Korea and the United States? Kim Jong-un's sudden willingness to talk could be both these things. It raises intriguing possibilities in the wake of a year where the drift has been entirely negative: Pyongyang making significant strides in its nuclear and missile programmes Growing external pressure to isolate North Korea Genuine fears that the Trump administration might be on the path to a new conflict on the Korean peninsula South Korea's President Moon has responded positively, eager to bolster his own diplomatic hand. But given that the North sees its nuclear programme as a permanent fixture and President Donald Trump insists that Pyongyang will not be allowed to have a credible means of striking US territory, it is hard to see this crisis abating any time soon. The only two North Korean athletes who qualified for the Games are figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik. Although the North has missed the official deadline to confirm their participation, the skaters could still compete via an invitation from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In a statement, the IOC welcomed the ""mutual intention"" of the two sides to start direct talks about the participation of North Korea's athletes. ""In this context, the IOC continues its discussions with the NOC (national Olympic committee) of DPRK (North Korea),"" it said. ""To allow for such a participation in respect of the Olympic Charter, the IOC is keeping its invitation for a delegation of the NOC of DPRK open and will take the final decision in due time.""

Ex-England star admits drink drivingTrevor Sinclair also admits racially abusing a police officer following his arrest.,"Trevor Sinclair played 12 times for England Former England footballer Trevor Sinclair has admitted drink driving and racially abusing a police officer. Sinclair was arrested in Lytham and became agitated and accused police of being racist, a court was told. Blackpool Magistrates' Court heard he racially abused the officer who arrested him, but has since accepted the police were not racist towards him. Sinclair has been sentenced to 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from driving for 20 months. He has also been ordered to pay Â£500 compensation to the police officer he abused. Solicitor Nick Freeman said Sinclair was ""totally appalled by his behaviour, embarrassed and contrite"". The court also heard that Sinclair, 44, urinated in a police car during the arrest in his hometown on 12 November. After Sinclair pleaded guilty to drink driving and a racially aggravated public order offence, the prosecution dropped other charges including assault on a police officer, failing to provide a specimen and criminal damage. Trevor Sinclair has done frequent work as a pundit for the BBC The court heard police were called to his home and told he had left in his car and might have been drinking. Officers found the BBC pundit's car stopped on Clifton Drive, Blackpool after he was involved in a collision with a woman getting out of a taxi. He was breathalysed and found to be twice the legal alcohol limit, the court was told. A statement from the officer who arrested him was read to the court. PC Gareth Evans said the former footballer had been ""calm, polite and courteous"" before his arrest but started ""getting more confrontational"". When Sinclair was put in the back of the police van, he made racist comments. He continued to be ""obnoxious, aggressive and racist while being booked in"", the officer said. Mr Freeman said the ""catalyst"" for his client's behaviour was being subjected to racism in front of his family while out having a meal hours earlier. Sinclair played 12 times for England, winning four caps during the 2002 World Cup. His clubs included Blackpool, QPR, West Ham, Cardiff and Manchester City. Since retiring from football, he has worked as a football spokesman on shows for the BBC. A BBC spokesman said: ""We currently have no scheduled plans to use him on our programmes.""

'Start saving now for next Christmas',"Low-earning households are being urged to start saving money now in time for next Christmas. The Money Advice Trust (MAT) debt charity is advising consumers who struggle with savings to budget for the year ahead. One idea, it says, is to join a credit union. An internet survey conducted for the MAT also suggests that more people will struggle with their finances this January than was the case last year. Some 16% of people questioned said they were likely - or very likely - to fall behind with their finances in January, as a result of Christmas spending. That amounts to 7.9 million people, the MAT said, and compares with 11% in a similar poll last year. The majority - 68% - said they would cope sufficiently during the month. The poll suggested that more than half of households in the country only started saving for Christmas in December. The MAT says one option is to save throughout the year with a credit union - community-owned organisations that tend to offer low-cost loans and savings accounts. ""At the start of this New Year, when resolutions are being made, I would encourage everyone to look at their personal finances and make a plan if they can for 2018 - set a household budget, look at joining a credit union in preparation for next Christmas, and seek free advice atwww.nationaldebtline.org,externalif you are struggling to cope,"" said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the MAT. Those who open Christmas savings accounts with credit unions can only access their money later in the year. ""Credit unions across the country help their members to save towards the costs of Christmas with dedicated Christmas savings accounts which lock funds away and make them available as the festivities approach,"" said Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited. The MAT urges households to: Make a plan for 2018, by budgeting for each month Join a credit union.A list can be found here,external Deal with any debts as soon as possible Meanwhile, the government-backed Money Advice Service suggested that the new year squeeze on finances could be mitigated by having a clear out at home and selling unwanted items and switching to cheaper deals on household bills. This was particularly important if it had not been done for some time. Nick Hill, from the service, said: ""If you're worried about money you owe, then it's best to get advice as early as you can.""

Mr Trump has criticised Pakistan for offering a ""safe haven"" to terrorists in the past. Tillerson piles pressure on Pakistan US rhetoric on Pakistan raises serious questions In a speech in August, he said: ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting."" ""It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace"", he added. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has suggested Pakistan could lose US privileges US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also put pressure on Pakistan over its perceived backing for the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US is a key ally to the country, which enjoys a special status as a non-Nato alliance partner.

Pakistan has already had millions of dollars of US aid withheld for allegedly not taking enough action against the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The New York Times said US officials had been denied access to a member of the organisation who they believed could help with information on an American hostage.

Seaplane in fatal crash to be recoveredAustralian officials will forensically examine the wreckage after the death of a UK family.2h2 hours agoAustralia,"Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins A seaplane that crashed and killed six people - including five Britons - is expected to be raised from an Australian river this week so it can be forensically examined, authorities say. The cause of the New Year's Eve crash north of Sydney is not yet known. It claimed the lives of Compass Group chief Richard Cousins, four members of his family, and a Sydney-based Canadian pilot. There were no survivors. Investigators will release a preliminary report in about 30 days. ""The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood at this stage,"" said Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) executive director Nat Nagy on Tuesday. Mr Cousins, 58, died alongside his fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, 48, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. Tributes paid to seaplane crash family The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, about 50km (30 miles) away. The single-engine aircraft belonged to sightseeing flight company Sydney Seaplanes, which offers scenic flights over local tourist attractions. Mr Nagy said investigators planned to use airbags or a crane to recover the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver from the Hawkesbury River, about 50km north of Sydney, sometime this week. The investigators will comb the aircraft's components and instruments, speak to witnesses, and conduct checks on the operator and pilot's flying history. They will also investigate whether other items on board, such as mobile phones, could provide additional clues. ""The key goal for us is to keep the aircraft as intact as possible so we're able to investigate,"" he said. He would not speculate on the cause of the crash, saying investigators were still piecing together a timeline. This would include determining whether the plane was operating at full power, ascending or descending, and how much weight it was carrying, he said. The model of plane was generally reliable, he added. Mr Cousins was head of one of the world's largest catering companies, the FTSE 100 firm Compass Group, and a big cricket fan. On Tuesday, former England captain Michael Vaughan joined others in paying tribute. ""Saddened to hear of the passing away of Richard Cousins and some family members in Sydney ... Great man who loved the game of cricket ... Thoughts to all his family,"" he tweeted. Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported the Barmy Army, a group of supporters of the England cricket team, planned to conduct a minute's silence at the Sydney Test, beginning on Thursday. The bodies of the six victims were recovered on Sunday evening. The UK Foreign Office said: ""We are providing consular assistance to the families of five British tourists who have sadly died in a seaplane accident near Sydney. Our sympathies are with their families and friends at this difficult time.""

Outrage over YouTuber's dead body videoSix million people watched the film showing Logan Paul finding an apparent suicide victim in Japan.,"The video was posted to his 15 million subscribers An American YouTube star has prompted a barrage of criticism after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The video showed Logan Paul and friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the ""haunted"" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. Online comments have called the video ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". The video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down. Logan Paul, who has more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube, posted an apology,externalon Twitter, saying he had been ""misguided by shock and awe"". He later uploaded a video apology, and said: ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through."" ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world. Aokigahara has a tragic reputation in Japan and internationally as a destination for people who want to kill themselves. Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their own lives. The 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends. They go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the ""haunted"" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body. The group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out. A member of the group is heard off camera saying he ""doesn't feel good"". Paul then asks him: ""What, you never stand next to a dead guy?"" He then laughs. The identity of the deceased man is not known.

2017 'safest year' for air travel,"A commercial jet prepares for landing 2017 was the safest year in history for commercial airlines, according to industry research. There were no passenger jets crashes anywhere in the world, separate reports by Dutch consultancy To70 and The Aviation Safety Network found. This was despite more flights being made than ever before. But To70 warned that despite high safety levels on passenger planes, the ""extraordinarily"" low accident rate must be seen as ""good fortune"". A report by the Airline Safety Network said there were a total of ten fatal accidents,,externalresulting in 79 deaths last year. That compared with 16 accidents and 303 lives lost in 2016. The organisation based its figures on incidents involving civil aircraft certified to carry at least 14 people. The most serious accident of 2017 came in January when aTurkish cargo plane crashed into a village in Kyrgyzstan killing all four crew and 35 people on the ground. And the incident with the most on-board fatalities happened on New Years Eve, whena Nature Air single-propeller Cessna 208 Caravan plane crashed in western Costa Rica, killing 12 passengers and crew. Neither report counted military or helicopter accidents, meaning the year's worst air disaster,the crash of a Burmese Y-8 military transporter plane, which crashed in June killing all 122 people on boarddid not appear in the statistics. Incidents involving smaller planes also did not figure in the data. Aviation deaths have been steadily falling for the last two decades. In 2005, there were more than 1,000 deaths on-board commercial passenger flights worldwide, the Aviation Safety Network said. The last fatal passenger jet airliner accident took place in November 2016 in Colombia, and the last commercial passenger aircraft crash to kill more than 100 people occurred in Egypt a year earlier. ASN said the accident rate was one fatal passenger flight accident per 7,360,000 flights. ""Since 1997 the average number of airliner accidents has shown a steady and persistent decline, for a great deal thanks to the continuing safety-driven efforts by international aviation organisations such as ICAO, IATA, Flight Safety Foundation and the aviation industry,"" ASN president Harro Ranter said. Dutch consultancyTo70, estimated there was now one fatal accident for every 16 million flights,,externalthough its report was compiled before the Costa Rica crash. ""2017 was the safest year for aviation ever,"" the firm's Adrian Young said, but added civil aviation still carried ""very large risks"". He pointed to new technology including fears of lithium-ion batteries catching fire on-board, as well as ""mental health issues and fatigue,"" among the main risk factors for the industry. And he highlighted that there were ""several quite serious non-fatal accidents"" including the ""spectacular""failure of an engine on an Air France A380.

Deadly overnight protests in Iran,"This video can not be played Iran protests: Why people are taking to the streets Iran's supreme leader has accused the country's enemies of stirring days of protests that have claimed at least 21 lives. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was speaking for the first time since people protesting at Iran's economic troubles clashed with security forces last Thursday. Nine people, including a child, died overnight in violence in central Iran, state media say. The protests are the largest since the disputed 2009 presidential election. They began last Thursday in the city of Mashhad, initially against price rises and corruption, but have since spread amid wider anti-government sentiment. In a post on his official website, Iran's supreme leader was quoted as saying: ""In recent days, enemies of Iran used different tools including cash, weapons, politics and intelligence services to create troubles for the Islamic Republic.""

He said he would address the nation about the recent events ""when the time was right"". Why are there protests in Iran? An unpredictable challenge for Iran Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' Analysts say the supreme leader's reference to ""enemies"" is a swipe at Israel, the US and regional rival Saudi Arabia. Tasnim news quoted Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, as warning Saudi Arabia that there would be a response from Iran ""and they know how serious it can be"". Musa Ghazanfarabadi, the head of Tehran's Revolutionary Court, in turn warned that the ringleaders of the protests would face harsh punishment. President Hassan Rouhani's words have been more measured. He has called the protests an ""opportunity, not a threat"", recognised economic discontent and said people had a right to take to the streets. However, he has also vowed to crack down on ""lawbreakers"". This video can not be played State TV shows protesters in the city of Qahderijan attacking a police station Reformist and moderate MPs have released a statement urging the authorities to be open to criticism and to be tolerant of the right to protest which, they said, was enshrined in the constitution. But they also accused the US of trying to take advantage of the situation. The Islamic Propagation Co-ordination Council, which organises state rallies, has called on people to turn out on Wednesday for pro-government events in Kermanshah, Alborz, Isfahan and Hormozgan provinces. Iran's Revolutionary Guards take lead on foreign affairs US warns Iran: The world is watching Who is Hassan Rouhani? There were reports on social media on Tuesday of more unrest, although it is not possible to confirm it independently or the exact timing. The reports spoke of shots being fired in Sanandaj, in Kurdistan province; a video showed protesters and security forces on the streets of the city of Hamedan; a second video appeared to show flash bombs or grenades being thrown in Rasht and a third showed street fires in Karaj. Other unrest was reported in Gohardasht and Eslamabad-e-Gharb. Nine deaths were reported overnight into Tuesday: Six protesters died in an apparent attempt to seize guns from a police station in the town of Qahderijan in the central province of Isfahan, state TV reported An 11-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were reported killed in the town of Khomeinishahr A member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards was fatally wounded in nearby Kahrizsang, state media say US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Iran's allegation that foreign enemies were behind the protests was ""complete nonsense"". She said the US also planned to call an emergency session at the UN.

Iran's foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Ghasemi, responded by saying Mr Trump should focus on ""the domestic issues of his own country, such as daily killings of dozens of people... and the existence of millions of homeless and hungry people"". In other reaction: The EU called on Iran to guarantee its citizens' right to peaceful protest, saying it had been in touch with the Iranian authorities and was monitoring the situation Turkey expressed concern at the unrest spreading and warned against any escalation France said it was concerned at the number of victims and arrests By Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor When the protests started last Thursday, they were about the current economic crisis but as they spread, pent-up frustrations spilled out and politics became a big part of them. President Rouhani has been widely criticised. He has disappointed voters who hoped he would do more to turn round an economy that has been damaged by years of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. Iran's role in conflicts across the Middle East has also been criticised as it is an expensive foreign policy at a time when people in Iran are getting poorer. Leading figures in the Islamic Republic have also been targeted by protesters, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. He has responded by blaming foreigners. Iran has suffered in the past from foreign interference, so his words will strike a chord among some - and could also signal a much tougher response from the security forces. The demonstrations do not seem to have recognisable leaders, unlike the last big protests after the disputed presidential election in 2009. At that time, the elite of the Islamic Republic was divided. It is not at the moment, so that will make it harder for the protests to be sustained, and they may run out of steam. But the fact they are happening at all is very significant. They show how discontented Iranians are with increasing poverty, after years of repression. Mass demonstrations - referred to as the Green Movement - were held by millions of opposition supporters against the disputed election victory of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. At least 30 people were killed and thousands arrested in the wave of protests, which drew the largest crowds in Iran since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.

"Hollywood women launch abuse campaignMore than 300 actresses, writers and directors back a project to fight sexual harassment at work.11h11 hours agoUS & Canada","Television producer Shonda Rhimes and actresses Natalie Portman and America Ferrera are among the supporters More than 300 actresses, writers and directors have launched a project to help fight sexual harassment in the film industry and other workplaces. The initiative, which is called Time's Up, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times. The Hollywood project is described as a ""unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere"". It comes in the wake of sexual abuse allegations by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein. The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, has already raised more than $13m (Â£9.6m) of its $15m target. The money raised will be used to fund legal support,externalfor both female and male victims of sexual harassment at work. The project is aimed primarily at those who are unable to meet the payments to defend themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. In a ""solidarity letter"" published on its website,Time's Up says the ""struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard"" must end,external, adding: ""Time's up on this impenetrable monopoly."" The letter, which is aimed at ""every woman... who has had to fend off sexual advances"", goes on to say that such harassment can often continue because ""perpetrators and employers never face any consequences"". Exploring the casting couch culture of LA The photographer telling women's sexual harassment stories How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Who are Time's ""silence breakers""? Harvey Weinstein scandal: Who has accused him of what? It also calls for ""gender inequality and the imbalance of power"" to be addressed, stressing the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay. In December, Time magazine named ""the Silence Breakers"" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its ""Person of the Year"" for 2017. Last year also saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. The term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity. Between October and December 2017, the hashtag was used on Twitter and Facebook more than six million times.

Outrage over YouTuber's dead body videoSix million people watched the film showing Logan Paul finding an apparent suicide victim in Japan.4m4 minutes agoAsia,"The video was posted to his 15 million subscribers An American YouTube star has prompted a barrage of criticism after he posted a video which showed the body of an apparent suicide victim in Japan. The video showed Logan Paul and friends at the Aokigahara forest at the base of Mount Fuji, known to be a frequent site of suicides. Going in to film the ""haunted"" forest, they come across a man's body and are shocked but also make jokes. Online comments have called the video ""disrespectful"" and ""disgusting"". The video was uploaded on Sunday and had millions of views on YouTube before it was taken down. Logan Paul, who has more than 15 million subscribers on YouTube, posted an apology,externalon Twitter, saying he had been ""misguided by shock and awe"". He later uploaded a video apology, and said: ""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through."" ""I'm ashamed of myself,"" he added. ""I'm disappointed in myself."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Japan has one of the highest rates of suicide in the developed world. Aokigahara has a tragic reputation in Japan and internationally as a destination for people who want to kill themselves. Data on the number of suicides there each year is not made public, to avoid publicising the site. Signs are posted in the forest urging people to seek medical help rather than take their own lives. The 15-minute video is part of a series of posts from Japan where the US vlogger is on a trip with friends. They go on a visit to the forest intending to focus on the ""haunted"" aspect of it, he says in the video. After walking a short distance into the forest, the group come across a body. The group is filmed approaching the body, which is shown in several close-ups where only the face is blurred out. A member of the group is heard off camera saying he ""doesn't feel good"". Paul then asks him: ""What, you never stand next to a dead guy?"" He then laughs. The identity of the deceased man is not known.

Appropriate disposal of right-wing agitation!"" in parliament in December Two German far-right politicians are being investigated by police over anti-Muslim messages on New Year's Eve. Beatrix von Storch, deputy leader of the AfD party, had her Twitter account temporarily suspended on Monday after posting an inflammatory message. She accused Cologne police of appeasing ""barbaric, gang-raping Muslim hordes of men"" after they tweeted a new-year message in Arabic. Another politician is being investigated after supporting her. Alice Weidel, one of the party's leaders, wrote on Facebook that authorities were submitting to ""imported, marauding, groping, abusive, knife-stabbing migrant mobs"".

Seaplane in fatal crash to be recovered,"Victims (clockwise from top left) Richard Cousins, Emma Bowden, Will Cousins, Gareth Morgan, Heather Bowden, Ed Cousins A seaplane that crashed and killed six people - including five Britons - is expected to be raised from an Australian river this week so it can be forensically examined, authorities say. The cause of the New Year's Eve crash north of Sydney is not yet known. It claimed the lives of Compass Group chief Richard Cousins, four members of his family, and a Sydney-based Canadian pilot. There were no survivors. Investigators will release a preliminary report in about 30 days. ""The full sequence of events leading up to the accident is not fully understood at this stage,"" said Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) executive director Nat Nagy on Tuesday. Mr Cousins, 58, died alongside his fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, 48, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, and pilot Gareth Morgan, 44. Tributes paid to seaplane crash family The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay, about 50km (30 miles) away. The single-engine aircraft belonged to sightseeing flight company Sydney Seaplanes, which offers scenic flights over local tourist attractions. Mr Nagy said investigators planned to use airbags or a crane to recover the De Havilland DHC-2 Beaver from the Hawkesbury River, about 50km north of Sydney, sometime this week. The investigators will comb the aircraft's components and instruments, speak to witnesses, and conduct checks on the operator and pilot's flying history. They will also investigate whether other items on board, such as mobile phones, could provide additional clues. ""The key goal for us is to keep the aircraft as intact as possible so we're able to investigate,"" he said. He would not speculate on the cause of the crash, saying investigators were still piecing together a timeline. This would include determining whether the plane was operating at full power, ascending or descending, and how much weight it was carrying, he said. The model of plane was generally reliable, he added. Mr Cousins was head of one of the world's largest catering companies, the FTSE 100 firm Compass Group, and a big cricket fan. On Tuesday, former England captain Michael Vaughan joined others in paying tribute. ""Saddened to hear of the passing away of Richard Cousins and some family members in Sydney ... Great man who loved the game of cricket ... Thoughts to all his family,"" he tweeted. Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported the Barmy Army, a group of supporters of the England cricket team, planned to conduct a minute's silence at the Sydney Test, beginning on Thursday. The bodies of the six victims were recovered on Sunday evening. The UK Foreign Office said: ""We are providing consular assistance to the families of five British tourists who have sadly died in a seaplane accident near Sydney. Our sympathies are with their families and friends at this difficult time.""

S Korea offers high-level talks with North,"Only two North Korean athletes qualify for this year's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea has offered high-level talks with North Korea next Tuesday to discuss its possible participation in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. The North's leader, Kim Jong-un, said earlier he was considering sending a team to Pyeongchang in South Korea for the Games in February. He said the two sides should ""urgently meet to discuss the possibility"". South Korea's president said he saw the offer as a ""groundbreaking chance"" to improve relations. At a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Moon Jae-in also said the North's nuclear programme would be the backdrop of any sporting discussions. US President Donald Trump said sanctions ""and other pressures"" were beginning to have an impact on North Korea. Referring to the possible North-South dialogue he tweeted: ""Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

South Korean Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon proposed a meeting at Panmunjom, the so-called ""truce village"". This video can not be played Tensions are high between the two warring countries The village, in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the border, is where the Koreas have historically held talks. It is not yet known who, if anyone, will attend the proposed talks as North Korea has yet to respond. President Moon said he wanted his ministers to act fast to ensure the North's delegation attended. If the two countries do meet, Hyung Eun Kim from the BBC's Korean service says, they are expected to talk logistics: What route the North might take into the host country Whether the athletes would come with a cheer-leading squad Whether the two countries would issue a joint declaration The last high-level talks, in December 2015 in the Kaesong joint industrial zone, ended without any agreement and the agenda was not made public.

Neither happened and instead the North continued to test-fire missiles. Kim Jong-un's New Year speech took an unexpectedly conciliatory tone with South Korea North Korea's leader took many people by surprise when hesaid he was ""open to dialogue"" with his neighbours in his New Year's Day speech.

North Korea has in the past two years quickly advanced its nuclear and conventional weapons programmes, despite increasing international sanctions. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent A step back from the brink of potential war, or an effort to open a rift in the already bumpy relationship between South Korea and the United States? Kim Jong-un's sudden willingness to talk could be both these things. It raises intriguing possibilities in the wake of a year where the drift has been entirely negative: Pyongyang making significant strides in its nuclear and missile programmes Growing external pressure to isolate North Korea Genuine fears that the Trump administration might be on the path to a new conflict on the Korean peninsula South Korea's President Moon has responded positively, eager to bolster his own diplomatic hand. But given that the North sees its nuclear programme as a permanent fixture and President Donald Trump insists that Pyongyang will not be allowed to have a credible means of striking US territory, it is hard to see this crisis abating any time soon. The only two North Korean athletes who qualified for the Games are figure skaters Ryom Tae-Ok and Kim Ju-Sik. Although the North has missed the official deadline to confirm their participation, the skaters could still compete via an invitation from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). In a statement, the IOC welcomed the ""mutual intention"" of the two sides to start direct talks about the participation of North Korea's athletes. ""In this context, the IOC continues its discussions with the NOC (national Olympic committee) of DPRK (North Korea),"" it said. ""To allow for such a participation in respect of the Olympic Charter, the IOC is keeping its invitation for a delegation of the NOC of DPRK open and will take the final decision in due time."" This video can not be played North Korea's star ice-skating duo have qualified for the Winter Olympics The president of the Pyeongchang Games' organising committee, Lee Hee-beom, told South Korea's news agency Yonhap that the North's potential participation was ""like a New Year's gift"".

"More than 11,000 homes empty for 10 years","More than 11,000 homes across the UK have been empty for 10 years or more, research by the Liberal Democrats has found. The figures, from 276 local councils, show there are more than 216,000 homes across the country which have been empty for six months or more. Lib Dem leader Vince Cable called it a ""national scandal"", at a time when ""the homelessness crisis is worsening"". The number of empty homes is down a third since 2010, the government said. Durham had the most empty homes (6,500) followed by Leeds (5,724), Bradford (4,144), Cornwall (3,273) and Liverpool (3,093). Empty homes spike in London commuter belt Couple on how Â£1 house in Stoke-on-Trent changed their lives 'Blight' of 23,000 properties in Wales The data - obtained through a Freedom of Information request - also reveals only one in 13 councils is making use of Empty Dwelling Management Orders. EDMOs allow councils in England and Wales to take over residential properties that have been empty for six months or more. Just 19 of the 247 councils in England and Wales that responded (the powers do not apply in Scotland) had used an EDMO in the past five years. Councils did return 23,000 empty homes back into use. Meanwhile homelessness in the UK is getting worse. In December, a committee of MPs found more than78,000 families were living in temporary accommodationin England. The number of people sleeping on the streets had increased by 134% since 2011. Mr Cable has called on the government to review the current system ""which is clearly not working"". ""Councils need to be given the powers and resources to bring empty homes back into use,"" he said. ""This must form part of a wider package to tackle the housing crisis, including building more homes on unused public sector land and clamping down on land-banking."" The Department for Communities and Local Government pointed out that powers had been given to councils to bring empty homes back into use. ""At the same time, we're implementing the major changes to law and investing over Â£1bn to 2020 to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping,"" a spokesman added. Reality Check: Who is homeless?

Trump blasts Pakistan in first 2018 tweet,"President Trump has previously said Pakistan offers a ""safe haven"" to terrorists President Donald Trump has accused Pakistan of lying and deceiving the United States while receiving billions of dollars in foreign aid. In his first tweet of the year, he also alleged Pakistan harboured terrorists. Pakistan reacted angrily to the tweet, saying all the funding was accounted for and that Mr Trump was bitter due to the ""US defeat in Afghanistan"". The US is considering withholding more than $250m (Â£185m) in aid that it delayed sending to Islamabad in August. The move is being considered due toPakistan's perceived failure to crack down more effectively on terror groups,external, The New York Times reports. Allow Twitter content?

US Ambassador to Pakistan David Hale was summoned to the foreign office,externalon Monday to hear a protest over Mr Trump's tweet. Mr Trump has criticised Pakistan for offering a ""safe haven"" to terrorists in the past. Tillerson piles pressure on Pakistan US rhetoric on Pakistan raises serious questions In a speech in August, he said: ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting."" ""It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order, and to peace"", he added. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has suggested Pakistan could lose US privileges US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also put pressure on Pakistan over its perceived backing for the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US is a key ally to the country, which enjoys a special status as a non-Nato alliance partner. But Mr Tillerson has said aid funding ""could be on the table for discussion if in fact they are unwilling to change their posture or change their approach to how they are dealing with the numerous terrorist organisations that find safe haven in Pakistan"". Pakistan has already had millions of dollars of US aid withheld for allegedly not taking enough action against the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. The New York Times said US officials had been denied access to a member of the organisation who they believed could help with information on an American hostage. The Afghan Ambassador to the US Hamdullah Mohib and former Afghan President Hamid Karzai both welcomed Mr Trump's latest tweet.

'Limit children's snacks to 100 calories',"Children between the ages of four and 10 eat more than 120 cakes, buns and pastries a year, figures show Half of the sugar young children in England consume comes from unhealthy snacks and sweet drinks, figures show. On average, primary school children have at least three sugary snacks a day, Public Health England found. This means they can easily consume three times more sugar than the recommended maximum. PHE has launched a campaign to encourage parents to look for healthier snacks of no more than 100 calories - and to limit them to two a day. The eight-weekChange4Life,externalcampaign will offer money-off vouchers towards items including malt loaf, lower-sugar yoghurt and drinks with no added sugar in some supermarkets. How much sugar is hidden in your food? Sugar targets set for cakes and chocolate Sugar warning over fruit snacks Children between the ages of four and 10 consumed 51.2% of their sugar from unhealthy snacks, including biscuits, cakes, pastries, buns, sweets, juice and fizzy drinks, PHE's National Diet and Nutritional Survey found. Each year children consume, on average, some 400 biscuits, 120 cakes, buns and pastries, 100 portions of sweets, 70 chocolate bars and ice creams and 150 juice drink pouches and cans of fizzy drink, the data shows. Too much sugar can cause tooth decay and obesity. Manufacturers are being challenged to cut sugar by 20% in their products by 2020 An ice cream - about 175 calories A pack of crisps - 190 calories A chocolate bar - 200 calories A pastry - 270 calories Source: Kantar research group Soreen malt lunchbox loaves (apple, banana or original malt) Petits Filous fromage frais (strawberry and raspberry, strawberry, strawberry and apricot, strawberry and banana) Fruit Shoot hydro water in apple and blackcurrant flavour Fresh or tinned fruit salad Chopped vegetables and lower fat hummus Plain rice cakes or crackers with lower fat cheese Sugar-free jelly One crumpet One scotch pancake Source: Public Health England The Change4Life campaign now wants parents to give their children a maximum of two snacks a day containing no more than 100 calories each, not including fruit and vegetables. The campaign will offer parents special offers on a range of healthier snacks - ones with 100 calories or fewer - at selected supermarkets, Public Health England said. Healthier suggested snacks include packs of chopped vegetables and fruit, malt loaf, sugar-free jelly, and plain rice crackers. Public Health England said it had also improved itsapp that reveals the content of sugar, salt and saturated fat in food and drink,external. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, told the BBC she hoped the campaign would help to ""empower"" parents to make healthier snacking choices for their children. ""If you wander through a supermarket you see many more things being sold as snacks than ever before,"" she said. ""What has changed is kids' lunch boxes are getting full of snacking products. It leads to a lot of calories for lunch. ""Our research showed us that parents appreciated a rule of thumb. They were surprised how much sugar their children were consuming in snacks."" Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, said: ""The volume of sugar kids are getting from snacks and sugary drinks alone is pretty mind blowing, and it can often be difficult to distinguish which snacks are healthy and which aren't. ""This rule of thumb from Change4Life will help parents make healthier choices, which can only be a good thing."" Public Health England has previously called on businesses to cut sugar by 20% by 2020, and by 5% in 2017, but experts have questioned how the targets can be enforced.

German MP under fire for anti-Muslim tweets,"Ms Storch waves a bag reading ""AfD? Appropriate disposal of right-wing agitation!"" in parliament in December Two German far-right politicians are being investigated by police over anti-Muslim messages on New Year's Eve. Beatrix von Storch, deputy leader of the AfD party, had her Twitter account temporarily suspended on Monday after posting an inflammatory message. She accused Cologne police of appeasing ""barbaric, gang-raping Muslim hordes of men"" after they tweeted a new-year message in Arabic. Another politician is being investigated after supporting her. Alice Weidel, one of the party's leaders, wrote on Facebook that authorities were submitting to ""imported, marauding, groping, abusive, knife-stabbing migrant mobs"". Police say both women may be guilty of incitement to hatred. If so, they could face fines or a prison sentence. Twitter and Facebook have deleted the posts. Just how far to the right is AfD? Why so many voters in Germany's east chose AfD Berlin New Year party to have women's zone AfD leaders called the actions censorship, saying the German authorities were acting like the Stasi in communist East Germany.

Failure to do so could lead to fines of up to â¬5m ($6m; Â£4.4m) Cologne prosecutors must now decide whether to launch an official inquiry.

Nine killed in Brazil prison riot,"Several prisoners were re-arrested a few hours after the riot Police in Brazil say 77 inmates are on the run after escaping amid a riot at a jail in the central state of Goias. The authorities say nine prisoners were killed and 14 injured when a group of armed inmates invaded a wing controlled by a rival gang. One of the victims was decapitated. Police say they have regained control of the jail and recaptured 29 of the 106 prisoners who escaped. Riots are common in Brazilian prisons, which are notoriously overcrowded. Brazil has one of the largest prison populations in the world. The country's jails are largely controlled by powerful criminal factions with access to drugs, mobile phones and weapons. A report by judicial authorities in 2016 described security at the rural penitentiary on the outskirts of the state capital, Goiania, as ""bad"". According to the report, the prison - part of a larger complex - was built to house 122 inmates, but at one point it held 423 inmates. Brazil prison riots: What's the cause? The riot began in the afternoon of New Year's Day when armed members of one criminal gang invaded a prison wing housing a rival gang, setting mattresses alight and firing weapons. Riot police said they had quickly suppressed the riot, but not before 106 prisoners had escaped after breaking down part of the prison's perimeter wall. ""It was a clash between prisoners and it is all under control now,"" said Lieutenant-Colonel Hrillner Braga Ananias. Worried relatives gathered outside the compound in Aparecida de Goiania. ""My brother is inside and I don't have any information about him,"" Luana Cristina told O Popular newspaper. ""No-one tells us anything. No-one tells us who is dead, who is alive, who was shot,"" she added. Jorimar Bastos, the head of Aspego, the state of Goias prison wardens' association, told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper that only five prison officers were on duty on New Year's Day. They were in charge of some 900 inmates across the whole complex, he said.

"'Start saving now for next Christmas'Around eight million people in the UK are likely to struggle with money this month, a debt charity says.3h3 hours agoBusiness","Low-earning households are being urged to start saving money now in time for next Christmas. The Money Advice Trust (MAT) debt charity is advising consumers who struggle with savings to budget for the year ahead. One idea, it says, is to join a credit union. An internet survey conducted for the MAT also suggests that more people will struggle with their finances this January than was the case last year. Some 16% of people questioned said they were likely - or very likely - to fall behind with their finances in January, as a result of Christmas spending. That amounts to 7.9 million people, the MAT said, and compares with 11% in a similar poll last year. The majority - 68% - said they would cope sufficiently during the month. The poll suggested that more than half of households in the country only started saving for Christmas in December. The MAT says one option is to save throughout the year with a credit union - community-owned organisations that tend to offer low-cost loans and savings accounts. ""At the start of this New Year, when resolutions are being made, I would encourage everyone to look at their personal finances and make a plan if they can for 2018 - set a household budget, look at joining a credit union in preparation for next Christmas, and seek free advice atwww.nationaldebtline.org,externalif you are struggling to cope,"" said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the MAT. Those who open Christmas savings accounts with credit unions can only access their money later in the year. ""Credit unions across the country help their members to save towards the costs of Christmas with dedicated Christmas savings accounts which lock funds away and make them available as the festivities approach,"" said Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited. The MAT urges households to: Make a plan for 2018, by budgeting for each month Join a credit union.A list can be found here,external Deal with any debts as soon as possible Meanwhile, the government-backed Money Advice Service suggested that the new year squeeze on finances could be mitigated by having a clear out at home and selling unwanted items and switching to cheaper deals on household bills. This was particularly important if it had not been done for some time. Nick Hill, from the service, said: ""If you're worried about money you owe, then it's best to get advice as early as you can.""

Four men die in New Year stabbingsA fifth victim remains in a critical condition in hospital after four men died in 'unrelated' stabbings.12h12 hours agoLondon,"A 17-year old boy was murdered in Norwood Road, Tulse Hill Four young men were killed in stabbing incidents in London amid New Year celebrations, the Met Police has said. Three were stabbed on New Year's Eve and a fourth in the early hours of New Year's Day in unrelated incidents. Another young man stabbed on New Year's Day is in a critical condition in hospital. Five men have been arrested over the death of an 18-year-old in Larmans Road, Enfield. No other arrests have been made. In the other attacks, a 20-year-old man was fatally stabbed in Memorial Avenue, West Ham, and a 17-year-old boy was killed in Norwood Road, Tulse Hill, on New Year's Eve. Early on New Year's Day, a 20-year-old man was fatally wounded in Bartholomew Court, Old Street. A second man in his 20s suffered critical stab injuries in the same incident. The fatalities in the final hours of 2017 took the number of people stabbed to death in the capital last year to 80, the Met said. Police have appealed for witnesses to the stabbings Commander Neil Jerome said: ""I am grateful to Londoners and visitors to the capital who co-operated with police to enable the vast majority of people to enjoy New Year's Eve. ""However, there were small groups who chose to engage in disorder and violence, and whose actions have had utterly tragic consequences. ""It is heartbreaking that, at a time when so many of us are contemplating what lies ahead in 2018, four families are dealing with the grief of losing a loved one to senseless violence and the callous use of knives as lethal weapons."" The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: ""My thoughts today are with the families of four young men who have tragically been killed in four unrelated stabbings in our city last night. ""We will work tirelessly in 2018 and beyond to stamp out this scourge. I want to be absolutely clear - if you use a knife the full force of the law will be brought down on you. ""You will be caught and prosecuted.""

Tributes paid to seaplane crash family,"Richard Cousins was known at work for his humanity and no-nonsense style, the company chairman said Tributes have been paid to the UK family killed in a seaplane crash near Sydney on New Year's Eve. Colleagues of Richard Cousins, 58, chief executive of one of the world's largest catering companies, Compass Group, described his ""great humanity"". He died alongside his fiancÃ©e, magazine editor Emma Bowden, 48, her 11-year-old daughter Heather, and his sons, Edward, 23, and William, 25, a campaigner. Australian pilot Gareth Morgan, who also died, was known as ""a gentle guy"". All six died when the seaplane - which belonged to a firm running sightseeing tours - plunged into a river 30 miles (50km) north of Sydney. The family, from Tooting, in south-west London, were reportedly flying back to Sydney from an exclusive waterfront restaurant in Jerusalem Bay on New Year's Eve. The crash happened in Hawkesbury River, near the suburb of Cowan, at about 15:10 local time (04:10 GMT) on Sunday, police said. The cause is not yet known and investigators say it could be many months before they can piece together events. Emma and Heather Bowden were on holiday in Australia when the crash happened William Cousins was head of press for campaign group Open Britain Ed Cousins studied at the University of St Andrews Richard Cousins had been chief executive of the FTSE 100 firm Compass Group in Surrey since 2006 - and had been due to retire in September. Compass chairman Paul Walsh said the firm was ""deeply shocked and saddened"". ""It has been a great privilege to know Richard personally and to work with him for the last few years,"" he said. ""Richard was known and respected for his great humanity and a no-nonsense style that transformed Compass into one of Britain's leading companies."" Mr Cousins, a huge cricket fan, was a regular visitor to the Kia Oval in Kennington. His son, William Cousins, was head of press for Open Britain, which campaigns against a hard Brexit. The group's chairman Roland Rudd said he was ""an extraordinary young man who took deep pride in his work"" and would be ""missed beyond words"". Labour MP Chuka Umunna described William as ""an absolute pleasure to work with, utterly dedicated to the cause, dynamic and full of enthusiasm"". ""He went about things with great heart and humour,"" he added. Fellow Labour MP Chris Leslie tweeted that William was an ""exceptionally talented head of press"" who would be deeply missed. Arts editor Ms Bowden, who worked at OK! magazine for 15 years, was the ""Grace Kelly"" of the office, according to former editor-in-chief Lisa Byrne. She was regal, serene, well-educated and could stay calm under pressure, she said. Family friend Jan Gleeson said Ms Bowden was ""a beautiful and positive person"" who ""spread light and happiness among her friends and family"". Her daughter Heather, who was a great friend to Ms Gleeson's son, was ""funny, lovely and always a pleasure to be with"", she said. ""Richard was a lovely, lovely man and together they were all finding the happiness she had so long deserved,"" she added. Edward Cousins had recently graduated from St Andrews University, where he was president of the university's Mixed Martial Arts Club. Friend Alex Brinkman said on Facebook that Ed's ""sense of humour and bright personality"" made training that much better, and he ""embodied what it meant to be a martial artist"". Pilot Gareth Morgan was described as ""a gentle guy"" The single-engine aircraft belonged to sightseeing flight company Sydney Seaplanes, which offers scenic flights over local tourist attractions. Aaron Shaw, chief executive of the firm, described Mr Morgan, the pilot, as a ""gentle guy"". ""Ringing his parents today was one of the worst calls I've had to make in my life,"" he said. He added that all flights had been suspended. This video can not be played Police divers attended the scene of the crash Investigators are trying to establish the sequence of events that led to the accident The crash involved a single-engine DHC-2 Beaver Seaplane The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) said the sequence of events leading up to the accident was not yet understood. Eyewitnesses said the aircraft turned sharply to the right shortly after taking off. The plane then crashed into the river and sank rapidly, ATSB said. One eyewitness told a radio station he had watched from a houseboat as the plane nosedived. He said he had dived in and tried unsuccessfully to open the fuselage door because the plane was sinking so quickly. Police divers were flown to the scene and all six bodies were recovered on Sunday evening. The UK Foreign Office said consular officials were in contact with local authorities and staff were ""ready to provide consular assistance"".

'Ferocious' fire engulfed arena car park,"This video can not be played Sue Wright and her husband, former England footballer Mark Wright, describe escaping A witness has described watching a ""ferocious"" blaze which destroyed about 1,400 cars break out in front of her. It engulfed the multi-storey car park in King's Dock- next to the Liverpool Echo Arena - on New Year's Eve. The venue was forced to cancel the Liverpool International Horse Show and hundreds were left stranded overnight. No casualties were reported. The fire chief said a sprinkler system could have stopped the fire, which began accidentally, from spreading. Sue Wright had been attending the horse show with her husband, former England footballer Mark Wright. She said she saw an old Land Rover - thought by firefighters to be the source of the blaze - with its engine on fire. ""The flames were just shooting out of the engine and coming past the tyres,"" she said. The blaze at King's Dock is thought to have started accidentally ""It looked like a ball of fire on the front of the car and it was producing a lot of smoke. ""We just left everything in the car - handbags, telephone, cash - and just went. ""I saw one car on fire but it was clear it was ferocious and spreading."" About 1,400 cars were destroyed in the fire Mrs Wright took a photo as the flames took hold Dan Stephens, of Merseyside Fire and Rescue, said the flames spread very quickly. ""I believe a sprinkler system would certainly have suppressed the fire,"" he said. ""It would definitely have limited the spread and given us a much better opportunity to put the fire out before it spread to the extent it did."" A sprinkler system could have suppressed the flames, fire bosses say Sue Wright said her family's minibus was a ""write-off"" Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson said there were lessons to be learned. ""If there's things we can do to make the car parks more safer then that is exactly what we will do,"" he said. Liverpool City Council opened a reception centre at Lifestyles Gym for those unable to get home or needing temporary shelter. Others were offered accommodation or lifts by fellow show-goers or locals. Jan Clarke, from Adelaide in Australia, spent the night in the centre with daughters Kaitlyn Bolton, 27, and Shelly, 22 after they were evacuated from a block of flats near the arena. She said the first sign of the fire was smoke and the sound of explosions from across the dock. ""We thought it was firecrackers,"" she said. Those with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company Jan Clarke and her daughters Kaitlyn and Shelly Bolton were evacuated from a nearby block of flats The family took shelter at a nearby McDonald's, where they watched the fire develop. ""All we could see was the smoke,"" Ms Clarke said. ""We could see the smoke getting darker and darker and we heard multiple explosions."" Ms Clarke, who celebrates her 60th birthday on Tuesday, praised the help and advice they were given by emergency services and was hopeful of a return to the flat. She said Shelly, who suffers from epilepsy, had left her medication behind and had missed two doses. ""Everyone here was fabulous, I couldn't fault them,"" she added. Sean and Alison Lightning were walking back to their car when they smelled burning plastic Sean and Alison Lightning, from Northwood, near Shropshire, were walking towards the arena to see the show when they detected the smell of ""burning plastic"" in the air. ""It was surreal,"" he said. ""I said 'knowing our luck it'll be the venue' and it was."" The couple had left their phones inside Mr Lightning's Nissan pick-up truck, but were helped to contact family by strangers and found temporary accommodation. ""People in the street were helping us, ringing our family and leaving messages,"" he added. Emergency services are still at the scene of the blaze No animals were hurt in the blaze and four dogs were rescued from a car on the top floor of the car park earlier. Daniel Delsart, a French show jumper, was supposed to be competing in the show on Sunday evening but ended up helping to evacuate some of the horses. He said: ""I rushed in with a few other riders and officials to pull out the last few horses in the multi-storey. ""The smoke was getting worse and worse and the horses were pretty alarmed with all the fire engine sirens and bangs from cars exploding."" Later smoke began to engulf the stables and he helped to move the horses again as it was getting difficult to breathe. ""The scale of the fire, it was crazy. It's like something that you see on TV but you never think it's possible."" Daniel Delsart had travelled to compete in the show but ended up helping to move horses The flames spread ""very quickly"" The fire service was first called at about 16:40 GMT on New Year's Eve. Crews remain at the scene to continue investigations into the cause of the fire and are guarding against the risk of the building collapsing. All vehicles in the 1,600-capacity car park were destroyed, Merseyside Police said. Those with vehicles in the car park have been told to contact their insurance company quoting reference number 650 of 31 December. This video can not be played Witness Olly Harrison said he heard bangs and explosions as he was turned away from the arena A spokeswoman for the Echo Arena said the horse show was cancelled and that ""all people and horses are safe and secure"". The four-day event was due to finish with Sunday evening's show, where around 4,000 people were expected. How ex-England footballer and wife fled fire.
