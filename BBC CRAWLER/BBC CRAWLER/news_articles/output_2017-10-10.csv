Paltrow and Jolie 'among Weinstein victims',"Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer, has been accused of sexually assaulting three women Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are the latest actresses to allege they were victims of sexual harassment by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Both said the incidents happened early in their careers. They join a string of actresses accusing Weinstein of harassment. On Tuesday he also denied allegations of rape made inThe New Yorker,externalmagazine. Weinstein's wife, designer Georgina Chapman, said on Tuesday that she was leaving him. ""My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,"" the 41-year-oldtold People magazine,external. London-born Chapman, co-founder of fashion label Marchesa, and Weinstein, 65, have two children together. The mogul has also been fired over the allegations by his Hollywood studio The Weinstein Company. Clooney joins Weinstein condemnation What next for Weinstein and Hollywood? Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have added their voice to growing demonstrations of public outrage. Their eldest daughter Malia worked as an intern at The Weinstein Company in New York earlier this year. A statement released by the Obamas says they ""have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein"". It adds they ""celebrate the courage of women who have come forward"". Also on Tuesday, Paltrow and Jolie both sent statements to the New York Times, which first reported allegations against him last week. Jolie said in an email: ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did. ""This behaviour towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable."" In a statement, Paltrow alleged that, after Weinstein cast her in the leading role in Emma, he summoned her to his hotel suite, where he placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom. Gwyneth Paltrow has joined the list of people accusing Harvey Weinstein ""I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,"" she told the newspaper. She said she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident, and said he confronted Weinstein. ""I thought he was going to fire me,"" she said. The separate New Yorker report says that 16 former and current employees at Weinstein's companies told the magazine ""they witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances and touching at events associated with Weinstein's films and in the workplace"". The magazine quotes Italian actress and director Asia Argento and Lucia Stoller, now Lucia Evans - who says she was an aspiring actress when Weinstein allegedly approached her in 2004.  Both say they were forced into sexual acts by the producer. A third woman, who did not want to be named, said Weinstein had ""forced himself on me sexually"". Argento said she has not spoken until now because she feared it would ruin her career to do so. ""That's why this story - in my case, it's 20 years old, some of them are old - has never come out,"" she told the New Yorker. Asia Argento, pictured in 2009, has spoken to the New Yorker magazine Other allegations in the piece came from Mira Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for her role in Mighty Aphrodite for Miramax, a studio headed by Weinstein at the time. She told the magazine that Weinstein had tried to pressure her into a relationship. Roseanna Arquette also said that she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement in response to the article. ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,"" she said. ""Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. ""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

May won't say if she'd vote for Brexit now,"This video can not be played Mrs May said she would not answer ""hypothetical questions"" Theresa May has refused to say how she would vote if there was another EU referendum. The prime minister, who backed Remain in last year's vote, was repeatedly asked if she would now vote for Brexit. She told LBC radio: ""I don't answer hypothetical questions."" The PM, who said during the general election campaign that the UK had a ""brighter future"" after Brexit, added: ""I voted Remain for good reasons at the time but circumstances move on."" Downing Street sources suggested it would be ridiculous to say the prime minister's comments raise doubts about whether she will deliver Brexit, as some such as ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage have said. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who was a leading campaigner for Brexit, said: ""She is entirely right to avoid being divisive. ""She is seeking to unite the country, not to perpetuate referendum divisions."" Fairly or not, Theresa May's hesitation in giving her answer on this hypothetical question will give pause for thought to those who harbour suspicions of her real commitment to Brexit. And her ""open and honest"" answer, which refused to come down on either side creates the strange situation where the prime minister appears unwilling to give full-throated support to her government's main policy. Read Laura's full blog Presenter Iain Dale told Mrs May that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had switched from Remain to Leave because former Chancellor George Osborne's gloomy economic predictions about the latter had failed to come true. He asked Mrs May why she could not say she had changed her mind, given that she was leading the country into Brexit. ""Yes and I'm prime minister ensuring I'm going to deliver Brexit for the British people,"" she replied. Pressed again, Mrs May said: ""I could say I would still vote Remain or I would vote Leave just to give you an answer to that question. ""I am being open and honest with you. What I did last time round was I looked at everything and I came to a judgement and I would do exactly the same this time round. ""But we are not having another referendum and that's absolutely crucial."" EU's Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks Mrs May's second in command, First Secretary of State Damian Green, also refused to say whether he would back Brexit if there was a referendum now. Jeremy Corbyn called on Mrs May to guarantee migrants' rights Mr Green, who was a board member of the campaign to keep Britain in the EU, told Channel 4 News: ""I don't resile from anything I said during the election campaign."" But he added that it was a ""meaningless"" question and ""purely hypothetical"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said: ""It is staggering that even the prime minister isn't convinced by the government's approach to Brexit. ""If Theresa May doesn't have any faith in her own government's policies, why is she still driving this country towards the cliff edge? ""Theresa May says she would weigh up the evidence again, she shouldn't deny that right to the British people. ""The public must have the chance to change their mind if they want to, once the government comes back with a deal."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""How can Theresa May negotiate Brexit without believing in it?"" In the same LBC interview, Mrs May said she could not guarantee the status of the estimated 1.2 million UK nationals living in other EU countries if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal. And she warned that rights held by more than three million EU nationals in the UK could ""fall away"" in a ""no deal"" scenario, something the government is actively preparing for if talks in Brussels fail. ""By definition, if there isn't a deal we won't have been able to agree with the EU what happens to UK citizens currently living in countries like Spain and Italy and other members of the EU,"" said the prime minister. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: ""Unacceptable. The Tories' chaotic handling of Brexit means no deal is a real risk. Theresa May must guarantee EU migrants' rights now.""

Catalonia independence bid on hold,"This video can not be played Catalan leader seeks talks to secure independence Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and other regional leaders have signed a declaration of independence from Spain, following the disputed referendum. However, they say the move will not be implemented for several weeks to allow talks with the government in Madrid. The document calls for Catalonia to be recognised as an ""independent and sovereign state"". The move was immediately dismissed by the Spanish central government in Madrid. A 1 October referendum in the north-eastern province - which Catalan leaders say resulted in a Yes vote for independence - was declared invalid by Spain's Constitutional Court. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Puigdemont told the Catalan parliament in Barcelona that the region had won the right to be independent as a result of the vote. The view from Barcelona v Madrid Puigdemont's announcement - reaction and analysis Catalonia crisis: What are the options now? The referendum resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence, Catalan officials say. But anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot - which had a reported turnout of 43% - and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters while implementing the legal ruling banning the referendum. A pro-independence rally was held near the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona The declaration reads: ""We call on all states and international organisations to recognise the Catalan republic as an independent and sovereign state. This video can not be played Pablo Insa Iglesias and Elisabeth BesÃ³ sit on opposite sides of the argument Mr Puigdemont told the regional parliament that the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid, but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. ""We are all part of the same community and we need to go forward together. The only way forward is democracy and peace,"" he told deputies. But he also said Catalonia was being denied the right to self-determination, and paying too much in taxes to the central government in Madrid. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? SCatalan crisis: Six things you need to know Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria responded to Tuesday's developments by saying: ""Neither Mr Puigdemont nor anybody else can claim... to impose mediation. ""Any dialogue between democrats has to take place within the law."" She added: ""After having come so far, and taken Catalonia to the greatest level of tension in its history, President Puigdemont has now subjected his autonomous region to its greatest level of uncertainty. ""The speech the president... gave today is that of a person who does not know where he is, where he's going, nor who he wants to go there with."" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called an extraordinary cabinet meeting for Wednesday morning to address the latest moves in the crisis. By the BBC's Tom Burridge, in Barcelona As Catalonia's leader announced he would declare independence, thousands of his supporters, watching his speech nearby, on a big screen, were euphoric. But seconds later - when Carles Puigdemont qualified his announcement - and said the declaration would be suspended for several weeks, the disappointment was visible in the crowd. Mr Puigdemont's language was stark, claiming that he had to follow the will of the Catalan people. But he is playing for time - offering a window for the possibility of dialogue with Madrid. His ultimate aim, to pressure the Spanish government to allow a legitimate referendum, remains. But it's highly unlikely that the Spanish government will accept that and there are signals now that its patience is wearing thin. Catalonia's centre-right, centre-left coalition government only had a majority of MPs in the regional parliament with the support of another small pro-independence party, on the far left. That party is unhappy that there has been no clear declaration of independence. And so Catalonia's awkward coalition of pro-independence parties feels more fragile. Independence supporters had been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaraciÃ³ (10 October Declaration) on Twitter, amid expectations that Mr Puigdemont would ask parliament to declare independence on the basis ofthe referendum law,externalit passed last month. But influential figures including Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau and European Council President Donald Tusk had urged Mr Puigdemont to step back from declaring independence. This video can not be played What do Scottish nationalists think about Catalonia? Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution. However, a 2005 amendment redefining the region as a ""nation"", boosting the status of the Catalan language and increasing local control over taxes and the judiciary, was reversed by the Constitutional Court in 2010. The economic crisis further fuelled discontent and pro-independence parties took power in the region in the 2015 elections. Catalonia is is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports. But a stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. Are you in the region?

Trump challenges Rex Tillerson to IQ test,"US President Donald Trump has challenged his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, to an IQ test, in the latest sign of discord between the two. He made the remark in a magazine interview when asked about reports that Mr Tillerson had called him a moron. ""I think it's fake news,"" Mr Trumptold Forbes,external, ""but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win."" Mr Trump had lunch on Tuesday with Mr Tillerson. Shortly beforehand, the president maintained he still had confidence in the secretary of state. ""I did not undercut anybody,"" he also told reporters. ""I don't believe in undercutting people."" Asked about Mr Trump's IQ test challenge, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the daily news briefing: ""It was a joke. You should get a sense of humour."" Reports have swirled of a schism in the Trump administration between the commander-in-chief and his top diplomat, as the US faces a host of vexatious foreign policy conundrums, from North Korea to Iran. Last week Mr Tillersoncalled a news conference to dismiss reportsthat he was considering quitting. This video can not be played In October, Rex Tillerson responded to a report he called Mr Trump 'a moron' But the former ExxonMobil chief executive did not deny an NBC News report that he had called his boss a moron after a July meeting at the Pentagon. Earlier this month,Mr Trump publicly undercut the former Texas oilmanby tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" trying to negotiate with nuclear-armed North Korea. Last week the New York Times reported that Mr Tillerson was astonished at how little Mr Trump grasps the basics of foreign policy. According to the newspaper,external, quoting sources close to the secretary of state, Mr Trump has been irritated by Mr Tillerson's body language during meetings. Mr Tillerson is said to roll his eyes or slouch when he disagrees with the decisions of his boss. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter Donald Trump insists that the stories about Rex Tillerson insulting his intelligence - despite being heavily sourced - are ""fake news"". Now, however, he's lobbing one of his trademark counter-punches, just in case. Mr Tillerson thinks he's a moron? Well, he's smarter than Rex, that's for certain. It's classic Trump - a slightly less juvenile version of the ""I guarantee you there's no problem"" retort Mr Trump snapped off during a Republican debate, when Senator Marco Rubio questioned the size of his, er, manhood. Mr Trump tends to get touchy when people doubt his intellect. That's probably why the ""moron"" line has prompted such a furious response from the White House and State Department. During the campaign he said he doesn't have to consult generals because he has ""a very good brain"" and told a rally in South Carolina that he was highly educated and has ""the best words"". In August, he boasted that he was a ""better student"" and went to better schools than all his elite critics. Mr Tillerson may have opened a difficult-to-repair rift with the president. While Mr Trump is quite comfortable with insult-trading, there's one topic that's clearly off-limits.

The war of words between the Trump wives,"Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana, has started a war of words by saying she, not Melania, is the real First Lady and by revealing that she has a direct line to the White House but uses it less than she could to avoid jealousy. Melania is Mr Trump's third wife, and although this is the first time she and Ivana have crossed swords in public, the first wife has certainly had harsh words for her successor, Marla, before. All three of them were at Mr Trump's inauguration as president in January. Here are the stories of the three women and their marriages to Donald Trump. Born in 1949 in Czechoslovakia, Ivana met Donald at a bar in New York and the pair were married for 15 years. She is the mother of three of his children: Donald Jr, Ivanka, and Eric. The couple divorced after rumours surfaced that he was having an affair and he refused to tell Playboy magazine in an interview whether his marriage was monogamous. During a divorce deposition, Ivana accused Mr Trump of raping her, but she later withdrew the comment, saying her words should not be ""interpreted in a literal or criminal sense"" and she meant instead that she had felt a lack of tenderness. He has  said the episode was completely falsified. The divorce is thought to have cost Mr Trump tens of millions of dollars. Ivana's attempts to receive more money than had been laid out in a pre-nuptial agreement were extensively reported in the New York press at the time. She even had a cameo in the 1996 film First Wives Club where she repeated the line: ""Don't get mad, get everything!"" She has married twice since, and has remained close enough to Mr Trump to be photographed next to him at functions (as above). He went on to marry the mistress, Marla Maples. Melania Trump hits back at Ivana's 'first lady' jibe On becoming president, Mr Trump reportedly offered Ivana the chance to be the US ambassador to the Czech Republic but she declined, preferring to be able to summer in St Tropez. ""I'm known by the name Ivana. I really did not need the name Trump,"" she told the New York Post. The first Mrs Trump is promoting her book Raising Trump, to be released on Tuesday. In the course of it, she quipped that she is the real first lady. Melania responded with a statement including the lines: ""There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. Unfortunately only attention seeking and self-serving noise."" Marla Maples was born into a Baptist family in Georgia in the US in 1963, making her 14 years younger than Ivana.  The couple had one daughter, Tiffany. Their relationship began in secret, as an affair that lasted for years. Before it, she had been a beauty queen who took a bit part in a Stephen King film (Maximum Overdrive) and posed for a Delta Air Lines ad. Vanity Fair reported,externalthat Marla lived on Mr Trump's mega yacht, Trump Princess and avoided the press. But she would soon come to the world's attention, when she and the Trumps holidayed in the same town. ""I'm Marla and I love your husband. Do you?"" are the words she reportedly said to Ivana when confronting her in Aspen in 1990. ""Stay away from him! Stay away from us!"" Ivana reportedly replied. Looking back on their divorce, Ms Maples has said she wanted to change Mr Trump but realised after some years that they were not bringing out the best in each other. In 1990, Marla said: ""I'm, like, of the soil, of the country, of a solid, firm belief in God. I would be happier living out on a farm away from everyone."" After the divorce she moved to California.

Last year when Marla competed in Dancing with the Stars she was eliminated quickly, and Ivana said she was ""never happier in her life"". Ivana took another swipe at her during book promotion interviews this week, by telling CBS Sunday Morning that Ms Maples was ""a showgirl"" who had never achieved anything - but she has not responded. Born as Melanija Knavs in Slovenia in 1970, Melania is seven years younger than Marla, 21 years younger than Ivana and 24 years younger than her husband, Donald. She later changed the spelling of her first name to Melania, and moved to the US in the 1990s. Unusual and traditional at once: Melania Trump, First Lady She married Mr Trump in 2005 after meeting him when she was working as a model. He was reportedly intrigued when she refused to give him her number, asking for his instead. She is the mother of Barron, 11, and delayed their move to the White House so as not to interrupt his school year. She is an unusual First Lady in another way: she is the first to have posed nude for a magazine. When she found herself attacked in public by the first Mrs Trump, her scathing statement managed to take some moral high ground: ""Mrs Trump has made the White House a home for [their son] Barron and The President. ""She loves living in Washington, DC and is honoured by her role as First Lady of the United States. ""She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books.""

More Hollywood stars accuse Weinstein,"Producer Harvey Weinstein and his wife, fashion designer Georgina Chapman, who has since said she is leaving him With allegations of rape and sexual harassment swirling around Harvey Weinstein, it is - the Daily Mail says -Hollywood's darkest day,external.  How did the Monster of Tinseltown get away with it for so long, it asks. Accounts by Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie in the New York Times that they were sexually harassed by the film producer are reported on most of the front pages. The Guardian says the stories appear to illustrate apattern of behaviour,externalby Mr Weinstein that carried on for decades. The New York Times - which has beenchronicling the claims,externalagainst Mr Weinstein - says his alleged behaviour was something of an open secret in Hollywood. More established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. A statement by Mr Weinstein's spokeswoman says he unequivocally denies any allegations of non-consensual sex. The Times leads on Chancellor Philip Hammond's article for the paper, in which he says it would beirresponsible to spend,externaltaxpayers' money now in preparation for a ""no-deal"" Brexit.

Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like?,"UK Brexit Secretary David Davis and Chief EU Negotiator Michel Barnier say they both want a deal There's a lot of discussion at the moment about a 'no deal' Brexit. What does that actually mean? It seems to mean slightly different things to different people. But in the current context it basically means that there would be no formal agreement reached during the negotiations between the UK and the EU, which are taking place under the terms of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. These are the negotiations that are led by David Davis for the UK and Michel Barnier for the EU - the fifth round of talks is being held in Brussels this week. Even if there is no deal under Article 50, there would still have to be some kind of formal relationship between the UK and the EU in the long term - for trade, security and every other aspect of bilateral ties. But if the Article 50 process fails there is very little time to work on alternative strategies before  Brexit in March 2019. This is an important question because the timing is critical. One scenario, being pushed by some Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, is that if the current negotiations make no progress - and the EU refuses to move on to talk about a future trade deal - the UK should announce that it will pursue a 'no deal' Brexit instead. Leave supporters believe that would free the UK from all EU structures in one fell swoop. If such a decision were to be made in, say, March 2018 there would still be a year before the UK is due to leave the EU. That's very little time to prepare for such a massive change, but it would be better than nothing. A more worrying scenario for many business leaders, and millions of citizens who are caught up in the Brexit process, is that something could go wrong at the very last minute - perhaps a deal that has been tentatively agreed but is subsequently rejected by one side or the other. Then the UK could crash out of the EU with neither side fully prepared for the consequences. This is the 'cliff edge' that gives many people in business and politics sleepless nights - a chaotic Brexit that would benefit no one. Yes they are - on both sides of the Channel. The UK government has been careful to say that it is not seeking a 'no deal' outcome, but that it has to be prepared for all eventualities. The Prime Minister has tried to move away from an emphasis on her initial message that ""no deal is better than a bad deal"" - but when pushed she continues to defend that stance. So there is a combination here of prudent planning behind the scenes, and public statements which aim to have an impact on the negotiations - trying to hurry things up by warning of possible alternatives. For the EU, the President of the European Council Donald Tusk has been very clear, arguing that no deal would be the worst deal of all. ""A no-deal scenario would be bad for everyone,"" he said earlier this year, ""but above all for the UK."" Contingency planning is also happening elsewhere in the EU, though - within both governments and the business community. The Federation of German Industries (BDI) said last week that it was setting up a task force of major companies to make provisions for the ""serious case of a very hard exit."" Anything else, it said, would be naÃ¯ve. If the two-year Article 50 process came to an end with no agreement, the UK would leave the EU on 29 March 2019 with no deal in place. Again, much would then depend on how long both sides have had to prepare for this. The consequences of 'no deal' would affect almost every aspect of life, and it is impossible to say exactly how events would unfold.  But here are a few examples: Money:With no agreement in place, according to aHouse of Lords report,externalthere would be no legal obligation for the UK to make any payment as part of a financial settlement. That would leave a huge hole in the EU budget. It would save the UK money in this instance, but it would antagonise the rest of the EU and further sour relations. Legal action, possibly via the International Court of Justice in The Hague, could not be ruled out. Citizens:Without a deal or other residency rights, the entitlement of EU nationals to reside in the UK, or of UK nationals to reside elsewhere in the EU, could technically disappear overnight. In theory, they could become third country nationals, subject to domestic immigration rules. Given the fact that this would affect more than three million EU citizens in the UK, and nearly a million UK citizens in the EU, it could well be that individual EU countries would try to strike deals with the UK to guarantee citizens' rights. Common sense should prevail, but that cannot be guaranteed. Trade:With no new trade agreement with the EU, the rules of the World Trade Organisation would apply. Tariffs would be imposed on goods that the UK sends to the EU, and on goods the EU sends to the UK. It would not be the frictionless trade - certainly to begin with - that the government hopes to promote. Tariffs on many industrial products would be 2-3%, but on cars they would be 10% and on many agricultural products between 20% and 40%. The trade in services would also suffer if nothing was agreed in advance. Under a pure 'no deal' scenario, businesses would lose their passporting rights, which allow them to sell their services across the EU without having to obtain licences in each individual country. The financial services industry would be particularly vulnerable, and it accounts for a significant slice of the UK economy. Again it is worth emphasising that all these restrictions would apply to EU businesses wanting to trade in the UK as well. 'No deal' is not a one-way street. Without any deal, and with no transition period negotiated, the UK would be free to sign trade agreements around the world as soon as it could finalise them. How might it try to go about this? There are a few pointershere. Customs:A government White Paper on customs, published yesterday, sets out options for a 'no deal' scenario in more detail. A customs bill will make provision for the UK to establish a stand-alone customs regime from day one, applying the same duties to every country with which it has no special deal. Traders would need to present goods to HM Revenue and Customs ""inland as much as possible"" to avoid congestion at ports, and consignments would need to be pre-notified to customs authorities, to try to ensure that trade continues to flow as seamlessly as possible. The White Paper promises to minimise disruption for business and travellers - but to give some idea of the scale of the challenge, HMRC estimates that about 130,000 businesses that export to the EU would be dealing with customs for the first time. 'No deal' is not the government's preferred option; and the detail in the customs paper hints at how disruptive it could be. The border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would, in particular, be a huge concern, with serious ramifications for the Northern Ireland peace process. Regulations:With no deal of any kind in place, the UK would suddenly cease to be a member of dozens of regulatory agencies that govern many aspects of daily life. In time, it would need to replace all of them with agencies of its own. Thousands of new employees would need to be recruited and trained - a process which should have already started if there were to be any chance of it being completed before Brexit. EU bodies that regulate the aviation industry and the pharmaceutical industry are often cited as prime examples. One of the main concerns associated with a 'cliff edge' Brexit is that there would be no time to put new measures in place, even if plenty of contingency planning had been done. In theory - under a worst case scenario - that could mean that planes would be grounded temporarily, and drugs could not be imported. But again, the hope would be that common sense would prevail, and that some kind of interim arrangements would be made to keep things moving. It would be in the interests of neither the UK nor the EU for chaos to ensue.

A police operation was conducted at a farm in Rio Grande do Sul state, reported news site Globo. It said 89 roosters were seized and more than $100,000 (Â£75,000) in cash. However, his father said his son was not present at the scene. Cockfighting is banned in Brazil. UOL Sport reported that police arrested 57 people, out of 147 present during the early-morning raid close to Palmeira das Missoe. But Rochemback's father Juarez said they had been together at the family farm elsewhere in the state.

PM's Brexit vote hesitation may haunt her,"This video can not be played Mrs May said she would not answer ""hypothetical questions"" Unscripted but uncontroversial - the prime minister had been safely navigating a radio phone-in. Then a quiet, excellent booby trap question was laid by the interviewer, Iain Dale, for the prime minister. She had, as she has said many times, balanced all the evidence and looked at all the facts to come to her original conclusion about backing Remain in the referendum. She had been lobbied by both sides to pick them, but in the end went for the doomed side of the status quo. Would she, more than a year on, stick to that view? Or is she now a convert, a true believer to the Brexit cause? If there were to be another referendum, what would she do? May won't say if she'd vote for Brexit now EU's Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks Now, to the mind of someone like Theresa May who is known to take time to make decisions, to call for evidence, answering a hypothetical question about something that isn't going to happen is perhaps the daft kind of game that journalists like to play from time to time. The point of those kinds of questions however is to probe a politician's instincts. In sticking only ever to purely factual answers it tells us little of their character, little of their thinking, little of their instincts. Fairly or not, Theresa May's hesitation in giving her answer on this hypothetical question will give pause for thought to those who harbour suspicions of her real commitment to Brexit. And her ""open and honest"" answer, which refused to come down on either side creates the strange situation where the prime minister appears unwilling to give full-throated support to her government's main policy. Of course, as she has said countless times, we are leaving the European Union, ""Brexit means Brexit"" - soundbites repeated ad nauseam. There is no question that she is fundamentally committed to the objective she has set for the government, determined to carry out the policy and Downing Street sources have suggested it would be ridiculous to say her comments raise doubts about whether she will deliver Brexit. But the refusal to be categoric on whether she would choose this set of circumstances was telling. It's easy to see why she wasn't willing to answer. She likes to talk about things that are real, rather than imagined. I remember, in the referendum campaign itself it took months - yes, months - to persuade her to give us an interview about why she had come to her conclusion to support Remain. And most importantly perhaps, she is the kind of politician who believes in doing what people have asked her to do, rather than blindly pursuing what she believes herself. In that sense, in many areas she is not a ""vision"" person, not a policy-pusher either. And for some, that's an advantage, one Brexiteer told me today: ""She is the best person to be the Boss because she is an administrator."" It's not about imposing her views on her party, or the country (of course, she doesn't have the majority to do that in any case). But her hesitation tonight may haunt her - and it's a judder that Number 10 could well have done without at a time when they are trying to rediscover the ground beneath their feet. At the very least, it's a question that she will be asked, again and again.

Farm incomes 'may halve' after Brexit,"Dairy farmers might, in some circumstances, receive higher prices after Brexit says the report The profitability of the average UK farm could fall by as much as half after Brexit, new research suggests. Thereport,external, by the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), says the ""worst-case scenario"" would cut average farm profits from Â£38,000 a year to just Â£15,000. The analysis tries to model the effects of cheaper imported food, reduced subsidies and more expensive labour. A government spokesman said the report was based on highly unlikely scenarios. The UK is due to leave the European Union (EU) in March 2019. Some formal negotiations with the EU started in June, but so far, it is unclear how trade between the UK and the EU will change if the Brexit timetable is met. In fact, the specific negotiations over a future trade deal have not even started. But they will be particularly vital to the agricultural and horticultural industries because of the subsidies which are received under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""This report is based on hypothetical and highly unlikely scenarios that do not reflect the government's negotiating position. ""Outside the EU and free from the bureaucracy of the Common Agricultural Policy, our farmers will be able to focus on growing, selling and exporting more fantastic produce."" The AHDB research looked at three possible outcomes of Brexit: ""Business-as-usual"", with trade arrangements staying much the same and subsidies continuing. Average annual profits might rise to Â£41,000 Reduced subsidies and tariff-free access to the UK for foreign producers. Average annual profits fall to Â£15,000 A ""cliff-edge"" Brexit with trade based on World Trade Organisation rules, and tariffs alongside a big cut in subsidies. Average annual profits fall to Â£20,000. ""Under the three scenarios outlined in the report, changes in the UK's trade relationships will impact farmers' bottom line when the UK leaves the single market, whether or not a free trade agreement is negotiated with the EU,"" said the Board. The CAP gives UK farmers Â£3.1bn a year which, on the face of it, will disappear after Brexit, though the UK government has guaranteed to maintain ""overall"" farm subsidies or payments at the same level until 2022. AHDB, a statutory body funded by a levy on the agricultural industry, said Brexit would inevitably have a ""dramatic immediate impact"" on farm sectors that rely most on subsidies. The effects of Brexit will not be uniform, though, and the position will be complex, depending on the sector and scenario being modelled. Dairy and pig farmers may benefit from rising prices, the report says. On the other hand, significant exporters such as cereal producers and sheep farmers would suffer due to the increased cost of exporting products to the EU. And where businesses rely on migrant workers, higher employment costs due to more stringent immigration restrictions will also push up farmers' costs dramatically, especially in horticulture. An AHDB spokeswoman said there were thought to be between 50,000 and 80,000 EU nationals working in UK agriculture and horticulture, in both permanent and seasonal jobs.

Eggs finally declared salmonella free,"Runny eggs can now be enjoyed by everyone ""Lion mark"" eggs have been declared safe for pregnant women and young children, nearly 30 years after a salmonella scare. Vulnerable groups had been advised not to eat raw, soft boiled or runny eggs. The Food Standards Agency says ""Lion Mark"" eggs, which include almost all of the eggs produced in the UK, are virtually free of salmonella. The new advice comes after a vaccination programme, and improvements to animal welfare. In 1988, a scare over the presence of salmonella in eggs caused a dramatic collapse in sales of eggs and a series of warnings for vulnerable groups to avoid eating them if they were raw or runny. The then junior Conservative health minister, Edwina Currie, declared: ""Most of the egg production in this country, sadly, is now affected with salmonella."" Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning. Mrs Currie's statement wildly overstated the danger and eventually led to her resignation. But there was a problem with salmonella in eggs and by the 1990s producers started a vaccination programme. The ""British Lion Mark"", printed on eggs in red ink, was introduced so that eggs could be traced back to the farm of origin and to show best-before dates. Almost 30 years on from the initial scare, the Food Standards Agency's Heather Hancock, says runny eggs can now be eaten by everyone. This video can not be played Science now shows the risk from salmonella in eggs is extremely low. ""We are now saying if there is a British Lion egg, you're safe to do that. ""The risk of salmonella is now so low you needn't worry. ""And that's true whether you're a fit healthy adult, or whether you're pregnant or elderly or young. ""It's only people on strictly medically supervised diets who need to avoid those eggs."" UK egg production is big business The British appetite for eggs has been growing in recent years. Last year British hens laid 10,372 million eggs, while on average we consume more than 34.5 million eggs every day. And eggs are very good for you, packed full of vitamin D, protein and valuable omega-3 fatty acids. Mother of two Catherine Millington is a big fan, with eggs providing quick, cheap and nutritious meals for her two daughters, who are aged nearly 4 years old and 7 months. ""Eggs are brilliant because you can boil them, break them into bits, and the baby can handle them so we can do baby-led weaning with it. ""And when you're in a rush, they're dead easy."" Just outside Penrith on the edge of the Lake District is The Lakes Free Range Egg Company. Egg farmer David Brass says the introduction of the British Lion standard has made all the difference. ""We know from back in the '80s when all the scare started, there was an issue with eggs. ""But what the Lion standard does, it is a fully independent, audited code of practice to make sure we have standards on the farm that make sure we can't have any of those disease problems again. ""And it has shown time after time, in those intervening years, that it is just a brilliant food safety code."" Over the summer, millions of eggs were pulled from supermarket shelves in more than a dozen European countries - including the UK - after it was discovered some had been contaminated with a potentially harmful insecticide at Dutch farms. British eggs were not affected. 700,000 eggs came to UK from tainted farms Food Standards Agency - Homepage Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres under fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

'I came to school to get sent home',"As the number of pupils being permanently excluded from England's schools has risen by a third over three years, Ben, who was expelled at 13, tells his story in his own words. ""I was a little shit back then, when I was younger. ""I was excluded from class every day, I never behaved, I never listened. ""I walked out of my lessons and I never followed instructions. ""Halfway through Year 8, I was excluded from my school permanently. ""That was before I got my diagnoses and my tablets for ADHD. ""The way ADHD affects you is that if you were looking at the board and you heard someone chatting behind you - your attention is taken away immediately. ""It made it impossible for me to focus. Every time I was in my lessons - I kept on talking. ""If the teachers wanted me to listen to what they said, they would have to take me outside, sit me down and maintain eye contact all the time. ""It became completely normal for me to get in trouble. Now Ben is much more of a team player ""I felt like that was what was expected of me. I would come to school to get sent home. ""I didn't really see my dad that much. He separated from my mum when I was one. ""So my mum was single at the time when I got excluded. ""When my mum was on her own, everything was fine, but we didn't have much money. We were struggling to get by. ""There would be some days when she wouldn't eat - she would just give me the food . ""I was a little shit. I was bad. ""If something didn't go my way, I just flipped out. ""One of the key things for me is that I was able to get off the weed [cannabis]. It was a stressful time and that was really the only release I had. ""Coming here to the Limes [pupil referral unit] and getting my ADHD medication has made me realise that. ""When I look back at the old me I see an idiot. ""Now I am more mature and grown up, and I realise that the world doesn't revolve around me. ""What's next?  After my GCSEs, I want to get into the performing arts, into drama school ""It's an absolute dream of mine to get into a Spiderman costume."" Good relationships are key to turning children's lives around, says Emma ""Turning lives around, that's the business we're in,"" says Emma Bradshaw, head of the Limes College in Sutton, Surrey. ""If this stuff is done right it's life changing. We turn lives around every year,"" she says For most children, she explains, a spell in a pupil referral unit means a chance to get their lives back on track and return to mainstream school. That's providing there are good relations between the PRU and the local schools. But there will be a small number for whom being in a large school will never work, she explains. ""What we do is we look at what is behind the behaviour. ""Behaviour is a form of communication. It's an indication that there is an unmet learning need,"" she says. Trauma is also a significant influence, she says, adding that ""90% of pupils have unresolved trauma issues which need to be addressed with interventions and therapy"". The key to success, she says, is having enough resources to tackle the issues pupils may have at this stage and to provide the right things at the right time. And that can be difficult, while trying to balance a reducing budget. The Limes works by creating tailor-made timetables around pupils and playing to their strengths. Hence the quality of the work they achieve is impressive. Kai, who has severe dyslexia, is very keen on photography. He  worked with some other pupils to create an animation based on the Greek legend of the Minotaur, telling the tale from the monster's point of view. And the results were staggering. So does head Ms Bradshaw think the rise in exclusions is a result of schools wanting to ""get rid of"" challenging pupils? ""No,"" she says, ""if anything I am surprised that some of these children have remained in schools as long as they have. ""You don't find head teachers saying 'I don't really like him I think we should exclude him'."" But if we want to keep more pupils like Ben and Kai in mainstream schools, she says, then we are going to have to change the way schools deal with them. Each day 35 children in England are being told to leave their school permanently, a report for charitable organisation The Difference says. Citing official figures, it highlights a 35% rise over the past few years in the number of pupils excluded from schools. It has grown from 4,950 in 2013-14 to 6,668 in 2015-16, according to Department for Education figures. The Difference also claims children are being pushed out of schools in more informal ways, such as managed moves and by parents being encouraged to ""home teach"". It highlights the high cost to society of not providing these children with the support and education they need to get back on track. The Difference was set up as part of the think tank and charity IPPR to focus on excluded pupils. Founder Kiran Gill says: ""By not addressing their challenges when they first appear, we are brewing trouble for later. The majority of today's prison population were excluded when at school."" She wants to create a new route for talented, well-rounded head teachers to get into PRUs, so that youngsters with a range of complex needs can make the most of their talents. The Department for Education has announced a review to improve exclusions and ensure that best practice is shared across the country. ""The government has also committed to bring forward proposals to ensure that alternative provision is the very best that it can be and gives every child the opportunity to fulfil their potential.""

"The man with 7,000 licence plates","Part of Andrew Pang's display American car registration plates have become aluminium works of art and collecting them has never been more popular. On a quiet street in Arlington, Virginia, one man has squeezed the whole world into his garage. On one wall, all 50 states of America. Next to it, all 13 of Canada's provinces and territories. Most of Mexico is above the garage door, while another wall zips from continent to continent: Montenegro one minute, Micronesia the next. Andrew Pang has spent 40 years collecting plates, and every sheet of metal tells a story. Andrew has ""between 7,000 and 8,000 plates"". He received his first aged seven while growing up in Virginia. ""My friend and neighbour across the street was from Louisiana, and he would go back every summer,"" says Andrew. ""One summer I said 'bring me something back from Louisiana'. He chose to bring me a licence plate from his grandfather's car dealership."" Andrew had ""dabbled"" in stamp collecting and ""had developed an interest in other countries, geography, maps"". When Louisiana landed in his lap, he decided to start collecting. ""I thought 'everyone collects stamps',"" he says. ""This was a little different."" In the US, licence plates are issued by states / territories When plates expire, they can be bought and sold by collectors Some states issue hundreds of types of plates, usually to raise money or awareness for good causes By the time Andrew was 12, he had a plate from all 50 states. His next challenge was collecting a Virginia plate from every year they were issued. Virginia has issued plates since 1906. ""It took me 25 years to complete,"" says Andrew. He found the missing piece of the jigsaw when a woman in Fredericksburg, Virginia, sold her deceased husband's collection. He bought a dozen plates - including the 1906 - for ""around $4,000"". After completing the Virginia set - or ""run"", to use the terminology - Andrew looked for new worlds to conquer. Or new states, at least. He spent four years in Texas, and completed its run. He now wants the set from all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, but admits it will take time. ""I'm very close on DC, Maryland, North Dakota,"" he says. ""But I particularly focus on quality (the plate's condition). I could have finished many (runs) if I took anything."" Many states and territories use their plates to advertise their attractions When Andrew started collecting plates, the hobby was an ""oddity"", he says. But two things have changed that: the internet, and the trend for colourful, well-designed plates. ""Many of the plates in the old days were very, very boring,"" he says. ""At the time their only reason was for identification: two colours, no pictures, no designs. ""With a few notable exceptions, the first real foray into more interesting graphics was 1976 for the US bicentennial (the 200th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence). ""At that time, quite a few states offered very specific bicentennial plates to everyone."" DVLA bans 'offensive' number plates America's 'offensive' licence plates Record price for Bond-themed plates The next marker, says Andrew, was in 1986. After the Challenger space shuttle disaster, Florida issued a plate with a rocket design to raise funds for the Astronauts Memorial Foundation. States began to realise the potential of plates, and the era of brighter, distinctive designs began. Oregon's plates have a fir tree, for example. North Dakota's have a bison. Florida's have two oranges. The effect, when driving on American roads, is twofold. On one hand, the country seems vast: it's not uncommon in DC to see plates from California, 3,000 miles away, for example. On the other, it makes the country seem smaller, more interesting, and more united: oh look, there goes someone from Maine, or Michigan, or Montana. We're all Americans here. Plates design began to change in the 1970s - as seen in these examples from 1970 and 1996 There is, of course, another reason for the rise in well-designed plates. ""The American population is very mobile,"" says Andrew, a 47-year-old accountant. ""This summer we drove 6,000 miles across the country, and that's not unusual. ""The states realised, 'here's my person from Virginia, people are going to see his licence plate, let's do something'. ""If you're in Florida, you're nowhere near a mountain, but you see a car from Colorado and they have the snow-covered peaks on the plate. ""South Carolina, Pennsylvania, and many others put their tourism website on their licence plate. In many ways they have replaced the bumper sticker. It's free advertising."" Massachusetts issued the first licence plate in the US in 1903 American plates have been made from materials including porcelain, copper, and fibreboard Among the rarest plates are 1913 Mississippi and 1921 Alaska. ""When they change hands, it's in the low five figures,"" says Andrew The Automobile License Plate Collectors Association began in 1954. It has almost 3,000 members from all 50 states and 19 countries. Around 500 people attend its annual conventions, and there are smaller, regional meetings too. Jeff Minard became a member in the 1960s, aged 15. ""Your member number is related to when you joined,"" says Jeff. ""My number is 495. There are very few three-digit members alive."" Jeff says licence plate collecting has become ""enormous"", although he distinguishes between ""serious"" collectors, such as the association's members, and those who may have a dozen or so in their garage. ""I'm not dismissing them at all (the less serious collectors),"" he says. ""But we're a little more academic, if I can put it like that."" One collector in Florida has 50,000 license plates. ""Unbelievable,"" says Jeff. Jeff himself has 500, after downsizing his collection from 5,000. ""I sold a lot,"" he says. ""I'm finding homes for them. I don't want someone (else) to have to do that. ""We just hope they don't get recycled for aluminium."" Part of Andrew's international collection - including the Monaco plate (0000) Back in Arlington, Andrew Pang looks at the international plates on his garage wall. In between Albania and the Bahamas is a 1998 plate from Monaco, still in a plastic wrapper. ""I wrote to the prince, asking for a plate,"" he says. ""I didn't expect anything to happen, but it arrived in the post a few weeks later."" Most of Andrew's plates, however, are bought online, rather than from royalty. He has plates from former countries, such as East Germany, disputed territories, such as South Ossetia in eastern Europe, and moments in history, such as when Iraq occupied Kuwait. He even has a plate from the pacific island of Vanuatu. It is made from wood. Andrew is missing plates from around 40 countries and territories. The Pitcairn Islands - a tiny British territory in the south Pacific - are proving tricky, while the Vatican City is ""tightly controlled"". Could you buy one, if money wasn't an issue? ""Probably, but you're talking high hundreds (of dollars), maybe low thousands,"" he says. Andrew has plates from most countries Despite having walls covered in plates, does Andrew still glance at every back bumper he passes? ""I am afflicted with that,"" he admits. ""Just yesterday I saw a vehicle in a parking lot from Puerto Rico, and that's quite unusual. In this area [near DC] I look for diplomatic plates. ""What really excites me is if I see a US diplomat that's coming back from another country, but they're back such a short period of time, the plates from the other country are still on the vehicle."" And what does his wife make of it all? ""My wife is less of a hobbyist than I am,"" says Andrew, smiling. ""While she has grown to understand it and live with it... she doesn't necessarily embrace it.""

Stalking: Not just an EastEnders story,"Michelle Fowler is being stalked by her ex Tom in the long-running BBC One soap EastEnders' character Michelle Fowler began dating a man she met on the Tube called Tom Bailey, but when she tried to cool things off, he wasn't willing to let go. Things have gradually escalated - turning up unannounced on her doorstep, calling, texting, sending presents - and by the end of this week, she's scared enough to call the police. This scenario may be fictional, but more than 1.1m people experience stalking each year, according to the Crime Survey of England and Wales. Zoe Dronfieldis one woman who knows the reality all too well. Her former partner, Jason Smith, had been stalking her for six months when she decided to meet him to try to put an end to the situation. But he followed her upstairs and brutally attacked her, leaving her with stab wounds to the neck, a bleed on the brain, a broken nose and a broken arm. ""My experience was awful and almost led to my death,"" she said. ""But the most terrible part was the disbelief by professionals. ""When you are so vulnerable you turn to those who can help - the police - but without the correct training and attitude towards victims, their response can be the difference between someone's life or death. ""It has to be taken seriously once and for all."" Stalked by a stranger for seven years Murdered by her stalker Thelatest law,externalon stalking describes it as when an individual is ""fixated and/or obsessed with another"", which can be shown by a pattern of persistent and repeated contact with a victim. But the Suzy Lamplugh Trust says it can take many forms, whether sending flowers or carrying out physical or sexual assault. ""If the behaviour is persistent and clearly unwanted, causing you fear, distress or anxiety then it is stalking and you should not have to live with it,"" it says. Figures show 11,889 stalking and harassment prosecutions were started in 2016-17, down by  1,097 offences (8.4%) on the previous year. Most (71%) were related to domestic abuse, the CPS figures showed. However, these are only the cases that are reported and make it to court. When 38-year-old Viviane*had a tradesman come to her home to quote for renovations, she didn't expect what was to follow. ""The initial conversation with him was pleasant,"" she said. ""But the weirdness started when he sent me a WhatsApp message saying that he thought my picture was nice."" Despite her choosing someone else for the work, the man continued to text and call her. ""He would send me messages at 11pm asking me what I was doing. He then would message at midnight and ask me why I was up so late. I would ignore them as I felt it was inappropriate."" But it carried on. He searched for Viviane on dating websites, sending sexually explicit messages to her, and started to call from another number to get around the fact she had blocked him. ""I was scared to upset him because I did not want to encourage rage in him,"" said Viviane. Viviane went to the police, but did not feel she was offered enough support. ""I just felt so alone,"" she said. For now, the calls seem to have stopped, but Viviane lives in fear of them starting again - or worse, him turning up on her doorstep. ""He knows where I live. He knows I work from home. He knows it's just me and mum there."" *Not the victim's real name Organisations are fighting to do more to help victims of stalking and to stop perpetrators from reoffending. Laura Richards, founder of Paladin - the National Stalking Advocacy Service -  will go to Downing Street later to hand in a petition of more than 130,000 signatures, calling on the government to create a register to help police track and monitor stalkers. She'll be joined by Zoe Dronfield and John Clough,whose daughter Jane was stalked and murderedby serial abuser Jonathan Vass. Nurse Jane was stabbed to death in a hospital car park in 2010 by her ex, who was on bail after being charged with raping her. ""Many victims have recounted the terror they have lived with because of their stalker and, of course, there are victims who have lost their life,"" said her father. ""Unless the offenders are labelled and called out for what they are, and accept they are the ones that have to change, their future victims will remain in great danger, with life-affecting consequences."" A report by the Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate in July saidvictims were being left at riskbecause of failings by police and prosecutors. Of the 112 recent cases of stalking and harassment the watchdogs looked at in depth, not a single one was dealt with properly, the report said. This video can not be played Victims of stalking are being failed by police, says a report. Laura Richards from Paladin - who worked on violent crime at New Scotland Yard and advises the National Police Chiefs Council - says if you're being stalked, the first thing to do is tell friends and family about it. ""You need to tell people what is happening as stalkers often try to get in the middle of relationships to manipulate."" If the perpetrator contacts you over social media, she advises on keeping the evidence, which could help in a later case. Keeping a diary of times, places and the people who were there when incidents happen in person is also important, so police can call on them for evidence too. ""The most important thing is to trust your own instincts,"" she adds. ""In cases which have ended in assault and murder, many women have said they knew their stalker wanted to kill them. ""These cases are murder in slow motion, psychologically and physically. Trust your instincts, despite what other professionals might say, and seek advice from organisations like ours. The victim is the best assessor."" S-Say No- Tell the person once that you do not want any contact, and then do not respond further T-Take Notes- Keep a diary of everything that happens and save evidence.

What next for Weinstein and Hollywood?,"Harvey Weinstein has been thanked more often than God in Oscars acceptance speeches Oscar-winning movie producer Harvey Weinstein is at the centre of a sexual harassment scandal, which has led to himbeing sacked by his own company. Actress Meryl Streep - who once called him ""God"" in an awards speech - hasspoken out against him, saying the claims left her ""appalled"". Many others have now denounced him for the alleged behaviour, including Kate Winslet, Emma Watson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Benedict Cumberbatch and Charlize Theron. When the claims were first reported in the New York Times, Weinstein apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"". He later disputed the article, however, claiming the report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". An article inThe New Yorker,externallater said that Weinstein had raped three women, which he denies. Others including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow have now also spoken out, with Jolie saying she had a ""bad experience"" with Weinstein as a young actress, and Paltrow saying he had placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom. It's a dramatic fall from grace for one of the movie industry's highest-profile producers, which could have wider implications for Hollywood itself. Here are five pressing questions that arise from this mounting scandal. Might Weinstein be welcomed back into the Hollywood fold like Gibson was? The man behind such hits as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love reportedly did not want to leave The Weinstein Company - but was fired anyway. He was apologetic but bullish last week when the allegations were first published and threatened to sue the New York Times, the paper thatbroke the story,external. Since then, he's been deserted by both his lawyer Lisa Bloom and his legal crisis adviser Lanny Davis. And in his personal life,his wife Georgina Chapman has now left him. It remains to be seen whether he will make good his threats of legal action. Weinstein was made an honorary CBE by the Queen in 2004 for his contribution to the British film industry, and there have already been calls for that to be revoked. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she's ""concerned"" about the allegations, but any decision on his CBE would not lie with Downing Street. Yet there is always the possibility he can bounce back, like other disgraced Hollywood figures who have returned to the limelight. Mel Gibson, for example, was back on Hollywood's red carpets earlier this year, despite an anti-Semitic rant duringa public meltdown,external11 years ago - although the allegations against Weinstein put him in a different situation. Weinstein (centre) with the other Shakespeare in Love producers after it won best picture at the 1999 Oscars Weinstein's firing comes after a number of high-profile men have left their jobs amid claims of sexual misconduct. These includeRoger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly and Eric Bolling at Fox Newsand Ain't It Cool News founderHarry Knowles,external. Bill Cosby is also facing a retrial over sexual assault charges. O'Reilly saidthey were ""completely unfounded claims"" andBolling described the claimsagainst him as ""untrue and terribly unfair"". Knowlescalled the initial allegation,external""100% untrue"" andlater decided to,external""step away"" from his role. ""Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,"" said actress Rose McGowan in an interviewwith the Hollywood Reporter,external. ""Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not. It is so not a good look."" Jenni Konner, executive producer of the HBO series Girls,told the New York Times,externalon Sunday: ""I see this as a tipping point. ""This is the moment we look back on and say, 'That's when it all started to change.'"" The King's Speech won four Oscars in 2011 Weinstein may have been fired but an internal investigation will still go ahead. The company said it had retained an independent law firm ""to undertake a thorough and independent investigation"". This will be a financial burden on the company, withForbes reporting,externalsuch investigations can cost between $20m (Â£15m) and $40m (Â£30m) to carry out. Forbes also said the company would find it more expensive to raise funds in the future. Weinstein and his brother Bob own 42% of the company, but it's unclear how profitable the company has been in recent years. It had started to move into TV production, but without its most famous figurehead and driving force it is unclear what will happen to any deals it has signed. One third of the company's all-male board resigned when the allegations emerged. The Wraphas reported,externalthat the company is set to change its name in an attempt to move on after Weinstein's firing. The website claims the Weinstein name has been ""irretrievably tainted by the scandal"", although it says a decision has not been formally made. Elizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner co-star in Wind River Weinstein is renowned for his campaigning skills, often managing to turn smaller, independent films into Oscar contenders. A 2015 survey,externalof nearly 1,400 Oscar acceptance speeches by the website Vocativ found that Weinstein was thanked more frequently than God. One of his biggest hits was Shakespeare in Love, which won the best picture Oscar in 1999. A sequel has since been announced, with Weinstein as producer. The Weinstein Company also distributed such films as The King's Speech, The English Patient and Chicago, all of which - like The Artist - won the best picture Oscar. This year the company is pushing Wind River, a wintry thriller starring Jeremy Renner and Mary Elizabeth Olsen. The Current War, produced by Weinstein and starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Thomas Edison, is also a possible awards contender, despite receiving mixed reviews. Will the Weinstein connection dent their chances? Harvey Weinstein at the 2016 Bafta Film Awards in London The Democratic National Committee (DNC) and several Democratic politicians have come out to say they will now channel Weinstein's political donations towards women's rights groups. The producer was a prominent donor to the Democratic Party during the 2016 election campaign. ""The DNC will donate over $30,000 (Â£22,850) in contributions from Weinstein to Emily's List, Emerge America and Higher Heights,"" the committee said in a statement. There are also question marks about his other donations and interests. In a statement issued last week, after the allegations surfaced, Weinstein said: ""One year ago, I began organising a $5m [Â£3.8m] foundation to give scholarships to women directors at USC [University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts]. ""While this might seem coincidental, it has been in the works for a year."" USC is understood to have said it is rejecting the donation. Weinstein was a trustee of Bafta (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) in New York but his membership of the organisation hasnow been suspended,external, with immediate effect. He was also on the board of directors at the US charity Robin Hood, which describes itself as ""New York City's largest poverty-fighting organisation"", but stepped down after the allegations emerged, the charity told BBC News.

'Bulimia battle did not beat me',"Jayne Nisbet said getting to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow was emotional Jayne Nisbet's eating disorder almost robbed her of her sporting dream - but the Edinburgh athlete fought back to compete in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. The 29-year-old, who has now retired from competing in the high jump, spoke to the BBC about her battle with bulimia in order to highlight the issue and inspire others to fight it. Jayne said she had been a top junior athlete who was tipped for the Olympics, but that she ""spiralled downhill"" because her illness. ""I felt like I was useless,"" she says. Jayne Nisbet has written a book about her battles with an eating disorder ""I had bulimia, which was combined with depression, and I suffered from anxiety for lots of years afterwards."" Jayne says she now recognises features of her condition, such as extreme behaviour and perfectionist tendencies, going back to childhood. But it all came to a head in the year before the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in 2010. She had moved to Loughborough in Leicestershire to train at the High Performance Training Centre, but was not eating properly and went down to a weight which was very low for an athlete of 5ft 8in (1.72m). ""People would say to me: 'You are so skinny', and I would genuinely think they were just jealous. Jayne said a medal at Glasgow would have been the icing on the cake ""I genuinely believed what I was doing was going to help my sport. ""But my performances got worse and worse and I became more and more isolated, to the point where I identified: 'This is not ok, I'm not myself any more'. I completely lost myself."" However, Jayne says that admitting she had an issue did not solve the problem. ""In fact, I probably got worse,"" she says. Over the next three months she put on a lot of weight. ""Nobody saw that because I hid myself away,"" she says. ""I used to hide away in my bedroom because I thought everyone was ashamed of me."" Even in the depths of her struggles, Jayne set herself the goal of qualifying for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. She says: ""I spent the first couple of years trying to work it out for myself because I was too afraid to speak anyone. ""By March 2012 I was fluctuating again and I thought: 'Why am I not happy?' ""I got a therapist at that point and he started working through some of my older issues that I didn't even realise existed. ""He unravelled things that I never even knew existed in my head."" In 2013, Jayne had a fantastic season but it was cut short in July by an accident in the gym. She fell from the top of a step-up box and sustained a compression fracture of the spine, exactly a year before the Glasgow games. Jayne missed out on the high jump in Delhi but fought back to compete in Glasgow ""In the past that would have triggered a complete downward spiral, and for a small amount of time it did,"" she says. ""But then I thought: 'What are you doing?' My coach said: 'Do not let this get back inside you, you have come so far'."" She had already pre-qualified for the Commonwealth Games, so needed to get fit and return to her best. In February 2014 she broke the Scottish indoor record with a clearance of 1.87m. Jayne finished 10th in the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow Jayne says that making it to Hampden Stadium for the Commonwealth Games was an ""amazing and emotional"" achievement. ""It was like making it to the finish line for me in terms of mental health issues,"" she says. While a 10th place finish was not as good as she would have wanted, for Jayne making it to the Games was a major success. ""For me getting a medal would have been the icing on the cake,"" she says. ""But it was to actually prove that you can overcome something when you are at such a low point. ""You can get through it all and not let it beat you and become what you were meant to be."" Jayne has since retired from high jump and runs a successful business as a personal trainer. She has also written a book called Free-ed. ""ED is a shorter version of eating disorder, and I want people to find freedom,"" she says. In recent years she has also made a transition from high jump to running marathons. Two years after her Commonwealth Games appearance, she ran a marathon in less than three hours and 15 minutes. She now wants to reduce her marathon time by competing in the London marathon and the New York marathon next year, to celebrate her 30th birthday. She says the Jayne of seven years ago would not recognise the woman she has become. ""The transformation in my confidence since competing at the Commonwealth Games has been huge,"" Jayne says. ""I love an opportunity now to get up and try to inspire people and that's the key thing. ""I want to help people overcome issues to try to get the best out of themselves.""

The government nudges itself over race,"Theresa May has pledged to tackle social and racial injustice in the UK It is fitting, perhaps, that the launch of the government's so-called ""race disparities audit""comes the day after American economistRichard Thaler was awarded a Nobel prize for his work on behavioural economics and nudging, because that is what this project is about. It is a giant nudge to change behaviour on issues of race inequality. The odd thing is that the project is not a government trying to nudge the people. It is a government trying to nudge itself. The prime minister has dedicated her premiership to fighting burning injustices and says she is determined to shine a light on disparities between different racial groups in the UK on a range of areas - health, education, job prospects, housing and so on. A focus on the many and often troubling differences is - of course - no bad thing, but people might well wonder why we need a public website to get Whitehall departments to take an interest. The race audit commissioned no new research. All the information on the website comes from Whitehall departments, the vast majority of which is already in the public domain. Indeed, most of the shocking headlines of disparity from the audit have been reported upon, discussed and debated many times. Graduates from ethnic minorities in Britain are less likely to be in work than their white peers, research has found This shouldn't come as a revelation. Adam or Mohamed - who gets the job? The man correcting stories about Muslims Is everyone racist? 'My colour is part of my brand' Another prime minister, James Callaghan, established the Commission for Racial Equality back in 1976 to deal with racial disparity and discrimination. It is still going, now part of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, a government quango whose job is to promote racial equality. The Social Mobility Commission, another quango set up in 2010, has written many reports on racial disparities, and sent them to ministers. It is perhaps a recognition of the inability of these bodies to get their messages across over decades that we apparently need a race audit website - a pull together of 60 of all the 300 data sets that relate to the experience of different racial groups. The people being nudged are the people who sit around the cabinet table with the prime minister - her own government. ""Explain or change,"" the PM will tell them. Where disparities exist, ministers will be encouraged to explain why they exist. There may be understandable reasons why all races do not experience the same outcomes. It might be a factor of demographics or income, cultural differences or even the chances of developing certain medical conditions.  But if the explanations don't stack up, then departments will be expected to introduce measures to change them. Today's launch is accompanied by some new initiatives. The Department of Work and Pensions has used its own data to identify 20 hot spots where people from racial minorities struggle to access the jobs market, and will now reintroduce a mentoring scheme that was abandoned 10 years ago. The question remains, though. Given that ministers have known about these ""troubling"" and ""shocking"" disparities for years or even decades, why does it take a prime ministerial nudge to get them to take action?

Harvey Weinstein denies rape accusations,"Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer, has been accused of sexually assaulting three women Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are the latest actresses to allege they were victims of sexual harassment by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Both said the incidents happened early in their careers. They join a string of actresses accusing Weinstein of harassment. On Tuesday he also denied allegations of rape made inThe New Yorker,externalmagazine. Weinstein's wife, designer Georgina Chapman, said on Tuesday that she was leaving him. ""My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,"" the 41-year-oldtold People magazine,external. London-born Chapman, co-founder of fashion label Marchesa, and Weinstein, 65, have two children together. The mogul has also been fired over the allegations by his Hollywood studio The Weinstein Company. Clooney joins Weinstein condemnation What next for Weinstein and Hollywood? Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have added their voice to growing demonstrations of public outrage. Their eldest daughter Malia worked as an intern at The Weinstein Company in New York earlier this year. A statement released by the Obamas says they ""have been disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein"". It adds they ""celebrate the courage of women who have come forward"". Also on Tuesday, Paltrow and Jolie both sent statements to the New York Times, which first reported allegations against him last week. Jolie said in an email: ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did. ""This behaviour towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable."" In a statement, Paltrow alleged that, after Weinstein cast her in the leading role in Emma, he summoned her to his hotel suite, where he placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom. Gwyneth Paltrow has joined the list of people accusing Harvey Weinstein ""I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,"" she told the newspaper. She said she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident, and said he confronted Weinstein. ""I thought he was going to fire me,"" she said. The separate New Yorker report says that 16 former and current employees at Weinstein's companies told the magazine ""they witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances and touching at events associated with Weinstein's films and in the workplace"". The magazine quotes Italian actress and director Asia Argento and Lucia Stoller, now Lucia Evans - who says she was an aspiring actress when Weinstein allegedly approached her in 2004.  Both say they were forced into sexual acts by the producer. A third woman, who did not want to be named, said Weinstein had ""forced himself on me sexually"". Argento said she has not spoken until now because she feared it would ruin her career to do so. ""That's why this story - in my case, it's 20 years old, some of them are old - has never come out,"" she told the New Yorker. Asia Argento, pictured in 2009, has spoken to the New Yorker magazine Other allegations in the piece came from Mira Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for her role in Mighty Aphrodite for Miramax, a studio headed by Weinstein at the time. She told the magazine that Weinstein had tried to pressure her into a relationship. Roseanna Arquette also said that she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement in response to the article. ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,"" she said. ""Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. ""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Catalan independence vote on hold,"This video can not be played Catalan leader seeks talks to secure independence Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and other regional leaders have signed a declaration of independence from Spain, following the disputed referendum. However, they say the move will not be implemented for several weeks to allow talks with the government in Madrid. The document calls for Catalonia to be recognised as an ""independent and sovereign state"". The move was immediately dismissed by the Spanish central government in Madrid. A 1 October referendum in the north-eastern province - which Catalan leaders say resulted in a Yes vote for independence - was declared invalid by Spain's Constitutional Court. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Puigdemont told the Catalan parliament in Barcelona that the region had won the right to be independent as a result of the vote. The view from Barcelona v Madrid Puigdemont's announcement - reaction and analysis Catalonia crisis: What are the options now? The referendum resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence, Catalan officials say. But anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot - which had a reported turnout of 43% - and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters while implementing the legal ruling banning the referendum. A pro-independence rally was held near the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona The declaration reads: ""We call on all states and international organisations to recognise the Catalan republic as an independent and sovereign state. This video can not be played Pablo Insa Iglesias and Elisabeth BesÃ³ sit on opposite sides of the argument Mr Puigdemont told the regional parliament that the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid, but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. ""We are all part of the same community and we need to go forward together. The only way forward is democracy and peace,"" he told deputies. But he also said Catalonia was being denied the right to self-determination, and paying too much in taxes to the central government in Madrid. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? SCatalan crisis: Six things you need to know Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria responded to Tuesday's developments by saying: ""Neither Mr Puigdemont nor anybody else can claim... to impose mediation. ""Any dialogue between democrats has to take place within the law."" She added: ""After having come so far, and taken Catalonia to the greatest level of tension in its history, President Puigdemont has now subjected his autonomous region to its greatest level of uncertainty. ""The speech the president... gave today is that of a person who does not know where he is, where he's going, nor who he wants to go there with."" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called an extraordinary cabinet meeting for Wednesday morning to address the latest moves in the crisis. By the BBC's Tom Burridge, in Barcelona As Catalonia's leader announced he would declare independence, thousands of his supporters, watching his speech nearby, on a big screen, were euphoric. But seconds later - when Carles Puigdemont qualified his announcement - and said the declaration would be suspended for several weeks, the disappointment was visible in the crowd. Mr Puigdemont's language was stark, claiming that he had to follow the will of the Catalan people. But he is playing for time - offering a window for the possibility of dialogue with Madrid. His ultimate aim, to pressure the Spanish government to allow a legitimate referendum, remains. But it's highly unlikely that the Spanish government will accept that and there are signals now that its patience is wearing thin. Catalonia's centre-right, centre-left coalition government only had a majority of MPs in the regional parliament with the support of another small pro-independence party, on the far left. That party is unhappy that there has been no clear declaration of independence. And so Catalonia's awkward coalition of pro-independence parties feels more fragile. Independence supporters had been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaraciÃ³ (10 October Declaration) on Twitter, amid expectations that Mr Puigdemont would ask parliament to declare independence on the basis ofthe referendum law,externalit passed last month. But influential figures including Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau and European Council President Donald Tusk had urged Mr Puigdemont to step back from declaring independence. This video can not be played What do Scottish nationalists think about Catalonia? Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution. However, a 2005 amendment redefining the region as a ""nation"", boosting the status of the Catalan language and increasing local control over taxes and the judiciary, was reversed by the Constitutional Court in 2010. The economic crisis further fuelled discontent and pro-independence parties took power in the region in the 2015 elections. Catalonia is is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports. But a stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. Are you in the region?

Big questions from The Last Jedi trailer,"Will Daisy Ridley's Rey use the Force for good or evil? The first full trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi,externaldoes its job brilliantly - it teases galaxy-rattling plot lines while leaving you unsure about whether what you think will happen is what is actually going to happen. On top of that, there are the ""oohs"" of spectacular battle scenes combined with the ""ahhs"" of some new cute fluffy creatures. We also see Carrie Fisher in some of her final shots as General Leia, filmed before her death last Christmas. Above all, it raises some big questions about what might unfold in the Star Wars universe. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She's seen learning to harness the Force on Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) island retreat. ""I've seen this raw strength only once before,"" he intones, looking pretty petrified, apparently comparing Rey to Ren. ""It didn't scare me enough then. It does now.""

Scotland to set up public energy firm,"This video can not be played Ms Sturgeon said the energy firm's ""only job is to secure the lowest price for consumers"" The Scottish government is to set up a publicly-owned, not-for-profit energy company, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The SNP leader told the party's conference that the company will sell energy to customers at ""as close to cost price as possible"". Ms Sturgeon said it would be set up by 2021, and would give people - particularly on low incomes - more choice of which supplier to use. She also said the SNP will ""always make the case for independence"". And while the Scottish government has delayed plans for a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon insisted that the SNP still had a mandate for a vote on the issue. Brian Taylor on 'Sturgeon's plea for patience' Watch Nicola Sturgeon's full speech She described the ""essence of independence"" as being ""in charge of the decisions that shape your destiny"" and ""being in the driving seat and not simply at the mercy of events"". The first minister declared: ""We are the party of independence. The case for independence doesn't depend on Brexit. But Brexit does show us what can happen when we don't control our own future"". Among Ms Sturgeon's other announcements were: A ""truly transformational"" doubling of spending on early-years childcare to Â£840m by 2020 A new scheme to provide free sanitary products in schools, colleges and universities from next August All young people leaving care will be exempt from paying council tax A Â£6m fund to help the tourist industry in Scotland's more remote areas Confirmed the 1% public sector pay will be lifted in Scotland Announced that permission has been granted to the people of Ulva, an island off the west coast of Mull, tobring their island into community ownership This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""The gap between Scotland's interests and Westminster's priorities has never been wider."" The possibility of launching a publicly-owned energy company was included in last year's SNP manifesto. In her keynote speech to the conference in Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said the idea would now be taken forward, with more detail to be provided when the Scottish government publishes its new energy strategy. She said: ""Energy would be bought wholesale or generated here in Scotland - renewable, of course - and sold to customers as close to cost price as possible. ""No shareholders to worry about. No corporate bonuses to consider. It would give people - particularly those on low incomes - more choice and the option of a supplier whose only job is to secure the lowest price for consumers."" Nottingham City Council operates a similar schemethrough its not for profit Robin Hood Energy company, which was launched two years ago and sells gas and electricity to customers across the UK. The three-day conference was held at the SEC Centre in Glasgow The SNP are in a holding pattern on a number of topics. On Brexit. On independence. On events in Catalonia, where Ms Sturgeon condemned the EU for failing to condemn the violence of the Spanish police - but stopped short of endorsing Catalan independence. Instead, she again urged talks. And there is a waiting game too on tax, but the speech was policy rich: Affordable housing, child care, the environment, a new not-for-profit energy company, an end to the public sector pay cap. And much, much more. These, firstly, are policies designed to improve Scotland and to win public support. They have a function and a life of their own. But they are also designed to meet a wider public mood. Which is to focus upon the day job, upon the mundane concerns of Scottish society. Read more from Brian On her government's childcare plans, Ms Sturgeon told delegates that it had already pledged to almost double free provision to 30 hours a week for all three and four-year-olds and eligible two-year-olds. Ms Sturgeon said the move will save working parents about Â£350 a month on the costs of childcare. And she confirmed that the Scottish government will double the Â£420m it currently spends on early years education and childcare to Â£840m a year by 2020. Ms Sturgeon arrived on stage with a packet of Strepsils - a reference to Theresa May's cough-interrupted speech at the Conservative company There is overwhelming sympathy for the Catalan government among SNP activists and elected politicians Ms Sturgeon told the conference: ""This is a commitment unmatched anywhere else in the UK. And it's the best investment we can make in Scotland's future."" The first minister went on to say that Scotland's interests were threatened by ""chaos"" at Westminster, with Labour's position on Brexit ""clear as mud"" and Theresa May having ""lost control"". She repeated claims the EU Withdrawal Bill amounted to a ""blatant power grab"" on the Scottish Parliament, adding: ""We will not allow a Tory government to undermine devolution"" 'People of Catalonia' But she acknowledged the EU was not perfect, and criticised its response to the police violence in Catalonia during the recent disputed independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Sometimes it (the EU) fails to live up to its founding values of human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality. ""When the people of Catalonia - EU citizens - were violently attacked by police just for trying to vote, the EU should have spoken up, loudly, to condemn it."" She said it was time for the Spanish government to sit down with the government of Catalonia, adding: ""It is time for them to talk and to find a way forward. ""A way forward that respects the rule of law, yes. But a way forward that also respects democracy and the right of the people of Catalonia to determine their own future."" The promise of a government-owned, not-for-profit energy company has been coming down the pipeline since last year's Holyrood manifesto from the SNP. Nicola Sturgeon's conference speech made clear that the initial key role will be competing with other energy providers on price. This implies that commercial firms are making unfair or unreasonable profits. But there could be more - a lot more. Things like supporting new schemes, district heating projects or investment for renewables Across the North Sea, in Denmark, the state Energy Agency administers energy and supply, and climate change initiatives. It has 400 staff, with tasks ranging across energy production, supply, transportation and consumption, including energy efficiency and building standards. Then there's another model of state-owned energy company - Norway's Statoil. Read more from  Douglas Scottish Conservative chief whip Maurice Goldensaid the one word missing from Ms Sturgeon's speech was ""sorry"". He added: ""For the last year, Nicola Sturgeon put her reckless plan for a second referendum before her day job. But instead of apologising, the first minister once again showed that the SNP simply doesn't do humility. ""This was a speech that demonstrated the SNP simply doesn't get it. Lacking in humility and failing to listen to people - it's the same old SNP."" Scottish Labour's interim leader, Alex Rowley, claimed the SNP was lacking in fresh ideas, so had instead taken Labour policies, watered them down and attempted to pass them off as their own. Mr Rowley said: ""From a not-for-profit energy company to teacher training bursaries, action on period poverty and promises on public sector pay, this conference shows that it is Labour which is setting the policy agenda in Scotland."" Scottish Greens co-convener Patrick Harviesaid Ms Sturgeon's speech ""showed yet again how Greens are leading the change in our society, pushing the SNP beyond its comfort zone on everything from publicly-owned energy to lifting the public sector pay cap."" Scottish Liberal Democrat MSP Alex Cole-Hamiltonsaid the SNP hierarchy had attempted to ""tiptoe around independence"" during the conference - but that the party's members had ""reminded them that independence is all the SNP care about"".

May won't say if she'd vote for Brexit,"This video can not be played Mrs May said she would not answer ""hypothetical questions"" Theresa May has refused to say how she would vote if there was another EU referendum. The prime minister, who backed Remain in last year's vote, was repeatedly asked if she would now vote for Brexit. She told LBC radio: ""I don't answer hypothetical questions."" The PM, who said during the general election campaign that the UK had a ""brighter future"" after Brexit, added: ""I voted Remain for good reasons at the time but circumstances move on."" Downing Street sources suggested it would be ridiculous to say the prime minister's comments raise doubts about whether she will deliver Brexit, as some such as ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage have said. Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, who was a leading campaigner for Brexit, said: ""She is entirely right to avoid being divisive. ""She is seeking to unite the country, not to perpetuate referendum divisions."" Fairly or not, Theresa May's hesitation in giving her answer on this hypothetical question will give pause for thought to those who harbour suspicions of her real commitment to Brexit. And her ""open and honest"" answer, which refused to come down on either side creates the strange situation where the prime minister appears unwilling to give full-throated support to her government's main policy. Read Laura's full blog Presenter Iain Dale told Mrs May that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had switched from Remain to Leave because former Chancellor George Osborne's gloomy economic predictions about the latter had failed to come true. He asked Mrs May why she could not say she had changed her mind, given that she was leading the country into Brexit. ""Yes and I'm prime minister ensuring I'm going to deliver Brexit for the British people,"" she replied. Pressed again, Mrs May said: ""I could say I would still vote Remain or I would vote Leave just to give you an answer to that question. ""I am being open and honest with you. What I did last time round was I looked at everything and I came to a judgement and I would do exactly the same this time round. ""But we are not having another referendum and that's absolutely crucial."" EU's Tusk warns over 'slow pace' of talks Mrs May's second in command, First Secretary of State Damian Green, also refused to say whether he would back Brexit if there was a referendum now. Jeremy Corbyn called on Mrs May to guarantee migrants' rights Mr Green, who was a board member of the campaign to keep Britain in the EU, told Channel 4 News: ""I don't resile from anything I said during the election campaign."" But he added that it was a ""meaningless"" question and ""purely hypothetical"". Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said: ""It is staggering that even the prime minister isn't convinced by the government's approach to Brexit. ""If Theresa May doesn't have any faith in her own government's policies, why is she still driving this country towards the cliff edge? ""Theresa May says she would weigh up the evidence again, she shouldn't deny that right to the British people. ""The public must have the chance to change their mind if they want to, once the government comes back with a deal."" Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: ""How can Theresa May negotiate Brexit without believing in it?"" In the same LBC interview, Mrs May said she could not guarantee the status of the estimated 1.2 million UK nationals living in other EU countries if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal. And she warned that rights held by more than three million EU nationals in the UK could ""fall away"" in a ""no deal"" scenario, something the government is actively preparing for if talks in Brussels fail. ""By definition, if there isn't a deal we won't have been able to agree with the EU what happens to UK citizens currently living in countries like Spain and Italy and other members of the EU,"" said the prime minister. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn tweeted: ""Unacceptable. The Tories' chaotic handling of Brexit means no deal is a real risk. Theresa May must guarantee EU migrants' rights now.""

Cyril Smith 'at alleged victim's wedding',"The abuse inquiry is hearing allegations about abuse by Rochdale's former Liberal MP Cyril Smith An alleged abuse victim of Cyril Smith told an inquiry how he came face-to-face with the politician at his own wedding. The man said Smith touched his genitals during what he thought was ""a medical"" at Cambridge House hostel in Rochdale. One of the wardens led the teenager to a ""quiet room"" to meet an ""important gentleman"", the inquiry heard. The hearings are examining Smith's alleged abuse of young boys in Rochdale care institutions. TheIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,externalwas told by a witness that Smith was a guest at his wedding years after he was indecently assaulted by him at the children's hostel. The politician later helped the couple secure a council house in Rochdale, the inquiry was told. Cyril Smith 'a puppet master abuser' MI5 'told of Cyril Smith abuse case lie' Giving evidence anonymously about alleged abuse at the hostel, the man said: ""All I knew was I was going to meet a gentleman and I thought I was having a medical."" The witness said Smith told him he wanted to check for nits and if he had been washing himself properly. ""So he said, 'Take your pants off', so I took my pants off, my underpants, and my T-shirt and stood there with my clothes off,"" he said. ""He asked me to face the wall. I outstretched my arms and then he started running his hands through my hair. ""He then started stroking me down the back of my head and along my arms and then he started coming down my body."" Then Smith allegedly touched the man's genitals, the hearing was told. The alleged victim had only arrived in the care of the hostel two days before, having fallen out with his foster family during the early 1960s, the hearing heard. Years passed and the man did not discuss it with his bride-to-be. But on their wedding day, he recognised one of the guests as the man who had abused him, the hearing was told. Unbeknown to him, Smith was a family friend of his fiancÃ©e. The inquiry is examining how Smith was allegedly able to target boys at Cambridge House hostel and Knowl View school Brian Altman QC asked: ""Did that make you angry?"" ""Yes, but I couldn't say anything,"" the witness replied. Between 1969 and 1970 police launched an investigation into Smith over sexual abuse claims and the man agreed to give a statement about his experience. Referring to the reaction of his in-laws, he said: ""It didn't go down too well, they couldn't believe it because they were obviously supporters of Cyril Smith."" Smith allegedly then paid the man a visit with an accomplice and asked him to retract his statement. The witness said: ""He says it is going to cause him a lot of problems and I said, 'No, what has happened to me is the truth'."" His allegations against Smith were never aired in court after the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) decided not to press charges. The inquiry continues. Cyril Smith 'a puppet master abuser' MI5 'told of Cyril Smith abuse case lie' Abuse victims 'last chance for justice' Rochdale abuse failings 'unforgiveable' No cover-up in child abuse investigation Rochdale abuse case 'has 40 victims' Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse Criminal's mother 'died ashamed of him' as 'everyone in her block of flats' talked about her Inside the 'Counterfeit Street' unit where fake perfume and watches went for Â£15 Man sentenced as GMP secures biggest penalty in Bury domestic violence pilot scheme Why there are 45-minute delays and lane closures on A56 Stop-smoking service urges people to quit the habit in 2025 New Marks and Spencer outlet store set to open on Warrington retail park At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

BBC's head of news James Harding to leave,"James Harding is going to set up his own company BBC director of news James Harding is to stand down at the beginning of 2018. In a statement, he said: ""I am proud to have worked for BBC News as we renewed our reputation for responsible journalism."" BBC director general Tony Hall praised Harding, saying: ""James has done an incredible job during a hugely complex and momentous period."" After four years in the role, Harding is leaving the BBC to set up his own news media venture. Announcing the move, Harding said ""even when we're pedalling into the wind"" that working at the BBC was ""rewarding and worthwhile"". Talking about his new company, he explained: ""There is some journalism that the BBC, for all its brilliance, can't, and probably shouldn't, do. ""And that's what I want to explore: I am going to start a new media company with a distinct approach to the news and a clear point of view. ""I know I will enjoy the chance to do some more journalism of my own and, at such a critical time, I'm seriously excited about the prospect of building a new venture in news."" He said he'd reveal more in the new year. James Harding was previously editor of The Times Lord Hall thanked Harding for his service to the BBC. ""James has done an incredible job during a hugely complex and momentous period of British and world history,"" he said. ""He has led the BBC's coverage through two referendums, two general elections, an astonishing US presidential election, not to mention a series of extraordinary events at home and abroad. ""In the years James has been with us he's played an important part in modernising and changing the BBC, but beyond that, he has been a first-class colleague and a pleasure to work with."" A successor will be appointed by the end of the year, Lord Hall said. Harding joined the Financial Times in 1994 and served as Shanghai correspondent, media editor and Washington bureau chief. He joined The Times in 2006 as business and city editor and was editor from 2007 to 2012. Harding was appointed in April 2013 to oversee all of the BBC's news and current affairs programming. The division's workforce produces output across network news, English regions and the World Service group. In an email to staff announcing his departure, James Harding covered what all departure messages must cover: his legacy. Harding, who is - full disclosure - my ultimate boss, mentioned the emphasis on slow news, the hiring of new talent, new language services and the launch of the Reality Check brand to address the challenge of fake news. Together these add up to a substantial legacy. But Harding, like any journalist, will want to be remembered above all for the stories that were covered during his tenure. Read more.

Acid was 'thrown inside packed club',"Arthur Collins is accused of throwing acid at clubbers in Mangle A man threw acid inside a packed London nightclub injuring 16 people after ""trouble"" broke out, a court has heard. Arthur Collins, ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, is accused of throwing the substance in the Mangle nightclub in Dalston, on 17 April. Prosecutors told Wood Green Crown Court it happened after a group of men started pushing and shoving. Mr Collins, 25, and co-defendant Andre Phoenix, 21, both deny the charges against them. They are accused of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent, and 11 counts of actual bodily harm. Jurors heard 16 people who were on the crowded dancefloor were injured when Mr Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, threw the substance at another man. Sixteen people were injured in April's attack at an east London nightclub Prosecutor Luke Ponte said it was not clear what started the confrontation. But he said Mr Collins ""does not dispute that he threw the acid"" and ""he was assisted"" by Mr Phoenix, of Tottenham. CCTV footage played in court showed Mr Collins throwing the substance ""into the face of another young man"". ""As that man went down in pain, the aggressor threw acid a second time directed towards another man, and then threw acid a third time,"" Mr Ponte said. He added it was ""not surprising"" Mr Collins did not dispute his involvement as it was filmed ""clearly on the club's CCTV"". Mr Collins is the father of The Only Way is Essex star Ferne McCann's unborn child Among those injured was Mr Phoenix who was splashed with the unidentified substance that was later found to have a pH level of 1, the court heard. The pair were later identified from the CCTV footage and Mr Phoenix was arrested on 21 April, the jury was told. However, Mr Collins initially ""could not be found"", Mr Ponte said. He was located a few days later at a property in Northamptonshire, the court heard, where he jumped out of the first floor window in his T-shirt and underwear to escape arrest and was Tasered by police. It is understood about 600 people were attending an event at the Mangle nightclub in London Fields The court was told Mr Collins allegedly heard Makai Brown - one of the people injured in the attack - talking about spiking a girl's drink in the club. When asked by George Carter-Stephenson QC, defending Mr Collins, if such a conversation about spiking a drink occurred, Mr Brown said no. Mr Carter-Stephenson told the jury it was Mr Collins' case he then insulted Mr Brown and told him ""you are not spiking anyone"". He then asked Mr Brown if his client had taken a bottle from him ""which he thought contained something to spike drinks."" But Mr Brown denied having a bottle, explaining he does not drink alcohol and had been searched on entry to the venue. He also denied that any altercation or aggression had taken place with Mr Collins and Mr Phoenix. The trial continues.

N Korea 'hacks US-S Korea war plan',"This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Hackers from North Korea are reported to have stolen a large cache of military documents from South Korea, including a plan to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. Rhee Cheol-hee, a South Korean lawmaker, said the information was from his country's defence ministry. The compromised documents include wartime contingency plans drawn up by the US and South Korea. They also include reports to the allies' senior commanders. The South Korean defence ministry has so far refused to comment about the allegation. Plans for the South's special forces were reportedly accessed, along with information on significant power plants and military facilities in the South. Mr Rhee belongs to South Korea's ruling party, and sits on its parliament's defence committee. He said some 235 gigabytes of military documents had been stolen from the Defence Integrated Data Centre, and that 80% of them have yet to be identified. The hack took place in September last year. In May, South Korea said a large amount of data had been stolen and that North Korea may have instigated the cyber attack - but gave no details of what was taken. North Korea denied the claim. Trump: 'One thing will work' with N Korea North Korea-US tension: How worried should we be? Inside the world's most secretive country South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports that Seoul has been subject to a barrage of cyber attacks by its communist neighbour in recent years, with many targeting government websites and facilities. The isolated state is believed to have specially-trained hackers based overseas, including in China. North Korea has accused South Korea of ""fabricating"" the claims. News that Pyongyang is likely to have accessed the Seoul-Washington plans for all-out war in the Koreas will do nothing to soothe tensions between the US and North Korea. The two nations have been at verbal loggerheads over the North's nuclear activities, with the US pressing for a halt to missile tests and Pyongyang vowing to continue them. The US president and his North Korean counterpart are at loggerheads over Pyongyang's nuclear programme The North recently claimed to have successfully tested a miniaturised hydrogen bomb, which could be loaded onto a long-range missile. In a speech at the UN in September, US President Donald Trump threatened to destroy North Korea if it menaced the US or its allies, and said its leader ""is on a suicide mission"". Can the US defend itself against North Korea? What was Kim Jong-un's most used word? North Korea crisis in 300 words Mr Kimresponded with a rare statement, vowing to ""tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire"". Mr Trump's latest comment took the form of a cryptic tweet at the weekend, where he warned that ""only one thing will work"" in dealing with North Korea, after years of talks had proved fruitless. He did not elaborate further. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' What was Kim Jong-un's most used word?

ParentPay website for schools goes down,"The website of payment firm ParentPay has gone down, leaving some parents unable to transfer funds for school meals and trips. The company normally serves more than 5,500 schools in 200 local authorities, helping about 1.5 million families. The companysaid,externalit was affected ""by a national internet connectivity issue - impacting some users. This is out of our control and we'll update you."" Some parents said their children were unable to buy food due to the glitch. ParentPay said payments had been suspended until the issue was resolved. Some parents reported being able to make transactions on Tuesday evening, but the company told the BBC the issue was not yet fixed and there was no timescale for when it would be. One parent, Victoria Lew, said on Twitter she had been trying to access her account for two hours. ""What do [the] kids do for lunch?"" she asked, adding that she had been unable to get through to the company on the phone. Charlotte Bankssaid on Facebook,externalthat neither of her sons had been able to buy food. ""This is getting ridiculous now. Seems to be every few days there are issues with this site,"" she said. People also expressed scepticism about the company's explanation for the outage.

"BAE Systems to cut almost 2,000 jobs","BAE Systems is planning to cut almost 2,000 jobs in military, maritime and intelligence services, the firm says. A total of 750 posts will go at the Warton and Samlesbury plants in Lancashire where parts for the Eurofighter Typhoon are manufactured. BAE is facing an order gap for the Typhoon so wants to slow production before an expected order from Qatar. In all, a total of 1,400 roles will go across England in the firm's air and information business, Outside Lancashire, 400 posts will close in Brough, East Yorkshire, 230 will go at RAF Marham and 15 are being lost at RAF Leeming. Meanwhile 340 maritime jobs will be lost in Portsmouth and Solent region and a further 180 posts will go in London, Guildford and other locations. Most of the pain for BAE Systems will be felt in its air business. Orders for the Typhoon jet have slowed down amid stiff competition from the new F-35, part of which is made by BAE Systems, and from France's Rafale and the US F-16. Overall, the multinational Typhoon/Eurofighter programme, which includes Germany, Italy and Spain, has received 599 orders from eight customers. BAE has already sold more than 70 Typhoons to Saudi Arabia and had been hoping to sell more. The political controversy surrounding arms sales to the Middle East Kingdom probably hasn't helped. Support jobs will be lost too as the RAF Tornado comes to the end of its life, with the RAF planning to retire its squadrons by 2019. Orders have also slowed down for the venerable Hawk Trainer jet. Both Typhoon and Hawk production lines will stay open for now, but for how much longer? BAE needs a clear signal from its main customer, the Ministry of Defence, as to what comes next after the F-35. Unions have already criticised the government for buying more military equipment from the US. While the UK now has an industrial strategy to sustain the production of warships in the UK, it does not appear to have a similar strategy for the air defence sector. In a statement,,externalthe defence contractor said it was making organisational changes to ""boost competitiveness, accelerate technology innovation and improve operational excellence"". It added that the restructuring of its cyber-security wing would ""drive continued growth"". The company's chief executive, Charles Woodburn, said the changes ""unfortunately include proposed redundancies at a number of operations"". He added: ""I recognise this will be difficult news for some of our employees and we are committed to do everything we can to support those affected."" BAE said that most of the military air job cuts would take place in the next two years and that it wanted to achieve as many voluntary redundancies as possible. The changes are due to begin on 1 January. The BAE plant in Samlesbury is one of those affected by the cuts Warton and Samlesbury, Lancashire - 750 Brough, East Yorkshire - 400 RAF Marham - 230 RAF Leeming - 15 Portsmouth and Solent region - 340 London, Guildford and other Applied Intelligence locations - 150 Other UK locations - 30 TOTAL- 1,915 The Unite union reacted with anger and assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: ""These planned job cuts will not only undermine Britain's sovereign defence capability, but devastate communities across the UK who rely on these skilled jobs and the hope of a decent future they give to future generations. ""These are world-class workers with years of training and expertise on which an additional four jobs rely upon in the supply chain. ""The UK government must take back control of our nation's defence and with it, play its part in supporting UK defence manufacturing jobs."" Business Minister Claire Perry insisted that the job cuts at BAE Systems were due to restructuring and ""not related to UK defence spending decisions"". Responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, Ms Perry said the government wished to continue to procure from BAE, but said ""it would be wrong for the government to interfere in the company's restructuring"". Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said: ""It is time for the government to address the clear uncertainty that is felt by the industry and come forward with an urgent plan to save these jobs. ""This must include the possibility of bringing forward orders to provide additional work for BAE's employees, such as replacing the Red Arrows' fleet of Hawk aircraft that are approaching the end of their service life.""

Catalan leader seeks independence talks,"This video can not be played Catalan leader seeks talks to secure independence Catalan President Carles Puigdemont and other regional leaders have signed a declaration of independence from Spain, following the disputed referendum. However, they say the move will not be implemented for several weeks to allow talks with the government in Madrid. The document calls for Catalonia to be recognised as an ""independent and sovereign state"". The move was immediately dismissed by the Spanish central government in Madrid. A 1 October referendum in the north-eastern province - which Catalan leaders say resulted in a Yes vote for independence - was declared invalid by Spain's Constitutional Court. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Puigdemont told the Catalan parliament in Barcelona that the region had won the right to be independent as a result of the vote. The view from Barcelona v Madrid Puigdemont's announcement - reaction and analysis Catalonia crisis: What are the options now? The referendum resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence, Catalan officials say. But anti-independence voters largely boycotted the ballot - which had a reported turnout of 43% - and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters while implementing the legal ruling banning the referendum. A pro-independence rally was held near the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona The declaration reads: ""We call on all states and international organisations to recognise the Catalan republic as an independent and sovereign state. This video can not be played Pablo Insa Iglesias and Elisabeth BesÃ³ sit on opposite sides of the argument Mr Puigdemont told the regional parliament that the ""people's will"" was to break away from Madrid, but he also said he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tension around the issue. ""We are all part of the same community and we need to go forward together. The only way forward is democracy and peace,"" he told deputies. But he also said Catalonia was being denied the right to self-determination, and paying too much in taxes to the central government in Madrid. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? SCatalan crisis: Six things you need to know Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria responded to Tuesday's developments by saying: ""Neither Mr Puigdemont nor anybody else can claim... to impose mediation. ""Any dialogue between democrats has to take place within the law."" She added: ""After having come so far, and taken Catalonia to the greatest level of tension in its history, President Puigdemont has now subjected his autonomous region to its greatest level of uncertainty. ""The speech the president... gave today is that of a person who does not know where he is, where he's going, nor who he wants to go there with."" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy has called an extraordinary cabinet meeting for Wednesday morning to address the latest moves in the crisis. By the BBC's Tom Burridge, in Barcelona As Catalonia's leader announced he would declare independence, thousands of his supporters, watching his speech nearby, on a big screen, were euphoric. But seconds later - when Carles Puigdemont qualified his announcement - and said the declaration would be suspended for several weeks, the disappointment was visible in the crowd. Mr Puigdemont's language was stark, claiming that he had to follow the will of the Catalan people. But he is playing for time - offering a window for the possibility of dialogue with Madrid. His ultimate aim, to pressure the Spanish government to allow a legitimate referendum, remains. But it's highly unlikely that the Spanish government will accept that and there are signals now that its patience is wearing thin. Catalonia's centre-right, centre-left coalition government only had a majority of MPs in the regional parliament with the support of another small pro-independence party, on the far left. That party is unhappy that there has been no clear declaration of independence. And so Catalonia's awkward coalition of pro-independence parties feels more fragile. Independence supporters had been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaraciÃ³ (10 October Declaration) on Twitter, amid expectations that Mr Puigdemont would ask parliament to declare independence on the basis ofthe referendum law,externalit passed last month. But influential figures including Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau and European Council President Donald Tusk had urged Mr Puigdemont to step back from declaring independence. This video can not be played What do Scottish nationalists think about Catalonia? Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution. However, a 2005 amendment redefining the region as a ""nation"", boosting the status of the Catalan language and increasing local control over taxes and the judiciary, was reversed by the Constitutional Court in 2010. The economic crisis further fuelled discontent and pro-independence parties took power in the region in the 2015 elections. Catalonia is is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports. But a stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. Are you in the region?

Vegas killer 'shot guard before attack',"The attack, carried out from the Mandalay Bay hotel, killed 58 people The gunman behind last week's Las Vegas massacre shot a security guard six minutes before the attack, police say, in a striking change to the timeline. Police initially said the guard interrupted Stephen Paddock as the attack was under way. The revelation raises questions as to why police did not pinpoint Paddock's location sooner. But the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the massacre unfolded, questioned the new sequence of events. ""We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline,"" said Debra DeShong, a spokeswoman for MGM Resorts International, late on Tuesday. ""We believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate."" The attack left 58 people dead and was the worst in modern US history. Security guard Jesus Campos was at first credited by authorities with distracting the gunman from killing more people. Las Vegas: What we still don't know But on Monday police revised their account of events to clarify that Mr Campos was shot in the leg and wounded at 21:59. They said Paddock, who had placed security cameras outside his room, shot Mr Campos through the door of his suite, firing 200 rounds into the hallway. 21:40(04:40GMT)Route 91 Harvest festival begins its closing act 21:59Paddock shoots security guard Jesus Campos outside his 32nd floor room 22:05Paddock opens fire on concert-goers below after smashing his window with a hammer 22:15Paddock stops firing 22:17The first police arrive on the scene and find the wounded security guard near Paddock's room a minute later 22:38Police publicly confirm an active shooter 23:20Swat team breaks into Paddock's room and finds him dead from a suspected self-inflicted gunshot Source:Clark Countysheriff's office According to police, the guard was investigating an alarm that went off in another room on the same floor when he heard a drilling sound from Paddock's room. The gunman inserted spy cameras into the peep hole on the door of his suite, police have previously said. What was Stephen Paddock's motive? Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo also amended the date on which police believe Paddock checked into Mandalay Bay. This video can not be played Police officers who entered the Las Vegas gunman's hotel room describe what they saw. They initially said he had checked in on 28 September, three days before the shooting. They now say he checked in on 25 September. Paddock sprayed gunfire from the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay hotel on to a concert attended by thousands of people. Sheriff Lombardo said that police did not realise that the security guard had been shot until they arrived on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel. That was the case even though the guard managed to alert the hotel's security team. Mr Lombardo said new information had emerged during the investigation and that ""some things were bound to change"" given its complicated nature. Police also say that the gunman, 64, was seen on numerous occasions in Las Vegas gambling heavily by himself the night before the shooting, which ended with him killing himself. Paddock was dead by the time officers entered the room and it is not known why he had stopped shooting. ""This individual purposely hid his actions leading up to this event, and it is difficult for us to find the answers,"" Mr Lombardo told a news conference. Paddock's motives remain unclear. Extensive research into the gunman's mental state found no explanation for such a violent turn of events, police say. It is suspected Paddock scouted out other locations near open-air concerts in the weeks before the Las Vegas attack.

Spain awaits Catalan leader's plans,"Carles Puigdemont has been urged to step back from declaring independence Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is announcing his plans for the future of the Spanish province. He told the regional parliament in Barcelona that he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tensions surrounding the issue. There had been speculation that he would make a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain following a disputed referendum. But there were also growing demands for him to drop plans to break away. Reports say Catalan party leaders met before the session began an hour behind schedule. LIVE coverage A vote was held on 1 October which Catalan officials say resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence for the north-eastern region. Turnout was put at 43%. The vote was deemed illegal by Madrid and suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court. ""No"" voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters. Mr Puigdemont hailed the referendum process and condemned the actions of the Spanish government, but acknowledged that people on all sides were worried about what would happen next. ""We are all part of the same community and we need to go forward together. The only way forward is democracy and peace,"" he told deputies. But he also said Catalonia was being denied the right to self-determination, and paying too much in taxes to the central government in Madrid. Catalan police have been posted outside the parliament in Barcelona, sealing off the grounds to the public. A large pro-independence rally is currently taking place in the area. Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona Never before has the world watched Catalonia's regional parliament so closely. This evening, with probably large numbers of police and protesters outside, the leader of the devolved government is due to address Catalan MPs. Carles Puigdemont plans to present his government's results of the disputed referendum, which Madrid declared illegal. Since then, Mr Puigdemont has said on several occasions that he will declare independence, despite fierce opposition across Spain and criticism from European governments. Now, will he make good his threat? Or will he announce a more nuanced strategy, hoping still for a proper, recognised referendum one day? Under pressure to act, the Spanish government has made stark warnings, too. If the order comes, thousands of Spanish national police, here in Barcelona, could intervene. The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, closed the Ciutadella Park, where parliament is located, early in the day, positioning vans near the entrances and alongside parliament. The authorities said the measures were ""for safety reasons"". A pro-independence rally was held near the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona Armed police have been deployed outside parliament ""for safety reasons"" The Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a non-party grassroots movement, earlier urged supporters in atweet,externalto come to the parliament district to ""defend"" the vote for independence. How do you start a country? Could Catalonia be a viable country? Independence supporters have been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaraciÃ³ (10 October Declaration) on Twitter. Expectations are high that Mr Puigdemont will ask parliament to declare independence on the basis ofthe referendum law,externalit passed last month. Parliament, which is dominated by pro-independence parties, would then have 48 hours to vote. This video can not be played Pablo Insa Iglesias and Elisabeth BesÃ³ sit on opposite sides of the argument Barcelona's influential mayor, Ada Colau, has urged Mr Puigdemont not to declare independence. She also called on Mr Rajoy to rule out direct control from Madrid. The Madrid government called on the Catalan leader ""not to do anything irreversible, not to pursue a path of no return and not to make any unilateral independence declaration"". European Council President Donald Tusk said: ""A few days ago I asked Prime Minister Rajoy to look for a solution to the problem without the use of force, to look for dialogue, because the use of dialogue is always better than the use of force. ""Today I ask you [Mr Puigdemont] to respect in your intentions the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible. ""Diversity should not and need not lead to conflict whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for whole of Europe."" When the BBC asked people for their opinion in Barcelona, one woman, Eva Iniesta, called for the Spanish government to open a ""dialogue so independence is not declared"". But another person, Salvador Puig, said: ""We have demonstrated and said that we don't like being part of this home and we have the right to live in the home we want and in the way we want."" Mr Rajoy is due to appear in Spain's parliament on Wednesday. He has already said any declaration of independence by Catalonia would ""lead to nothing"". Carles Puigdemont, left, and Mariano Rajoy show no signs of compromise UnderArticle 155 of the constitution,external, his Spanish government could suspend devolution. The leader of Spain's main opposition party, Pedro SÃ¡nchez of the Socialists, has said his party will back action by the government ""in the face of any attempt to break social harmony"". What are the options now? Catalan Spaniards fear loss of identity Distressed police officer photo goes viral A stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis. It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports. Publishing company Grupo Planeta is the latest to announce it will move from Barcelona to Madrid if there is a declaration of independence. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. A European Commission spokesman told Reuters news agency it called on ""all those concerned to get of this confrontation as quickly as possible and to start dialogue"". This video can not be played What do Scottish nationalists think about Catalonia? The EU, he added, had confidence ""in the capacity of Prime Minister Rajoy to manage this delicate process in full respect of the Spanish constitution and the basic fundamental rights of the citizens"". Austrian Finance Minister Hans JÃ¶rg Schelling warned the effects of Catalan independence could spread beyond Spain. ""I hope that this won't lead to a crisis in the euro and in the EU but the danger naturally exists because extreme positions are clashing,"" he said. Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution.

Clooney joins Weinstein condemnation,"George Clooney has called the alleged actions of Weinstein 'indefensible'. George Clooney and Jennifer Lawrence have joined the list of Hollywood stars condemning Harvey Weinstein. The co-founder of The Weinstein Company faces sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades, which came to light in the New York Times. Clooney, whose big-screen big break was a Weinstein film, said the producer's alleged actions were ""indefensible"". Weinstein, who has been fired by the board of his company, disputes the New York Times report. He has vowed to take legal action against the newspaper, which said in the report that he had reached at least eight settlements with women. Fashion designer Donna Karan defends Harvey Weinstein. What next for Weinstein and Hollywood? Hollywood reacts to Weinstein claims Weinstein and the media's shame Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for his film Silver Linings Playbook, has also now spoken about the allegations, saying she was ""deeply disturbed"". Jennifer Lawrence with Harvey Weinstein at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2013 Clooney, who was given his first big movie role as an actor by Weinstein in 1996's From Dusk Till Dawn and as a director in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, said he was previously unaware of the allegations. ""The part we're hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn't hear anything about that and I don't know anyone that did,"" he saidin an interview with The Daily Beast.,external ""That's a whole other level and there's no way you can reconcile that. There's nothing to say except that it's indefensible."" Clooney said he had known Weinstein for 20 years. ""We've had dinners, we've been on location together, we've had arguments. But I can tell you that I've never seen any of this behaviour - ever,"" he said. ""Maybe that's what good will come out of this - that not just in Hollywood, although Hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don't need to be afraid."" Lawrence also released a statement, five years on from working with Weinstein on Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the best actress Oscar. ""I was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour,"" shetold Variety.,external ""I worked with Harvey five years ago and I did not experience any form of harassment personally, nor did I know about any of these allegations. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting."" Jessica Chastain said she had been ""warned"" about working with Weinstein Actress Jessica Chastain, who has appeared in The Martian and Zero Dark Thirty, also spoke out on Tuesday, saying she had been ""warned"" about working with Weinstein. Unlike others in the industry, who have said they were not aware of his alleged actions, the Oscar winner tweeted her reaction. ""I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an environment for it to happen again."" She also responded on social media to a statement from Kate Winslet, who said the allegations made her ""angry"", and also noted that more men should be speaking up. Allow Twitter content?

Virtual Zuck fails to connect,"It must have seemed like a good idea. As a taster for a big announcement about Oculus VR on Wednesday, send Mark Zuckerberg on a little virtual reality trip, including a stop in Puerto Rico. But the reviews are in - and they are not good. The sight of Mr Zuckerberg using VR to survey the devastation of an island still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria may have been meant to convey Facebook's empathy with the victims. The fact that he was there in the form of a cartoon seemed to many the perfect visual metaphor for the gulf in understanding between Silicon Valley and the real world. Sure, he was talking about all the activities which his company had initiated to help the island, from helping people tell their families they were ok using Safety Check to sending Facebook employees to help restore connectivity. But cartoon Zuck showing us a 360 degree view of a flooded street before zipping back to a virtual California just seemed a little, well, crass. Is Facebook really concerned about the plight of Puerto Rico, or is it merely a handy backdrop to promote Oculus, whose sales have so far proved disappointing? It is not the first time the young tycoon has misread the public mood. Back in November following the US elections,he said it was ""crazy"" to suggest that fake news on Facebookhad played any part in deciding the results. Since then, as ever more detail has emerged about Russian use of his platform to try to influence voters, Zuckerberg has been on a journey towards understanding and acknowledging the power he has. He's also been on a literal journey, with a mission to visit every US state this year. As he's been pictured at the dinner table with farmers in the mid-west or mused about religion, revealing he is no longer an atheist, some have seen another motive behind this odyssey. Could this be preparation for Zuckerberg 2020, a run at the White House? Meanwhile, back at Mountain View headquarters problems are piling up in the CEO's in-tray, with politicians from left and right asking tricky questions. Is he doing enough to stop terrorists using WhatsApp? Did Facebook promote fake news around the Las Vegas shootings? Is billionaire Peter Thiel, with his connections to the alt-right, a fit and proper person to serve on Facebook's board? Like many a tech leader, Mark Zuckerberg has assumed that what is good for his company is good for the world, but now the world is not so sure. As I was writing this, a reminder popped up on Facebook of a day in 2008 when I interviewed its founder during a trip to London. Back then he seemed impossibly young, not very articulate - but very focused on building his business and ignoring the sceptics who kept telling him to sell up before the bubble burst. Since then his vision of a company connecting the world has come true, and his business brain has out-thought all of his rivals and detractors. It's his political brain which still needs a bit of work. Maybe it is time to retire the cartoon Zuckerberg and for the real one to spend a little more time out of the spotlight, reflecting on the impact his immensely powerful empire has on our lives. UPDATE 20:25 Mark Zuckerberg has obviously been taken aback by the reaction to his virtual reality visit to Puerto Rico. He has posted this on Facebookin response to negative comments,externalbelow his original post and video. ""One of the most powerful features of VR is empathy. My goal here was to show how VR can raise awareness and help us see what's happening in different parts of the world. I also wanted to share the news of our partnership with the Red Cross to help with the recovery. Reading some of the comments, I realize this wasn't clear, and I'm sorry to anyone this offended.""

Clooney reacts to Weinstein allegations,"George Clooney has called the alleged actions of Weinstein 'indefensible'. George Clooney and Jennifer Lawrence have joined the list of Hollywood stars condemning Harvey Weinstein. The co-founder of The Weinstein Company faces sexual harassment claims dating back nearly three decades, which came to light in the New York Times. Clooney, whose big-screen big break was a Weinstein film, said the producer's alleged actions were ""indefensible"". Weinstein, who has been fired by the board of his company, disputes the New York Times report. He has vowed to take legal action against the newspaper, which said in the report that he had reached at least eight settlements with women. Fashion designer Donna Karan defends Harvey Weinstein. What next for Weinstein and Hollywood? Hollywood reacts to Weinstein claims Weinstein and the media's shame Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar for his film Silver Linings Playbook, has also now spoken about the allegations, saying she was ""deeply disturbed"". Jennifer Lawrence with Harvey Weinstein at the GLAAD Media Awards in 2013 Clooney, who was given his first big movie role as an actor by Weinstein in 1996's From Dusk Till Dawn and as a director in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, said he was previously unaware of the allegations. ""The part we're hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn't hear anything about that and I don't know anyone that did,"" he saidin an interview with The Daily Beast.,external ""That's a whole other level and there's no way you can reconcile that. There's nothing to say except that it's indefensible."" Clooney said he had known Weinstein for 20 years. ""We've had dinners, we've been on location together, we've had arguments. But I can tell you that I've never seen any of this behaviour - ever,"" he said. ""Maybe that's what good will come out of this - that not just in Hollywood, although Hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don't need to be afraid."" Lawrence also released a statement, five years on from working with Weinstein on Silver Linings Playbook, for which she won the best actress Oscar. ""I was deeply disturbed to hear the news about Harvey Weinstein's behaviour,"" shetold Variety.,external ""I worked with Harvey five years ago and I did not experience any form of harassment personally, nor did I know about any of these allegations. This kind of abuse is inexcusable and absolutely upsetting."" Jessica Chastain said she had been ""warned"" about working with Weinstein Actress Jessica Chastain, who has appeared in The Martian and Zero Dark Thirty, also spoke out on Tuesday, saying she had been ""warned"" about working with Weinstein. Unlike others in the industry, who have said they were not aware of his alleged actions, the Oscar winner tweeted her reaction. ""I was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to create an environment for it to happen again."" She also responded on social media to a statement from Kate Winslet, who said the allegations made her ""angry"", and also noted that more men should be speaking up. Allow Twitter content?

Spain Catalan crisis: Six things you need to know,"Catalonia's controversial independence poll has prompteda constitutional crisis in Spain. Here are six charts which help to explain what's going on in Catalonia, and why it matters. Catalonia has barely left the headlines over the last few weeks. That's because on 1 October, the regional government held a referendum. Despite it being ruled illegal by Spain's constitutional court, and despite police attempts to stop it happening, Catalans were asked whether they wanted the region to become independent. These results were provided by the Catalan government. Although 90% of voters backed independence, only 43% of those eligible cast a ballot. Fewer than half of the electorate actually registered a vote for independence on 1 October. The pro-independence movement draws from Catalonia's strong sense of regional identity - its history, its customs, but also its distinctive language. But how many people in Catalonia speak Catalan every day? About four in ten - but there's large variation depending on where you are. Nearly three-quarters of those in the south-western Terres d'Elbre speak Catalan as their habitual language - but fewer than three in ten do so in Barcelona. Catalonia is a comparatively wealthy corner of north-east Spain. With just 19% of the population, it accounts for more than a quarter of the country's exports. It is also one of the richer parts of the country per capita. Catalonia has the fourth highest GDP per capita in Spain. But its wealth has been a bone of contention. It contributes more in taxes than it receives in public spending. Some say this is unjust - but the Spanish government argues that richer regions should help support poorer ones. It's not just that wealth that Spain would lose if Catalonia broke away. The region exports more than any other in Spain. The Catalan government is keen that, in the event of independence, it maintains ties with the EU - preferably as a member state. It would start life outside the bloc - and Spain would have a veto on its membership. This matters, in part, because two-thirds of Catalan exports go to other EU countries. This is particularly clear when you look at one of Catalonia's most famous exports - sparkling Cava wine. In fact, Catalonia exports more bottles of Cava to the EU than are sold in the whole of Spain. A final cause for concern might be Catalonia's debt. It's the most indebted autonomous region in Spain - and around five euros in every seven are owed to the Spanish government. That could make independence particularly fraught - especially if the Spanish government expected Catalonia to take on a share of the national debt as well as paying what it owes to Madrid.

Cyril Smith 'a puppet master abuser',"The abuse inquiry is hearing allegations about abuse by Rochdale's former Liberal MP Cyril Smith Cyril Smith treated a children's home as his ""personal fiefdom"" and abused residents for ""perverted amusement"", an inquiry heard. Laura Hoyano, representing eight alleged victims, said Smith was a ""puppet master"" who escaped justice. Prosecutors have also said ""it is difficult to see why"" it was decided as far back as 1970 not to charge Smith. The independent inquiry is examining the late MP's alleged abuse of young boys in Rochdale care institutions. A dossier of information on the Liberal MP was held by the security services and has been disclosed to theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse,external(IICSA). The MI5 intelligence on the allegations ""raises a spectre of collusion"" over his activities, Ms Hoyano said. It is examining how Smith was able to carry out his alleged offences at a number of institutions, including the Cambridge House children's hostel and Knowl View residential school, where he was a governor. On Monday, counsel to the inquiry Brian Altman QC, said Sir Norman Skelhorn - then Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) -claimed in 1970 a police investigation of Smith was unlikely to lead to a prosecution. This was followed nine years later, Mr Altman said, when MI5 was informed the Rochdale Alternative Press (RAP) was told by Sir Norman's successor, Thomas Hetherington, there was no record of the 1970 case. Referring to the claims, Ms Hoyano asked: ""Was political pressure brought to bear upon the DPP from politicians and members of the Liberal Party from 1969 to 1970? Smith was a governor at Knowl View ""Why would Sir Thomas Hetherington decide he should lie to journalists, stating that he had not submitted a prosecution file? ""Why would the DPP contact MI5 about this at all?  We say this dossier from MI5 raises a spectre of collusion."" In an opening statement for the CPS - which replaced the DPP - Edward Brown QC said changes in the law relating to evidence in child sexual abuse cases in the intervening years could explain the decision not to prosecute Smith. Since 1995, juries have been able to convict offenders based solely on the accounts of victims when there are similarities in the evidence, Mr Brown said. But in 1970, he said a jury would have been specifically warned of the dangers of convictions based on uncorroborated evidence, which might have led to the accused being acquitted. However, he did accept that even then courts were starting to see so called ""similar fact evidence"" where accounts are similar, could prove the guilt of an abuser. Referring to the evidence in Smith's case, he said: ""It is perhaps difficult to see how [the DPP] would have come to any other conclusion that there was, indeed, corroboration of the complainant's accounts; that is, one supporting the other."" MI5 'told of Cyril Smith abuse case lie' Abuse victims 'last chance for justice' Rochdale abuse failings 'unforgiveable' No cover-up in child abuse investigation Rochdale abuse case 'has 40 victims' Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse Criminal's mother 'died ashamed of him' as 'everyone in her block of flats' talked about her Inside the 'Counterfeit Street' unit where fake perfume and watches went for Â£15 Man sentenced as GMP secures biggest penalty in Bury domestic violence pilot scheme Why there are 45-minute delays and lane closures on A56 Stop-smoking service urges people to quit the habit in 2025 New Marks and Spencer outlet store set to open on Warrington retail park At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA, 0% contained 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

4kg of gum discarded on Ben Nevis,"Fourteen volunteers took part in the clean-up of Ben Nevis at the weekend A bag of chewing gum and an empty 1980s packet of peanuts were among 121kg (267lbs) of rubbish found on Ben Nevis. Fourteen volunteers filled 21 bags during a litter pick on Scotland's highest mountain on Saturday. The debris found on the hillside included a peanut packet with a best before date of January 1987 and a ball of chewing gum weighing 4kg (9lbs). It was one of a series of events across the UK organised by theReal 3 Peaks Challenge,external. A total of 570kg (1,256lbs) of waste was taken off seven peaks in Scotland, England and Wales. They were: Ben Nevis Scafell Pike (Lake District) Snowdon (Wales) Ben Lomond (Scotland) Lochnagar (Scotland) Ben MacDui (Scotland) Mam Tor (Peak District) Dovestone reservoir (Peak District) Organiser Rich Pyne said it was ""not a bad day out"" for the 109 volunteers who took part in the nationwide clean-up. Rich Payne organised the litter pick where 4kg of discarded chewing gum was collected The peanut packet had a best before date of 24 January 1987 Among the debris were lots of tissues, cigarette ends, banana peel, orange peel, bottle tops, tampons, sweet wrappers, foil, crisp and sandwich wrappers. Some of the 150,000 people who climb Ben Nevis every year even abandoned walking poles, tents and flags on the mountain. One volunteer also came across a horseshoe they believe belonged to one of the ponies which worked Ben Nevis in the early 1900s. A horseshoe believed to date back to the early 1900s was among items picked up on Ben Nevis My Pyne told the BBC Scotland website that they generally receive a good reaction from other hillwalkers during their annual litter picks. ""They always say thank you, they're always grateful,"" he said. ""Quite often they ask if there's anything they can do and then they might pick up a few bottles on the way down."" The mountain guide, from Kinlochleven, set up the Real 3 Peaks challenge in 2013, in a bid to clean up the mountains before the winter snowfall.

BBC head of news James Harding to leave,"James Harding is going to set up his own company BBC director of news James Harding is to stand down at the beginning of 2018. In a statement, he said: ""I am proud to have worked for BBC News as we renewed our reputation for responsible journalism."" BBC director general Tony Hall praised Harding, saying: ""James has done an incredible job during a hugely complex and momentous period."" After four years in the role, Harding is leaving the BBC to set up his own news media venture. Announcing the move, Harding said ""even when we're pedalling into the wind"" that working at the BBC was ""rewarding and worthwhile"". Talking about his new company, he explained: ""There is some journalism that the BBC, for all its brilliance, can't, and probably shouldn't, do. ""And that's what I want to explore: I am going to start a new media company with a distinct approach to the news and a clear point of view. ""I know I will enjoy the chance to do some more journalism of my own and, at such a critical time, I'm seriously excited about the prospect of building a new venture in news."" He said he'd reveal more in the new year. James Harding was previously editor of The Times Lord Hall thanked Harding for his service to the BBC. ""James has done an incredible job during a hugely complex and momentous period of British and world history,"" he said. ""He has led the BBC's coverage through two referendums, two general elections, an astonishing US presidential election, not to mention a series of extraordinary events at home and abroad. ""In the years James has been with us he's played an important part in modernising and changing the BBC, but beyond that, he has been a first-class colleague and a pleasure to work with."" A successor will be appointed by the end of the year, Lord Hall said. Harding joined the Financial Times in 1994 and served as Shanghai correspondent, media editor and Washington bureau chief. He joined The Times in 2006 as business and city editor and was editor from 2007 to 2012. Harding was appointed in April 2013 to oversee all of the BBC's news and current affairs programming. The division's workforce produces output across network news, English regions and the World Service group. In an email to staff announcing his departure, James Harding covered what all departure messages must cover: his legacy. Harding, who is - full disclosure - my ultimate boss, mentioned the emphasis on slow news, the hiring of new talent, new language services and the launch of the Reality Check brand to address the challenge of fake news. Together these add up to a substantial legacy. But Harding, like any journalist, will want to be remembered above all for the stories that were covered during his tenure. Read more.

Traffic ban on Game of Thrones road,"The famous tunnel of beech trees was used by the Game of Thrones crew to represent 'the Kingsroad' Traffic is to be banned from part of a County Antrim road - made famous by the TV fantasy drama Game of Thrones - to protect trees known as the Dark Hedges. The tunnel of beech trees on the Bregagh Road, near Armoy, has become a major international tourist attraction. The scene was used by the Game of Thrones crew to represent ""the Kingsroad"" in the HBO drama series. Stormont's Department for Infrastructure is introducing a ban on cars using the road from 30 October. Dark Hedges suffer Easter crowds and cars Game of Thrones road closure proposed The order will also prohibit buses and coaches from using the designated stretch of the Bregagh Road. This video can not be played Tourists at the beech-lined avenue have welcomed the move Any motorist who flouts the ban could face a fine of up to Â£1,000. Some vehicles - including agricultural and emergency vehicles - will be exempt from the ban ""in certain circumstances"". The Dark Hedges were planted more than 200 years ago by the Stuart family, who created a tree-lined avenue along the entrance to their Gracehill House mansion. About 150 were planted by James Stuart, but time has taken its toll over the centuries and now fewer than two thirds remain standing. A large branch of one of the trees fell onto the Bregagh Road in July 2016 In January 2016, during Storm Gertrude,high winds ripped up two trees, causing them to collapse. Later that year, a large, rotten branchbroke off one of the trees and fell across the road. The Dark Hedges became a huge draw for tourists and TV fans after they appeared, albeit very briefly, in the closing scene of one episode of Game of Thrones. A sign at the Dark Hedges marks the site's contribution to the TV show Arya Stark, one of the show's main characters, was filmed travelling on a cart along the road, disguised as a boy. Conservationists have expressed alarm about the increasing traffic levels in the area and the possible damage to the trees' roots. During the Easter holidays this year, pictures of traffic jams were shared on social media,some criticising the number of vehicles lining the road.. The cycling blog NI Greenways described the Dark Hedges as a ""national treasure"" and claimed it was being slowly killed.

Torture survivors win detention ruling,"Harmondsworth immigration centre in Middlesex is one of a number of such facilities in the UK Survivors of torture have won a legal challenge against Home Office rules on asylum seeker detention in the UK. The government had argued torture could only be carried out by official state agents or terror groups with territory. But survivors and the charity Medical Justice argued that definition was too narrow and should include victims of trafficking and other abuses. The Home Office has said it will not appeal against the ruling, which could affect hundreds of cases. Under official guidelines, people classed as victims of torture should be housed in private accommodation - provided by the government or family members already living in the country - while their asylum claims are processed. But the court was told that the new definition led to ""many"" detainees, including victims of trafficking and rape, no longer being recognised as victims of torture and therefore being locked up in detention centres instead. That was despite doctors submitting evidence of their torture and ill-treatment, the judge was told. Mr Justice Ouseley ruled that Home Office policy on torture survivors ""lacked a rational or evidence basis"". This ruling will have a profound effect - both symbolically and in practical terms. It means there's less risk that asylum seekers who come to Britain severely traumatised after being persecuted, abused or trafficked will be detained. Medical experts say that's hugely important because detention can lead to a deterioration in the mental health of those who've suffered ill treatment before. It's also a reminder to the Home Office to ensure it acts within the law when it introduces measures, even apparently minor changes, which affect the welfare of people seeking refuge in the UK. Seven people who had sought sanctuary in Britain after being raped, abused or trafficked were among those detained under the new policy because they were not classed as torture victims. But the High Court said the Home Office had acted unlawfully, because the new rules excluded people who were vulnerable to harm in detention. Two-tier system 'leaves refugees destitute' Mr Po, one of the former detainees who was part of the legal challenge, welcomed the decision. ""The policy allowed the Home Office to turn a blind eye to my suffering and the suffering of hundreds of other torture survivors,"" he said. ""Although I welcome the decision, it is still upsetting that the Home Office, who should protect people like me, rejected me and put me in detention which reminded me of the ordeal I suffered in my country of origin."" A 20-year-old Vietnamese woman, who said she worked from the age of six to pay off her dead parents' debts with a loan shark. Medical Justice said she was repeatedly beaten with sticks, broken bottles and burned with cigarettes before being trafficked to the UK. A 21-year-old Afghan man, who said he was kidnapped and recruited by the Taliban at the age of five, beaten with rifle butts, stabbed and thrown off a mountain. Two women who say they were subjected to sexual violence, rape and human trafficking for sexual exploitation. David Isaac, chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which intervened in the case, said: ""This unlawful policy has been scrapped, but the government should now go further and strengthen the human rights protections for people in immigration detention."" The Home Office said it was looking at how best it could consider the court's findings.

Grenfell baby story probably never happened,"One of the most dramatic stories from the night of the Grenfell Tower blaze - that a baby was thrown from a window and caught - probably never happened, a BBC investigation has concluded. The news was reported in the media right across the UK and the world. But neither the police nor ambulance service have a record of the event, and experts have questioned whether it is scientifically possible. No witnesses quoted at the time were willing to be interviewed on camera. The report, by BBC Newsnight, found the first reference to the story can be traced back to 10:08 on 14 June while firefighters were still battling the blaze. It was one of the few good news stories out of Grenfell Tower that awful night in June The Press Association tweeted an interview with a woman named Samira Lamrani. She told them that she had witnessed a woman on the ""ninth or 10th floor"" throwing a baby from a window and that the child was caught by a man below. The quotes were picked up by news organisations across the UK,including by the BBC. Newsnight contacted Ms Lamrani but she declined to be interviewed. ""My memory of that night is fadingâ¦ I don't want to talk about it,"" she said. Another witness quoted at the time was the broadcaster and architect George Clarke who told Newsnight on the day of the fire that he saw a man catch ""a kid"" thrown out of the window from the eighth floor. When we contacted him for this report, he told us he did not wish to make any comment on the matter at all. ""It's such a contentious issue and I think it's so hurtful to so many people,"" he said. The news was first reported in this tweet from a journalist with a video of a witness at the scene On the 16 June, two days after the fire, a dramatic account of a similar sounding incident appeared in The Sun newspaper. It was subsequently picked up by many other news organisations. The story features photographs of a man holding a young girl. The Sun names him as ""Pat"" and says the picture was taken just after he had caught the girl, aged 4, who the newspaper said had been dropped from the fourth floor. However, we tracked down the man in the picture. His name is Oluwaseun Talabi, and the girl he is holding in the picture is actually his own daughter. The pair had escaped the fire by walking down from the 14th floor. Inside the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower Messages from the Tower What happened at Grenfell Tower? Belief in this miracle doesn't seem to have diminished in the streets around the burned-out tower. If you ask local residents some will tell you that they are certain the story is true, although they didn't see it themselves. Newsnight has attempted to contact every person quoted as saying they did see the baby thrown and caught. Some told us that they had been misquoted. For some supposed witnesses, we found no evidence that they actually exist at all. None of those we could track down were willing to go on the record and give us an on-camera interview. One local resident, Jody Martin, has a theory about where the baby story originated. He arrived at the scene of the fire at about the same time as the first fire crews, just after 01:00. Jody Martin saw a woman holding a child outside a window to give it air He says his attention was drawn to activity on the third or fourth floor. ""There was an African-Caribbean lady with her baby and she was leaning out the window,"" he says. ""It was more like a toddler. And there was smoke just billowing out behind us, so obviously she was just trying to get oxygen. So she was at the lowest point of the ledge, you know right down low, top half of her torso hanging out, but her infant at arm's length."" Jody is clear that the woman was only minutes away from being rescued by fire crews and wasn't throwing the baby, just trying to make sure it had enough air. According to psychologists it is common in fast moving situations for witnesses to see part of an event and then assume what happened next. There is nothing dishonest about this. It is just how we formulate memories. As experts told us, human memory isn't a video tape - it is a best guess assembly of often incomplete or even contradictory information. There is another reason we should perhaps be sceptical of this story. The physics of such a fall would make serious injury to any child and anyone who tried to catch it a probability according to medical experts. Even dropped from five storeys or 15m, an object would be travelling at 17.15m per second or 61.73km per hour (38mph). Double the height to the 10th floor, or 30m, and an object is travelling at 24.25m per second or 87.3kmh (54.2mph). Any fall from above one storey would likely result in serious injury, irrespective of whether someone tries to catch the child or not, according to Dr Dan Magnus, Consultant in Paediatric Emergency Medicine at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. ""I would be sceptical of a baby falling from a very high height and someone catching that baby would somehow make the fall benign. I think that is difficult to understand,"" he said. If this event had happened you would think that there would be some official record of it, but Newsnight has established that neither the police, nor the ambulance service know anything about it, and no children from Grenfell were treated at hospital for the serious physical injuries likely to have resulted from such a fall. The Metropolitan Police could not have been clearer in their statement: ""We have no record of this incident."" It is often not possible to definitively say something didn't happen.  All we can do is search for the witnesses and scrutinise the evidence. We have done that and haven't turned up anything that suggests this amazing event actually happened. Indeed all the available evidence points to the opposite conclusion. David Grossman was reporting forBBC Newsnight. Watch hisfull report here.

UK attracting record number of tourists,"Tourism is booming in the UK with nearly 40 million overseas people expected to have visited the country during 2017 - a record figure. Tourist promotion agency VisitBritain forecasts overseas trips to the UK will increase 6% to 39.7 million with spending up 14% to Â£25.7bn this year. Britons are also holidaying at home in record numbers. British Tourist Authority chairman Steve Ridgway said tourism was worth Â£127bn annually to the economy. He called the sector an ""economic powerhouse"" and a ""job creator right across Britain"". ""Two-and-a-half times bigger than the automotive industry, employing three million, tourism is one of our most successful exports and needs no trade deals to compete globally."" The UK has become a cheaper place to visit for tourists from overseas following the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote last year. But Mr Ridgway said: ""Tourism is a fiercely competitive global industry and you cannot just build a strong, resilient industry on a weaker currency. ""We must continue to invest in developing world-class tourism products, getting Britain on the wish-list of international and domestic travellers and we must make it easy for visitors to make that trip."" The London Eye has proved popular since it opened in 2000 Tourism Minister John Glen said: ""Tourism contributes billions to the UK economy and supports millions of jobs."" He added that the record figures for overseas and domestic holidaymakers were ""testament to our world-class attractions and the innovation of our tourism industry"". During the first six months of the year there were a record 23.1 million overseas visits to the UK - up 8% on the same period in 2016 - and the figures for July topped four million for the first time, with only a slightly smaller number of visits made during August. British Museum - 6.4 million visits National Gallery -6.3 million Tate Modern - 5.8 million Natural History Museum - 4.6 million Southbank Centre - 3.9 million Source:Association of Leading Visitor Attractions,external Britain's beaches and attractions have also attracted more domestic users with ""staycations"" on the rise. From January to June this year, domestic overnight holidays in England rose 7% to a record 20.4 million with visitors spending Â£4.6bn - a rise of 17% and another record. On Monday,figures from trade body UK Financeshowed UK tourists' debit card spending when abroad was down sharply compared with last summer, providing more evidence of the trend towards holidaying at home.

Suzi Quatro: Rock's female role model,"The singer scored 18 hit singles in the UK It all began with the bongos. As a seven year-old in 1950s Michigan, Susan Kay Quatro would sit with her father's jazz band, the Art Quatro Trio, playing percussion and getting an early education in stagecraft. But her life changed when she saw Elvis and the Beatles on television. Grabbing the Fender Precision Bass her father had loaned her, she started a band with her sisters Patti and Arlene. The Pleasure Seekers' early singles, especially Never Thought You'd Leave Me and What A Way To Die, are still sought after by garage rock collectors - and the band soon found themselves sharing the bill with fellow Detroit rock stars Iggy Pop and Alice Cooper. When the band broke up in 1971, Quatro was headhunted by British pop impresario Mickie Most, and launched a hugely successful solo career, marrying the double-tracked drums of glam rock to the strolling bass lines of Motown. One of the first female rock stars, she sold 55 million records, with number one singles including Can The Can and Devil Gate Drive; while setting hearts aflutter on TV sitcom Happy Days as Leather Tuscadero, the rebellious younger sister of The Fonz's girlfriend, Pinky. One of rock's true trailblazers, she's about to set off on a UK tour. She told the BBC about shooting Alice Cooper, becoming a museum exhibit and what's inside her ""Ego Room"". The singer was a regular presence on Top of the Pops in the 1970s You were part of a Detroit scene that also included Iggy Pop, MC5 and Alice Cooper. What was that like? It was an extremely exciting time. I'm very proud of the Detroit pedigree. Musicians from Detroit have an energy level, an edge that's second to none. I don't know why it is. It just is. Who were your inspirations? I'm a Motown fanatic. I cut my teeth on James Jamerson, who played bass in Motown's house band, The Funk Brothers. He's my absolute hero. Did you ever meet him? Once. I ran down into the pit [in front of the stage] and started playing bass next to him. He gave me the biggest compliment. He said: 'Not bad for a white chick.' I read that you once shot Alice Cooper with a rubber dart. Is that true? Oh yeah! How did it happen? It was on the Welcome To My Nightmare tour, which was 80 shows. We got bored, so we decided to have a dart gun fight. Alice decided to hide behind a television and, you know, he's got a little bit of a large nose. And I saw his nose sticking out, so I whacked him. I gave him a black eye! He said his first thought was, 'Ouch' and his second thought was, 'Good shot!' Your first number one was Can The Can. How did you celebrate? I was at a gig up North and we were staying at some lady's bedsit. We were in the bedroom, all celebrating with a bottle of champagne when the lady knocked on the door and said, 'Lights off! It's 10 o'clock.' So that was our celebration! The singer recently recorded an album with Glam rock cohorts Andy Scott (from Sweet) and Don Powell (from Slade) Why do you think you had more chart success over here than at home in the 70s? I had more singles released over here, that's all. I toured America successfully all the time and Happy Days made me into a household name over there. There's a famous scene where you kiss The Fonz [Henry Winkler]. Did you get any hate mail? Not at all! In fact, I heard from the main secretary on Happy Days that, after Henry, I got the most fan mail, as Leather Tuscadero. So that's a big compliment! Happy Days isn't your only acting role - what's been your favourite? Happy Days is hard to beat but recently I loved Midsomer Murders, where I got electrocuted. Quatro got her role on Happy Days without auditioning, after the show's producer saw her poster on his daughter's bedroom wall Is it true that your leather catsuit is now in the Victoria & Albert museum? I gave them one of my jumpsuits - a gold one. I have to keep reminding them it's only on loan! But I have loads here in my house, in my Ego Room, and I still wear jumpsuits now. Sorry, did you say Ego Room? Yes! I have an Ego Room on the third floor. My entire life's in there - videos, DVDs, suits, guitars, pictures all over the wall, scrapbooks, awards, everything. Even the red book from This Is Your Life on the table. The sign on the door says, ""Ego Room - Mind Your Head"". On your last album, you covered Goldfrapp's Strict Machine - which itself references Can The Can. What's it like to know you're still influencing new bands? It's fantastic. It's a little bit of humbly-accepted applause. I recently found out KT Tunstall is a fan. In fact, she stayed here last night and we did three songs together! Suzi Quatro in her trademark catsuit, with an actual cat You were one of the first female rock stars - did people come to you for advice? Oh God, yes. I was a bit of a benchmark for a lot of girls. I was able to be the leader of the gang, with the guys, and still keep my femininity - which is the difficult part. And now you've got an honorary doctorate in music! I have! I received it in Cambridge [from Anglia Ruskin University] dressed in a cap and a gown. It was such an honour. Do you have to give lectures now? Yes - I talk about how to survive in this industry, mainly. What's your big tip? Learn one instrument properly. Learn to read and write [music]. And gig. Because you don't know your craft until you can entertain the drunk at the bar who doesn't want to see you. It feels like a lot of artists don't get that schooling these days. They're just famous for being famous. It's just so stupid. I hate it. I've been on the road for 53 years and I'm still learning. Don't tell me these guys who've been working at McDonald's and go on X Factor have any tools to deal with fame. That's not how stars are discovered. You're about to hit the road with The Osmonds and Hot Chocolate. Do you like doing nostalgia tours? I like it as long as I'm headlining! After everything you've achieved, what's left on your bucket list? I just had my first novel released, called The Hurricane. I'd like a movie of that made, and I'd like a proper movie of my life. The Legends Live Tour - featuring Suzi Quatro, David Essex, The Osmonds and Hot Chocolate - starts on Friday, 13 October in Glasgow.

Four ways Corker skewered Trump,"On Sunday morning, Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own party. This, in itself, isn't exactly huge news. It's far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranks. This time, however, his attacks were particularly biting and personal. He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a coward for not running for re-election. He said Mr Corker ""begged"" for the president's endorsement, which he refused to give. He wrongly claimed that Mr Corker's support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishment. Unlike some of his colleagues, Mr Corker - free from having to worry about his immediate political future -didn't hold his tongue,external. That wasn't the end of it, though. He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it. Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senator'sinterview with the Times,externaland why they are particularly damning. You can't really sugarcoat this one. Mr Corker is flat-out saying the president is a liar - and everyone knows it. The senator, in particular, is challenging Mr Trump's insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement, but the accusation is much broader. Mr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies. The Tennessean was on Mr Trump's short list for vice-president and secretary of state. Bob Corker at Trump campaign rally in July 2016 Those days are seemingly very much over now - and it's not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon. Although he's not running for re-election, he'll be in the Senate, chairing a powerful committee, until January 2019. The president's margin for success in that chamber is razor-thin. If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition, he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators. That's why healthcare reform collapsed in July - and it could be bad news for tax efforts. From here on out, Mr Corker isn't going to do the president any favours. Frustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the president's inability to focus on advancing their agenda. Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare, reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough. Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harder. One of the president's gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject. That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign, but it's less effective during the legislative slow grind. Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson For months, Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves. Occasionally, someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesn't understand how the Senate works. Mr Corker has now stated it loud and clear. And, what's more, he says almost everyone agrees with him. They've kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trump's legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general election. If that calculus ever changes - if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out - Mr Trump will be in real trouble. Time and again, Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crises. The war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement, the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours, the unrest in Venezuela and, most recently, North Korea's continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the president's offhand remarks and Twitter invective. Trump could put US 'on the path to WW3' Tillerson denies resignation rumours What will happen to the Iran nuclear deal? Some administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trump's strategy - an updated version of the Nixon-era ""madman theory"", in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leader's actions. Mr Corker isn't buying it. There's no strategy, he says, just the possibility of chaos - which he hopes Mr Trump's senior advisers will be able to avoid. There's now a growing collection of John Kelly face-palm photos that serve as a testament to the chief-of-staff's reported frustration at dealing with the president. Mr Trump goes off-script to praise torch-bearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose, as if attempting to stave off a migraine. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly looks on as US President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally The president calls North Korean leaders ""criminals"" in a speech to the United Nations, and Mr Kelly straight-up buries his face in his hands. The White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential ""joke"" or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration line. Even though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff, the president still marches to the beat of his own drum - and continues to have unfettered access to his phone's Twitter app. Bob Corker is only the latest person - politician, journalist, sports star or celebrity - to feel the mercurial president's uncontainable ire.

Could your fluffy pillows help combat climate change?,"Your fluffy pillows and memory foam mattress could be helping to reduce CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process? When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change. This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street. It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet. Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2. UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics. In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic. And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process. ""Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year,"" explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies. ""This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."" CarbonCure's Robert Niven thinks his firm's concrete is far more environmentally friendly The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market. Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete. CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer. The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger. Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects. Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel. While  Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes. But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference? Simply put, levels of ""greenhouse gases"" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities. Should we be reducing the amount of CO2 used in making plastics, or simply using less plastic? At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions. But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark. A gigatonne is a billion tonnes. Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year. And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year. Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes. ""It's great to have these options coming up,"" says Mr Christensen, ""but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."" Greenpeace's Doug Parr thinks renewable energy is a better way to reduce CO2 emissions Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy. A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes. ""Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels,"" says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. ""A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."" In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale. Could a hacker hijack your connected car? What will stop these self-driving lorries colliding? Could wood pulp make cars lighter and more efficient? Where will the deadly floods strike next? ""The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed,"" he argues. Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon. Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood. So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue. This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed. ""Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down. Then carbon capture can come in,"" says Mr Christensen. ""It could have an important role to play.""

Weinstein 'sent plea ahead of firing',"Harvey Weinstein has said he is the victim of ""false and defamatory statements"" Film producer Harvey Weinstein emailed Hollywood associates asking for help to avoid being fired by his own company, US media report Weinstein was sacked amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations dating back decades. In the email, he said he was ""desperate"" for help and called for the film industry to support him,the New York Times reported.,external Hollywood stars have spoken of their shock at the allegations. Weinstein sacked after harassment claims Conservatives call out 'liberal hypocrisy' Hollywood reacts to Weinstein claims Top Hollywood producer 'sincerely sorry' Meryl Streep told theHuffington Post,externalshe was appalled by the ""disgraceful"" news and praised the women who reported the alleged abuse as ""heroes"". Dame Judi Dench, who won an Oscar for her role in the Weinstein movie Shakespeare in Love, called the claims ""horrifying"". The email was sent on Sunday to studio executives and agents, the New York Times reported, hours before Weinstein was fired by the board of his company. According to those who said they had seen it, the email read: ""My board is thinking of firing me. All I'm asking is let me take a leave of absence and get into heavy therapy and counselling. ""Whether it be in a facility or somewhere else, allow me to resurrect myself with a second chance. A lot of the allegations are false as you know but given therapy and counselling as other people have done, I think I'd be able to get there. ""I could really use your support or just your honesty if you can't support me."" The email adds: ""We believe what the board is trying to do is not only wrong but might be illegal and would destroy the company. If you could write this letter backing me, getting me the help and time away I need, and also stating your opposition to the board firing me, it would help me a lot. I am desperate for your help. Just give me the time to have therapy. Do not let me be fired. If the industry supports me, that is all I need."" Streep and Weinstein worked together on films such as The Iron Lady Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, having co-founded the Miramax and Weinstein Company production firms. His films include Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and Pulp Fiction. When the claims were first reported in the New York Times last week, Weinsteinissued a statementin which he apologised for causing ""a lot of pain"". However he later disputed the article, with one of his legal team claiming the newspaper's report was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"". Weinstein's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in another statement that the allegations against him were ""patently false"". Bloomlater announced,externalshe had resigned as Weinstein's adviser. The allegations against him, according to the New York Times report, emerged mainly from young women hoping to break into the film industry and included celebrities Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan. Among the accusations levelled against the film producer are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. In return for sexual favours, he promised to help advance their careers, they said. 'Liberal hypocrisy' over Weinstein?

May to urge action on race inequality,"Students at Dunraven School in south London listened as Theresa May explained the audit Theresa May has warned public services there will be ""nowhere to hide"" if they treat people differently on the basis of their race. A new government website,externalshows disparities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and courts between ethnicities. The PM said institutions must ""explain or change"" any variations - but critics are demanding action from ministers. Labour says government must accept its role in exacerbating injustice. Adam or Mohamed - who gets the job? The man correcting stories about Muslims Is everyone racist? 'My colour is part of my brand' The figures cover a wide range of lifestyle indicators, including: Black Caribbean pupils are permanently excluded from school three times as often as white British classmates White British pupils on free school meals perform the worst at key stage two, with just 32% reaching the expected level Indian, Pakistani and white people are more likely to own their own homes than black and Bangladeshi individuals Unemployment among black, Asian and minority ethnic people is nearly double that of white Britons Rates of smoking are highest in the mixed and white ethnic groups Just over half of white adults ate five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, compared with a third of black adults ""People who have lived with discrimination don't need a government audit to make them aware of the scale of the challenge,"" Mrs May said. ""This audit means that for society as a whole - for government, for our public services - there is nowhere to hide."" Among those contacting the BBC, Shaneil, from Moss Side, Manchester, said: ""It shouldn't matter where you come from or your race. You should be equal, you should be able to do anything you want to do. ""We need more different ethnicities to be in power as well."" 'I don't think people in Moss Side get enough chances' Joseph G Jones, of the Gypsy Council, said the government was failing its Romani and Traveller communities with ""multi-discrimination"" across people's lifetimes. ""The younger generations shouldn't have to put up with endemic ongoing discrimination - for the time being there is little light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. And Victoria Stevens, a Ukrainian who has lived in the UK for 18 years told the BBC she had no problem in applying for jobs, as she had a mechanical engineering degree, plenty of work experience, and her late husband's English surname. But she added: ""However, when it came to career progression, I found that a British candidate would get a promotion above me, every time."" This video can not be played Awal Hassan tells Radio 4's Today he was unable to take out a loan for a council flat Almost all the data released on 'Ethnicity Facts and Figures' is already publicly available and no new data was commissioned for the audit. Analysis:By BBC home editor Mark Easton This audit is a giant nudge to change behaviour on issues of race inequality. The odd thing is that the project is not a government trying to nudge the people. It is a government trying to nudge itself. The prime minister has dedicated her premiership to fighting burning injustices and says she is determined to shine a light on disparities between different racial groups in the UK on a range of areas - health, education, job prospects, housing and so on. A focus on the many and often troubling differences is - of course - no bad thing, but people might well wonder why we need a public website to get Whitehall departments to take an interest. And given that ministers have known about these ""troubling"" and ""shocking"" disparities for years or even decades, why does it take a prime ministerial nudge to get them to take action? Read more from Mark Critics from ethnic minority backgrounds, including former deputy London mayor Munira Mirza, in aletter to The Times,external, said the ""crude and tendentious"" approach of comparing the data in the website risked ""promoting a grievance culture and policies that harm the communities they aspire to help"". They said prejudice had declined ""markedly"" and while injustice must be challenged, there were often many underlying factors to explain differences. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid denied it would drive a grievance culture but would help identify disparities. ""There are hundreds of thousands of British Pakistani women and Bangladeshi women who don't speak proper English, who don't speak English at all,"" hetold BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That might be through choice in some cases, it might be a cultural issue. But that is a big issue because that does then hold those women back from the employment market and other opportunities."" Labour's Dawn Butler said government cuts to services had disproportionately affected women, ethnic minorities, disabled and older people. Speaking in the House of Commons, she said the PM had ""done nothing but exacerbate the problems"". ""Far from tackling the burning injustices she's added fuel to the fire. We need solutions and a sustained effort to really tackle burning injustices, talking shop's just not going to cut it."" Although the audit does not focus on government policies, Mrs May is launching a number of measures to combat the differences discovered. They include Department for Work and Pensions ""hotspots"" to help people from ethnic minorities get jobs, and traineeships for 16-24 year-olds. Under the plans, the Ministry of Justice will also adopt recommendations fromthe Lammy Review, including demanding that prisons have performance indicators to assess how inmates are treated and how representative their workforce is. David Lammy MP told BBC News the data was ""not all doom and gloom"" and ""some progress"" had been made. ""The truth is you can't rest back on your laurels, you can't leave race and issues of class and poverty off the agenda. Some of this has been left off the agenda over the last seven years so we've fallen backwards.""

Exotic animal parties 'to require licences',"This video can not be played Mobile zoo owner Scott Gavin uses snakes and a raccoon dog at parties Mobile zoos that provide exotic animals for children's parties will require licences to operate in England, the government has said. It comes as the RSPCA told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme animals such as meerkats and raccoons were being handled and kept inappropriately. Animals used currently range from snakes and tarantulas to - more controversially - skunks and monkeys. Animal welfare group the Scottish SPCA said it was opposed to mobile zoos. There are about 200 mobile zoos in the UK, estimates suggest Estimates suggest there are about 200 mobile zoos in the UK. Some do hundreds of events a month. Under the changes to the Animal Welfare Act 2006 - to be introduced ""as soon as parliamentary time allows"" in England - ""anyone in the business of providing an animal for exhibit"" would need a licence from their local authority, the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. This includes mobile zoos. They must also adhere to welfare standards developed with those working in the sector and animal welfare charities. Defra said it would ""liaise closely"" with the Welsh government over the matter - which has just concluded a consultation on bringing in new laws. The Scottish government has previously announced it plans to develop a new licence to protect the welfare of animals used in such shows. Ros Clubb, from the RSPCA, said the charity was particularly worried about the use of meerkats, raccoons and raccoon dogs - also known as tanukis - at children's parties. ""They have specific needs, for example being kept in a group. They're wild animals, they're not used to being handled,"" she said. She was also concerned about ""animals being stacked up in inappropriate boxes and enclosures, and taken to places for display and for handing round again and again potentially in the same day"". The charity warned that some animals may also pose a risk to children from bites and scratches, or even the spread of disease. Reptiles and amphibians can spread salmonella to humans. Dr Clubb says it is ""extremely easy"" for someone to start a mobile zoo business Under the current system, local councils in England, Scotland and Wales do run a registration scheme for performing animals. But the RSPCA said many did not require mobile zoos to sign up, because they did not consider animals in mobile petting zoos as ""performing"". This video can not be played A good mobile zoo has a trusting relationship between an animal and its handler, one operator told the BBC Most of the mobile zoo owners the Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to supported the notion of stronger regulation. Joshua Jameson, from Wild Science - whose animals include hedgehogs, snakes and scorpions - said his company had never been inspected. ""I definitely think there should be more regulation in this industry,"" he said. ""People are using the wrong animals - meerkats, skunks, even small monkeys. It's tantamount to animal cruelty."" Scott Gavin with his raccoon Scott Gavin, who runs Party Central Entertainments, has more than 120 animals - including a raccoon dog. He defends his use of large exotic animals, seeing little difference to the keeping of domestic pets. ""It's OK to keep a rabbit in a hutch, but it's not OK to have a raccoon. You can have a hamster, but not a hedgehog,"" he said, questioning the logic. ""It's just people being very picky."" Mr Gavin has more than 120 animals Mr Gavin - who also does school visits - believes his events help to educate children about the creatures. He insisted that animal welfare was his number one priority. ""The environment has got to be set properly, no crowding, no noise,"" he said. ""If [the children] are causing stress for the animals, the animals go home."" In 2013, the RSPCA rescued 70 exotic animals from a company running a mobile zoo The RSPCA is urging parents to think carefully before booking any mobile zoo for their children's party. In 2013, it rescued 70 exotic animals from a company that was keeping them in cramped, dirty conditions. The owner of the company, Stephen Rowlands, pleaded guilty to 34 animal welfare offences. He was given a suspended jail sentence, but was able to continue running his mobile zoo business.

Fluffy pillows to concrete: The uses of captured CO2,"Your fluffy pillows and memory foam mattress could be helping to reduce CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process? When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change. This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street. It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet.

'No deal' Brexit plan raises the stakes,"Tuesday's papers have plenty of advice for the prime minister ahead of the next round of Brexit talks. The Guardian says Theresa May must not subordinate her judgement to the whim of ""no deal Brexit hardliners,external"". The paper says ""the reckless dogma that would drive us to a Brexit without a deal enjoys no majority in Parliament or the country"". Former Prime Minister David Cameron's old spin doctor, Andy Coulson, writes in the Daily Telegraph that Mrs May should announce that she will stand down as leader before the next general election. He says such a dramatic announcement could convince voters that ""it's not all about her,externalbut about the country"". The Daily Mail columnist, Richard Littlejohn, is also frustrated with what he sees at the Tory Party's introspection. Fifteen months on from the EU referendum, he complains, ""it's still all about them,external"".  The only thing that matters, he says, is getting Britain out of the EU as quickly as possible. Several papers are alarmed by the warnings from the Care Quality Commission about the pressures facing the NHS and the care system. It's the front page story in the Daily Mirror, which says ""savage Tory austerity,external"" is killing ""our most precious public service"" - although the government says the vast majority of patients are getting good care. The Daily Mail saysunhealthy lifestyles are to blame,externalfor increasing rates of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. The Times says it's learnt that the term ""junior doctor""could be banished from the NHS,externalbecause it's viewed as demeaning. The chief medical officer for England, Dame Sally Davies, has apparently said that doctors need job titles that give them ""the respect they deserve"". She's backing a call to rename qualified doctors with medical degrees - many of whom are in their late 30s and have been working for 10 years. At a time of low morale, it is hoped changing job titles would be a cost-free way of making the doctors feel valued and improving patient care.

The Spectator's gossip columnist, Steerpike, hopes that none of the minster's staff have been watching the BBC iPlayer on their office computers - an offence that risks a Â£1,000 fine.

The artist's biographer, James Hamilton, has told the Cheltenham Literature Festival that the inclusion of two donkeys trapped in a pen in the background; a gun he believes is a phallic symbol; and what he believes to be a phallic drawing on the wife's skirt suggest Gainsborough had fallen out with the couple andwas exacting revenge,external.

May to urge action on racial disparity,"Students at Dunraven School in south London listened as Theresa May explained the audit Theresa May has warned public services there will be ""nowhere to hide"" if they treat people differently on the basis of their race. A new government website,externalshows disparities in educational attainment, health, employment and treatment by police and courts between ethnicities. The PM said institutions must ""explain or change"" any variations - but critics are demanding action from ministers. Labour says government must accept its role in exacerbating injustice. Adam or Mohamed - who gets the job? The man correcting stories about Muslims Is everyone racist? 'My colour is part of my brand' The figures cover a wide range of lifestyle indicators, including: Black Caribbean pupils are permanently excluded from school three times as often as white British classmates White British pupils on free school meals perform the worst at key stage two, with just 32% reaching the expected level Indian, Pakistani and white people are more likely to own their own homes than black and Bangladeshi individuals Unemployment among black, Asian and minority ethnic people is nearly double that of white Britons Rates of smoking are highest in the mixed and white ethnic groups Just over half of white adults ate five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, compared with a third of black adults ""People who have lived with discrimination don't need a government audit to make them aware of the scale of the challenge,"" Mrs May said. ""This audit means that for society as a whole - for government, for our public services - there is nowhere to hide."" Among those contacting the BBC, Shaneil, from Moss Side, Manchester, said: ""It shouldn't matter where you come from or your race. You should be equal, you should be able to do anything you want to do. ""We need more different ethnicities to be in power as well."" 'I don't think people in Moss Side get enough chances' Joseph G Jones, of the Gypsy Council, said the government was failing its Romani and Traveller communities with ""multi-discrimination"" across people's lifetimes. ""The younger generations shouldn't have to put up with endemic ongoing discrimination - for the time being there is little light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said. And Victoria Stevens, a Ukrainian who has lived in the UK for 18 years told the BBC she had no problem in applying for jobs, as she had a mechanical engineering degree, plenty of work experience, and her late husband's English surname. But she added: ""However, when it came to career progression, I found that a British candidate would get a promotion above me, every time.""

Analysis:By BBC home editor Mark Easton This audit is a giant nudge to change behaviour on issues of race inequality. The odd thing is that the project is not a government trying to nudge the people. It is a government trying to nudge itself. The prime minister has dedicated her premiership to fighting burning injustices and says she is determined to shine a light on disparities between different racial groups in the UK on a range of areas - health, education, job prospects, housing and so on. A focus on the many and often troubling differences is - of course - no bad thing, but people might well wonder why we need a public website to get Whitehall departments to take an interest. And given that ministers have known about these ""troubling"" and ""shocking"" disparities for years or even decades, why does it take a prime ministerial nudge to get them to take action? Read more from Mark Critics from ethnic minority backgrounds, including former deputy London mayor Munira Mirza, in aletter to The Times,external, said the ""crude and tendentious"" approach of comparing the data in the website risked ""promoting a grievance culture and policies that harm the communities they aspire to help"". They said prejudice had declined ""markedly"" and while injustice must be challenged, there were often many underlying factors to explain differences. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid denied it would drive a grievance culture but would help identify disparities. ""There are hundreds of thousands of British Pakistani women and Bangladeshi women who don't speak proper English, who don't speak English at all,"" hetold BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That might be through choice in some cases, it might be a cultural issue. But that is a big issue because that does then hold those women back from the employment market and other opportunities."" Labour's Dawn Butler said government cuts to services had disproportionately affected women, ethnic minorities, disabled and older people. Speaking in the House of Commons, she said the PM had ""done nothing but exacerbate the problems"". ""Far from tackling the burning injustices she's added fuel to the fire. We need solutions and a sustained effort to really tackle burning injustices, talking shop's just not going to cut it."" Although the audit does not focus on government policies, Mrs May is launching a number of measures to combat the differences discovered. They include Department for Work and Pensions ""hotspots"" to help people from ethnic minorities get jobs, and traineeships for 16-24 year-olds. Under the plans, the Ministry of Justice will also adopt recommendations fromthe Lammy Review, including demanding that prisons have performance indicators to assess how inmates are treated and how representative their workforce is. David Lammy MP told BBC News the data was ""not all doom and gloom"" and ""some progress"" had been made. ""The truth is you can't rest back on your laurels, you can't leave race and issues of class and poverty off the agenda. Some of this has been left off the agenda over the last seven years so we've fallen backwards.""

"NHS future precarious, says regulator","The Care Quality Commission (CQC) says the health system is ""straining at the seams"" and faces a ""precarious"" future. The England's regulator's annual report raised concerns about staff shortages, rising demand and the number of patients with preventable illnesses. It said so far the quality of NHS and council care has been maintained but warned standards were likely to drop. Health Minister Philip Dunne suggested that extra money for social care, mental health and A&E was enough. ""With record funding and more doctors and nurses, the NHS was recently judged the best healthcare system in the world, despite the pressures from increasing demand,"" he said. In its report, the CQC highlighted: Staffing shortages with vacancy rates in the NHS rising by 16% over the last two years despite an increase in staff of 4% Bed shortages in hospitals with occupancy levels being consistently above recommended levels since April 2012 Falling numbers of nursing homes beds - down by 4,000 in two years at a time when more are needed Rising numbers of people not getting support for their social care needs with the numbers hitting 1.2m, up 18% in a year Number of detentions under the Mental Health Act up by a fifth in two years to more than 63,000 last year The CQC's report - its yearly round-up on the state of the sector - comes after it completed its new inspection regime of hospitals, mental health units and care services. CQC chief executive Sir David Behan said that while the quality of care was being maintained currently thanks to the efforts of staff, that resilience was not inexhaustible given the rising pressures. ""We are going to see a fall in the quality of services that are offered to people and that may mean that the safety of some people is compromised,"" he added. He said the NHS is ""struggling to cope with 21st century problems"" including increasing numbers of people with illnesses linked to unhealthy lifestyle choices like obesity, diabetes, dementia and heart disease. ""We are living longer but are not living healthier so I think what we are signalling is that the system now and into the future has got to deal with those increased numbers of older people who are going to have more than one condition."" He said one of the immediate priorities was finding a solution to funding social care - ministers have promised a Green Paper by the end of the year after providing an extra Â£2bn of funding over the next three years to keep services going. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said the findings made worrying reading. ""Really this tells you everything you need to know about the state of care today - it's like a rubber band that's been stretched as far as it will go and can't stretch any further."" Labour Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the report was ""damning"". ""Next month the Chancellor in his budget must finally put the NHS on a secure financial footing for the long term.""

Australia dual citizenship hearing begins,"Barnaby Joyce inherited New Zealand citizenship from his father An Australian court has begun a long-awaited hearing into whether seven MPs caught up in a dual citizenship saga should remain eligible for office. Under constitutional rules, Australian politicians cannot be dual citizens. The High Court of Australia will clarify whether there are any exceptions, such as for those who did not know they were dual nationals. If Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is disqualified, the government could lose its one-seat majority. The government will argue that only two politicians who""voluntarily obtained, or retained""dual status should be disqualified. The other five politicians, including Mr Joyce, were unknowing recipients and should remain eligible, according to the government's defence. The hearing will last three days. A ruling could be made as early as Thursday, but the court may decide that longer deliberations are necessary. Who are the MPs, and what do they argue? Is the row a threat to the government? How the saga befell an immigrant nation The cases involve Mr Joyce and his government colleagues Fiona Nash and Matt Canavan, as well as four politicians from minor parties - Malcolm Roberts, Nick Xenophon, Larissa Waters and Scott Ludlam. Mr Joyce will attract the most interest because he sits in the lower House of Representatives, where the party with the most MPs forms the government. The others were elected to the Senate. If Mr Joyce loses his seat, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull could oversee a minority government, butthe potential outcomes are complex. The citizenship revelations began in July when New Zealand-born Mr Ludlam, from the Greens, announced he was a dual national. It prompted dozens of politicians to make public statements about their status. The court will hear submissions from the seven politicians, the government, and an independent challenger, former MP Tony Windsor. Who are Australia's dual citizen MPs?

Pressure mounts on Catalan leader,"Carles Puigdemont has been urged to step back from declaring independence Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont is announcing his plans for the future of the Spanish province. He told the regional parliament in Barcelona that he wanted to ""de-escalate"" the tensions surrounding the issue. There had been speculation that he would make a unilateral declaration of independence from Spain following a disputed referendum. But there were also growing demands for him to drop plans to break away. Reports say Catalan party leaders met before the session began an hour behind schedule. LIVE coverage A vote was held on 1 October which Catalan officials say resulted in almost 90% of voters backing independence for the north-eastern region. Turnout was put at 43%. The vote was deemed illegal by Madrid and suspended by Spain's Constitutional Court. ""No"" voters largely boycotted the ballot and there were several reports of irregularities. National police were involved in violent scenes as they manhandled voters. Mr Puigdemont hailed the referendum process and condemned the actions of the Spanish government, but acknowledged that people on all sides were worried about what would happen next. ""We are all part of the same community and we need to go forward together. The only way forward is democracy and peace,"" he told deputies. But he also said Catalonia was being denied the right to self-determination, and paying too much in taxes to the central government in Madrid. Catalan police have been posted outside the parliament in Barcelona, sealing off the grounds to the public. A large pro-independence rally is currently taking place in the area. Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona Never before has the world watched Catalonia's regional parliament so closely. This evening, with probably large numbers of police and protesters outside, the leader of the devolved government is due to address Catalan MPs. Carles Puigdemont plans to present his government's results of the disputed referendum, which Madrid declared illegal. Since then, Mr Puigdemont has said on several occasions that he will declare independence, despite fierce opposition across Spain and criticism from European governments. Now, will he make good his threat? Or will he announce a more nuanced strategy, hoping still for a proper, recognised referendum one day? Under pressure to act, the Spanish government has made stark warnings, too. If the order comes, thousands of Spanish national police, here in Barcelona, could intervene. The Catalan police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, closed the Ciutadella Park, where parliament is located, early in the day, positioning vans near the entrances and alongside parliament. The authorities said the measures were ""for safety reasons"". A pro-independence rally was held near the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona Armed police have been deployed outside parliament ""for safety reasons"" The Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a non-party grassroots movement, earlier urged supporters in atweet,externalto come to the parliament district to ""defend"" the vote for independence. How do you start a country? Could Catalonia be a viable country? Independence supporters have been sharing the Catalan hashtag #10ODeclaraciÃ³ (10 October Declaration) on Twitter. Expectations are high that Mr Puigdemont will ask parliament to declare independence on the basis ofthe referendum law,externalit passed last month. Parliament, which is dominated by pro-independence parties, would then have 48 hours to vote. This video can not be played Pablo Insa Iglesias and Elisabeth BesÃ³ sit on opposite sides of the argument Barcelona's influential mayor, Ada Colau, has urged Mr Puigdemont not to declare independence. She also called on Mr Rajoy to rule out direct control from Madrid. The Madrid government called on the Catalan leader ""not to do anything irreversible, not to pursue a path of no return and not to make any unilateral independence declaration"". European Council President Donald Tusk said: ""A few days ago I asked Prime Minister Rajoy to look for a solution to the problem without the use of force, to look for dialogue, because the use of dialogue is always better than the use of force. ""Today I ask you [Mr Puigdemont] to respect in your intentions the constitutional order and not to announce a decision that would make such a dialogue impossible. ""Diversity should not and need not lead to conflict whose consequences would obviously be bad for the Catalans, for Spain and for whole of Europe."" When the BBC asked people for their opinion in Barcelona, one woman, Eva Iniesta, called for the Spanish government to open a ""dialogue so independence is not declared"". But another person, Salvador Puig, said: ""We have demonstrated and said that we don't like being part of this home and we have the right to live in the home we want and in the way we want."" Mr Rajoy is due to appear in Spain's parliament on Wednesday. He has already said any declaration of independence by Catalonia would ""lead to nothing"". Carles Puigdemont, left, and Mariano Rajoy show no signs of compromise UnderArticle 155 of the constitution,external, his Spanish government could suspend devolution. The leader of Spain's main opposition party, Pedro SÃ¡nchez of the Socialists, has said his party will back action by the government ""in the face of any attempt to break social harmony"". What are the options now? Catalan Spaniards fear loss of identity Distressed police officer photo goes viral A stream of companies have announced plans to move their head offices out of Catalonia in response to the crisis. It is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, accounting for a quarter of the country's exports. Publishing company Grupo Planeta is the latest to announce it will move from Barcelona to Madrid if there is a declaration of independence. The European Union has made clear that should Catalonia split from Spain, the region would cease to be part of the EU. A European Commission spokesman told Reuters news agency it called on ""all those concerned to get of this confrontation as quickly as possible and to start dialogue"". This video can not be played What do Scottish nationalists think about Catalonia? The EU, he added, had confidence ""in the capacity of Prime Minister Rajoy to manage this delicate process in full respect of the Spanish constitution and the basic fundamental rights of the citizens"". Austrian Finance Minister Hans JÃ¶rg Schelling warned the effects of Catalan independence could spread beyond Spain. ""I hope that this won't lead to a crisis in the euro and in the EU but the danger naturally exists because extreme positions are clashing,"" he said. Catalonia, a part of the Spanish state for centuries but with its own distinct language and culture, enjoys broad autonomy under the Spanish constitution. However, a 2005 amendment redefining the region as a ""nation"", boosting the status of the Catalan language and increasing local control over taxes and the judiciary was reversed by the Constitutional Court in 2010. The economic crisis further fuelled discontent and pro-independence parties took power in the region in the 2015 elections. Attempts to hold a legal Scottish-style referendum on independence have got nowhere with the Spanish government. Couple divided by Catalan question.

From fluffy pillows to concrete: The uses of captured CO2,"Your fluffy pillows and memory foam mattress could be helping to reduce CO2 Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process? When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change. This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street. It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet. Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2. UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics. In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic. And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process. ""Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year,"" explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies. ""This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."" CarbonCure's Robert Niven thinks his firm's concrete is far more environmentally friendly The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market. Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete. CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer. The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger. Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects. Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel. While  Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes. But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference? Simply put, levels of ""greenhouse gases"" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities. Should we be reducing the amount of CO2 used in making plastics, or simply using less plastic? At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions. But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark. A gigatonne is a billion tonnes. Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year. And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year. Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes. ""It's great to have these options coming up,"" says Mr Christensen, ""but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."" Greenpeace's Doug Parr thinks renewable energy is a better way to reduce CO2 emissions Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy. A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes. ""Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels,"" says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. ""A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."" In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale. Could a hacker hijack your connected car? What will stop these self-driving lorries colliding? Could wood pulp make cars lighter and more efficient? Where will the deadly floods strike next? ""The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed,"" he argues. Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon. Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood. So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue. This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed. ""Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down. Then carbon capture can come in,"" says Mr Christensen. ""It could have an important role to play.""
