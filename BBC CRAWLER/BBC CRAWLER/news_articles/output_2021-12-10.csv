Top US court lets abortion clinics sue over ban,"The US Supreme Court has ruled that abortion providers can sue to challenge a controversial Texas abortion law. The law, known as SB8, gives people the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. In its ruling, however, the court said that the law can remain in effect, leaving it in place. Doctors, women's rights groups and the Biden administration have heavily criticised the law. The divisive law - which came into effect on 1 September - bans abortion after what some refer to as a foetal heartbeat. The law makes an exception for cases of medical emergency, but not for rape or incest. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that at six weeks a foetus has not yet developed a heartbeat, but rather an ""electronically induced"" flickering of tissues that will become the heart. The Texas law is enforced by giving individuals - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week mark. At issue at the Supreme Court was whether two groups - Texas abortion providers and the federal government - can sue to block the law. Friday's 8-1 ruling means that lawsuits from the providers can proceed. With the decision, the ruling will head back to the district court. Once back in the district court, the providers will now be able to file for a stay of enforcement and ultimately challenge the law's constitutionality. In the meantime, the law will stay in place. In a separate order, the Supreme Court dismissed a separate challenge brought by the Biden administration. Who could be most affected by US abortion changes? In a written dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with allowing the lawsuits to move forward but was critical of leaving the law in place, saying that ""the court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before SB8 went into effect"". The ban has led to a steep drop in abortions, experts say. Research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project found that abortions in the state fell by nearly 50% after the law went into effect, leading to an influx of patients seeking abortion care in neighbouring states. The abortion provider who brought the case, Whole Woman's Health, called the Supreme Court ruling a victory ""on very narrow grounds"". Its decision to leave SB8 in place, despite allowing challenges to go forward, was ""unjust, cruel and inhumane"", the group's CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller said. ""Our staff are heartbroken, scared and discouraged"". This video can not be played The impact of the strictest anti-abortion law in the US During a press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden is ""very concerned"" by the court's decision to keep SB8 in effect.""The ruling this morning is a reminder of how much these rights are at risk,"" she said. The Biden administration is seeking to pass legislation - introduced in the House of Representatives in response to SB8 - that would protect women seeking to end pregnancies and the right of healthcare providers to conduct abortions. It is considered unlikely to pass in the Senate. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion organisation that supports SB8, praised the Supreme Court for showing ""judicial restraint"" and dismissing the Biden administration's legal challenge and vowed to ""fight for this policy in the lower courts"". The group celebrated the law remaining in place but expressed frustration that the ruling allowed lawsuits to proceed. In December, the Supreme Court, which currently has a conservative majority, heard a separate case regarding a Mississippi law that bans abortions after the first 15 weeks. Anti-abortion activists consider the Mississippi case as among their best opportunities to overturn Roe v Wade, a landmark Supreme Court case that legalised abortions across the country. Why abortion rights in US could be about to change The 1973 decision gave women the constitutional right to abortions during their first 12-week trimester of pregnancy. A ruling in Mississippi case could mean that individual states can decide on the legality of abortions in their own jurisdictions. An end to Roe v Wade ""is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome"" according to Jessie Hill, a reproductive rights law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""I think the writing is on the wall here,"" Ms Hill said. ""The decision about Texas only adds to that perception. It was not a very favourable decision to the clinics."" In addition to Texas and Mississippi, several states - including Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina - have passed six-week ban bills so far this year. All have so far been stalled by legal challenges and haven't been put into effect. ""It's really unlike any other time in US history since 1973,"" Ms Hill said. ""To the extent that the Texas case provides tea leaves to read, they all point in the same direction."" This is a minor victory for abortion providers because it removes a hurdle. The unusual enforcement mechanism of the Texas law was deliberately designed to prevent legal challenges. The Supreme Court justices have now provided a path for the clinics to sue, albeit a narrow one. But the Chief Justice, John Roberts, stressed that there were wider issues at stake. He said the law was specifically crafted to nullify the Supreme Court's precedents on abortion, banning it at roughly six weeks of pregnancy rather than the court's standard of two trimesters - in effect denying women a constitutional right. And he wrote that the issue was not the federal right in question, it was that the role of the Supreme Court in America's constitutional system was at stake. Nonetheless, the conservative majority on the court refused to block the rogue law while it's being litigated. And it has indicated that it may roll back abortion rights enshrined in nearly 50 years of precedent in a separate case involving the state of Mississippi.

LV= members reject sale to US private equity firm,"Members of LV= have rejected selling the insurance mutual to US private equity firm Bain Capital for Â£530m. The sale of LV= to Bain Capital had been controversial, drawing criticism from politicians from several parties. LV= chief executive Mark Hartigan had said that for the business to survive it needed to demutualise. But some LV= members had been unhappy over demutualisation and the size of payouts on offer from the deal. The Bain Capital takeover would have meant that LV= would lose its mutual status, with members given Â£100 each as part of the deal. But the sale did not get enough support from members. Although 69% of a possible 1.1 million voting members were in favour of the transaction with Bain Capital, 75% approval was needed for the sale to pass. The result followed a meeting in which members discussed whether the company should remain a mutual. Some LV= staff were unable to watch the general meeting on Friday, according to reports. LV= chairman Alan Cook said: ""We want to reassure policyholders that this outcome will mean no changes to their policies or our ongoing commitment to the highest standards of service from LV=."" ""I will continue to lead the process to find a way forward that will enable us to provide the right financial outcome for all our members whilst respecting their different wishes,"" Mr Cook continued, and added that once a way forward had been determined, he would step down as chairman. Chief executive Mark Hartigan will continue in his role, the firm said. The firm said it would ""swiftly reassess its strategic options and explore alternative ways to provide the best long-term outcome for members, the business, employees and its wider communities"". The LV= board said it had ""listened to member concerns about the loss of mutuality and so will in particular explore whether mutuality can be retained either on a standalone basis without undue risk to members, or through a merger with a larger mutual organisation"". Bain Capital said it ""remains crucial"" that members are ""looked after and protected"". ""We have always wanted LV= to flourish and become a leading company in the sector, that offers more consumer choice and creates more jobs,"" a spokesperson added. Did this vote stir emotions? Most certainly, yes. It is, after all, about the future of a 178-year-old insurer owned by its members and founded to cover the funeral costs of Liverpool's poor. Did it raise some fundamental questions? Again, yes. They ranged from whether members should fund a long-term future they might not profit from, to the appropriateness of a private equity takeover. Was it a vote on the future of the mutual movement as a whole? No. LV= has specific problems, some of its own making. Experts say other mutuals have already navigated similar issues successfully. Meanwhile, mutual building societies still account for 23% of the UK residential mortgage market, hold 18% of people's cash savings, and have 40% of cash ISA balances. There are challenges, but as this vote shows - and the LV= board now acknowledges - there is plenty of life in the old mutual dog yet. LV= attracted a number of bids when it first proposed a sale of the business, including from rival mutual Royal London. LV=, which was founded in 1843 and formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, had pushed back against approaches from Royal London. It said that so-called ""with-profits"" members, who legally own LV=, should not have to ""finance a future that requires significant investment, which many would not benefit from"". Royal London said on Friday it had ""offered to enter into immediate and exclusive discussions with LV= to agree a mutual merger that will offer LV= customers the opportunity to have their life savings protected and invested by a mutual"". LV= said it had received an ""unsolicited preliminary merger proposal from Royal London"" on 8 December. ""The outline proposal from Royal London is at an early stage and is subject to discussion, due diligence and detailed negotiation of financial and other terms. There can be no certainty that a transaction will be agreed,"" LV= said. Mark Hartigan says LV= has to demutualise to survive The LV= group had a ""challenged"" capital structure and operated in an increasingly competitive market dominated by well-capitalised, global insurers,it said when trying to convince members to vote for the sale. The heart of the problem, Mr Hartigan said earlier, was that because it was a mutual it was unable to raise funds due to a cap on its debts.

'Sadistic' abuser jailed for 32 years,"This video can not be played Abdul Elahi tells police he targeted women who were in debt An online blackmailer who carried out ""sickening"" and ""abhorrent"" sexual abuse has been sentenced to 32 years in prison. Abdul Elahi targeted almost 2,000 victims to amass images of degrading sexual acts before selling the images to paedophiles. In some cases, women were blackmailed into abusing a baby or a sibling, with Elahi offering to pay off their debts. He admitted158 charges committed against 72 complainants. He will also be subject to an eight-year extension to his normal licence period following his eventual release. During sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court, he was described as being ""in a league of his own"" in terms of the scale of his online offending. The National Crime Agency (NCA) described Elahi's abuse as some of the most ""sickening sexual offending"" it had ever investigated. His victims ranged in age from eight-month-old babies to adults, it said. This video can not be played Abdul Elahi: Victim speaks out on abuse suffered Sentencing him, Judge Sarah Buckingham described the 26-year-old, formerly of Sparkhill in Birmingham, as the ""very worst type of predatory offender ever identified thus far"". The court heard more than 67,000 indecent images of children had been recovered from hard drives, with victims spread across 30 or more different countries. ""There is no conceivable way of tracing and destroying all the material you have spread online, causing ongoing distress to your victims,"" the judge said. ""The abhorrent nature of your crimes warrants an extremely long sentence for the protection of the public."" At the start of the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, the court heard Elahi used fake personas, including those of a doctor or a wealthy stockbroker, offering financial assistance and promising to pay off debts with Bitcoin, before persuading people to send him explicit photographs. So-called ""box sets"" of abusive images and videos compiled by Elahi were distributed in vast quantities, the court heard, after girls and young adults were blackmailed into providing ever more humiliating and degrading sexual material. ""Your demands increased in their viciousness, their depravity, even when your victims begged for mercy,"" the judge told Elahi. ""Even when you knew they were suicidal, you laughed at their distress and pain."" Abdul Elahi's sentencing hearing at Birmingham Crown Court took three days A series of impact statements were read to the court including that of one victim, a schoolgirl at the time of the offences. She described trying to take an overdose after learning Elahi had uploaded her images to Twitter. ""I would say for two years this person has ruined my life, I was heartbroken. I remember my 16th birthday, I spent the night crying, I was severely depressed. ""I am trying to move on but I find it very hard, I feel that this will be with me for the rest of my life."" Another teenage victim described feeling ""shaken to my soul and completely horrified that I was a part of this"". Tony Cook of the NCA said: ""Abdul Elahi is a depraved sadist who got sexual gratification through power and control over his victims whom he often goaded to the point of wanting to kill themselves. ""He has wrecked lives and families."" About 550 women and female children in Britain are believed to have been targeted by Elahi, who sold one customer more than 1,000 hours of videos. The court heard he regarded his crimes as a job. In interviews after his arrest he admitted to ""trying to make as much money"" as he possibly could. The Revenge Porn Helpline said it had been working with the NCA to remove the online content for more than two and a half years and had removed 135,000 individual images. ""We hope that every person affected by this feels some small sense of closure today, we know that their priority is the removal of this content,"" said Sophie Mortimer, from the charity. Kirsty Nicholls admitted working with Elahi to make indecent images of a child and also sexually assaulting a child Co-defendant Kirsty Nicholls, 35, of Northolt, west London, who admitted working with Elahi to make indecent images of a child, was jailed for six years and nine months. Nicholls met Elahi on a so-called sugar daddy website, targeting financially desperate women. ""You committed these offences with Elahi - your offending was motivated entirely by financial gain,"" the judge told Nicholls.

Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron cases,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland"" Scotland is facing a ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases, with the variant likely to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are only the ""tip of the iceberg"". And she predicted that a new wave of the pandemic was about to begin. She also announced changes to self-isolation guidelines, and urged people to cancel work Christmas parties. Ms Sturgeon said that, from Saturday, all household contacts of any Covid cases should isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status and even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Non-household contacts can leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and have had two vaccine doses. 'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister said early action was needed, with Omicron cases rising ""exponentially"" in recent days, and that she could not rule out further measures having to be introduced. She said cases of the new variant were doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic - which would potentially result in Omicron overtaking Delta by the beginning of next week. The R number - essentially the rate at which the virus is transmitted - has been hovering at about one in Scotland recently, but is now expected to rise to ""well over two and possibly closer to 3"". Scotland has recorded a further 5,018 cases of the virus in the past 24 hours - a sharp rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. However, the number of people is hospital with the virus has fallen slightly to 573, with 40 patients in intensive care. Scientistswarned on Friday afternoonthat two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop you catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. And vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped - although not known - that Omicron may cause less severe illness on average than Delta, despite being much more transmittable. But she said that even if this is true, the surge in cases that was now ""virtually certain"" would still result in a ""massive"" number of people needing hospital care. And she said the numbers of people having to isolate after becoming infected, even mildly, would put a significant strain on the economy and public services. She added: ""It also means that the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure."" ScotRail has already had to cancel 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid, while many staff at an accident and emergency unit in Lanarkshire are also having to isolate after attending a social event and becoming infected. The first minister urged everyone to follow the existing Covid guidelines, and stressed that everyone who had been working from home at the start of the pandemic should be doing so again. No new general Covid restrictions for Scotland were announced today but Nicola Sturgeon has made clear these cannot be ruled out. The signs are that we may be headed towards some tightening. The request to consider deferring Christmas parties and the change to self-isolation advice for household contacts of Covid cases both point that way. The warning of a ""tsunami"" of omicron cases with the potential to put a big strain on the workforce, public services and in particular - the NHS - was an even clearer signal. The first minister has already said an extension of the Covid certification scheme is one potential option. The introduction of that approach in England is among the measures announced by Boris Johnson in his plan B this week. His plan B is quite like Nicola Sturgeon's plan A. But as Omicron cases rise, governments across the UK will be considering what further action may be required. Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish governmentpublished modelling,externalwhich said infections could rise as high as 25,000 a day by 20 December in the worst case scenario. The most-likely range of the worst-case scenario will see cases hit a little over 15,000 a day, while in the best-case scenario, cases will peak at just over 1,250. It comes the day after Public Health Scotland urged people to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of Omicron cases. Ms Sturgeon said she was focusing on work events in particular as they were resulting in rapid spread of the new variant which could pose a big risk to workplaces. She said everyone should ""be thinking a bit more carefully about unnecessary contacts, especially in crowded places"", and said people should use ""common sense"" in deciding whether to meet up. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she added. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with, make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand."" Scotland's National Clinical Director, Prof Jason Leitch, said incident teams around the country were finding evidence of big ""attack rates"" at larger work parties. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""This wave of a fourth variant which is worse than the three preceding it is coming. And it is really, really serious. ""The attack rate - the number of people who get it from every index case in an environment when people are close together - appears to be high with Omicron. ""We are really worried about events we have seen where there are 100 people in a room, and more than half are testing positive after the event."" The hospitality sector has already reported asurge of last-minute cancellationssince the advice against holding parties was issued. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation must be made available to affected businesses immediately, adding: ""We cannot see a repeat of March 2020 where the hospitality sector was essentially closed down without any financial support being put in place until weeks after the lockdown decision.""

Stephen Port police failings led to further deaths,"Stephen Port's victims (L-R): Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Jack Taylor and Daniel Whitworth Failings by the Met Police contributed to the deaths of serial killer Stephen Port's final three victims, an inquest jury has ruled. Port, 46, is serving a whole-life term for murdering Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor in Barking over 16 months. The deaths were not regarded suspicious until weeks after the fourth murder. The case was branded ""one of the most widespread institutional failings in modern history"" by the men's families. Neil Hudgell, a solicitor representing the victims, added: ""Our firmly held belief is that the Metropolitan Police's actions were, in part, driven by homophobia."" How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men The Met failed to carry out basic checks, send evidence to be forensically examined, and exercise professional curiosity while Port was embarking on his killing spree, the inquest heard. Port is serving a whole-life term for the four murders Port killed the four men, who were all aged in their early 20s, by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at his east London home between June 2014 and September 2015. He was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2016for the murders and a string of sex assaults. This video can not be played The sisters of Port's final victim blame police for his death Police refused to class the partner of Daniel Whitworth, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, as next of kin. Ricky Waumsley said he would have been treated differently if he was a ""straight, white woman"". Coroner Sarah Munro QC said: ""These inquests have, on any view, raised a number of serious concerns."" She added she would be preparing a prevention of future deaths report. This year already Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has been forced to make a series of public apologies following scandals: Forthe Met's inadequate response to two missing black sisterslater found murdered; fortwo officers taking selfies with the bodiesof those dead women; for corruption and cover-up inthe Daniel Morgan murder case; and after Met PC Wayne Couzens wasconvicted of the murder Sarah Everard. This year has also seen the force accused of institutional corruption, misogyny, racism and, today, institutional homophobia. The official graphs illustrating Londoners' perception of the Met show every line reflecting performance heading substantially downwards. A national poll by Ipsos Mori this week suggested the proportion who trust the police had fallen from 76% to 63% in the last two years. There have been more ""heartfelt apologies"" today, but sorrow and regret alone will not reverse the reputational decline of the force which pioneered ""professional policing"". The nine-week long inquests at Barking Town Hall were told police had ignored multiple chances to uncover that Port had been responsible for the first murder - Anthony Walgate, 23, in June 2014 - with the result being the later deaths were preventable. The jury found a murder team should have taken over that first inquiry. Referring to the inquiries made by officers in Barking and Dagenham into the deaths of Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, the jury said there were ""fundamental failings in these investigations from the beginning"". This meant Port was free to kill Jack Taylor, 25, a year later. The bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were found in the graveyard of St Margaret's Church The inquest also ruled the failings were by both officers in Barking and in the Met's homicide command. In written conclusions, the jury acknowledged officers had faced a ""heavy workload"", but said there were failures which ""cannot be overlooked"". During the inquests police admitteda series of ""terrible mistakes"" were made. Coroner Sarah Munro QC ruled out homophobia as an issue for the jury to consider Mr Hudgell told a press conference: ""We are incensed by the police's successful attempts to prevent the jury from examining whether [homophobic] prejudice played any part in the police's action."" He added that ""had the police done their job properly in the first place, Gabriel, Daniel and Jack would not have been killed and other young men would not have been drugged and raped by him"". Met Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball offered ""my own and the Met's heartfelt apologies"" and said she and Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick have offered to meet personally with the victims' loved ones to hear concerns. She said: ""We completely accept people's trust in us has been damaged by a number of recent events. This video can not be played Asst Commissioner Helen Ball described the jury's conclusion as ""a devastating finding"" ""What has happened in connection with each of the deaths of these four young men is part of that damage, and we know has a particular impact in communities local to Barking and LGBT+ communities across London. ""It is very important now to show that we are trustworthy, that we care, that we have changed, and that we are learning."" The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is considering reopening investigation into handling of the deaths. Although 17 officers were interviewed, 16 gave ""no comment"" interviews, submitting written statements instead. None faced gross misconduct charges but nine officers ""fell below the standard required"". Families pay tribute to young men murdered by Port Port case made assumptions about gay community The killer the police missed IOPC Regional Director Graham Beesley said: ""We are examining if anything was said by the officers who gave evidence during the inquests which could alter our findings and give grounds to re-open our investigation."" Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said some police officers ""have got to face serious disciplinary action"". ""Every single gay person who raised concerns about the young gay men was ignored, dismissed and treated with contempt, even the partner of one of the victims,"" he said.

The Monkees star Michael Nesmith dies at 78,"Michael Nesmith, singer, guitarist and songwriter with 1960s pop group The Monkees, has died at the age of 78. The quartet enjoyed hits like Daydream Believer and I'm A Believer, and starred in their own popular TV sitcom. Nesmith wrote numerous tunes including Listen To The Band, Sunny Girlfriend and Tapioca Tundra. In a statement, his family said he ""passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes"". Fellow Monkees band memberMicky Dolenz said he was ""heartbroken"",externalat having ""lost a dear friend and partner"". ""I'm so grateful that we could spend the last couple of months together doing what we loved best - singing, laughing, and doing shtick,"" he tweeted. Nesmith (right) and Dolenz (left) took part in a Monkees tour, which ended last month Nesmith and Dolenz had been on tour last month and the group's managerAndrew Sandoval said,external: ""We shared many travels and projects together over the course of 30 years, which culminated in a Monkees farewell tour that wrapped up only a few weeks ago. ""That tour was a true blessing for so many. And in the end I know that Michael was at peace with his legacy which included songwriting, producing, acting, direction and so many innovative ideas and concepts. ""I am positive the brilliance he captured will resonate and offer the love and light towards which he always moved."" Nesmith died from heart failure at his home in Carmel Valley, California, on Friday, a spokesman for record label Rhino told BBC News. The Monkees, with Nesmith (left), charmed viewers with their madcap TV sitcom The Monkees were originally put together for the TV show and found fame with songs that were written for them. But Nesmith, Dolenz, Peter Tork and Brit Davy Jones went on to take full control of their music. ""We were kids with our own taste in music and were happier performing songs we liked - and/or wrote - than songs that were handed to us,""Nesmith told Rolling Stone in 2012,external. The group broke up in 1969, after which Nesmith scored two US chart hits with his First National Band. He also wrote the song Different Drum, which became a major country hit for Linda Ronstadt. After filming a music video for his single Rio in 1977, Nesmith came up with the idea of a TV programme consisting entirely of promo clips. ""Audio records are played on radio, so a video record should be played on video - on television,"" he wrote in his memoir. ""There should be a broadcast component for the music video just like there is for records."" Nesmith called his idea PopClips, and later sold the intellectual property to Time Warner, who used it to develop and launch MTV. Paying tribute, Midge Ure described him as ""an underrated, talented musician, songwriter and video artist"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea,"The Chester Hotel in Aberdeen has seen 900 cancellations in 48 hours Hospitality venues in Scotland say they have had ""non-stop cancellations"" since people were urged to cancel Christmas parties. Public Health Scotland released the advice on Thursday evening due to the number of Omicron outbreaks. The first minister said at her briefing on Friday that she agreed with the public health advice. However Stephen Montgomery, from the Scottish Hospitality Group, said it was a ""heavy blow"" to the industry. In one case a hotel in Aberdeen told the BBC that it had 900 cancellations in 48 hours - one event had 263 guests drop to 18 overnight. They have had 3,000 portions of turkey on order for months and a fully stocked bar. They are now worried much of that could go to waste. Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron cases People urged to cancel Christmas parties in Scotland What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Speaking to the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme, Mr Montgomery said hospitality had been dealt a ""heavy blow at a time when we take 30% of our turnover"". He said: ""We weren't seeing many cancellations even whenever the new variant raised its head - a few but not many. ""But last night from the PHS statement coming out it was just non-stop. Personally I've been up until about 02:30 this morning answering emails, getting back to customers, members and general people who are asking what was happening."" At a briefing on Friday Nicola Sturgeon announced there would betighter rules around isolatingdue to the ""significant risk"" posed by Omicron. She warned of a ""tsunami"" of cases and said large gatherings including Christmas parties were becoming ""super spreaders"". ""If that happens lots of people get infected and if these are work events, as well as the risk to individual health there is a risk to the ability of the workplace to operate as people isolate,"" she said. ""So the public health advice, which I have no alternative but to agree with given the evidence of risk, is that we should all think a bit more carefully about unnecessary contacts in crowded places just now, that it would be sensible to defer work Christmas parties."" Ms Sturgeon said she knew this would have a big impact on businesses and she was pressing the UK government on financial support. By Connor Gillies, consumer affairs correspondent This is a difficult one for both business and consumer. There is no law to stop Christmas parties or office get togethers. This is advice. The key word is ""defer"". Public health officials have avoided specifically urging us to cancel our Christmas parties. Nevertheless, many people have jumped in to making decisions amid the Omicron threat. One business owner told me they were at their ""wits end"" and had been inundated with cancellations. It will be very difficult for people to get deposits back for gatherings which are now cancelled. It's a grey area. Businesses will have bought huge amounts of food and alcohol in preparation for this big festive rush. They feel this advice has dented consumer confidence. The law is much clearer if an organised event, like a panto or show, is cancelled. Consumers would be entitled to a refund. We're told ""if it feels like a party, then it probably is a party"". The onus is on us to decide. Stephen Gow, manager of The Chester Hotel in Aberdeen, said that when he left work on Thursday, one of the hotel's Christmas parties was due to have 263 guests - by 10:00 on Friday the number had dropped to 18. In some cases, he said guests were ""demanding"" deposits back and that cancellations would impact the entire supply chain. He said: ""The hospitality sector plans well in advance for Christmas and especially so this year when there have been messages about turkey and champagne shortages. ""We've had 3,000 portions of turkey on order for months; and that order is just for our banqueting events, not for our restaurant bookings. We have a fully stocked bar with kegs of beer which all have sell by dates. ""Our regular band is paid for their residency at our party nights. Our staff are all rota-ed for this weekend. The costs of these cancellations are considerable and for some businesses they will be overwhelming."" Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told the BBC that the Scottish government had placed another request for financial assistance for businesses to the UK government on Thursday. She said: ""I'm extremely sympathetic to concerns form hospitality. I've said I will do anything I can to provide assistance. ""But also within a fixed budget that does need to come from the UK government. If that funding can be made available I will do my level best to get it out the door as quickly as possible.""

LiveLiveUK Covid cases hit highest daily total since January10 minutes ago,"UK research suggests that two vaccine doses are not enough to prevent infection with the Omicron variant But the study found that a third booster dose does increase protection against symptomatic infection to around 75% Another 58,194 Covid cases are reported in the UK - the highest daily number since 9 January, when there were 59,937 The number of infections confirmed to be the Omicron variant has risen to 1,265 but the real number will be much higher Meanwhile, 10 Downing Street's Christmas party has been cancelled amid anger over a gathering last December But the PM has declared his full confidence in communications chief Jack Doyle, after it emerged he spoke at last year's event In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections could be looming It's time for us to wrap up today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal. Readherefor more details on where Covid cases are happening around the globe. Reality Check As we've been reporting, top civil servant Simon Case is to investigate allegations of government gatherings last Christmas - including two in Downing Street - while the country was in lockdown. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has been ""repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken"". But what is being examined? The investigation, announced by the PM on Wednesday will examine:  Case will look at the purpose of the events, who attended and whether rules were followed. No date has been given on when his report will be published. Take a look at how the row startedand what has happened since. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ex-Tory minister found to have raped wifeAndrew Griffiths used ""coercive and controlling behaviour"", a family court judge hears.","Andrew Griffiths resigned as minister and MP in July 2018 A former Conservative minister has been found to have raped and physically abused his wife. A family court judge concluded Andrew Griffiths, 51, pressurised Kate Griffiths, MP for Burton-upon-Trent, into engaging in sexual activity. Mr Griffiths, a former MP for the Staffordshire town, used ""coercive and controlling behaviour"". In July 2018 he resignedafter it was reported he sent ""depraved"" messages to two women constituents. The ex-MP denied allegations made by Ms Griffiths and ""adamantly denied"" rape. Judge Elizabeth Williscroft had been overseeing a dispute between Mr and Ms Griffiths, who are now divorced, at a private family court hearing in Derby. Ms Griffiths, 51, made a series of allegations against Mr Griffiths and asked Judge Williscroft to make findings of fact. The judge made findings in favour of Ms Griffiths but decided that they should not be made public, in order to protect the child at the centre of the family court proceedings. A High Court judge, however, ruled that Judge Williscroft's findings should be revealed, after it was argued by the Press Association and Tortoise Media they were in the public interest. Ms Griffiths had backed the move, which Mr Griffiths was against, and agreed to be named in media reports, even though victims of sexual abuse have a legal right to anonymity. Kate Griffiths was elected as an MP in November 2019 Speaking after appeal judges ruled details could be made public, Ms Griffiths said she ""welcomed"" the decision following a case that had ""taken a huge emotional and financial toll"" on her family. She said she waived her right to anonymity ""because I recognise the unique position I am in to campaign to improve the outcomes of cases such as this, for those who endure domestic violence, and the actions taken to protect the children involved"". Mr Griffiths - who used to be MP for Burton and the minister for small business, and once worked as former prime minister Theresa May's chief of staff - resigned over allegations he bombarded a 28-year-old barmaid and her friend with lewd comments over social media during a three-week period. He was cleared of wrongdoingby the parliamentary standards watchdog, which said it found no evidence. Ms Griffiths stood in his place as the Conservative candidatefor the area and was elected in November 2019. She announced at the time she was divorcing her husband. Judge Williscroft made a number of findings of fact - on the balance of probability - about the way Mr Griffiths had treated Ms Griffiths. The judge said Ms Griffiths had ""proved in her oral evidence to me"" that Mr Griffiths ""did rape her when sexual intercourse took place"". She said Ms Griffiths's allegations had been ""confirmed"" by Mr Griffiths's ""responses"". Ms Griffiths said rapes had begun while she was asleep. Andrew Griffiths is pictured arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice in London in July 2021 In the timeline of events relayed in the judgment, dates for the offence are not given. The judge heard that the couple married in 2013 after forming a relationship about five years earlier, and that Ms Griffiths had learned of sexual indiscretions by Mr Griffiths including a ""long affair"" and, with someone else, ""the sending of sexual texts"". The MP, who gave evidence behind a screen at court hearings so she could not see Mr Griffiths, also gave accounts of ""physical abuse"". The judge said she found those accounts ""proved"". Ms Griffiths had said that during an argument, Mr Griffiths knelt on her and put his hands on her throat, trying to strangle her. Mr Griffiths said no assault had taken place but Judge Williscroft said she ""preferred"" Ms Griffiths's account. The judge also found that Mr Griffiths had pushed Ms Griffiths when she was heavily pregnant. Mr Griffiths said in a written statement: ""I am deeply disappointed that the Court of Appeal has allowed the publication of proceedings in the family court. ""Whilst there remain legal constraints on what I can say, because the entirety of the judgment has not been published, I strongly denied the allegations put to me. However, the family court, which I believed to be private, made findings against me on the balance of probabilities."" He said his aim had been always to protect his child from publicity and he would continue to do what he could to ""repair the damage that publication of this case has caused"".

The judge said Ms Griffiths had ""proved in her oral evidence to me"" that Mr Griffiths ""did rape her when sexual intercourse took place"". She said Ms Griffiths's allegations had been ""confirmed"" by Mr Griffiths's ""responses"". Ms Griffiths said rapes had begun while she was asleep. Andrew Griffiths is pictured arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice in London in July 2021 In the timeline of events relayed in the judgment, dates for the offence are not given. The judge heard that the couple married in 2013 after forming a relationship about five years earlier, and that Ms Griffiths had learned of sexual indiscretions by Mr Griffiths including a ""long affair"" and, with someone else, ""the sending of sexual texts"". The MP, who gave evidence behind a screen at court hearings so she could not see Mr Griffiths, also gave accounts of ""physical abuse"". The judge said she found those accounts ""proved"". Ms Griffiths had said that during an argument, Mr Griffiths knelt on her and put his hands on her throat, trying to strangle her. Mr Griffiths said no assault had taken place but Judge Williscroft said she ""preferred"" Ms Griffiths's account. The judge also found that Mr Griffiths had pushed Ms Griffiths when she was heavily pregnant. Mr Griffiths said in a written statement: ""I am deeply disappointed that the Court of Appeal has allowed the publication of proceedings in the family court. ""Whilst there remain legal constraints on what I can say, because the entirety of the judgment has not been published, I strongly denied the allegations put to me. However, the family court, which I believed to be private, made findings against me on the balance of probabilities."" He said his aim had been always to protect his child from publicity and he would continue to do what he could to ""repair the damage that publication of this case has caused"".

Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron casesNicola Sturgeon says the new variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days.ScotlandComments,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland"" Scotland is facing a ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases, with the variant likely to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are only the ""tip of the iceberg"". And she predicted that a new wave of the pandemic was about to begin. She also announced changes to self-isolation guidelines, and urged people to cancel work Christmas parties. Ms Sturgeon said that, from Saturday, all household contacts of any Covid cases should isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status and even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Non-household contacts can leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and have had two vaccine doses. 'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister said early action was needed, with Omicron cases rising ""exponentially"" in recent days, and that she could not rule out further measures having to be introduced. She said cases of the new variant were doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic - which would potentially result in Omicron overtaking Delta by the beginning of next week. The R number - essentially the rate at which the virus is transmitted - has been hovering at about one in Scotland recently, but is now expected to rise to ""well over two and possibly closer to 3"". Scotland has recorded a further 5,018 cases of the virus in the past 24 hours - a sharp rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. However, the number of people is hospital with the virus has fallen slightly to 573, with 40 patients in intensive care. Scientistswarned on Friday afternoonthat two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop you catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. And vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped - although not known - that Omicron may cause less severe illness on average than Delta, despite being much more transmittable. But she said that even if this is true, the surge in cases that was now ""virtually certain"" would still result in a ""massive"" number of people needing hospital care. And she said the numbers of people having to isolate after becoming infected, even mildly, would put a significant strain on the economy and public services. She added: ""It also means that the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure."" ScotRail has already had to cancel 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid, while many staff at an accident and emergency unit in Lanarkshire are also having to isolate after attending a social event and becoming infected. The first minister urged everyone to follow the existing Covid guidelines, and stressed that everyone who had been working from home at the start of the pandemic should be doing so again. No new general Covid restrictions for Scotland were announced today but Nicola Sturgeon has made clear these cannot be ruled out. The signs are that we may be headed towards some tightening. The request to consider deferring Christmas parties and the change to self-isolation advice for household contacts of Covid cases both point that way. The warning of a ""tsunami"" of omicron cases with the potential to put a big strain on the workforce, public services and in particular - the NHS - was an even clearer signal. The first minister has already said an extension of the Covid certification scheme is one potential option. The introduction of that approach in England is among the measures announced by Boris Johnson in his plan B this week. His plan B is quite like Nicola Sturgeon's plan A. But as Omicron cases rise, governments across the UK will be considering what further action may be required. Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish governmentpublished modelling,externalwhich said infections could rise as high as 25,000 a day by 20 December in the worst case scenario. The most-likely range of the worst-case scenario will see cases hit a little over 15,000 a day, while in the best-case scenario, cases will peak at just over 1,250. It comes the day after Public Health Scotland urged people to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of Omicron cases. Ms Sturgeon said she was focusing on work events in particular as they were resulting in rapid spread of the new variant which could pose a big risk to workplaces. She said everyone should ""be thinking a bit more carefully about unnecessary contacts, especially in crowded places"", and said people should use ""common sense"" in deciding whether to meet up. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she added. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with, make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand."" Scotland's National Clinical Director, Prof Jason Leitch, said incident teams around the country were finding evidence of big ""attack rates"" at larger work parties. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""This wave of a fourth variant which is worse than the three preceding it is coming. And it is really, really serious. ""The attack rate - the number of people who get it from every index case in an environment when people are close together - appears to be high with Omicron. ""We are really worried about events we have seen where there are 100 people in a room, and more than half are testing positive after the event."" The hospitality sector has already reported asurge of last-minute cancellationssince the advice against holding parties was issued. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation must be made available to affected businesses immediately, adding: ""We cannot see a repeat of March 2020 where the hospitality sector was essentially closed down without any financial support being put in place until weeks after the lockdown decision.""

"'Sadistic' abuser jailed for 32 yearsAbdul Elahi targeted almost 2,000 victims, amassing images he sold to paedophiles.","This video can not be played Abdul Elahi tells police he targeted women who were in debt An online blackmailer who carried out ""sickening"" and ""abhorrent"" sexual abuse has been sentenced to 32 years in prison. Abdul Elahi targeted almost 2,000 victims to amass images of degrading sexual acts before selling the images to paedophiles. In some cases, women were blackmailed into abusing a baby or a sibling, with Elahi offering to pay off their debts. He admitted158 charges committed against 72 complainants. He will also be subject to an eight-year extension to his normal licence period following his eventual release. During sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court, he was described as being ""in a league of his own"" in terms of the scale of his online offending. The National Crime Agency (NCA) described Elahi's abuse as some of the most ""sickening sexual offending"" it had ever investigated. His victims ranged in age from eight-month-old babies to adults, it said. This video can not be played Abdul Elahi: Victim speaks out on abuse suffered Sentencing him, Judge Sarah Buckingham described the 26-year-old, formerly of Sparkhill in Birmingham, as the ""very worst type of predatory offender ever identified thus far"". The court heard more than 67,000 indecent images of children had been recovered from hard drives, with victims spread across 30 or more different countries. ""There is no conceivable way of tracing and destroying all the material you have spread online, causing ongoing distress to your victims,"" the judge said. ""The abhorrent nature of your crimes warrants an extremely long sentence for the protection of the public."" At the start of the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, the court heard Elahi used fake personas, including those of a doctor or a wealthy stockbroker, offering financial assistance and promising to pay off debts with Bitcoin, before persuading people to send him explicit photographs. So-called ""box sets"" of abusive images and videos compiled by Elahi were distributed in vast quantities, the court heard, after girls and young adults were blackmailed into providing ever more humiliating and degrading sexual material. ""Your demands increased in their viciousness, their depravity, even when your victims begged for mercy,"" the judge told Elahi. ""Even when you knew they were suicidal, you laughed at their distress and pain."" Abdul Elahi's sentencing hearing at Birmingham Crown Court took three days A series of impact statements were read to the court including that of one victim, a schoolgirl at the time of the offences. She described trying to take an overdose after learning Elahi had uploaded her images to Twitter. ""I would say for two years this person has ruined my life, I was heartbroken. I remember my 16th birthday, I spent the night crying, I was severely depressed. ""I am trying to move on but I find it very hard, I feel that this will be with me for the rest of my life."" Another teenage victim described feeling ""shaken to my soul and completely horrified that I was a part of this"". Tony Cook of the NCA said: ""Abdul Elahi is a depraved sadist who got sexual gratification through power and control over his victims whom he often goaded to the point of wanting to kill themselves. ""He has wrecked lives and families."" About 550 women and female children in Britain are believed to have been targeted by Elahi, who sold one customer more than 1,000 hours of videos. The court heard he regarded his crimes as a job. In interviews after his arrest he admitted to ""trying to make as much money"" as he possibly could. The Revenge Porn Helpline said it had been working with the NCA to remove the online content for more than two and a half years and had removed 135,000 individual images.

Cambo oil field development to be paused,"The firm behind the controversial Cambo oil field off Shetland is ""pausing"" the project, BBC Scotland has learned. Siccar Point Energy's decision comes a week afterShell pulled outof the North Atlantic development. Forty four contractors - 29 in Aberdeen and 15 in Singapore -  are set to lose their jobs. Its 37 permanent staff are not affected. The firm said Shell's announcement meant the project could not progress on the ""originally planned timescale"". Chief executive officer Jonathan Roger said: ""We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps."" ""We continue to believe Cambo is a robust project that can play an important part of the UK's energy security, providing homegrown energy supply and reducing carbon intensive imports, whilst supporting a just transition,"" he added. Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? The move has been welcomed by climate change campaigners who have long been critical of the project. Greenpeace called on the UK and Scottish governments to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure. However concerns have been raised about the security of gas supplies, and energy worker jobs. Approval from the UK government is needed to develop the field. Located in the North Atlantic, about 125km (75 miles) north west of the Shetland islands. Major stakeholder is Siccar Point Energy, with a 70% stake, backed by private equity firm investors. Siccar Point Energy says Cambo could deliver 170 million barrels of oil over 25 years, and 53.5 billion cubic feet of gas. The exploration licences dates back to 2001, but UK government must approve drilling - which could start as early as 2022. The UK government Department for Business said that while this was ""ultimately a commercial decision"" by Siccar Point Energy, it was committed to the domestic offshore oil and gas sector. Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" Responding to Siccar Point Energy's decision, Sam Chetan-Welsh of Greenpeace UK said: ""The economics of Cambo were looking decidedly shaky, and the climate maths never did make sense. ""Both the Westminster and Scottish government now need to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure."" Today's decision definitely makes it less likely that the controversial Cambo field will be developed but it does not kill it off. The critical move to watch is whether the consent application to the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is withdrawn. If it isn't - and the company won't confirm their plan - then it could easily be 'unpaused' at a later date. Even if it is, there's nothing to stop it being revived once the dust settles. This project has been a key test of the apparent contradictions of the UK government and whether or not is will support new oil and gas while also promoting a transition to renewables. Only they can kill it off completely. But politically they'll be hoping they don't have to make that decision. Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns Mary Church described it as ""another nail in the coffin"" for Cambo oil field. ""The UK government must officially reject the Cambo proposal once and for all,"" she said. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which has been campaigning against Cambo, said it was yet another signal that the project needed to be rejected. And Scottish Greens climate spokesman Mark Ruskell said it should not come as a surprise that Cambo was looking ""increasingly unlikely"". Activists at the COP26 summit called for the Cambo development to be blocked However industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo are still needed. OGUK's supply chain and operations director Katy Heidenreich said: ""Continued investment will be required to avoid increasing reliance on imported energy, protect security of supply and deliver a homegrown energy transition."" Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative spokesman for net zero and energy, said: ""This announcement from Siccar Point Energy is extremely concerning for the oil and gas industry. ""Without investment in these projects, we risk becoming even more dependent on foreign imports rather than making use of Scotland's domestic reserves of oil and gas."" And Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, said:  ""It's meant to be a transition to a low carbon economy, not a surrender of the national interest. ""The cheerleaders for Cambo's shutdown aren't just throwing energy workers under the bus, but also our security of supply for the gas we will still need on the road to 2050."" Shell had faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo. Announcing its decision to pull out of the development last week, it said it believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"".

Could Scotland see a 'green laird gold rush'?,"So-called green lairds invest in land to create woodland to offset carbon emissions A land reform campaigner has warned of businesses buying up land in Scotland to offset their carbon emissions rather than reducing what they emit. The so-called ""green lairds"" have peatland restored or land planted with thousands of trees. But Andy Wightman, a former MSP, said the practice did not go far enough to tackle climate change. Scottish firm BrewDog has invested in 9,000 acres, but said reducing carbon emissions remained its priority. The company said its Lost Forest tree-planting project was supplementary to cutting back on what it emits in the first place. Green laird is a term that has been used to describe a business buying thousands of acres of land to plant with trees to help it achieve net zero - a balance between the carbon emitted into the atmosphere, and the carbon removed from it. Mapping Scotland's urban land ownership The changing face of Scotland's landowners But Mr Wightman, who is supportive of tree-planting, told BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""Should we even be offsetting carbon emissions? ""We should really be heading for zero not net zero. Offsetting allows people to continue to emit."" Former MSP Andy Wightman has concerns about a rise in green lairds He added: ""Who gets to offset? Basically those with the deepest pockets - who can buy land and claim they are net zero."" Mr Wightman said there was ""substantial demand"" for businesses to buy land to offset their emissions. He said: ""This could be something like a gold rush because Scotland has a lot of land, it has a lot of potential for carbon sequestration."" Mr Wightman said there was the risk land prices would increase, and local communities could find it harder to purchase land for their own needs. The Scottish government-funded Scottish Land Commission, which was set up to reform land rights, encourage responsible land ownership and use and reform land markets, said private investment was needed if Scotland was to increase woodland and restore habitats. But its chief executive Hamish Trench said: ""I suppose the question is how to that in a way that is fair to everyone?"" He said some organisations had invested in community carbon neutral projects, rather than buy land. Scottish Land Commission has seen some high prices being paid for land and has commissioned work to look at what is happening in the land market in terms of values, transactions and the influence of carbon on the market. Lauren Carrol of BrewDog said cutting carbon emissions was the company's number one business priority Drinks producer BrewDog said it had invested in 9,000 acres (3,642ha) in the Highlands for its Lost Forest project, which involves peatland restoration and planting a million trees. But the Aberdeenshire-based company said its ""number one business priority"" was reducing its carbon emissions. Lauren Carrol, a director at the company, said it had already cut emissions by 34% by moving to the use of renewable energy, electrifying its vehicle fleet and using cans and instead of bottles for some of its products. She said: ""What we can't reduce we look to remove through various carbon nature projects, including the Lost Forest."" Real Wild Estates is a company set up a few months ago with an aim of helping landowners restore biodiversity on existing or newly bought land.

How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men,"Anthony Walgate Inquests for the four victims of Stephen Port have exposed how failings by the Metropolitan Police contributed to the deaths of three men. Port killed four gay men - Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor  - between June 2014 and September 2015. For the first time, during the inquests, the Met Police responses to the deaths were fully revealed. Here is the story of what happened. Anthony Walgate from Hull was studying fashion in London and occasionally worked as an escort. Using an alias, Stephen Port arranged for him to visit his Barking flat in June 2014. Port then drugged Anthony with GHB and raped him. He died after being given a fatal overdose of the drug. In the early morning of 19 June, Port dragged Anthony's body to the pavement outside his flat and used his own mobile phone to call an ambulance. He didn't give his name but told an operator that he had been driving past and had seen a ""young boy"" looking unwell. Port then returned to his flat. A paramedic who checked Anthony's body requested that police attend the scene. They arrived shortly afterwards with homicide detectives. Anthony's phone was missing, his underpants were on back-to-front, and he had bruising under his arms consistent with being moved by another person. The cause of death would eventually be attributed to a GHB overdose, although friends would tell police during their inquiries he was not a GHB user. This in itself should have been seen as critical. Anthony Walgate At the police station, a trace of the mobile phone number showed that the caller - Stephen Port - lived in the flat right next to where Anthony's body was found. Police visited him and he immediately changed his account of what happened. The bus garage chef claimed he had returned from a night-shift to find ""a male lying in my front door"" and had called 999. A police records check at the station revealed Port had previously been accused of drugging and raping a teenager, but somehow investigators on the ground did not become aware of this for several days. The case was then left with local officers from Barking, rather than being taken on by a specialist Scotland Yard murder investigation team. Anthony's mother Sarah Sak says the call she received from police was so brief it was like a discussion about a lost pet. She says police liaison officer, DS Paul Slaymaker, described Anthony's death as ""not suspicious at the moment"". But she knew this was wrong. ""It just started literally from day one. They just weren't interested - they just didn't listen to any of us,"" she tells the BBC. Anthony's mother Sarah Anthony's friends, who also realised something was seriously amiss, told officers he had travelled to Barking to meet a new client who called himself Joe Deen. Anthony had shared a photo of the man with them - and that person turned out to be Stephen Port. Port was arrested for lying to police about his dealings with Anthony, and was questioned at Barking police station - but only by a junior borough detective on his own. The killer gave a rambling and inconsistent account, ultimately claiming the deceased had visited his flat, died after taking his own drugs, and he only placed Anthony outside after panicking. At the recent inquests, the junior officer revealed that he thought Port had killed Anthony and that an experienced homicide team should have carried out the interview. At this point, DCI Tony Kirk, head of Barking and Dagenham CID, asked for a murder inquiry team to take over. He messaged a senior Scotland Yard homicide detective to say Port had previously drugged and raped someone and that, on balance, it appeared Anthony had died ""at the hands of another"". He added: ""I feel we as an organisation have a duty to his friends and family to get to the bottom of his death in what are increasingly suspicious circumstances."" The request was refused, but specialist detectives were sent to interview Port. They obtained more information from him, yet, according to details from the inquests, failed to follow a basic interview strategy or challenge Port on things he said. Unprompted, the killer revealed that he had previously been searched and questioned by police at Barking railway station after helping out a friend who was unwell. Officers thought this information seemed significant and left a note for the borough team. But nothing was done to establish any more detail and Port was released on bail. A police intelligence log, available on a national database, would have shown Port was referring to an incident two weeks before Anthony's death, when British Transport Police were called to reports of him assaulting an unwell man at Barking station. But a basic check wasn't made. Port had claimed the man had possibly taken ""G"" - a reference to GHB - and he had found him on drugs outside the flat after they met online.  It was not until more than a year later - by which time four men had been killed - that a murder investigation team traced the victim of the assault. He described having been surreptitiously drugged, waking naked and disoriented in Port's flat. Homicide officers now accept they would have taken on the case had they known about the incident. Months after Port's police interviews, he was charged with perverting the course of justice for lying about his dealings with Anthony. But nothing more was done to investigate the death itself - Scotland Yard's homicide division was not contacted again by Barking officers despite an order for them to be updated and consulted on developments. The inquests would also hear that, at that time, formal advice from homicide officers to check a laptop and phone belonging to Port was ignored. Had they been sent for forensic analysis Port's obsession with drugging and raping young men would have been uncovered. When they were eventually analysed the following year - after a request from a coroner - they showed that Port had persistently watched ""drug rape"" pornography. Even then, a detective failed to even look at the relevant sections of the forensic report. By then, police had closed their investigation. An interaction with a coroner showed the investigation's poor grasp of key details. DS Martin O'Donnell, who was managing the inquiry, told the coroner that Port ""stated he hadn't used escorts before and didn't know about the costs"" even though he had told detectives he used male prostitutes and had worked as an escort himself. Anthony's mother, Sarah Sak, was so concerned by the lapsed police investigation and unhappy with her liaison officer, DS Slaymaker, that she was forced to approach her MP for help. The killer had ""literally got away with murder"", Ms Sak says now. She believes detectives ""just couldn't be bothered"" to investigate properly. While he was on bail, Port went on to kill two more young men. Gabriel Kovari, a 22-year-old from Slovakia who was planning to work as a translator, became Port's flatmate in August 2014. He was killed within days. His body was discovered by a dog-walker in a Barking graveyard near Port's flat. Like Anthony, his mobile phone was missing and he was eventually found to have died due to a GHB overdose. Gabriel Kovari Police treated the death as unexplained but not suspicious. The resulting inquiries were shallow. John Pape, with whom Gabriel had lived in south London for several weeks, was contacted as his was the last known address. Pape said that Gabriel had headed east, but he did not know where. Detectives could have discovered that he moved to Cooke Street - where Port lived - if they had sought out a man who helped Gabriel move to Barking. The young Slovakian had sent his friend a map showing the new residence and several photos from inside Port's flat. In September 2014, three weeks after Gabriel died, the body of Daniel Whitworth was found in exactly the same spot of the same graveyard by the same dogwalker. Daniel, too, had died of a GHB overdose, and his phone was missing. Daniel Whitworth The ambitious young chef lived in Gravesend and had no connection to Barking. On him was an apparent suicide note claiming he had accidentally killed Gabriel, and had taken his own life as a result. The note had actually been written by Stephen Port, but police fell for his lies. Taken at face value, which the police did, since the note referred to an apparent homicide, Scotland Yard policy demanded a murder investigation team take the lead. Homicide detectives were consulted, but the death was never investigated by them. Again, the case remained with local officers. Their performance was a disaster. No forensic tests were conducted on items found with Daniel and Gabriel. Had they been, Port would have been identified since his DNA was on record. Police could have established the ""suicide note"" was fake if they had scrutinised it properly. It was not sent to a handwriting expert, despite promises being made to Daniel's family. His father Adam Whitworth was emailed a small piece of the note, with DC Yinka Adeyemo-Phillips of Barking police then telling officers that he had confirmed the writing as Daniel's. Daniel's father Adam But Mr Whitworth says he never confirmed it, and says he has ""no idea"" how the detective decided he did. ""She has done an abominable thing there and it's led to tragic consequences,"" he says. The note also stated ""btw please do not blame the guy I was with last night"". Officers failed to establish that person's identity. If they had, it would have led them to Stephen Port. Weeks after Daniel's death, his father was shown the full note by DS Slaymaker, who also worked on the Anthony Walgate inquiry. ""The first thing I said to him was, there's nothing in here that identifies it as Daniel, there's no names of anybody, there's no words and phrases that he would use,"" says Mr Whitworth. ""Slaymaker had an opportunity there in that room, when we was telling him our concerns, to put that right."" Detectives also refused to show the note to Daniel's long-term partner, Ricky Waumsley, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, after refusing to class him as next of kin. He says ""I felt like I was being put to one side and I felt like they were being homophobic towards me. If it was a straight woman who'd been found dead, and that was my partner, I think I would have been treated very, very differently."" Daniel and his partner Ricky Questioned about Daniel's whereabouts at the time Gabriel had died in east London, Ricky Waumsley checked his phone and told officers they appeared to have been together at home in Kent, far from Barking. This gave Daniel an alibi and meant he could not have killed Gabriel. But officers ignored this fundamental point. DS Slaymaker, was ordered to get mobile phone data, which would have shown Daniel's real location on the key date, but failed to do so. In reality, the victims never met one another. Mandy Whitworth, Daniel's stepmother, says being told by police that Daniel was a killer was incredibly distressing.  ""I don't think I can even tell you not only how angry that has made us, but how deeply that has wounded us for life."" Detectives also ignored a series of warnings about the two deaths being linked to that of Anthony Walgate. Gabriel's former flatmate John Pape and boyfriend Thierry Amodio both suggested there might be link, after reading an anonymised local newspaper report about the earlier death. But they were ignored. Amodio, making his own inquiries, ended up in contact with a Facebook user calling himself Jon Luck. This person appeared to know important information about the last days of Gabriel and Daniel and made alarming suggestions about parties at which young men were drugged and exploited. He was plainly a central witness. Amodio sent the Facebook account to DC Adeyemo-Phillips but nothing was done to investigate the account or the person behind it. It turned out to be a fake account used by Stephen Port to spread lies. Officers did not bother taking a statement from Amodio, who lived in Spain, and refused to keep him updated as they did not regard him as 'next of kin'. When Amodio resorted to emailing the local coroner for information, one of the leading detectives on the case - DS Debbie Turrell - wrote to her colleague that he was ""fishing for information"". Pape persistently contacted detectives to raise concerns about the threat to gay men, but he was totally ignored. In one email he wrote: I worry about what is happening to young men in Barking"". He resorted to asking LGBT organisations to contact the Met, but the force continued to be dismissive. The officer who ignored Pape's warnings was DC Jacqueline Baxter, who had also been appointed as ""family liaison officer"" for Gabriel's family in Slovakia. But she failed in her role by not making any effort to contact them. DC Baxter then misled a coroner's officer. In an email, she wrongly stated that ""uniformed officers kept this case as it was not deemed suspicious. She then named the wrong country by stating, ""I just dealt with the burial company in Lithuania"". The inquests also heard about serious failings by DI Rolf Schamberger, who oversaw the Barking and Dagenham Police team that examined the deaths of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth. He signed off a series of actions as complete, even though they had not been carried out, such as the crucial demand to obtain phone data on Daniel. DI Rolf Schamberger Schamberger personally prepared flawed reports for the men's first inquests, which took place in June 2015, giving evidence at both. He falsely told the coroner that a ""diary"" had been used to confirm Daniel Whitworth's handwriting on the suicide note, even though no diary was ever seized. Having been asked at Gabriel's first inquest in 2015 about a possible link to the death of Anthony Walgate, the detective said ""there was consideration given to there being a link, but, to the best of my knowledge, no link was ever established"". The officer, who has since been promoted, claimed at this year's inquest not to have known anything about Anthony's case at the time, saying it is ""hard to say"" what he meant in his answer back then. In 2015, Schamberger told the coroner that no testing had taken place on a bedsheet found with Daniel's body, contrary to a pathologist's recommendation, adding the ""circumstances at the time indicated towards no other external parties being involved"". He now says he ""can't really explain"" that answer, given the investigation had considered the possibility that other people might have been involved. The bedsheet was covered in the killer's DNA. Even before the pathologist's report on Daniel had concluded, the detective had written ""the investigation is complete and the report can be closed"". Jack Taylor was found dead in September 2015, slumped against the other side of the graveyard wall to where Gabriel and Daniel had been discovered. Like the other three young men, his phone was missing and he died of a GHB overdose. Like the others, he was not a user of drugs, meaning the circumstances were unusual. Jack Taylor Despite some detectives attending the scene who had been present at the earlier deaths, no connection was made to them. Officers decided Jack's death was non-suspicious. The Taylor family were briefly visited and told that Jack had died, but then heard nothing more from police. PC Jon Taylor, whose job was to patrol local parks, found out he was running the investigation from a digital crime report entry, rather than because anyone told him.  He was not a detective but had been put in charge because he had been the person flagged down in the street when the body was discovered. He asked for help from the local CID team - the same unit that had run inquiries into the earlier deaths - but a detective refused and stated: ""I deal with more protracted/unexplained deaths"". Almost a fortnight had passed when Donna Taylor, Jack's sister, contacted the Met, furious at the lack of contact. In that time Donna and younger sister Jenny had launched their own investigation, spotting the links to the earlier deaths. ""We should never have had to investigate and do everything behind the scenes ourselves,"" says Jenny Taylor. ""Why couldn't they have done that? Saying they didn't have enough resources or enough training, we've got no training, we had no resources, we had a laptop - that's all we had - and it makes us very angry."" The Taylor family kept pushing the police to do more. Jack's sisters Donna and Jenny For example, when police confirmed there was CCTV of Jack meeting a tall man at Barking station and walking away together, the Taylor sisters insisted that officers issue a public appeal to identify the stranger. At first, officers refused to do so, but relented following pressure from the sisters. It was one of the original Anthony Walgate detectives who recognised the tall blonde stranger as Stephen Port after seeing the appeal images on a colleague's desk. Donna Taylor says the Met ""didn't look into anything"" and have ""allowed that man to take three innocent people's lives"". Families of the dead men say the Met made false assumptions about their loved ones, with homophobia playing a role in the flawed decision-making. Scotland Yard accepts failing the victims, but denies that prejudice was a factor. Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball said: ""I don't think the Met is an institutionally homophobic organisation. I do think that we need to make a great deal of change to our investigative practices. We have done that - and people need to be reassured that we have done that."" Seventeen police officers involved in the original response into the four deaths were investigated by the police watchdog. The Independent Office for Police Conduct did not refer any of them for misconduct proceedings. Seven of the officers have since been promoted. The Taylor sisters, whose persistence led the police to the killer, say they will not accept this result. ""We've never gone away - the Taylor family, the Taylor sisters - will never will go away. We want to see people held accountable.""

Stephen Port police failings led to further deathsThe deaths were not treated as suspicious until weeks after the killer murdered his final victim.London,"Stephen Port's victims (L-R): Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Jack Taylor and Daniel Whitworth Failings by the Met Police contributed to the deaths of serial killer Stephen Port's final three victims, an inquest jury has ruled. Port, 46, is serving a whole-life term for murdering Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor in Barking over 16 months. The deaths were not regarded suspicious until weeks after the fourth murder. The case was branded ""one of the most widespread institutional failings in modern history"" by the men's families. Neil Hudgell, a solicitor representing the victims, added: ""Our firmly held belief is that the Metropolitan Police's actions were, in part, driven by homophobia."" How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men The Met failed to carry out basic checks, send evidence to be forensically examined, and exercise professional curiosity while Port was embarking on his killing spree, the inquest heard. Port is serving a whole-life term for the four murders Port killed the four men, who were all aged in their early 20s, by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at his east London home between June 2014 and September 2015. He was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2016for the murders and a string of sex assaults. This video can not be played The sisters of Port's final victim blame police for his death Police refused to class the partner of Daniel Whitworth, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, as next of kin. Ricky Waumsley said he would have been treated differently if he was a ""straight, white woman"". Coroner Sarah Munro QC said: ""These inquests have, on any view, raised a number of serious concerns."" She added she would be preparing a prevention of future deaths report. This year already Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has been forced to make a series of public apologies following scandals: Forthe Met's inadequate response to two missing black sisterslater found murdered; fortwo officers taking selfies with the bodiesof those dead women; for corruption and cover-up inthe Daniel Morgan murder case; and after Met PC Wayne Couzens wasconvicted of the murder Sarah Everard. This year has also seen the force accused of institutional corruption, misogyny, racism and, today, institutional homophobia. The official graphs illustrating Londoners' perception of the Met show every line reflecting performance heading substantially downwards. A national poll by Ipsos Mori this week suggested the proportion who trust the police had fallen from 76% to 63% in the last two years. There have been more ""heartfelt apologies"" today, but sorrow and regret alone will not reverse the reputational decline of the force which pioneered ""professional policing"". The nine-week long inquests at Barking Town Hall were told police had ignored multiple chances to uncover that Port had been responsible for the first murder - Anthony Walgate, 23, in June 2014 - with the result being the later deaths were preventable. The jury found a murder team should have taken over that first inquiry. Referring to the inquiries made by officers in Barking and Dagenham into the deaths of Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, the jury said there were ""fundamental failings in these investigations from the beginning"". This meant Port was free to kill Jack Taylor, 25, a year later. The bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were found in the graveyard of St Margaret's Church The inquest also ruled the failings were by both officers in Barking and in the Met's homicide command. In written conclusions, the jury acknowledged officers had faced a ""heavy workload"", but said there were failures which ""cannot be overlooked"". During the inquests police admitteda series of ""terrible mistakes"" were made. Coroner Sarah Munro QC ruled out homophobia as an issue for the jury to consider Mr Hudgell told a press conference: ""We are incensed by the police's successful attempts to prevent the jury from examining whether [homophobic] prejudice played any part in the police's action."" He added that ""had the police done their job properly in the first place, Gabriel, Daniel and Jack would not have been killed and other young men would not have been drugged and raped by him"". Met Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball offered ""my own and the Met's heartfelt apologies"" and said she and Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick have offered to meet personally with the victims' loved ones to hear concerns. She said: ""We completely accept people's trust in us has been damaged by a number of recent events. This video can not be played Asst Commissioner Helen Ball described the jury's conclusion as ""a devastating finding"" ""What has happened in connection with each of the deaths of these four young men is part of that damage, and we know has a particular impact in communities local to Barking and LGBT+ communities across London. ""It is very important now to show that we are trustworthy, that we care, that we have changed, and that we are learning."" The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is considering reopening investigation into handling of the deaths. Although 17 officers were interviewed, 16 gave ""no comment"" interviews, submitting written statements instead. None faced gross misconduct charges but nine officers ""fell below the standard required"". Families pay tribute to young men murdered by Port Port case made assumptions about gay community The killer the police missed IOPC Regional Director Graham Beesley said: ""We are examining if anything was said by the officers who gave evidence during the inquests which could alter our findings and give grounds to re-open our investigation."" Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said some police officers ""have got to face serious disciplinary action"". ""Every single gay person who raised concerns about the young gay men was ignored, dismissed and treated with contempt, even the partner of one of the victims,"" he said.

US price rises hit highest level for 40 years,"Maria said she won't treat herself to a bagel for a long time due to the higher prices American shoppers, especially those on low incomes have felt the pinch of higher prices, with annual inflation at rates not seen for 40 years. Thelatest figures,externalshow prices rose 6.8% in the year to November. Bibi who works as a cleaner in Harlem, New York, said she has had to cut back as a result, sometimes buying just one meal to share with her 27-year-old son. ""We don't have any choice,"" she said, ""I can't afford to cook."" ""I take a little bit then I give him more because a mother is always going to do that for her child."" Price rises have pushed up food shopping bills, and petrol prices jumped 6.1%, while the cost of second-hand cars and rent also rose. While the monthly pace of price rises at 0.8% eased a little compared to October's 0.9%, people like Bibi have felt the cumulative effects on their budgets. Patricia, who has just shopped in the local supermarket, said her bill is about $30 a week more than it used to be, so she's replaced chicken and pork chops with more vegetables, although prices for fresh produce are also higher she said. ""It affects me a lot right now, I'm not working,"" she said. Maria has just retired and said she's noticed that what she buys is not only pricier but often smaller too, especially the bagels. ""I'm not going to buy them again for a long time. They used to be big bagels, now they're smaller and more money,"" she said. Biden says US economy 'in strong shape' US jobs growth falls far short of expectations Prices for American consumers are rising at their fastest annual rate since June 1982. But the impact is felt more amongst those on the lowest incomes, with the least room to manage. Rising inflation is also putting pressure on President Biden as he tries to pass his $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) social spending bill. Some economists blame the president's previous spending programmes, designed to offer support amid the Covid pandemic, for exacerbating price increases. ""One of the major reasons we have inflation is because the government spent so much money,"" said Christopher Campbell, chief strategist at Kroll a risk consultancy, and a former Treasury official under President Trump. He argued that further spending could make inflation worse. ""At the end of the day we hopefully are on the tail end of the pandemic, and the government is still putting its foot on the gas, on the levels of spending."" However Claudia Sahm, senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute and former Federal Reserve economist said government spending is not the cause.  She said the reason inflation has persisted is because the pandemic has not been brought under control, affecting the supply of things like cars, fuel and food. ""The longer the Covid-related disruptions last, the more that starts to spread into the prices of goods,"" she said. She said with energy prices falling recently, inflation should start to ease. ""There are signs that we may be turning the corner soon, but Omicron is a new wild card."" In the meantime the poorest are facing both the end of pandemic-era extra support and rising prices. ""Food is a much larger proportion of lower income families' budgets,"" points out Christopher Wimer of Columbia's Centre on Poverty and Social Policy. ""Lots of people use gas [fuel] but in terms of heating and utilities as well as transportation, those costs eat up a larger share of low income folks' budget, than higher income folks' budgets, which might be driven more towards leisure, commodities and things like that."" Price rises are affecting some parts of the country more than others too, with the south and mid-west impacted more. Dare to Care, a food bank in Louisville, Kentucky, said it has felt the effect of both inflation and supply chain problems. ""Overall we're spending a substantial amount more,"" said Annette Ball, Dare to Care's chief programmes officer. Annette Ball said inflation is putting a squeeze on the food bank distribution centre where she works Usually a lot of Dare to Care's food comes from producers and retailers passing on any surplus they have. ""Right now that's just not happening - people want that overrun. There's demand in the market for that, so it's going out into the retail avenues."" Dare to Care has had to buy food at retail prices instead, and the cost of transport has risen too. ""Freight has doubled, even tripled [in price], in some instances,"" she added. As a result, Dare to Care has made compromises, like not including wholegrain bread or pure fruit juice as often. President Biden has pledged to make tackling inflation a priority and has made moves to ease supply chain problems, including changing rules for transport operators. But expectations are now focused squarely on the Federal Reserve too. Speculation is mounting that the Fed will reduce the bond-buying support it provides every month more quickly than planned, paving the way for a possible rise in interest rates next year. ""The Fed is going to have to move,"" said Beth Ann Bovino US Chief Economist, S&P Global ratings ""We expect them to now to speed up tapering and reach zero [monthly support] by March with at least one [interest] rate hike in 2022.""

Online blackmailer sentenced to 40 years in prison,"This video can not be played Abdul Elahi tells police he targeted women who were in debt An online blackmailer who carried out ""sickening"" and ""abhorrent"" sexual abuse has been sentenced to 32 years in prison. Abdul Elahi targeted almost 2,000 victims to amass images of degrading sexual acts before selling the images to paedophiles. In some cases, women were blackmailed into abusing a baby or a sibling, with Elahi offering to pay off their debts. He admitted158 charges committed against 72 complainants. He will also be subject to an eight-year extension to his normal licence period following his eventual release. During sentencing at Birmingham Crown Court, he was described as being ""in a league of his own"" in terms of the scale of his online offending. The National Crime Agency (NCA) described Elahi's abuse as some of the most ""sickening sexual offending"" it had ever investigated. His victims ranged in age from eight-month-old babies to adults, it said. This video can not be played Abdul Elahi: Victim speaks out on abuse suffered Sentencing him, Judge Sarah Buckingham described the 26-year-old, formerly of Sparkhill in Birmingham, as the ""very worst type of predatory offender ever identified thus far"". The court heard more than 67,000 indecent images of children had been recovered from hard drives, with victims spread across 30 or more different countries. ""There is no conceivable way of tracing and destroying all the material you have spread online, causing ongoing distress to your victims,"" the judge said. ""The abhorrent nature of your crimes warrants an extremely long sentence for the protection of the public."" At the start of the sentencing hearing on Wednesday, the court heard Elahi used fake personas, including those of a doctor or a wealthy stockbroker, offering financial assistance and promising to pay off debts with Bitcoin, before persuading people to send him explicit photographs. So-called ""box sets"" of abusive images and videos compiled by Elahi were distributed in vast quantities, the court heard, after girls and young adults were blackmailed into providing ever more humiliating and degrading sexual material. ""Your demands increased in their viciousness, their depravity, even when your victims begged for mercy,"" the judge told Elahi. ""Even when you knew they were suicidal, you laughed at their distress and pain."" Abdul Elahi's sentencing hearing at Birmingham Crown Court took three days A series of impact statements were read to the court including that of one victim, a schoolgirl at the time of the offences. She described trying to take an overdose after learning Elahi had uploaded her images to Twitter. ""I would say for two years this person has ruined my life, I was heartbroken. I remember my 16th birthday, I spent the night crying, I was severely depressed. ""I am trying to move on but I find it very hard, I feel that this will be with me for the rest of my life."" Another teenage victim described feeling ""shaken to my soul and completely horrified that I was a part of this"". Tony Cook of the NCA said: ""Abdul Elahi is a depraved sadist who got sexual gratification through power and control over his victims whom he often goaded to the point of wanting to kill themselves. ""He has wrecked lives and families."" About 550 women and female children in Britain are believed to have been targeted by Elahi, who sold one customer more than 1,000 hours of videos. The court heard he regarded his crimes as a job. In interviews after his arrest he admitted to ""trying to make as much money"" as he possibly could. The Revenge Porn Helpline said it had been working with the NCA to remove the online content for more than two and a half years and had removed 135,000 individual images. ""We hope that every person affected by this feels some small sense of closure today, we know that their priority is the removal of this content,"" said Sophie Mortimer, from the charity. Kirsty Nicholls admitted working with Elahi to make indecent images of a child and also sexually assaulting a child Co-defendant Kirsty Nicholls, 35, of Northolt, west London, who admitted working with Elahi to make indecent images of a child, was jailed for six years and nine months. Nicholls met Elahi on a so-called sugar daddy website, targeting financially desperate women. ""You committed these offences with Elahi - your offending was motivated entirely by financial gain,"" the judge told Nicholls.

"Ex-Tory minister found to have raped wifeAndrew Griffiths used ""coercive and controlling behaviour"", a family court judge hears.Stoke & Staffordshire","Andrew Griffiths resigned as minister and MP in July 2018 A former Conservative minister has been found to have raped and physically abused his wife. A family court judge concluded Andrew Griffiths, 51, pressurised Kate Griffiths, MP for Burton-upon-Trent, into engaging in sexual activity. Mr Griffiths, a former MP for the Staffordshire town, used ""coercive and controlling behaviour"". In July 2018 he resignedafter it was reported he sent ""depraved"" messages to two women constituents. The ex-MP denied allegations made by Ms Griffiths and ""adamantly denied"" rape. Judge Elizabeth Williscroft had been overseeing a dispute between Mr and Ms Griffiths, who are now divorced, at a private family court hearing in Derby. Ms Griffiths, 51, made a series of allegations against Mr Griffiths and asked Judge Williscroft to make findings of fact. The judge made findings in favour of Ms Griffiths but decided that they should not be made public, in order to protect the child at the centre of the family court proceedings. A High Court judge, however, ruled that Judge Williscroft's findings should be revealed, after it was argued by the Press Association and Tortoise Media they were in the public interest. Ms Griffiths had backed the move, which Mr Griffiths was against, and agreed to be named in media reports, even though victims of sexual abuse have a legal right to anonymity. Kate Griffiths was elected as an MP in November 2019 Speaking after appeal judges ruled details could be made public, Ms Griffiths said she ""welcomed"" the decision following a case that had ""taken a huge emotional and financial toll"" on her family. She said she waived her right to anonymity ""because I recognise the unique position I am in to campaign to improve the outcomes of cases such as this, for those who endure domestic violence, and the actions taken to protect the children involved"". Mr Griffiths - who used to be MP for Burton and the minister for small business, and once worked as former prime minister Theresa May's chief of staff - resigned over allegations he bombarded a 28-year-old barmaid and her friend with lewd comments over social media during a three-week period. He was cleared of wrongdoingby the parliamentary standards watchdog, which said it found no evidence. Ms Griffiths stood in his place as the Conservative candidatefor the area and was elected in November 2019. She announced at the time she was divorcing her husband. Judge Williscroft made a number of findings of fact - on the balance of probability - about the way Mr Griffiths had treated Ms Griffiths. The judge said Ms Griffiths had ""proved in her oral evidence to me"" that Mr Griffiths ""did rape her when sexual intercourse took place"". She said Ms Griffiths's allegations had been ""confirmed"" by Mr Griffiths's ""responses"". Ms Griffiths said rapes had begun while she was asleep. Andrew Griffiths is pictured arriving at the Royal Courts of Justice in London in July 2021 In the timeline of events relayed in the judgment, dates for the offence are not given. The judge heard that the couple married in 2013 after forming a relationship about five years earlier, and that Ms Griffiths had learned of sexual indiscretions by Mr Griffiths including a ""long affair"" and, with someone else, ""the sending of sexual texts"". The MP, who gave evidence behind a screen at court hearings so she could not see Mr Griffiths, also gave accounts of ""physical abuse"". The judge said she found those accounts ""proved"". Ms Griffiths had said that during an argument, Mr Griffiths knelt on her and put his hands on her throat, trying to strangle her. Mr Griffiths said no assault had taken place but Judge Williscroft said she ""preferred"" Ms Griffiths's account. The judge also found that Mr Griffiths had pushed Ms Griffiths when she was heavily pregnant. Mr Griffiths said in a written statement: ""I am deeply disappointed that the Court of Appeal has allowed the publication of proceedings in the family court. ""Whilst there remain legal constraints on what I can say, because the entirety of the judgment has not been published, I strongly denied the allegations put to me. However, the family court, which I believed to be private, made findings against me on the balance of probabilities.""

People urged to use Covid tests before going out,"The Welsh government recommends lateral flow tests are used before people head out of the house People in Wales going to Christmas shopping or to parties are being asked to take a lateral flow test to help protect others against Covid. The Welsh government is asking everyone to use the tests before going to crowded places or visiting others. People are also being asked to wear masks in pubs when not eating or drinking. The new advice comes as officials prepare for an expected large wave of cases linked to the Omicron variant. But the latest Welsh Covid review will not see any major changes to the country's regulations. Nine cases of the Omicron variant have been found in Wales so far, but the coronavirus variant is thought to be more transmissible than Delta, which currently dominates in the UK. Wales expects 'formidable wave' of Omicron cases Does Wales have its own Covid plan B? When should I take a Covid test now? First Minister Mark Drakeford appealed to people to take a booster shot if offered one. The Welsh NHS is expanding the booster programme to all adults in response to Omicron, with a target to offer everyone a booster by the end of January. Mr Drakeford said: ""Every single vaccination is a small victory against the virus - so please make getting your vaccine or booster a priority."" Lateral flow tests are available online and in pharmacies There will be no major changes to Wales' Covid regulations, with the country to stay under ""alert level zero"" rules when Mark Drakeford announces his latest coronavirus review on Friday. Instead, the Welsh government called for people to take a lateral flow test before ""going out"". It recommended using the tests before going to a Christmas party, shopping, visiting friends or family, going to any crowded or busy place, or before travelling. If the test is positive, individuals should stay home, arrange for a PCR test and self-isolate. Boxes of lateral flow tests, which produce results within 20 minutes,can be obtained online,external, through pharmacies and local collection points. Guidance on face masks is also being widened, and coverings will be recommended in pubs and restaurants when people are not eating or drinking. However it is understood the law on face coverings - which requires them to be worn in most indoor public places except pubs and restaurants - will not change. 'No immediate plans' for Covid passes in pubs Covid passes may be used to keep pubs open Chefs call for end to bullying culture and low pay There had been concern that Covid passes - which show whether someone has been doubled vaccinated or has had a negative lateral flow test - could be extended to pubs and restaurants. But that is not happening as part of Friday's review of restrictions. This video can not be played The Welsh government has asked people to wear masks in pubs and restaurants Earlier this week the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective urged the Welsh government to cut business rates for hospitality by 50% from April, as is happening in England. It had warned measures like Covid passports would lead to additional costs for hospitality businesses. Owen Morgan, owner of Bar 44 and Asador 44 restaurants south Wales and Bristol, earlier this week said his business had seen 60 cancellations, costing ""tends of thousands"". James Sommerin, who runs restaurants in Penarth and Barry, said he had his fingers crossed there are no changes in restrictions, saying it was a nervous time. ""We have two weeks left before Christmas, it's a big investment time for a lot of restaurants, there are plenty of parties and you've got to have a lot of stock in."" This video can not be played Shielders having to take safety ""into their own hands"" A woman who was told to shield at the start of the pandemic says the shielding group was being ""forgotten"". Melanie Duddridge, 49, from Cardiff, who has fibromyalgia and Crohn's disease, said she was still being cautious. ""There's nothing there now because shielding isn't mandated, there's nothing there now put in place to help us."" She is taking her own decisions for her safety and called on governments to offer more support. ""I've had issues with depression and loneliness because I feel like I'm possibly the only person making the kinds of decisions that I am,"" she added. A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We know that some people in this group are feeling anxious - the chief medical officer has previously written to those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and have been on the shielding patient list to give them advice about how to reduce their risks of exposure to coronavirus."" Welsh Conservative and Shadow Health Minister Russell George said he was pleased no major restrictions will be introduced on Friday. He added: ""We know vaccinations are the key to a society living with coronavirus, so it's vital Labour ministers now use this period to ramp up the booster programme to protect lives and ensure we keep our hard-earned success.""

Top court says Texas abortion clinics can sue over law,"The US Supreme Court has ruled that abortion providers can sue to challenge a controversial Texas abortion law. The law, known as SB8, gives people the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. In its ruling, however, the court said that the law can remain in effect, leaving it in place. Doctors, women's rights groups and the Biden administration have heavily criticised the law. The divisive law - which came into effect on 1 September - bans abortion after what some refer to as a foetal heartbeat. The law makes an exception for cases of medical emergency, but not for rape or incest. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that at six weeks a foetus has not yet developed a heartbeat, but rather an ""electronically induced"" flickering of tissues that will become the heart. The Texas law is enforced by giving individuals - from Texas or elsewhere - the right to sue doctors who perform an abortion past the six-week mark. At issue at the Supreme Court was whether two groups - Texas abortion providers and the federal government - can sue to block the law. Friday's 8-1 ruling means that lawsuits from the providers can proceed. With the decision, the ruling will head back to the district court. Once back in the district court, the providers will now be able to file for a stay of enforcement and ultimately challenge the law's constitutionality. In the meantime, the law will stay in place. In a separate order, the Supreme Court dismissed a separate challenge brought by the Biden administration. Who could be most affected by US abortion changes? In a written dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor agreed with allowing the lawsuits to move forward but was critical of leaving the law in place, saying that ""the court should have put an end to this madness months ago, before SB8 went into effect"". The ban has led to a steep drop in abortions, experts say. Research from the Texas Policy Evaluation Project found that abortions in the state fell by nearly 50% after the law went into effect, leading to an influx of patients seeking abortion care in neighbouring states. The abortion provider who brought the case, Whole Woman's Health, called the Supreme Court ruling a victory ""on very narrow grounds"". Its decision to leave SB8 in place, despite allowing challenges to go forward, was ""unjust, cruel and inhumane"", the group's CEO Amy Hagstrom Miller said. ""Our staff are heartbroken, scared and discouraged"". This video can not be played The impact of the strictest anti-abortion law in the US During a press briefing, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that President Biden is ""very concerned"" by the court's decision to keep SB8 in effect.""The ruling this morning is a reminder of how much these rights are at risk,"" she said. The Biden administration is seeking to pass legislation - introduced in the House of Representatives in response to SB8 - that would protect women seeking to end pregnancies and the right of healthcare providers to conduct abortions. It is considered unlikely to pass in the Senate. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion organisation that supports SB8, praised the Supreme Court for showing ""judicial restraint"" and dismissing the Biden administration's legal challenge and vowed to ""fight for this policy in the lower courts"". The group celebrated the law remaining in place but expressed frustration that the ruling allowed lawsuits to proceed. In December, the Supreme Court, which currently has a conservative majority, heard a separate case regarding a Mississippi law that bans abortions after the first 15 weeks. Anti-abortion activists consider the Mississippi case as among their best opportunities to overturn Roe v Wade, a landmark Supreme Court case that legalised abortions across the country. Why abortion rights in US could be about to change The 1973 decision gave women the constitutional right to abortions during their first 12-week trimester of pregnancy. A ruling in Mississippi case could mean that individual states can decide on the legality of abortions in their own jurisdictions. An end to Roe v Wade ""is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome"" according to Jessie Hill, a reproductive rights law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""I think the writing is on the wall here,"" Ms Hill said. ""The decision about Texas only adds to that perception. It was not a very favourable decision to the clinics."" In addition to Texas and Mississippi, several states - including Idaho, Oklahoma and South Carolina - have passed six-week ban bills so far this year. All have so far been stalled by legal challenges and haven't been put into effect. ""It's really unlike any other time in US history since 1973,"" Ms Hill said. ""To the extent that the Texas case provides tea leaves to read, they all point in the same direction."" This is a minor victory for abortion providers because it removes a hurdle. The unusual enforcement mechanism of the Texas law was deliberately designed to prevent legal challenges. The Supreme Court justices have now provided a path for the clinics to sue, albeit a narrow one. But the Chief Justice, John Roberts, stressed that there were wider issues at stake. He said the law was specifically crafted to nullify the Supreme Court's precedents on abortion, banning it at roughly six weeks of pregnancy rather than the court's standard of two trimesters - in effect denying women a constitutional right. And he wrote that the issue was not the federal right in question, it was that the role of the Supreme Court in America's constitutional system was at stake. Nonetheless, the conservative majority on the court refused to block the rogue law while it's being litigated. And it has indicated that it may roll back abortion rights enshrined in nearly 50 years of precedent in a separate case involving the state of Mississippi.

Beauticians break teen lip filler law,"Some beauty practitioners are illegally offering lip fillers on social media, the BBC has found. It isagainst the lawfor under-18s to receive dermal fillers for cosmetic reasons in England. This includes making an appointment or agreeing to undertake the procedure for underage clients via online sites. Following this investigation, Facebook says it has introduced measures which will make it harder for users to search for lip treatments. Currently no qualifications are required to buy or inject filler, which can add volume and fill lines in areas like the lips or cheeks. The age restriction was put in place two months ago to protect teenagers from an industrydescribed as the ""wild west"". Cosmetic doctors say aesthetic work for under-18s is ""completely unnecessary"" and can cause mental harm if things go wrong. Physical complications include infection, lumps, bruising, scarring and even blindness. The BBC investigated how the law was working by creating a Facebook profile named ""Jennie May"". It included a unique image of a 16-year-old girl generated by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) programme. Facebook says listings on its Marketplace must not promote the sale of cosmetic procedures such as fillers. But ""Jennie"" was able to contact more than 200 practitioners. The message requested a lip filler appointment so she could ""feel confident"" for her upcoming 17th birthday. While the majority of the 184 respondents refused the request, more than one in five who replied said they were willing to treat underage ""Jennie"". Responding to the BBC's findings, a Facebook spokesperson has confirmed ""search terms"" have now been ""blocked"" and listings which violate its guidelines will be removed. Minister for Patient Safety and Women's Health, Maria Caulfield, says businesses are legally required to check the age of their clients, and anyone found not doing so will face prosecution. This video can not be played Watch: Liv legally got lip fillers when she was 16 Shortly before her school prom, 16-year-old Liv legally got lip fillers. She had wanted the procedure for two years because she didn't like the fact that her gums were visible when she smiled. Like the majority of patients, she found her practitioner on social media - a woman who was offering cheap treatments because she was still in training. Liv says: ""It did hurt, but afterwards the practitioner held the mirror up and I loved how they looked. She said, 'you're going to be addicted now'."" Now aged 19, Liv doesn't think she's addicted, but she has visited multiple practitioners for more lip treatments as well as getting filler injected into her cheeks, jaw and chin. Some work was free or at a discounted price because she agreed to share her experiences with her tens of thousands of followers on social media. ""It'll usually be a lot cheaper and it's obviously directed at young people who probably have less money. It attracts them to come forward and be like, 'you can practice on my lips'."" On one occasion Liv was in so much pain that she cried and walked out of the appointment with filler only in her top lip. She says it is wrong young girls are being used as ""test dummies"" and she now will only go to qualified practitioners. Liv supports the ban, but understands the pressure teenagers feel to look a certain way. ""When I got my lips done at 16 it didn't feel wrong,"" she explains. ""You look at someone getting all these likes on social media and you think 'I'm going to make myself look like that because that's what everyone wants me to look like.' ""There are filters that make your lips bigger and change your entire face. I can laugh about it more now. But if you are 15, they are so damaging."" 'Outrageous' Ashton Collins, Director of Save Face, a national register of accredited practitioners who provide non-surgical treatments, says it's ""outrageous"" that teenagers might still be offered the procedure. ""It's either absolute negligence or these practitioners are completely unaware. Either factor poses a significant risk to anybody they treat. These people should not be practising."" Laura Trott MP, who successfully called for the law change in Parliament, agrees: ""This shows how necessary the law is and how important it is that we enforce it. There are individual, unscrupulous providers that we need to crack down on."" While under-18s are banned from getting dermal fillers or botulinum toxin injections - often known as Botox - in England, teenagers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are still allowed to. Practitioner Amar Suchde refuses to treat cosmetic patients who are under 21. Campaigners say the industry across the whole of the UK still has a long way to go. Analysis by the Department of Health and Social Care suggests tens of thousands of filler procedures were being performed on under-18s every year, before the ban wasbrought in on 1 October. There is no centralised data on complications, but Save Face says it has received more than 5,000 complaints over the past four years - and 70% of them related to fillers. Founder of AMS Aesthetics, Amar Suchde, believes mandatory training should be required for all practitioners, to ensure they are ""safe and ethical"". He has been injecting filler for nearly eight years, including 18 months of training. ""You need a lot of exposure and learning in this job,"" he explains. ""You could treat 100 people and everything is fine. But the day something goes wrong, you need to act immediately to stop things escalating. You soon realise how important it is to understand your anatomy."" Earlier this year, a BBC Three documentary revealed complicatedaesthetic procedures were being taught over the internetor on unsafe one-day courses. From May 2022,adverts for cosmetic surgerywhich target under-18s, will be banned across the UK. Other updates on the non-surgical beauty industry are expected in the near future in Wales and Scotland, while Northern Ireland has no current plans to make any changes.

LadBaby enlist Ed and Elton for Christmas single,"LadBaby have recorded a spoof of Ed Sheeran and Elton John's own Christmas single LadBaby are going for a record fourth UK Christmas number one in a row - with help from Ed Sheeran and Elton John. YouTube stars Mark and Roxanne Hoyle have raised money for the Trussell Trust food bank charity with their sausage roll-themed singles since 2018. This year's attempt is a cheeky version of Ed and Elton's Merry Christmas, called Sausage Rolls For Everyone. LadBaby could overtake the Spice Girls and Beatles as the act with the most consecutive Christmas number ones. The Beatles had three in a row in the 1960s and the Spice Girls achieved the same feat in the 90s, with LadBaby matching the record over the past three years. Sheeran was the last artist before the Nottinghamshire couple to have a festive number one, with his 2017 love song Perfect. The star said he was ""proud"" to be supporting and featuring on LadBaby's single this Christmas. ""All profits will be donated to The Trussell Trust, which is a very wonderful and important charity, so make sure you stream it, buy it and play it on repeat,"" Sheeran said. In a statement, Hoyle said: ""Ed and Elton are pop royalty and they've both had huge success at Christmas, so we're honoured and excited to be coming together to help families this Christmas... with the power of sausage rolls."" The charity song will be released on 17 December, but bookmakers have already made it odds-on favourite to top the festive charts. Allow YouTube content?

No clichÃ© is left unwrapped in this gaudily-decorated ode to gathering around the tree and kissing under the mistletoe. The video pays homage to dozens of Christmas classics from yesteryear, recreating scenes from Last Christmas, Walking in the Air, Stay Another Day and the David Bowie/Bing Crosby duet Little Drummer Boy. Released last Friday, it amassed 46,265 sales in its first five days and is almost certain to headline this week's Top 40. But can it withstand LadBaby's sausage roll assault?

Comedians Adam Rowe and Dan Nightingale have a running joke on their Have A Word podcast, in which Dan is told his wife, Laura, has left him. Dan replies with ""Where's she gone?"", with the hosts and their guests trading increasingly bizarre tales of Laura's suave new suitors and their globetrotting adventures. That, somehow, has become a song, written and performed by the duo's producer Finnlay. Presumably funny if you're in on the joke, it otherwise sounds like a Stereophonics b-side. Dan and Adam are supporting a good cause, though, with all proceeds going to ZoÃ«'s Place Baby Hospice, which provides palliative care for terminally ill children, and the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust.

Adele's comeback single has been sitting atop the charts for the last seven weeks, in the face of heavyweight competition from Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa. With streams of the album going strong, the track could hold on for Christmas - but a quirk of the chart rules might make that harder. In order to stop old songs clogging up the top 40, compilers have a ruled called ""accelerated decline"", which says if sales of a song decline for three weeks in a row, it needs 300 streams to count as one ""sale"", instead of the usual 150:1 ratio. Sales of Easy On Me decreased from 100,627 to 69,372 last week. If the trend continues, Adele will go into accelerated decline just in time for the Christmas chart. Even without that penalty, her current sales are no match for the 157,733 singles LadBaby sold in Christmas week last year, so her chances look slim. Bookmakers' odds:20/1 Allow YouTube content?

She's been asking for 27 years, but Mariah Carey still hasn't got you in her stockings (oh shush). But what she does have is the chart equivalent of Coca-Cola's ""Holidays are coming"" jingle. Christmas only really starts when her tinselled tonsils appear on the radio. A perennial presence in the Christmas top 10, itreached number one for the first time last year, only to be deposed by LadBaby before the big day. It's already in the top three this year, even though chart rules dictate that old songs have their streaming tallies halved when calculating the top 40. There's too much competition for her to reach the summit this year. However, she's all-but-guaranteed a top five finish. Bookmakers' odds: 33/1 Allow YouTube content?

Earlier this year, Wigan band The Lathums beat Drake to number one with their debut album, How Beautiful Life Can Be. Now, they're hoping to score a similar upset on the Christmas charts with their festive offering. Technically an anti-Christmas song, it's set at the end of the world, with frontman Alex Moore singing: ""Santa ain't coming this year / Your Christmas will be cancelled anyway."" Inspired by an episode of the BBC Two comedy series Inside No.9, the darkness of its lyrics are offset by a jangly Merseybeat shuffle.

This year, George Ezra has recorded a new version of Charles Brown's Come On Home For Christmas. Recorded in September, while wearing a Santa outfit, Ezra said the song's message struck a chord after the tribulations of 2020. ""Last year was the first Christmas I've experienced where, completely out of anyone's control, we weren't able to see the people we would hope to see.

Gypsy Pistoleros are basically the Flamenco version of Kiss - a sleazy glam-rock band wearing Day of the Dead make-up. Their bid for Christmas number one is a retread of Livin' La Vida Loca that trades the original's camp joie de vivre for dreary pub band clichÃ©s. The song's most redeeming quality is that the proceeds go to housing and homeless charity Shelter. An early publicity campaign helped it gain favourable odds, but with the video only attracting 20,000 views in the course of a month, its ranking has slipped.

LiveLiveOmicron surge leads to tightening isolation rules12 minutes ago12 minutes ago Key pointsKey points15 minutes ago STUC calls for furlough to return immediatelySTUC calls for furlough to return immediately21 minutes ago Briefing gives context to any future decisionsBriefing gives context to any future decisions,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warns that Scotland could be facing - and may already be experiencing - a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections The highly-transmissible Omicron variant is likely to overtake Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland within days, she tells a media briefing Ms Sturgeon says the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" She says there has already been an effect on the economy - 60 ScotRail cancellations have been blamed on mainly Omicron-related staff shortages New rules of self-isolation are introduced - household contacts of people with any Covid should isolate for 10 days, whether or not they are vaccinated She reiterated advice from Public Health Scotland urging people to ""defer"" Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases Ms Sturgeon says she will raise the question of financial support from the UK government in a Cobra meeting later BBC Scotland News  That's all from our live page today. Join us again next time.  The STUC reacts to Nicola Sturgeon's calls for home working. The trade union organisation says workers are being placed in an ""invidious position"". They are calling for the Scottish government to lift the burden of Covid safety from workersâ shoulders and legislate imminently if they
wonât. They are also asking the UK government to reinstate furlough now. STUC General Secretary Roz Foyer says it is ""all fine and well"" for the first minister to appeal to
workers to work from home if they can, but says she needs to be more direct. Ms Foyer adds that often employers refuse such requests and many workers are now worried about asking.  Once again workers are being called on make judgments on whether to work from home even where they know their employer will not be sympathetic. The first minister needs to instruct employers to comply and withdraw all government support from any companies that fail to do so. Roz Foyer, STUC general secretary The first minister ends by saying the government has shared today's information in an ""unvarnished way"" to try to give context to decisions which may have to be made in the future. She says they also want to underline that none of us are powerless to make a difference. She urges people to get vaccinated, test, wash hands, wear face coverings and increase ventilation. Asked about schools, and if isolation rules will see schools closed ""by the back door"", the first minister says schools must be kept open at all costs. She says that if there are cases in schools, isolating groups of children is about keeping schools open. If children end up sick and off school, this will lead to the closure of schools by the back door. She says the government has to try to reduce the need for further mitigations and that they cannot let the disease run. I can't stand here and say no class will be disrupted. I will bust a gut to keep schools open. Of course if there are outbreaks there will be a response but I am conscious of minimising disruption to children's education. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish Sun's reporter asks if there is any further evidence on how Omicron was seeded in Scotland. Dr Smith says he can speculate that the first case probably came from a Southern African country. He says the first cases were from testing after an event on or around 20 November and that the variant was in the country at that point. He says the exact source is completely unknown. And that Omicron's transmissibility means it had spread right across the world so it was inevitable that it arrived here. He says travel restrictions will reduce the speed of the spread. The Daily Mail question asks about planning social gatherings at home and asks if restrictions could be introduced on the numbers involved in household mixing. The first minister hopes that current advice will help to drive the situation in a better direction. She says we need to take things a day at a time and is asking people to do all the things she is asking to minimise the need for restrictions down the line. On the BBC Scotland programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says transmissibility of Omicron is clearly ""much greater"". She warns there is the potential for the NHS to be overwhelmed ""very quickly indeed"". Ms Baillie says that in the face of a serious public health crisis, the Scottish and UK governments should work together to make sure support is in place for businesses. She adds that the FM gave a ""stark warning"" today and was ""laying the groundwork for further restrictions to come"". She says she suspects the government will look at numbers mixing in households. The Press Association asks about the impact of Omicron on hospital admissions. Bed-blocking issues in Edinburgh are mentioned. Dr Gregor Smith says he is keeping a close eye on this and that with the size of wave he sees shaping up he has no doubt we will see a rise in hospital admissions. He says discussions are ongoing on how to respond to this and how to improve resilience within the system to cope with that. This may result in changes to services. Prof Leitch says there are two issues - the number of patients expected to come in the expected ""tsunami"" plus the numbers of health staff who may have to isolate. Bauer media asks about support from Westminster for the hospitality sector who are now faced with Christmas cancellations. He asks that if that support comes, how likely is the FM to bring back restrictions. The first minister says that re-introducing restrictions will be a ""last resort"". She says that because the Scottish government has no borrowing powers, she has to rely on the UK Treasury to activate that. She adds that there will be a four-nations discussion this afternoon and expects other nations to make the point about financial support.  On the BBC Scotland programme, Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane says he is very concerned about the variant. ""Our best form of defence is to ensure we're all vaccinated,"" he says. He adds that we need to do better in Scotland, to get more jabs into arms. He calls for mass vaccination centres to be re-opened. Asked about the impact on hospitality businesses of cancelling Christmas parties, he acknowledges that businesses will be struggling. He says if there are additional measures brought in which affect businesses then he would expect the UK government to provide more financial support. Back at the briefing, a question from Global asks about casualties of the pandemic from other harms including suicide or missing health screening or medical appointments. The reporter says people are ""terrified"" of a return to Covid rules. The FM is asked what she would say to put people's minds at ease right now. Ms Sturgeon says she cannot describe the despondency she feels at this. She says two weeks ago she announced that the vaccination certification scheme would not be extended because cases looked like they were on a downwards trend. She says she felt a sense of optimism she had not felt for a long time. But then within 48 hours it all changed with the emergence of Omicron. I feel that despondency, that anxiety and that fear of going backwards. But if we take the option of just letting it happen, all the harm will happen anyway because the weight of infections will overwhelm the NHS, paralyse workplaces and interrupt services. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister On the BBC Scotland coronavirus programme, NHS Grampian's Jillian Evans says people must ""absolutely"" change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus. Ms Evans stresses the importance of daily testing now, adding that the smallest encounter could create a transmission event. She says it's crucial that the spread is slowed while people get their boosters. Anyone who is yet to be vaccinated must come forward, she adds. ITV Border asks how people can celebrate Christmas safely this year. Ms Sturgeon says we should be mindful of which contacts are necessary. She says people we come into contact with may be infected with the Omicron variant. She adds that we should test every time we leave the house to meet other people. Dr Gregor Smith says that getting into the habit of testing regularly safeguards those we are meeting and ensures we do not pass the virus on.   A question comes from STV asking what changed to prompt Public Health Scotland (PHE) to issue guidance on Christmas parties. The FM says that in the days to come, advice will change quickly and information may come from different agencies as data and information is assessed daily and hourly. She says the doubling rate of two days is unprecedented and that they have to act very quickly. She asks the public to ""bear with us"" on the changes to come. BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke asks the first minister to provide a clear definition of a Christmas party. Ms Sturgeon says she is focusing on work events as they are resulting in rapid spread of this infection which pose a big risk to workplaces. She says the bigger the event, the more those risks are very real. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she says. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with... make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand,"" she adds. The FM urges the public to use their good sense when deciding whether to meet up. While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has put out anevidence paper,externallooking at the impact of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. It says Omicron is spreading at a rate that threatens a rapid and large surge of Covid-19 cases. Case numbers are higher for females for all age groups except the under 20s and
over 70s. The paper says it is likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation. It concludes by saying the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure. The evidence that Omicron is here and is spreading fast, and uncertainty over how it responds to vaccines and how much severe illness it causes, are grounds for concern about what might happen as it becomes the dominant strain of the virus."" Scottish government evidence paper Ms Sturgeon ends by saying this is not a briefing she wanted to deliver as we approach Christmas. She says the only way through this challenging period is by doing it together. She adds that even with Omicron, we know the things we can do to reduce the risk. She says that by sticking to mitigations we will be in the best position possible heading into Christmas and the New Year.  Ms Sturgeon says we face ""a situation that has no easy options"". She says any measures will cause social and economic harms but she says early intervention is the best way of acting proportionately. She adds that she cannot rule out further measures. Ms Sturgeon ends with a plea to abide by all the basic protections and reminds us to get vaccinated, to test ourselves regularly and when we are meeting other people. She reminds us to wear face coverings where required, ventilate rooms and stick to hand hygiene rules. She reiterates her call to work from home. She describes what she has set out today as ""grim"". Ms Sturgeon refers to Public Health Scotland's advice that work Christmas parties should be deferred, adding: ""There is a significant risk with Omicron."" She says we are ""already seeing the realities"" of the situation with parties or events with lots of people in attendance becoming super-spreader events. There is a risk to individual health and to workplaces she adds, referring back to the 60 ScotRail cancellations today and the Lanarkshire A&E department outbreaks she referred to earlier.

Ms Sturgeon outlines new rules around self-isolating. She says given that Omicron is becoming dominant, the rules must change. From tomorrow, the advice is that all household contacts of any confirmed Covid case should isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status - even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this is essential to ease transmission. However, some exemptions will be made for critical services. Non-household contacts should isolate pending a PCR result. If it is negative, they can leave isolation at this point as long as they are double vaccinated. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Covid rules to be reviewed twice before Christmas,"This video can not be played Omicron cases could rise steeply, Drakeford says Wales' Covid rules could change before Christmas after the first minister announced he would review them week-by-week. Mark Drakeford has held off imposing new restrictions for the time being. But he said ministers will be monitoring the situation closely if they need to put in place ""additional protections"" in response to Omicron. The change means there will be two weekly reviews in the run-up to Christmas. The Welsh government urged individuals to take lateral flow tests before going shopping, going to Christmas parties or visiting others. It alsoextended guidanceon mask wearing to pubs and restaurants, when people are not eating. Four more cases of Omicron were declared in Wales on Friday, bringing the total to 13, although it is thought there are more. Two vaccine doses don't stop you catching Omicron People urged to use Covid tests before going out Does Wales have its own Covid Plan B? It comes as the Scottish government warned of a""tsunami"" of Omicron cases. Mr Drakeford attended a meeting of senior leaders across the UK on Friday, at which UK Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said they were presented with ""very challenging new information"". He said the UK faced a ""deeply concerning situation"", with Omicron doubling every two to three days in England. Earlier, Mr Drakeford told a press conference Wales ""may be about a week behind what is happening in other parts of England and Scotland"". ""And that may give us a little bit more time here in Wales to learn and to act"". Usually the government looks at the rules once every three weeks. He said because of the speed things may change his cabinet would move from holding three-weekly reviews, to holding them once a week. Meanwhile, the Welsh Parliament has announced it will close the Senedd building and hold its proceedings virtually in response to the new variant. It is unclear what restrictions Wales will have over Christmas More than 1,200 cases of Omicron have been found in the UK, but the figure is thought to be an underestimate. Experts in the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) believe the variant will becomedominant by mid-December. On Friday, the UKHSA said two doses of a Covid vaccine were not enough to stop someone catching Covid. However, a third booster dose significantly increased protection to around 75%. The Welsh NHS is expanding its booster programme and aims to offer a jab to all adults by the end of January. Wales' latest case rate from 5 December stands at 504 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, a slight dip from the day before. Don Darch, 65, and Nesta Darch, 63, from Pontypridd with their grandchildren Berwyn and Heti People told BBC Wales of their concerns over Covid during the winter months. Lee Coburn, 46, from the Rhondda, and who lost his father Terry in March to Covid. 'I'm a bit apprehensive, the reason being I do have an elderly mum who's high at risk,"" he said. ""But also people need that time together with families, because it's been two years - so I think we could proceed with Christmas, but be cautious."" Mr Coburn said he was worried for what was coming after Christmas: ""because if people are going to be partying, not being cautious then there's a massive wave going to hit us just after Christmas in January, and we'll be all in lockdown then until summertime like last year."" Nesta Darch, 63, Pontypridd, said she would ""like to see perhaps more mandatory mask-wearing"". ""You mention it to the staff in the shops and they say we have no legal requirement to make people wear masks"", she said. Her husband Don said his family take lateral flow tests ""religiously"". ""We do them - my children are all teachers, I've got my 85-year-old mam who's housebound,"" he said. ""But the reliability of them, I'm not so sure. It's better than nothing, they do highlight some cases but I don't think you can 100% rely on lateral flow tests."" ""This is a very difficult balance."" So said the first minister in announcing no big changes to the Covid rules. It's difficult because there's an information deficit around the Omicron variant which makes it hard to predict its impact on the NHS in Wales - an NHS already under severe strain. But the first minister also said Wales ""may be about a week behind England and Scotland"", where rules have been tightened this week. With Covid reviews here in Wales now taking place weekly, the message looks clear - preserving the status quo this week is a long way away from a guarantee of no change next week. Mr Drakeford said there was still a lot that is not known about the variant, or how severe an illness it can cause. But he feared the speed the variant transmits meant it could infect large numbers of people, leading to an increase in hospital admissions. He said ministers would act early if data shows the variant is causing significant problems. But the first minister said he could not give a ""precise sense of what exactly would trigger action"". In the meantime, new guidance for visiting in care homes and hospitals is to be issued. ""We want to do all we can to support visiting where it is safe to do so but, if we see a new wave of cases, some strengthened measures to protect patients and residents may be needed"", Mr Drakeford said. Wales went into a stay-at-home lockdown last Christmas The first minister refused to confirm or deny a report in political blog Guido Fawkes that claimed he called for a lockdown between Christmas and New Year. He said he would not be drawn into ""distorted accounts"" of a meeting he had with the other UK nations this week. The account of the meeting was a ""gross violation of the rules under which those meetings are conducted"", he said. He suggested the motivation for whoever spoke to the blog ""was simply to cause a distraction from the many, many difficulties that the UK government has experienced this week"". Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the Welsh government had taken the ""right approach"" to the Omicron variant by not announcing any major new restrictions on Friday. ""I don't think any of us want to see restrictions imposed on lives, particularly at the Christmas period,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price backed Mr Drakeford's decision to hold weekly-reviews of the Covid rules. He also supported Welsh government requests for more financial support from the UK government if tighter restrictions were to be introduced.

LiveLiveOmicron surge leads to tightening isolation rules12 minutes ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warns that Scotland could be facing - and may already be experiencing - a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections The highly-transmissible Omicron variant is likely to overtake Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland within days, she tells a media briefing Ms Sturgeon says the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" She says there has already been an effect on the economy - 60 ScotRail cancellations have been blamed on mainly Omicron-related staff shortages New rules of self-isolation are introduced - household contacts of people with any Covid should isolate for 10 days, whether or not they are vaccinated She reiterated advice from Public Health Scotland urging people to ""defer"" Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases Ms Sturgeon says she will raise the question of financial support from the UK government in a Cobra meeting later BBC Scotland News  That's all from our live page today. Join us again next time.  The STUC reacts to Nicola Sturgeon's calls for home working. The trade union organisation says workers are being placed in an ""invidious position"". They are calling for the Scottish government to lift the burden of Covid safety from workersâ shoulders and legislate imminently if they
wonât. They are also asking the UK government to reinstate furlough now. STUC General Secretary Roz Foyer says it is ""all fine and well"" for the first minister to appeal to
workers to work from home if they can, but says she needs to be more direct. Ms Foyer adds that often employers refuse such requests and many workers are now worried about asking.  Once again workers are being called on make judgments on whether to work from home even where they know their employer will not be sympathetic. The first minister needs to instruct employers to comply and withdraw all government support from any companies that fail to do so. Roz Foyer, STUC general secretary The first minister ends by saying the government has shared today's information in an ""unvarnished way"" to try to give context to decisions which may have to be made in the future. She says they also want to underline that none of us are powerless to make a difference. She urges people to get vaccinated, test, wash hands, wear face coverings and increase ventilation. Asked about schools, and if isolation rules will see schools closed ""by the back door"", the first minister says schools must be kept open at all costs. She says that if there are cases in schools, isolating groups of children is about keeping schools open. If children end up sick and off school, this will lead to the closure of schools by the back door. She says the government has to try to reduce the need for further mitigations and that they cannot let the disease run. I can't stand here and say no class will be disrupted. I will bust a gut to keep schools open. Of course if there are outbreaks there will be a response but I am conscious of minimising disruption to children's education. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish Sun's reporter asks if there is any further evidence on how Omicron was seeded in Scotland. Dr Smith says he can speculate that the first case probably came from a Southern African country. He says the first cases were from testing after an event on or around 20 November and that the variant was in the country at that point. He says the exact source is completely unknown. And that Omicron's transmissibility means it had spread right across the world so it was inevitable that it arrived here. He says travel restrictions will reduce the speed of the spread. The Daily Mail question asks about planning social gatherings at home and asks if restrictions could be introduced on the numbers involved in household mixing. The first minister hopes that current advice will help to drive the situation in a better direction. She says we need to take things a day at a time and is asking people to do all the things she is asking to minimise the need for restrictions down the line. On the BBC Scotland programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says transmissibility of Omicron is clearly ""much greater"". She warns there is the potential for the NHS to be overwhelmed ""very quickly indeed"". Ms Baillie says that in the face of a serious public health crisis, the Scottish and UK governments should work together to make sure support is in place for businesses. She adds that the FM gave a ""stark warning"" today and was ""laying the groundwork for further restrictions to come"". She says she suspects the government will look at numbers mixing in households. The Press Association asks about the impact of Omicron on hospital admissions. Bed-blocking issues in Edinburgh are mentioned. Dr Gregor Smith says he is keeping a close eye on this and that with the size of wave he sees shaping up he has no doubt we will see a rise in hospital admissions. He says discussions are ongoing on how to respond to this and how to improve resilience within the system to cope with that. This may result in changes to services. Prof Leitch says there are two issues - the number of patients expected to come in the expected ""tsunami"" plus the numbers of health staff who may have to isolate. Bauer media asks about support from Westminster for the hospitality sector who are now faced with Christmas cancellations. He asks that if that support comes, how likely is the FM to bring back restrictions. The first minister says that re-introducing restrictions will be a ""last resort"". She says that because the Scottish government has no borrowing powers, she has to rely on the UK Treasury to activate that. She adds that there will be a four-nations discussion this afternoon and expects other nations to make the point about financial support.  On the BBC Scotland programme, Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane says he is very concerned about the variant. ""Our best form of defence is to ensure we're all vaccinated,"" he says. He adds that we need to do better in Scotland, to get more jabs into arms. He calls for mass vaccination centres to be re-opened. Asked about the impact on hospitality businesses of cancelling Christmas parties, he acknowledges that businesses will be struggling. He says if there are additional measures brought in which affect businesses then he would expect the UK government to provide more financial support. Back at the briefing, a question from Global asks about casualties of the pandemic from other harms including suicide or missing health screening or medical appointments. The reporter says people are ""terrified"" of a return to Covid rules. The FM is asked what she would say to put people's minds at ease right now. Ms Sturgeon says she cannot describe the despondency she feels at this. She says two weeks ago she announced that the vaccination certification scheme would not be extended because cases looked like they were on a downwards trend. She says she felt a sense of optimism she had not felt for a long time. But then within 48 hours it all changed with the emergence of Omicron. I feel that despondency, that anxiety and that fear of going backwards. But if we take the option of just letting it happen, all the harm will happen anyway because the weight of infections will overwhelm the NHS, paralyse workplaces and interrupt services. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister On the BBC Scotland coronavirus programme, NHS Grampian's Jillian Evans says people must ""absolutely"" change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus. Ms Evans stresses the importance of daily testing now, adding that the smallest encounter could create a transmission event. She says it's crucial that the spread is slowed while people get their boosters. Anyone who is yet to be vaccinated must come forward, she adds. ITV Border asks how people can celebrate Christmas safely this year. Ms Sturgeon says we should be mindful of which contacts are necessary. She says people we come into contact with may be infected with the Omicron variant. She adds that we should test every time we leave the house to meet other people. Dr Gregor Smith says that getting into the habit of testing regularly safeguards those we are meeting and ensures we do not pass the virus on.   A question comes from STV asking what changed to prompt Public Health Scotland (PHE) to issue guidance on Christmas parties. The FM says that in the days to come, advice will change quickly and information may come from different agencies as data and information is assessed daily and hourly. She says the doubling rate of two days is unprecedented and that they have to act very quickly. She asks the public to ""bear with us"" on the changes to come. BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke asks the first minister to provide a clear definition of a Christmas party. Ms Sturgeon says she is focusing on work events as they are resulting in rapid spread of this infection which pose a big risk to workplaces. She says the bigger the event, the more those risks are very real. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she says. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with... make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand,"" she adds. The FM urges the public to use their good sense when deciding whether to meet up. While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has put out anevidence paper,externallooking at the impact of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. It says Omicron is spreading at a rate that threatens a rapid and large surge of Covid-19 cases. Case numbers are higher for females for all age groups except the under 20s and
over 70s. The paper says it is likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation. It concludes by saying the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure. The evidence that Omicron is here and is spreading fast, and uncertainty over how it responds to vaccines and how much severe illness it causes, are grounds for concern about what might happen as it becomes the dominant strain of the virus."" Scottish government evidence paper Ms Sturgeon ends by saying this is not a briefing she wanted to deliver as we approach Christmas. She says the only way through this challenging period is by doing it together. She adds that even with Omicron, we know the things we can do to reduce the risk. She says that by sticking to mitigations we will be in the best position possible heading into Christmas and the New Year.  Ms Sturgeon says we face ""a situation that has no easy options"". She says any measures will cause social and economic harms but she says early intervention is the best way of acting proportionately. She adds that she cannot rule out further measures. Ms Sturgeon ends with a plea to abide by all the basic protections and reminds us to get vaccinated, to test ourselves regularly and when we are meeting other people. She reminds us to wear face coverings where required, ventilate rooms and stick to hand hygiene rules. She reiterates her call to work from home. She describes what she has set out today as ""grim"". Ms Sturgeon refers to Public Health Scotland's advice that work Christmas parties should be deferred, adding: ""There is a significant risk with Omicron."" She says we are ""already seeing the realities"" of the situation with parties or events with lots of people in attendance becoming super-spreader events. There is a risk to individual health and to workplaces she adds, referring back to the 60 ScotRail cancellations today and the Lanarkshire A&E department outbreaks she referred to earlier.

Ms Sturgeon outlines new rules around self-isolating. She says given that Omicron is becoming dominant, the rules must change. From tomorrow, the advice is that all household contacts of any confirmed Covid case should isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status - even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this is essential to ease transmission. However, some exemptions will be made for critical services. Non-household contacts should isolate pending a PCR result.

Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron casesNicola Sturgeon says the new variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days.,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland"" Scotland is facing a ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases, with the variant likely to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are only the ""tip of the iceberg"". And she predicted that a new wave of the pandemic was about to begin. She also announced changes to self-isolation guidelines, and urged people to cancel work Christmas parties. Ms Sturgeon said that, from Saturday, all household contacts of any Covid cases should isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status and even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Non-household contacts can leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and have had two vaccine doses. 'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister said early action was needed, with Omicron cases rising ""exponentially"" in recent days, and that she could not rule out further measures having to be introduced. She said cases of the new variant were doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic - which would potentially result in Omicron overtaking Delta by the beginning of next week. The R number - essentially the rate at which the virus is transmitted - has been hovering at about one in Scotland recently, but is now expected to rise to ""well over two and possibly closer to 3"". Scotland has recorded a further 5,018 cases of the virus in the past 24 hours - a sharp rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. However, the number of people is hospital with the virus has fallen slightly to 573, with 40 patients in intensive care. Scientistswarned on Friday afternoonthat two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop you catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. And vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped - although not known - that Omicron may cause less severe illness on average than Delta, despite being much more transmittable. But she said that even if this is true, the surge in cases that was now ""virtually certain"" would still result in a ""massive"" number of people needing hospital care. And she said the numbers of people having to isolate after becoming infected, even mildly, would put a significant strain on the economy and public services. She added: ""It also means that the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure."" ScotRail has already had to cancel 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid, while many staff at an accident and emergency unit in Lanarkshire are also having to isolate after attending a social event and becoming infected. The first minister urged everyone to follow the existing Covid guidelines, and stressed that everyone who had been working from home at the start of the pandemic should be doing so again. No new general Covid restrictions for Scotland were announced today but Nicola Sturgeon has made clear these cannot be ruled out. The signs are that we may be headed towards some tightening. The request to consider deferring Christmas parties and the change to self-isolation advice for household contacts of Covid cases both point that way. The warning of a ""tsunami"" of omicron cases with the potential to put a big strain on the workforce, public services and in particular - the NHS - was an even clearer signal. The first minister has already said an extension of the Covid certification scheme is one potential option. The introduction of that approach in England is among the measures announced by Boris Johnson in his plan B this week. His plan B is quite like Nicola Sturgeon's plan A. But as Omicron cases rise, governments across the UK will be considering what further action may be required. Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish governmentpublished modelling,externalwhich said infections could rise as high as 25,000 a day by 20 December in the worst case scenario. The most-likely range of the worst-case scenario will see cases hit a little over 15,000 a day, while in the best-case scenario, cases will peak at just over 1,250. It comes the day after Public Health Scotland urged people to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of Omicron cases. Ms Sturgeon said she was focusing on work events in particular as they were resulting in rapid spread of the new variant which could pose a big risk to workplaces. She said everyone should ""be thinking a bit more carefully about unnecessary contacts, especially in crowded places"", and said people should use ""common sense"" in deciding whether to meet up. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she added. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with, make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand."" Scotland's National Clinical Director, Prof Jason Leitch, said incident teams around the country were finding evidence of big ""attack rates"" at larger work parties. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""This wave of a fourth variant which is worse than the three preceding it is coming. And it is really, really serious. ""The attack rate - the number of people who get it from every index case in an environment when people are close together - appears to be high with Omicron. ""We are really worried about events we have seen where there are 100 people in a room, and more than half are testing positive after the event."" The hospitality sector has already reported asurge of last-minute cancellationssince the advice against holding parties was issued. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation must be made available to affected businesses immediately, adding: ""We cannot see a repeat of March 2020 where the hospitality sector was essentially closed down without any financial support being put in place until weeks after the lockdown decision.""

LiveLivePM: I support press chief amid Christmas party row9 minutes ago,"UK research suggests that two vaccine doses are not enough to prevent infection with the Omicron variant But the study found that a third booster dose does increase protection against symptomatic infection to around 75% Another 58,194 Covid cases are reported in the UK - the highest daily number since 9 January, when there were 59,937 The number of infections confirmed to be the Omicron variant has risen to 1,265 but the real number will be much higher Meanwhile, 10 Downing Street's Christmas party has been cancelled amid anger over a gathering last December But the PM has declared his full confidence in communications chief Jack Doyle, after it emerged he spoke at last year's event In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections could be looming It's time for us to wrap up today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections.

Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron casesNicola Sturgeon says the new variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days.Scotland,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""Omicron is going to very quickly overtake Delta as the dominant Covid strain in Scotland"" Scotland is facing a ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases, with the variant likely to replace Delta as the dominant form of the virus within days, Nicola Sturgeon has warned. The first minister said the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are only the ""tip of the iceberg"". And she predicted that a new wave of the pandemic was about to begin. She also announced changes to self-isolation guidelines, and urged people to cancel work Christmas parties. Ms Sturgeon said that, from Saturday, all household contacts of any Covid cases should isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status and even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Non-household contacts can leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and have had two vaccine doses. 'Non-stop cancellations' after Christmas party plea Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? What are the Covid rules in Scotland? The first minister said early action was needed, with Omicron cases rising ""exponentially"" in recent days, and that she could not rule out further measures having to be introduced. She said cases of the new variant were doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic - which would potentially result in Omicron overtaking Delta by the beginning of next week. The R number - essentially the rate at which the virus is transmitted - has been hovering at about one in Scotland recently, but is now expected to rise to ""well over two and possibly closer to 3"". Scotland has recorded a further 5,018 cases of the virus in the past 24 hours - a sharp rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. However, the number of people is hospital with the virus has fallen slightly to 573, with 40 patients in intensive care. Scientistswarned on Friday afternoonthat two doses of a Covid vaccine are not enough to stop you catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. And vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment. Ms Sturgeon said it was hoped - although not known - that Omicron may cause less severe illness on average than Delta, despite being much more transmittable. But she said that even if this is true, the surge in cases that was now ""virtually certain"" would still result in a ""massive"" number of people needing hospital care. And she said the numbers of people having to isolate after becoming infected, even mildly, would put a significant strain on the economy and public services. She added: ""It also means that the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure."" ScotRail has already had to cancel 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid, while many staff at an accident and emergency unit in Lanarkshire are also having to isolate after attending a social event and becoming infected. The first minister urged everyone to follow the existing Covid guidelines, and stressed that everyone who had been working from home at the start of the pandemic should be doing so again. No new general Covid restrictions for Scotland were announced today but Nicola Sturgeon has made clear these cannot be ruled out. The signs are that we may be headed towards some tightening. The request to consider deferring Christmas parties and the change to self-isolation advice for household contacts of Covid cases both point that way. The warning of a ""tsunami"" of omicron cases with the potential to put a big strain on the workforce, public services and in particular - the NHS - was an even clearer signal. The first minister has already said an extension of the Covid certification scheme is one potential option. The introduction of that approach in England is among the measures announced by Boris Johnson in his plan B this week. His plan B is quite like Nicola Sturgeon's plan A. But as Omicron cases rise, governments across the UK will be considering what further action may be required. Ms Sturgeon was speaking as the Scottish governmentpublished modelling,externalwhich said infections could rise as high as 25,000 a day by 20 December in the worst case scenario. The most-likely range of the worst-case scenario will see cases hit a little over 15,000 a day, while in the best-case scenario, cases will peak at just over 1,250. It comes the day after Public Health Scotland urged people to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of Omicron cases. Ms Sturgeon said she was focusing on work events in particular as they were resulting in rapid spread of the new variant which could pose a big risk to workplaces. She said everyone should ""be thinking a bit more carefully about unnecessary contacts, especially in crowded places"", and said people should use ""common sense"" in deciding whether to meet up. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she added. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with, make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand."" Scotland's National Clinical Director, Prof Jason Leitch, said incident teams around the country were finding evidence of big ""attack rates"" at larger work parties. He toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""This wave of a fourth variant which is worse than the three preceding it is coming. And it is really, really serious. ""The attack rate - the number of people who get it from every index case in an environment when people are close together - appears to be high with Omicron. ""We are really worried about events we have seen where there are 100 people in a room, and more than half are testing positive after the event."" The hospitality sector has already reported asurge of last-minute cancellationssince the advice against holding parties was issued. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation must be made available to affected businesses immediately, adding: ""We cannot see a repeat of March 2020 where the hospitality sector was essentially closed down without any financial support being put in place until weeks after the lockdown decision.""

LiveLivePM: I support press chief amid Christmas party row3 minutes ago,"UK research suggests that two vaccine doses are not enough to prevent infection with the Omicron variant But the study found that a third booster dose does increase protection against symptomatic infection to around 75% Another 58,194 Covid cases are reported in the UK - the highest daily number since 9 January, when there were 59,937 The number of infections confirmed to be the Omicron variant has risen to 1,265 but the real number will be much higher Meanwhile, 10 Downing Street's Christmas party has been cancelled amid anger over a gathering last December But the PM has declared his full confidence in communications chief Jack Doyle, after it emerged he spoke at last year's event In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections could be looming It's time for us to wrap up today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab?

"PM's press chief spoke at No 10 party last yearJack Doyle gave a speech and handed out awards at the gathering on 18 December, it is understood.UK Politics","The PM's press chief addressed staff and gave out awards at a Downing Street party last Christmas that is now under investigation, it is understood. Jack Doyle, then deputy communications director, gave a speech to between 20 and 30 people at the 18 December event. A source has told the BBC there were food, drinks and games at the event. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""not fit for office"" and it was important to ""get to the bottom of this"". But Downing Street said: ""There is an ongoing review, and we won't be commenting further while that is the case."" This 18 December event is one of three government staff gatherings from last year now being investigated by the UK's top civil servant, Simon Case, for possible breaches of Covid rules. The others are a No 10 staff event on 27 November last year and a gathering at the Department of Education event on 10 December. The inquiry could be widened out if it considered there are credible allegations about other events. Which parties are being investigated? What were the rules on Christmas parties? Education department chief admits December party Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she did not hold a Christmas party last year, when she was international trade secretary, as she had been too ""busy"". ""We had a lot of deals to get done by 31 December, so that was my focus,"" she told the BBC'sPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinsonpodcast. The revelation of Mr Doyle's speech at the Downing Street gathering follows an arduous few days for the government, during which time it has been accused by Labour of not being honest over this and other events. ITV News, whichfirst reported,externalthat Mr Doyle had been present at the 18 December party, said he had also handed out award certificates to staff. The event took place two days after London went into Tier 3 lockdown restrictions, meaning people were told not to mix indoors with anyone outside their household or support bubble. No 10 has refused to explain how the party complied with the restrictions. The former Daily Mail political reporter became the prime minister's press secretary in 2020 He was promoted to Downing Street director of communications in April this year He is not the PM's official spokesman - but is in charge of how the government gets its message across to the media It is the role held by Alastair Campbell, when Labour was in power Mr Doyle earns between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999 a year On Wednesday, the prime minister told the Commons he had been ""repeatedly assured"" that there had been no party and that no Covid rules had been broken on that date. The government's chief whip Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham that Mr Johnson ""will not have lied"" about any parties that took place on Downing Street last year. He added that the 18 December event had been a ""meeting"" rather than a social get-together, and that staff had discussed how to deal with coronavirus. But Sir Keir, speaking during a visit to Northumberland, said: ""It's absolutely important that we get to the bottom of this. ""This is just the latest allegation of dishonesty from the prime minister. We've had lie upon lie in relation to the parties going on in Downing Street. The prime minister is not fit for office."" This video can not be played Newscastâs take on the No 10 Christmas party fallout Government adviser Allegra Strattonquit her post on Wednesday after a backlash over a video she appeared in from last December, in which she joked about a Christmas party. Before her resignation, Mr Johnson told MPs that he was ""furious"" about the clip, obtained by ITV News, and was launching an investigation into whether Covid rules had been broken. Sources in Westminster are questioning whether it's possible for Jack Doyle to stay in his job. In part that's because one of the problems this week for No 10 has been their efforts to deny and explain what did or didn't happen. Ministers, and the prime minister himself, have been stuck in the Kafka-esque position of saying that they are sure no rules were broken, but they also don't know what went on. If they don't know what happened, how can they be sure that nothing went wrong? And if multiple sources have said there was a gathering of several dozen people, and people who were not on the Downing Street payroll had been invited, how can that have been just a few work drinks at the desk in a Covid-secure office? Read Laura's blog in full Meanwhile, Lord Geidt, the prime minister's standards adviser, is unhappy about the contents of an Electoral Commission report into the funding of refurbishments to the Downing Street flat but is not ready to resign over it, the BBC understands. Labour says the report shows Mr Johnson lied to Lord Geidt when he investigated the PM's conduct earlier this year, something denied by Downing Street. Labour has written to Lord Geidt, asking him to reinvestigate. Mr Johnson is also facing a rebellion from Conservative MPs over his plans announced on Wednesday to introducetighter Covid curbs in Englandto tackle the Omicron variant. Dozens of Tories have hit out at extra restrictions ahead of a vote next week, particularly the plans for mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs and large events. Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said the mood in the Conservative Party was ""sulphurous"", adding: ""What we need now is a bit of grip from No 10."" Business minister Paul Scully told BBC Breakfast it had been a ""difficult week for the government"" and that it had not ""been able to get across"" policies it had announced to deal with Covid and the economy.

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

Omicron surge leads to tightening isolation rules,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warns that Scotland could be facing - and may already be experiencing - a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections The highly-transmissible Omicron variant is likely to overtake Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland within days, she tells a media briefing Ms Sturgeon says the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" She says there has already been an effect on the economy - 60 ScotRail cancellations have been blamed on mainly Omicron-related staff shortages New rules of self-isolation are introduced - household contacts of people with any Covid should isolate for 10 days, whether or not they are vaccinated She reiterated advice from Public Health Scotland urging people to ""defer"" Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases Ms Sturgeon says she will raise the question of financial support from the UK government in a Cobra meeting later BBC Scotland News  That's all from our live page today. Join us again next time.  The STUC reacts to Nicola Sturgeon's calls for home working. The trade union organisation says workers are being placed in an ""invidious position"". They are calling for the Scottish government to lift the burden of Covid safety from workersâ shoulders and legislate imminently if they
wonât. They are also asking the UK government to reinstate furlough now. STUC General Secretary Roz Foyer says it is ""all fine and well"" for the first minister to appeal to
workers to work from home if they can, but says she needs to be more direct. Ms Foyer adds that often employers refuse such requests and many workers are now worried about asking.  Once again workers are being called on make judgments on whether to work from home even where they know their employer will not be sympathetic. The first minister needs to instruct employers to comply and withdraw all government support from any companies that fail to do so. Roz Foyer, STUC general secretary The first minister ends by saying the government has shared today's information in an ""unvarnished way"" to try to give context to decisions which may have to be made in the future. She says they also want to underline that none of us are powerless to make a difference. She urges people to get vaccinated, test, wash hands, wear face coverings and increase ventilation. Asked about schools, and if isolation rules will see schools closed ""by the back door"", the first minister says schools must be kept open at all costs. She says that if there are cases in schools, isolating groups of children is about keeping schools open. If children end up sick and off school, this will lead to the closure of schools by the back door. She says the government has to try to reduce the need for further mitigations and that they cannot let the disease run. I can't stand here and say no class will be disrupted. I will bust a gut to keep schools open. Of course if there are outbreaks there will be a response but I am conscious of minimising disruption to children's education. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish Sun's reporter asks if there is any further evidence on how Omicron was seeded in Scotland. Dr Smith says he can speculate that the first case probably came from a Southern African country. He says the first cases were from testing after an event on or around 20 November and that the variant was in the country at that point. He says the exact source is completely unknown. And that Omicron's transmissibility means it had spread right across the world so it was inevitable that it arrived here. He says travel restrictions will reduce the speed of the spread. The Daily Mail question asks about planning social gatherings at home and asks if restrictions could be introduced on the numbers involved in household mixing. The first minister hopes that current advice will help to drive the situation in a better direction. She says we need to take things a day at a time and is asking people to do all the things she is asking to minimise the need for restrictions down the line. On the BBC Scotland programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says transmissibility of Omicron is clearly ""much greater"". She warns there is the potential for the NHS to be overwhelmed ""very quickly indeed"". Ms Baillie says that in the face of a serious public health crisis, the Scottish and UK governments should work together to make sure support is in place for businesses. She adds that the FM gave a ""stark warning"" today and was ""laying the groundwork for further restrictions to come"". She says she suspects the government will look at numbers mixing in households. The Press Association asks about the impact of Omicron on hospital admissions. Bed-blocking issues in Edinburgh are mentioned. Dr Gregor Smith says he is keeping a close eye on this and that with the size of wave he sees shaping up he has no doubt we will see a rise in hospital admissions. He says discussions are ongoing on how to respond to this and how to improve resilience within the system to cope with that. This may result in changes to services. Prof Leitch says there are two issues - the number of patients expected to come in the expected ""tsunami"" plus the numbers of health staff who may have to isolate. Bauer media asks about support from Westminster for the hospitality sector who are now faced with Christmas cancellations. He asks that if that support comes, how likely is the FM to bring back restrictions. The first minister says that re-introducing restrictions will be a ""last resort"". She says that because the Scottish government has no borrowing powers, she has to rely on the UK Treasury to activate that. She adds that there will be a four-nations discussion this afternoon and expects other nations to make the point about financial support.  On the BBC Scotland programme, Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane says he is very concerned about the variant. ""Our best form of defence is to ensure we're all vaccinated,"" he says. He adds that we need to do better in Scotland, to get more jabs into arms. He calls for mass vaccination centres to be re-opened. Asked about the impact on hospitality businesses of cancelling Christmas parties, he acknowledges that businesses will be struggling. He says if there are additional measures brought in which affect businesses then he would expect the UK government to provide more financial support. Back at the briefing, a question from Global asks about casualties of the pandemic from other harms including suicide or missing health screening or medical appointments. The reporter says people are ""terrified"" of a return to Covid rules. The FM is asked what she would say to put people's minds at ease right now. Ms Sturgeon says she cannot describe the despondency she feels at this. She says two weeks ago she announced that the vaccination certification scheme would not be extended because cases looked like they were on a downwards trend. She says she felt a sense of optimism she had not felt for a long time. But then within 48 hours it all changed with the emergence of Omicron. I feel that despondency, that anxiety and that fear of going backwards. But if we take the option of just letting it happen, all the harm will happen anyway because the weight of infections will overwhelm the NHS, paralyse workplaces and interrupt services. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister On the BBC Scotland coronavirus programme, NHS Grampian's Jillian Evans says people must ""absolutely"" change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus. Ms Evans stresses the importance of daily testing now, adding that the smallest encounter could create a transmission event. She says it's crucial that the spread is slowed while people get their boosters. Anyone who is yet to be vaccinated must come forward, she adds. ITV Border asks how people can celebrate Christmas safely this year. Ms Sturgeon says we should be mindful of which contacts are necessary. She says people we come into contact with may be infected with the Omicron variant. She adds that we should test every time we leave the house to meet other people. Dr Gregor Smith says that getting into the habit of testing regularly safeguards those we are meeting and ensures we do not pass the virus on.   A question comes from STV asking what changed to prompt Public Health Scotland (PHE) to issue guidance on Christmas parties. The FM says that in the days to come, advice will change quickly and information may come from different agencies as data and information is assessed daily and hourly. She says the doubling rate of two days is unprecedented and that they have to act very quickly. She asks the public to ""bear with us"" on the changes to come. BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke asks the first minister to provide a clear definition of a Christmas party. Ms Sturgeon says she is focusing on work events as they are resulting in rapid spread of this infection which pose a big risk to workplaces. She says the bigger the event, the more those risks are very real. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she says. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with... make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand,"" she adds. The FM urges the public to use their good sense when deciding whether to meet up. While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has put out anevidence paper,externallooking at the impact of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. It says Omicron is spreading at a rate that threatens a rapid and large surge of Covid-19 cases. Case numbers are higher for females for all age groups except the under 20s and
over 70s. The paper says it is likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation. It concludes by saying the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure. The evidence that Omicron is here and is spreading fast, and uncertainty over how it responds to vaccines and how much severe illness it causes, are grounds for concern about what might happen as it becomes the dominant strain of the virus."" Scottish government evidence paper Ms Sturgeon ends by saying this is not a briefing she wanted to deliver as we approach Christmas. She says the only way through this challenging period is by doing it together. She adds that even with Omicron, we know the things we can do to reduce the risk. She says that by sticking to mitigations we will be in the best position possible heading into Christmas and the New Year.  Ms Sturgeon says we face ""a situation that has no easy options"". She says any measures will cause social and economic harms but she says early intervention is the best way of acting proportionately. She adds that she cannot rule out further measures. Ms Sturgeon ends with a plea to abide by all the basic protections and reminds us to get vaccinated, to test ourselves regularly and when we are meeting other people. She reminds us to wear face coverings where required, ventilate rooms and stick to hand hygiene rules. She reiterates her call to work from home. She describes what she has set out today as ""grim"". Ms Sturgeon refers to Public Health Scotland's advice that work Christmas parties should be deferred, adding: ""There is a significant risk with Omicron."" She says we are ""already seeing the realities"" of the situation with parties or events with lots of people in attendance becoming super-spreader events. There is a risk to individual health and to workplaces she adds, referring back to the 60 ScotRail cancellations today and the Lanarkshire A&E department outbreaks she referred to earlier.

Ms Sturgeon outlines new rules around self-isolating. She says given that Omicron is becoming dominant, the rules must change. From tomorrow, the advice is that all household contacts of any confirmed Covid case should isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status - even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this is essential to ease transmission. However, some exemptions will be made for critical services. Non-household contacts should isolate pending a PCR result.

Masks in cinemas and theatres as Plan B kicks in,"UK research suggests that two vaccine doses are not enough to prevent infection with the Omicron variant But the study found that a third booster dose does increase protection against symptomatic infection to around 75% Another 58,194 Covid cases are reported in the UK - the highest daily number since 9 January, when there were 59,937 The number of infections confirmed to be the Omicron variant has risen to 1,265 but the real number will be much higher Meanwhile, 10 Downing Street's Christmas party has been cancelled amid anger over a gathering last December But the PM has declared his full confidence in communications chief Jack Doyle, after it emerged he spoke at last year's event In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections could be looming It's time for us to wrap up today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

Reality Check As we've been reporting, top civil servant Simon Case is to investigate allegations of government gatherings last Christmas - including two in Downing Street - while the country was in lockdown. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has been ""repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken"". But what is being examined? The investigation, announced by the PM on Wednesday will examine:  Case will look at the purpose of the events, who attended and whether rules were followed. No date has been given on when his report will be published. Take a look at how the row startedand what has happened since. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Port police failings 'probably' led to more deathsStephen Port murdered four young men by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug GHB.London","Stephen Port's victims (L-R): Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Jack Taylor and Daniel Whitworth Failings by the Met Police contributed to the deaths of serial killer Stephen Port's final three victims, an inquest jury has ruled. Port, 46, is serving a whole-life term for murdering Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor in Barking over 16 months. The deaths were not regarded suspicious until weeks after the fourth murder. The case was branded ""one of the most widespread institutional failings in modern history"" by the men's families. Neil Hudgell, a solicitor representing the victims, added: ""Our firmly held belief is that the Metropolitan Police's actions were, in part, driven by homophobia."" How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men The Met failed to carry out basic checks, send evidence to be forensically examined, and exercise professional curiosity while Port was embarking on his killing spree, the inquest heard. Port is serving a whole-life term for the four murders Port killed the four men, who were all aged in their early 20s, by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at his east London home between June 2014 and September 2015. He was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2016for the murders and a string of sex assaults. This video can not be played The sisters of Port's final victim blame police for his death Police refused to class the partner of Daniel Whitworth, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, as next of kin. Ricky Waumsley said he would have been treated differently if he was a ""straight, white woman"". Coroner Sarah Munro QC said: ""These inquests have, on any view, raised a number of serious concerns."" She added she would be preparing a prevention of future deaths report. This year already Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has been forced to make a series of public apologies following scandals: Forthe Met's inadequate response to two missing black sisterslater found murdered; fortwo officers taking selfies with the bodiesof those dead women; for corruption and cover-up inthe Daniel Morgan murder case; and after Met PC Wayne Couzens wasconvicted of the murder Sarah Everard. This year has also seen the force accused of institutional corruption, misogyny, racism and, today, institutional homophobia. The official graphs illustrating Londoners' perception of the Met show every line reflecting performance heading substantially downwards. A national poll by Ipsos Mori this week suggested the proportion who trust the police had fallen from 76% to 63% in the last two years. There have been more ""heartfelt apologies"" today, but sorrow and regret alone will not reverse the reputational decline of the force which pioneered ""professional policing"". The nine-week long inquests at Barking Town Hall were told police had ignored multiple chances to uncover that Port had been responsible for the first murder - Anthony Walgate, 23, in June 2014 - with the result being the later deaths were preventable. The jury found a murder team should have taken over that first inquiry. Referring to the inquiries made by officers in Barking and Dagenham into the deaths of Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, the jury said there were ""fundamental failings in these investigations from the beginning"". This meant Port was free to kill Jack Taylor, 25, a year later. The bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were found in the graveyard of St Margaret's Church The inquest also ruled the failings were by both officers in Barking and in the Met's homicide command. In written conclusions, the jury acknowledged officers had faced a ""heavy workload"", but said there were failures which ""cannot be overlooked"". During the inquests police admitteda series of ""terrible mistakes"" were made. Coroner Sarah Munro QC ruled out homophobia as an issue for the jury to consider Mr Hudgell told a press conference: ""We are incensed by the police's successful attempts to prevent the jury from examining whether [homophobic] prejudice played any part in the police's action."" He added that ""had the police done their job properly in the first place, Gabriel, Daniel and Jack would not have been killed and other young men would not have been drugged and raped by him"". Met Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball offered ""my own and the Met's heartfelt apologies"" and said she and Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick have offered to meet personally with the victims' loved ones to hear concerns. She said: ""We completely accept people's trust in us has been damaged by a number of recent events. This video can not be played Asst Commissioner Helen Ball described the jury's conclusion as ""a devastating finding"" ""What has happened in connection with each of the deaths of these four young men is part of that damage, and we know has a particular impact in communities local to Barking and LGBT+ communities across London. ""It is very important now to show that we are trustworthy, that we care, that we have changed, and that we are learning."" The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is considering reopening investigation into handling of the deaths. Although 17 officers were interviewed, 16 gave ""no comment"" interviews, submitting written statements instead. None faced gross misconduct charges but nine officers ""fell below the standard required"". Families pay tribute to young men murdered by Port Port case made assumptions about gay community The killer the police missed IOPC Regional Director Graham Beesley said: ""We are examining if anything was said by the officers who gave evidence during the inquests which could alter our findings and give grounds to re-open our investigation."" Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said some police officers ""have got to face serious disciplinary action"". ""Every single gay person who raised concerns about the young gay men was ignored, dismissed and treated with contempt, even the partner of one of the victims,"" he said.

Households face 'double-whammy' tax rise next year,"This video can not be played Council tax increase 'is going to make people worry even more' Families are facing a ""double-whammy"" of rising bills next year, as council tax across much of England is set to increase at the same time as National Insurance, according to BBC research. Two-thirds of councils in England that responded to a BBC survey said they were considering a rise in council tax to help fund services. Many other councils said they were unable to rule it out. Working households face an increase in National Insurance from next April. The increase is to help pay for health and social care, but with the bulk of the money initially due to go to the NHS, many council leaders have told the BBC they will still face funding shortfalls and so council tax increases are inevitable. Council tax could rise by Â£220, say researchers Covid: What is council tax and should it go up in the pandemic? The Local Government Association said it could leave hard-pressed residents feeling that they are ""shelling-out twice"" for social care services. The BBC contacted 152 councils in England that are responsible for social care and 121 responded, with two-thirds saying they are considering a tax rise from next April. Final decisions will be taken after councils get more detail about the funding they will receive from government, which is expected next week. Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said: ""It will be the communities the government promised to 'level-up' who will be hit hardest - in towns and villages across the country, with older populations where people are already struggling to make ends meet. ""Instead of delivering for people in these communities, the government's 'double whammy' National Insurance and council tax will leave people worse off."" Ministers are likely to confirm councils can increase tax by 2%, with an additional 1% allowed for the councils which have responsibility for social care. What that means for household bills will differ from place to place, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has calculated that a 2.8% rise would add an average of around Â£40 to household bills from next April. That is less than in recent years and will mean council tax won't rise as fast as some other household bills, but the IFS says it comes after many years of above-inflation increases. Research Economist Kate Ogden said: ""The biggest uncertainty for budgets next year is probably the impact of Covid which will continue to mean falls in incomes and significant spending by councils on the public health response. ""Councils are being allowed a smaller council tax rise than they have been allowed in recent years, but they've also been promised lots of extra funding from government. ""It's hard to say whether this will be enough, although we can expect to see many councils put up their council tax bills in an attempt to stem the gap."" Employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound forNational Insurance(NI) from April 2022. But from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a newHealth and Social Care Levy. The government says the changes are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years. The Local Government Association said councils were acutely aware of the burden tax increases placed on households, but many were facing tough choices about how to raise funds. Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, said: ""In recent years, the government has relied on council tax raising powers to increase councils' core spending power. ""While council tax is an important funding stream, it has never been the solution to the long-term pressures facing our local services, raising different amounts in different parts of the country, which is not related to need. ""Increasing council tax to pay for social care is a double whammy for hard-pressed residents, who may also feel they are shelling out twice for a service now that the Health and Social Care Levy is being introduced."" Some council leaders in the north of England say relying on council tax for funding leaves them at a disadvantage because they can raise less than councils in part of the south. Paul Dennett, Labour Mayor of Salford, said: ""Different parts of the country can raise more money through council tax because they have properties that are in higher council tax bands paying more in council tax, but also different parts of the country have different demands on services. ""Salford is the 18th most deprived area in the country, and as a consequence of that the demand for public services is higher in places like Salford than it is in other parts of the country."" The government said councils are responsible for setting tax levels, and local people have the ability to veto excessive rises through referendums. MPs back change to social care funding in England Social care changes at-a-glance A spokesman said: ""We are committed to reforming health and social care and are investing an additional Â£5.4bn over three years, with Â£1bn allocated, to improve the lives of those who receive care. ""We are also providing an additional Â£1.6bn in core local government funding in each year of the next Spending Review, which will allow councils to increase their spending on vital public services, such as Children's and Adults Social Care, to ensure they respond effectively to rising demand."" The leaders of England's largest councils - many of which are Tory-led - have warned that even with extra funding from government they are still facing a shortfall of over Â£500m next year and so will have to ""reluctantly"" raise council tax to keep services running. Cllr Tim Oliver, chairman of the County Councils Network and Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said that many councils will face a gap in their finances. ""We recognise that our residents will be feeling the pinch after a tough 18 months with the cost of living rising, whilst some may be facing uncertain employment prospects,"" he said. ""County residents already pay the highest rates and those county leaders that do propose rises of the maximum permitted will be doing so as they have little choice other than to substantively reduce local services.""

LiveLiveMasks in cinemas and theatres as Plan B kicks in5 minutes ago,"UK research suggests that two vaccine doses are not enough to prevent infection with the Omicron variant But the study found that a third booster dose does increase protection against symptomatic infection to around 75% Another 58,194 Covid cases are reported in the UK - the highest daily number since 9 January, when there were 59,937 The number of infections confirmed to be the Omicron variant has risen to 1,265 but the real number will be much higher Meanwhile, 10 Downing Street's Christmas party has been cancelled amid anger over a gathering last December But the PM has declared his full confidence in communications chief Jack Doyle, after it emerged he spoke at last year's event In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections could be looming It's time for us to wrap up today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and around the world. Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

"Port police failings 'probably' led to more deathsStephen Port murdered four young men by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug GHB.","Stephen Port's victims (L-R): Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Jack Taylor and Daniel Whitworth Failings by the Met Police contributed to the deaths of serial killer Stephen Port's final three victims, an inquest jury has ruled. Port, 46, is serving a whole-life term for murdering Anthony Walgate, Gabriel Kovari, Daniel Whitworth and Jack Taylor in Barking over 16 months. The deaths were not regarded suspicious until weeks after the fourth murder. The case was branded ""one of the most widespread institutional failings in modern history"" by the men's families. Neil Hudgell, a solicitor representing the victims, added: ""Our firmly held belief is that the Metropolitan Police's actions were, in part, driven by homophobia."" How Met failings contributed to the deaths of three men The Met failed to carry out basic checks, send evidence to be forensically examined, and exercise professional curiosity while Port was embarking on his killing spree, the inquest heard. Port is serving a whole-life term for the four murders Port killed the four men, who were all aged in their early 20s, by giving them overdoses of the ""date rape"" drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) at his east London home between June 2014 and September 2015. He was jailed for life at the Old Bailey in 2016for the murders and a string of sex assaults. This video can not be played The sisters of Port's final victim blame police for his death Police refused to class the partner of Daniel Whitworth, with whom he shared a home and a bank account, as next of kin. Ricky Waumsley said he would have been treated differently if he was a ""straight, white woman"". Coroner Sarah Munro QC said: ""These inquests have, on any view, raised a number of serious concerns."" She added she would be preparing a prevention of future deaths report. This year already Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has been forced to make a series of public apologies following scandals: Forthe Met's inadequate response to two missing black sisterslater found murdered; fortwo officers taking selfies with the bodiesof those dead women; for corruption and cover-up inthe Daniel Morgan murder case; and after Met PC Wayne Couzens wasconvicted of the murder Sarah Everard. This year has also seen the force accused of institutional corruption, misogyny, racism and, today, institutional homophobia. The official graphs illustrating Londoners' perception of the Met show every line reflecting performance heading substantially downwards. A national poll by Ipsos Mori this week suggested the proportion who trust the police had fallen from 76% to 63% in the last two years. There have been more ""heartfelt apologies"" today, but sorrow and regret alone will not reverse the reputational decline of the force which pioneered ""professional policing"". The nine-week long inquests at Barking Town Hall were told police had ignored multiple chances to uncover that Port had been responsible for the first murder - Anthony Walgate, 23, in June 2014 - with the result being the later deaths were preventable. The jury found a murder team should have taken over that first inquiry. Referring to the inquiries made by officers in Barking and Dagenham into the deaths of Gabriel Kovari, 22, and Daniel Whitworth, 21, the jury said there were ""fundamental failings in these investigations from the beginning"". This meant Port was free to kill Jack Taylor, 25, a year later. The bodies of Gabriel Kovari and Daniel Whitworth were found in the graveyard of St Margaret's Church The inquest also ruled the failings were by both officers in Barking and in the Met's homicide command. In written conclusions, the jury acknowledged officers had faced a ""heavy workload"", but said there were failures which ""cannot be overlooked"". During the inquests police admitteda series of ""terrible mistakes"" were made. Coroner Sarah Munro QC ruled out homophobia as an issue for the jury to consider Mr Hudgell told a press conference: ""We are incensed by the police's successful attempts to prevent the jury from examining whether [homophobic] prejudice played any part in the police's action."" He added that ""had the police done their job properly in the first place, Gabriel, Daniel and Jack would not have been killed and other young men would not have been drugged and raped by him"". Met Police Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball offered ""my own and the Met's heartfelt apologies"" and said she and Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick have offered to meet personally with the victims' loved ones to hear concerns. She said: ""We completely accept people's trust in us has been damaged by a number of recent events. This video can not be played Asst Commissioner Helen Ball described the jury's conclusion as ""a devastating finding"" ""What has happened in connection with each of the deaths of these four young men is part of that damage, and we know has a particular impact in communities local to Barking and LGBT+ communities across London. ""It is very important now to show that we are trustworthy, that we care, that we have changed, and that we are learning."" The Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) said it is considering reopening investigation into handling of the deaths. Although 17 officers were interviewed, 16 gave ""no comment"" interviews, submitting written statements instead. None faced gross misconduct charges but nine officers ""fell below the standard required"". Families pay tribute to young men murdered by Port Port case made assumptions about gay community The killer the police missed IOPC Regional Director Graham Beesley said: ""We are examining if anything was said by the officers who gave evidence during the inquests which could alter our findings and give grounds to re-open our investigation."" Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said some police officers ""have got to face serious disciplinary action"". ""Every single gay person who raised concerns about the young gay men was ignored, dismissed and treated with contempt, even the partner of one of the victims,"" he said.

Cambo oil field development to be pausedSiccar Point Energy's decision to pause the project off Shetland comes a week after Shell pulled out.Scotland,"The firm behind the controversial Cambo oil field off Shetland is ""pausing"" the project, BBC Scotland has learned. Siccar Point Energy's decision comes a week afterShell pulled outof the North Atlantic development. Forty four contractors - 29 in Aberdeen and 15 in Singapore -  are set to lose their jobs. Its 37 permanent staff are not affected. The firm said Shell's announcement meant the project could not progress on the ""originally planned timescale"". Chief executive officer Jonathan Roger said: ""We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps."" ""We continue to believe Cambo is a robust project that can play an important part of the UK's energy security, providing homegrown energy supply and reducing carbon intensive imports, whilst supporting a just transition,"" he added. Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? The move has been welcomed by climate change campaigners who have long been critical of the project. Greenpeace called on the UK and Scottish governments to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure. However concerns have been raised about the security of gas supplies, and energy worker jobs. Approval from the UK government is needed to develop the field. Located in the North Atlantic, about 125km (75 miles) north west of the Shetland islands. Major stakeholder is Siccar Point Energy, with a 70% stake, backed by private equity firm investors. Siccar Point Energy says Cambo could deliver 170 million barrels of oil over 25 years, and 53.5 billion cubic feet of gas. The exploration licences dates back to 2001, but UK government must approve drilling - which could start as early as 2022. The UK government Department for Business said that while this was ""ultimately a commercial decision"" by Siccar Point Energy, it was committed to the domestic offshore oil and gas sector. Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" Responding to Siccar Point Energy's decision, Sam Chetan-Welsh of Greenpeace UK said: ""The economics of Cambo were looking decidedly shaky, and the climate maths never did make sense. ""Both the Westminster and Scottish government now need to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure."" Today's decision definitely makes it less likely that the controversial Cambo field will be developed but it does not kill it off. The critical move to watch is whether the consent application to the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is withdrawn. If it isn't - and the company won't confirm their plan - then it could easily be 'unpaused' at a later date. Even if it is, there's nothing to stop it being revived once the dust settles. This project has been a key test of the apparent contradictions of the UK government and whether or not is will support new oil and gas while also promoting a transition to renewables. Only they can kill it off completely. But politically they'll be hoping they don't have to make that decision. Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns Mary Church described it as ""another nail in the coffin"" for Cambo oil field. ""The UK government must officially reject the Cambo proposal once and for all,"" she said. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which has been campaigning against Cambo, said it was yet another signal that the project needed to be rejected. And Scottish Greens climate spokesman Mark Ruskell said it should not come as a surprise that Cambo was looking ""increasingly unlikely"". Activists at the COP26 summit called for the Cambo development to be blocked However industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo are still needed. OGUK's supply chain and operations director Katy Heidenreich said: ""Continued investment will be required to avoid increasing reliance on imported energy, protect security of supply and deliver a homegrown energy transition."" Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative spokesman for net zero and energy, said: ""This announcement from Siccar Point Energy is extremely concerning for the oil and gas industry. ""Without investment in these projects, we risk becoming even more dependent on foreign imports rather than making use of Scotland's domestic reserves of oil and gas."" And Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, said:  ""It's meant to be a transition to a low carbon economy, not a surrender of the national interest. ""The cheerleaders for Cambo's shutdown aren't just throwing energy workers under the bus, but also our security of supply for the gas we will still need on the road to 2050."" Shell had faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo. Announcing its decision to pull out of the development last week, it said it believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"".

"PM's press chief spoke at No 10 party last yearJack Doyle gave a speech and handed out awards at the gathering on 18 December, it is understood.UK PoliticsCare homes 'could ban visits' as Omicron risesThe chair of Care Forum Wales says a temporary ban might be needed to keep people safe.Wales","The PM's press chief addressed staff and gave out awards at a Downing Street party last Christmas that is now under investigation, it is understood. Jack Doyle, then deputy communications director, gave a speech to between 20 and 30 people at the 18 December event. A source has told the BBC there were food, drinks and games at the event. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the prime minister was ""not fit for office"" and it was important to ""get to the bottom of this"". But Downing Street said: ""There is an ongoing review, and we won't be commenting further while that is the case."" This 18 December event is one of three government staff gatherings from last year now being investigated by the UK's top civil servant, Simon Case, for possible breaches of Covid rules. The others are a No 10 staff event on 27 November last year and a gathering at the Department of Education event on 10 December. The inquiry could be widened out if it considered there are credible allegations about other events. Which parties are being investigated? What were the rules on Christmas parties? Education department chief admits December party Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said she did not hold a Christmas party last year, when she was international trade secretary, as she had been too ""busy"". ""We had a lot of deals to get done by 31 December, so that was my focus,"" she told the BBC'sPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinsonpodcast. The revelation of Mr Doyle's speech at the Downing Street gathering follows an arduous few days for the government, during which time it has been accused by Labour of not being honest over this and other events. ITV News, whichfirst reported,externalthat Mr Doyle had been present at the 18 December party, said he had also handed out award certificates to staff. The event took place two days after London went into Tier 3 lockdown restrictions, meaning people were told not to mix indoors with anyone outside their household or support bubble. No 10 has refused to explain how the party complied with the restrictions. The former Daily Mail political reporter became the prime minister's press secretary in 2020 He was promoted to Downing Street director of communications in April this year He is not the PM's official spokesman - but is in charge of how the government gets its message across to the media It is the role held by Alastair Campbell, when Labour was in power Mr Doyle earns between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999 a year On Wednesday, the prime minister told the Commons he had been ""repeatedly assured"" that there had been no party and that no Covid rules had been broken on that date. The government's chief whip Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham that Mr Johnson ""will not have lied"" about any parties that took place on Downing Street last year. He added that the 18 December event had been a ""meeting"" rather than a social get-together, and that staff had discussed how to deal with coronavirus. But Sir Keir, speaking during a visit to Northumberland, said: ""It's absolutely important that we get to the bottom of this. ""This is just the latest allegation of dishonesty from the prime minister. We've had lie upon lie in relation to the parties going on in Downing Street. The prime minister is not fit for office."" This video can not be played Newscastâs take on the No 10 Christmas party fallout Government adviser Allegra Strattonquit her post on Wednesday after a backlash over a video she appeared in from last December, in which she joked about a Christmas party. Before her resignation, Mr Johnson told MPs that he was ""furious"" about the clip, obtained by ITV News, and was launching an investigation into whether Covid rules had been broken. Sources in Westminster are questioning whether it's possible for Jack Doyle to stay in his job. In part that's because one of the problems this week for No 10 has been their efforts to deny and explain what did or didn't happen. Ministers, and the prime minister himself, have been stuck in the Kafka-esque position of saying that they are sure no rules were broken, but they also don't know what went on. If they don't know what happened, how can they be sure that nothing went wrong? And if multiple sources have said there was a gathering of several dozen people, and people who were not on the Downing Street payroll had been invited, how can that have been just a few work drinks at the desk in a Covid-secure office? Read Laura's blog in full Meanwhile, Lord Geidt, the prime minister's standards adviser, is unhappy about the contents of an Electoral Commission report into the funding of refurbishments to the Downing Street flat but is not ready to resign over it, the BBC understands. Labour says the report shows Mr Johnson lied to Lord Geidt when he investigated the PM's conduct earlier this year, something denied by Downing Street. Labour has written to Lord Geidt, asking him to reinvestigate. Mr Johnson is also facing a rebellion from Conservative MPs over his plans announced on Wednesday to introducetighter Covid curbs in Englandto tackle the Omicron variant. Dozens of Tories have hit out at extra restrictions ahead of a vote next week, particularly the plans for mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs and large events. Former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell said the mood in the Conservative Party was ""sulphurous"", adding: ""What we need now is a bit of grip from No 10.""

Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy?,"An offshore oil exploration rig, in the Scottish sector of the North Sea, burns off oil and natural gas it has just tapped Glasgow is hosting the COP26 climate summit amid ongoing controversy over a new oil field west of Shetland that could get the green light by the UK government. The Cambo oil field is thought to contain 800 million barrels of oil - with climate campaigners saying it would be hypocrisy to develop the site at a time when countries across the world are being asked to take urgent action to prevent global temperatures from spiralling out of control. The UK government's Scottish secretary, Alister Jack, has said that the new field should ""100%"" get the go-ahead, arguing that it would be ""foolish to think that we can just run away from oil and gas"". The Scottish government has been accused of sitting on the fence over whether or not the development should be allowed, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon refusing to openly oppose the plans. UK minister 'eager' for Cambo oil field talks Sturgeon urges PM to reassess Cambo oil field plan Climate report is 'code red for humanity' The Cambo oil field is situated approximately 125km (75 miles) to the west of the Shetland Islands in water depths of between 1,050m to 1,100m. While the UK government says the original ""licensing approval"" for the site dates back to 2001, it is important to note that licence was an exploration licence. Before any oil or gas is discovered in a particular location, such a licence gives companies permission to seek out where it is. An industry expert has told me that there is then a lengthy, rigorous process - which can sometimes take decades - involving the creation of field development plans, environmental statements and many other requirements which require approval from the relevant bodies, before production activity can begin. If approved by the Oil and Gas Authority, drilling at Cambo could start as early as 2022. And the field is expected to produce oil and gas for approximately 25 years. It is this ""licensing loophole"" that is also causing concern to campaigners. A spokesperson for the UK government's Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has responded to the criticisms, saying: ""While we are working hard to drive down demand for fossil fuels, there will continue to be ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming years, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee."" The company behind the Cambo proposal is Siccar Point Energy, backed by private equity firm investors. It sees this as an opportunity to create more than 1,000 jobs and even more in the supply chain. ""The Cambo development supports the country's energy transition, maintaining secure UK supply,"" says Jonathan Roger, the company's CEO. ""We have proactively taken significant steps to minimise the emissions footprint through its design and Cambo will be built 'electrification-ready', with the potential to use onshore renewable power when it becomes available in the future, in line with decarbonisation targets."" Boris Johnson's UK government has promised to take the lead role in tackling climate change The other player is Shell, which has a 30% stake in the project. While a spokesperson told me they were unable to comment on the licence application because Shell is not the operator, they did tell me about the company's overall strategy. They said: ""Even the most ambitious scenarios tell us that as the energy system transitions, the world will continue to need oil and gas for decades to come. ""Targeted investment will generate cash to help fund the growth of our new low-carbon portfolio."" But the group of campaigners protesting against the proposal do not believe this sticks, with Friends of the Earth gaining thousands of signatures on their petitions. They calculate that in phase 1, emissions alone would be approximately the equivalent of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of 16 coal-fired power plants. They say this contradicts a number of robust targets and recommendations to keep rising temperatures in check, including the International Energy Agency recommendations for no new oil and gas fields from 2021, except those already approved. ""The huge response to the open letter shows that the public understand that we must keep fossil fuels in the ground and switch to clean renewable energy,"" says Friends of the Earth Scotland climate and energy campaigner Caroline Rance. ""Both the UK and Scottish governments must end their hypocritical support for drilling for every last drop of climate-wrecking oil and gas, and instead develop a clear plan for winding down fossil fuel extraction while retraining offshore workers and supporting communities affected by this transition.""

LiveLiveSturgeon: We may be facing a tsunami of infections3 minutes ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warns that Scotland could be facing - and may already be experiencing - a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections The highly-transmissible Omicron variant is likely to overtake Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland within days, she tells a media briefing Ms Sturgeon says the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" She says there has already been an effect on the economy - 60 ScotRail cancellations have been blamed on mainly Omicron-related staff shortages New rules of self-isolation are introduced - household contacts of people with any Covid should isolate for 10 days, whether or not they are vaccinated She reiterated advice from Public Health Scotland urging people to ""defer"" Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases Ms Sturgeon says she will raise the question of financial support from the UK government in a Cobra meeting later BBC Scotland News  That's all from our live page today. Join us again next time.  The STUC reacts to Nicola Sturgeon's calls for home working. The trade union organisation says workers are being placed in an ""invidious position"". They are calling for the Scottish government to lift the burden of Covid safety from workersâ shoulders and legislate imminently if they
wonât. They are also asking the UK government to reinstate furlough now. STUC General Secretary Roz Foyer says it is ""all fine and well"" for the first minister to appeal to
workers to work from home if they can, but says she needs to be more direct. Ms Foyer adds that often employers refuse such requests and many workers are now worried about asking.  Once again workers are being called on make judgments on whether to work from home even where they know their employer will not be sympathetic. The first minister needs to instruct employers to comply and withdraw all government support from any companies that fail to do so. Roz Foyer, STUC general secretary The first minister ends by saying the government has shared today's information in an ""unvarnished way"" to try to give context to decisions which may have to be made in the future. She says they also want to underline that none of us are powerless to make a difference. She urges people to get vaccinated, test, wash hands, wear face coverings and increase ventilation. Asked about schools, and if isolation rules will see schools closed ""by the back door"", the first minister says schools must be kept open at all costs. She says that if there are cases in schools, isolating groups of children is about keeping schools open. If children end up sick and off school, this will lead to the closure of schools by the back door. She says the government has to try to reduce the need for further mitigations and that they cannot let the disease run. I can't stand here and say no class will be disrupted. I will bust a gut to keep schools open. Of course if there are outbreaks there will be a response but I am conscious of minimising disruption to children's education. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish Sun's reporter asks if there is any further evidence on how Omicron was seeded in Scotland. Dr Smith says he can speculate that the first case probably came from a Southern African country. He says the first cases were from testing after an event on or around 20 November and that the variant was in the country at that point. He says the exact source is completely unknown. And that Omicron's transmissibility means it had spread right across the world so it was inevitable that it arrived here. He says travel restrictions will reduce the speed of the spread. The Daily Mail question asks about planning social gatherings at home and asks if restrictions could be introduced on the numbers involved in household mixing. The first minister hopes that current advice will help to drive the situation in a better direction. She says we need to take things a day at a time and is asking people to do all the things she is asking to minimise the need for restrictions down the line. On the BBC Scotland programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says transmissibility of Omicron is clearly ""much greater"". She warns there is the potential for the NHS to be overwhelmed ""very quickly indeed"". Ms Baillie says that in the face of a serious public health crisis, the Scottish and UK governments should work together to make sure support is in place for businesses. She adds that the FM gave a ""stark warning"" today and was ""laying the groundwork for further restrictions to come"". She says she suspects the government will look at numbers mixing in households. The Press Association asks about the impact of Omicron on hospital admissions. Bed-blocking issues in Edinburgh are mentioned. Dr Gregor Smith says he is keeping a close eye on this and that with the size of wave he sees shaping up he has no doubt we will see a rise in hospital admissions. He says discussions are ongoing on how to respond to this and how to improve resilience within the system to cope with that. This may result in changes to services. Prof Leitch says there are two issues - the number of patients expected to come in the expected ""tsunami"" plus the numbers of health staff who may have to isolate. Bauer media asks about support from Westminster for the hospitality sector who are now faced with Christmas cancellations. He asks that if that support comes, how likely is the FM to bring back restrictions. The first minister says that re-introducing restrictions will be a ""last resort"". She says that because the Scottish government has no borrowing powers, she has to rely on the UK Treasury to activate that. She adds that there will be a four-nations discussion this afternoon and expects other nations to make the point about financial support.  On the BBC Scotland programme, Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane says he is very concerned about the variant. ""Our best form of defence is to ensure we're all vaccinated,"" he says. He adds that we need to do better in Scotland, to get more jabs into arms. He calls for mass vaccination centres to be re-opened. Asked about the impact on hospitality businesses of cancelling Christmas parties, he acknowledges that businesses will be struggling. He says if there are additional measures brought in which affect businesses then he would expect the UK government to provide more financial support. Back at the briefing, a question from Global asks about casualties of the pandemic from other harms including suicide or missing health screening or medical appointments. The reporter says people are ""terrified"" of a return to Covid rules. The FM is asked what she would say to put people's minds at ease right now. Ms Sturgeon says she cannot describe the despondency she feels at this. She says two weeks ago she announced that the vaccination certification scheme would not be extended because cases looked like they were on a downwards trend. She says she felt a sense of optimism she had not felt for a long time. But then within 48 hours it all changed with the emergence of Omicron. I feel that despondency, that anxiety and that fear of going backwards. But if we take the option of just letting it happen, all the harm will happen anyway because the weight of infections will overwhelm the NHS, paralyse workplaces and interrupt services. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister On the BBC Scotland coronavirus programme, NHS Grampian's Jillian Evans says people must ""absolutely"" change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus. Ms Evans stresses the importance of daily testing now, adding that the smallest encounter could create a transmission event. She says it's crucial that the spread is slowed while people get their boosters. Anyone who is yet to be vaccinated must come forward, she adds. ITV Border asks how people can celebrate Christmas safely this year. Ms Sturgeon says we should be mindful of which contacts are necessary. She says people we come into contact with may be infected with the Omicron variant. She adds that we should test every time we leave the house to meet other people. Dr Gregor Smith says that getting into the habit of testing regularly safeguards those we are meeting and ensures we do not pass the virus on.   A question comes from STV asking what changed to prompt Public Health Scotland (PHE) to issue guidance on Christmas parties. The FM says that in the days to come, advice will change quickly and information may come from different agencies as data and information is assessed daily and hourly. She says the doubling rate of two days is unprecedented and that they have to act very quickly. She asks the public to ""bear with us"" on the changes to come. BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke asks the first minister to provide a clear definition of a Christmas party. Ms Sturgeon says she is focusing on work events as they are resulting in rapid spread of this infection which pose a big risk to workplaces. She says the bigger the event, the more those risks are very real. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she says. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with... make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand,"" she adds. The FM urges the public to use their good sense when deciding whether to meet up. While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has put out anevidence paper,externallooking at the impact of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. It says Omicron is spreading at a rate that threatens a rapid and large surge of Covid-19 cases. Case numbers are higher for females for all age groups except the under 20s and
over 70s. The paper says it is likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation. It concludes by saying the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure. The evidence that Omicron is here and is spreading fast, and uncertainty over how it responds to vaccines and how much severe illness it causes, are grounds for concern about what might happen as it becomes the dominant strain of the virus."" Scottish government evidence paper Ms Sturgeon ends by saying this is not a briefing she wanted to deliver as we approach Christmas. She says the only way through this challenging period is by doing it together. She adds that even with Omicron, we know the things we can do to reduce the risk. She says that by sticking to mitigations we will be in the best position possible heading into Christmas and the New Year.  Ms Sturgeon says we face ""a situation that has no easy options"". She says any measures will cause social and economic harms but she says early intervention is the best way of acting proportionately. She adds that she cannot rule out further measures. Ms Sturgeon ends with a plea to abide by all the basic protections and reminds us to get vaccinated, to test ourselves regularly and when we are meeting other people. She reminds us to wear face coverings where required, ventilate rooms and stick to hand hygiene rules. She reiterates her call to work from home. She describes what she has set out today as ""grim"". Ms Sturgeon refers to Public Health Scotland's advice that work Christmas parties should be deferred, adding: ""There is a significant risk with Omicron."" She says we are ""already seeing the realities"" of the situation with parties or events with lots of people in attendance becoming super-spreader events. There is a risk to individual health and to workplaces she adds, referring back to the 60 ScotRail cancellations today and the Lanarkshire A&E department outbreaks she referred to earlier.

Ms Sturgeon outlines new rules around self-isolating. She says given that Omicron is becoming dominant, the rules must change. From tomorrow, the advice is that all household contacts of any confirmed Covid case should isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status - even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this is essential to ease transmission. However, some exemptions will be made for critical services. Non-household contacts should isolate pending a PCR result.

Cambo oil field development to be pausedSiccar Point Energy's decision to pause the project off Shetland comes a week after Shell pulled out.,"The firm behind the controversial Cambo oil field off Shetland is ""pausing"" the project, BBC Scotland has learned. Siccar Point Energy's decision comes a week afterShell pulled outof the North Atlantic development. Forty four contractors - 29 in Aberdeen and 15 in Singapore -  are set to lose their jobs. Its 37 permanent staff are not affected. The firm said Shell's announcement meant the project could not progress on the ""originally planned timescale"". Chief executive officer Jonathan Roger said: ""We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps."" ""We continue to believe Cambo is a robust project that can play an important part of the UK's energy security, providing homegrown energy supply and reducing carbon intensive imports, whilst supporting a just transition,"" he added. Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? The move has been welcomed by climate change campaigners who have long been critical of the project. Greenpeace called on the UK and Scottish governments to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure. However concerns have been raised about the security of gas supplies, and energy worker jobs. Approval from the UK government is needed to develop the field. Located in the North Atlantic, about 125km (75 miles) north west of the Shetland islands. Major stakeholder is Siccar Point Energy, with a 70% stake, backed by private equity firm investors. Siccar Point Energy says Cambo could deliver 170 million barrels of oil over 25 years, and 53.5 billion cubic feet of gas. The exploration licences dates back to 2001, but UK government must approve drilling - which could start as early as 2022. The UK government Department for Business said that while this was ""ultimately a commercial decision"" by Siccar Point Energy, it was committed to the domestic offshore oil and gas sector. Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" Responding to Siccar Point Energy's decision, Sam Chetan-Welsh of Greenpeace UK said: ""The economics of Cambo were looking decidedly shaky, and the climate maths never did make sense. ""Both the Westminster and Scottish government now need to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure."" Today's decision definitely makes it less likely that the controversial Cambo field will be developed but it does not kill it off. The critical move to watch is whether the consent application to the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is withdrawn. If it isn't - and the company won't confirm their plan - then it could easily be 'unpaused' at a later date. Even if it is, there's nothing to stop it being revived once the dust settles. This project has been a key test of the apparent contradictions of the UK government and whether or not is will support new oil and gas while also promoting a transition to renewables. Only they can kill it off completely. But politically they'll be hoping they don't have to make that decision. Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns Mary Church described it as ""another nail in the coffin"" for Cambo oil field. ""The UK government must officially reject the Cambo proposal once and for all,"" she said. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which has been campaigning against Cambo, said it was yet another signal that the project needed to be rejected. And Scottish Greens climate spokesman Mark Ruskell said it should not come as a surprise that Cambo was looking ""increasingly unlikely"". Activists at the COP26 summit called for the Cambo development to be blocked However industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo are still needed. OGUK's supply chain and operations director Katy Heidenreich said: ""Continued investment will be required to avoid increasing reliance on imported energy, protect security of supply and deliver a homegrown energy transition."" Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative spokesman for net zero and energy, said: ""This announcement from Siccar Point Energy is extremely concerning for the oil and gas industry. ""Without investment in these projects, we risk becoming even more dependent on foreign imports rather than making use of Scotland's domestic reserves of oil and gas."" And Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, said:  ""It's meant to be a transition to a low carbon economy, not a surrender of the national interest. ""The cheerleaders for Cambo's shutdown aren't just throwing energy workers under the bus, but also our security of supply for the gas we will still need on the road to 2050."" Shell had faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo. Announcing its decision to pull out of the development last week, it said it believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"".

Ministers divided over 2% cuts in Stormont budget,"The finance minister has said the budget's main priority would be health The Stormont draft budget is proposing a 10% increase in health funding, but a squeeze on all other departments. The majority of the Executive voted to put the three-year budget plan out to public consultation from next week. But DUP ministers voted against the move. Ministers had previously agreed to prioritise health and use the majority of funding to deal with the crisis including waiting lists. But BBC News NI understands some are unhappy about the cuts being proposed to their respective budgets. First Minister Paul Givan said he supported increased funding for health, however, he accused the budget paper of lacking a detailed plan for how the service will be transformed. ""We want to see that transformation plan, because with that additional funding the people of Northern Ireland need to see real changes as to the experiences that they have in the health service,"" he said. Health Minister Robin Swann said the budget was about starting the ""transformation process"" of the health service. A meeting of the executive on Friday morning was requested by Finance Minister Conor Murphy to sign off the draft budget before public consultation. Speaking afterwards, Mr Murphy explained: ""We don't have the resources that we need for everything, so that means there are choices to be made."" ""The proposition going out is to prioritise health, to support health, to get waiting lists down, to support mental health provision and cancer provision,"" he added. Conor Murphy said the executive did not have the resources to meet all its priorities Details of the plan will be outlined in the assembly next week. It includes moves to freeze regional rates and provide a one-month rates holiday to all businesses with the exception of utilities and larger food stores. There will be a three-months rates break for retail, tourism, hospitality, leisure, childcare and airports. A multi-year UK spending review announced earlier this yearallowed the executive to produce its own multi-year spending plan. Here is the proposed financial allocations for each Stormont department in the draft budget plans for 2022-2025. It's broken down by resource budget, which is largely spent on the running of services and resources, and capital budget, which is mostly used for major infrastructure or investment projects. Department of Health: Â£20.9bn resource; Â£1.1bn capital Department of Education: Â£7.4bn resource; Â£582m capital Department for Infrastructure: Â£1.3bn resource; Â£2.4bn capital Department of Justice: Â£3.4bn resource; Â£353m capital Department for Communities: Â£2.5bn resource; Â£631m capital Department for the Economy: Â£2.5bn resource; Â£582m capital Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs: Â£1.7bn resource budget; Â£327m capital budget The Executive Office: Â£670m resource; Â£45m capital Department of Finance: Â£510m resource; Â£105m capital Mr Murphy said there was ""an opportunity over three years"" to fulfil commitments made to transform healthcare. ""If we're going to walk the walk, having talked the talk in relation to supporting health over the last number of years, and all executive parties have repeatedly said health is a priority, this is the opportunity to match that with some resource and funding,"" he continued. The finance minister explained ""there is no money tree here available"" if ministers, MLAs or the public wish to change the draft budget. ""If people want to change that then they need to say where they're finding the money to do that from,"" Mr Murphy said. ""If that's coming back off health then they need to be upfront in saying that."" Health Minister Robin Swann said the budget was about ""starting to redress the 10 years of financial underinvestment in our health service"". He said there needed to be a stripping of party politics from the budget. ""It is about allowing us to actually start the transformation process that we need to do, it also gives that surety that we have been asking for of a three-year budget and that has been part of the challenge as well."" Naomi Long says while health is a priority, all departments have a responsibility to drive up health outcomes for the public Justice Minister Naomi Long is among ministers who have expressed concerns about the current draft budget. While she has agreed that the draft budget should go out to public consultation, she is not yet prepared to agree to its content. ""There's no point us presenting it to the public as a fait accompli,"" she said. ""What we have agreed however, and I think what the public would expect us to agree, is that health is our priority going forward. ""However for me that is about health outcomes, and I think all departments have a real responsibility in terms of their own job, to drive up health outcomes and to deliver better for people."" Mrs Long is understood to believe allocations for her department are ""not adequate to maintain an efficient, effective and functional justice system"". The first minister said the DUP also had reservations about the draft budget's impact on the number of police officers. ""Ultimately we will seek to address the deficiencies that exist within this budget before there is a final agreement ultimately in March,"" Mr Givan outlined. The SDLP's finance spokesperson, Matthew O'Toole said his party supported the focus on health and for the draft budget to go out for public consultation, however, there were ""serious concerns"" about cuts elsewhere. ""That is a political choice that Conor Murphy has made, but clearly did not command the support of any ministers outside of his own party at the executive today,"" he said. ""Public services have been placed under immense strain over the course of the last 20 months. This is not the time to cut back further."" Mr O'Toole said the consultation would be ""an opportunity for people to have their say on those priorities"". The opening position of the health budget was Â£6.45bn this year and will rise to just over Â£7.1bn by 2024/25. The increase is partially funded by a 2% cut in the baseline of all other departments budgets. That means that although those departments will still see their budgets rise in cash terms, some will probably experience a real cut when inflation is considered. The Finance Minister Conor Murphy acknowledged that would present ""significant challenges"" for some departments but that the executive had agreed health would be its top priority. Other measures in the budget include an extension of the business rates ""holiday"". Rates are property taxes, but some sectors have been exempt for the past two years as a pandemic support measure. Those exemptions were due to end in April but most business will get a further one-month exemption with those in sectors like retail, hospitality and childcare getting three months. Large food shops and utilities will not get an exemption. The domestic and non-domestic regional rate will also be frozen over the budget period.

EU set to change laws to guarantee medicine supply,"There have been warnings the full implementation of the NI protocol could lead to some medicines being withdrawn in NI Further progress has been made in talks about guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Britain to Northern Ireland, UK's Brexit minister has said. The NI Protocol means Northern Ireland is still covered by the EU's pharmaceutical regulations. Lord Frost was speaking after a meeting with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. He said they would meet twice next week in the hope of ""making worthwhile progress"" before Christmas. Lord Frost said he ""underlined the need for movement on all the difficult issues created by the protocol"", including customs, agrifood rules and the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). ""We will not find a durable solution that does not deal with all these problems,"" he added. Earlier, several European media outlets had reported that the UK wants to concentrate on addressing practical problems and was placing less emphasis on the role of the ECJ. It is understood that a senior official held a video conference with London-based EU journalists. Irish broadcaster RTÃ said the official described this change in emphasis as ""an important shift"". Lord Frost (left) and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ (right) - pictured at a previous meeting in October RTÃ also reported that the British official said that if the UK ever had to use Article 16 - the so-called safeguard clause in the protocol - it would be done in a way that was ""very limited and very focused on practical issues"". Article 16 allows parts of the protocol to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious problems or leading to diversion of trade. The German newspaper Die Welt reported the official as saying: ""'Nobody on Belfast's streets is protesting to get rid of ECJ. We now focus on medicines and customs."" The Northern Ireland Protocol leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, a market which includes medicines. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. Q&A: The NI Protocol medicines issue explained 'Patients at risk' if medicines withdrawn from NI That means goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but goods arriving from the rest of the UK are subject to controls to ensure they comply with EU standards. Northern Ireland gets most of its medicines from distributors and manufacturers in Great Britain but, due to a 'grace period', controls have not yet been imposed on the movement of those products. The industry has warned that if the protocol as it stands is ever fully implementedit will mean major difficulties in importing medicines from Great Britain. Northern Ireland gets most of its medicines from GB distributors The EU acknowledged the requirements are too much of a burden and should be removed, subject to some conditions. BBC News NI understands that the EU could shortly begin the process of changing its laws as part of a solution. Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann said on Friday he would need to consider the ""fine detail"" of any legislation, as it ""does make a difference to the people of Northern Ireland"". He said he was waiting on the EU publishing its proposals and on how the pharmaceutical industry and ""stakeholders"" react to legislation which he hoped to see ""this side of Christmas"". Mr Swann added that it was ""about seeing the final document, seeing how it will impact us"" but that he was committed to ""making sure there is the least disruption of supply of medicines coming into Northern Ireland"". Q&A: The NI Protocol medicines issue explained 'More work needed' on EU medicine proposals More than 2,000 medicines face withdrawal over Protocol 'Patients at risk' if medicines withdrawn from NI EU could move unilaterally on NI medicines issue Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

LiveLiveFM: We may be facing a tsunami of infections4 minutes ago,"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warns that Scotland could be facing - and may already be experiencing - a ""potential tsunami"" of Covid infections The highly-transmissible Omicron variant is likely to overtake Delta as the dominant strain in Scotland within days, she tells a media briefing Ms Sturgeon says the 110 cases that have been recorded in the country are just the ""tip of the iceberg"" She says there has already been an effect on the economy - 60 ScotRail cancellations have been blamed on mainly Omicron-related staff shortages New rules of self-isolation are introduced - household contacts of people with any Covid should isolate for 10 days, whether or not they are vaccinated She reiterated advice from Public Health Scotland urging people to ""defer"" Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases Ms Sturgeon says she will raise the question of financial support from the UK government in a Cobra meeting later BBC Scotland News  That's all from our live page today. Join us again next time.  The STUC reacts to Nicola Sturgeon's calls for home working. The trade union organisation says workers are being placed in an ""invidious position"". They are calling for the Scottish government to lift the burden of Covid safety from workersâ shoulders and legislate imminently if they
wonât. They are also asking the UK government to reinstate furlough now. STUC General Secretary Roz Foyer says it is ""all fine and well"" for the first minister to appeal to
workers to work from home if they can, but says she needs to be more direct. Ms Foyer adds that often employers refuse such requests and many workers are now worried about asking.  Once again workers are being called on make judgments on whether to work from home even where they know their employer will not be sympathetic. The first minister needs to instruct employers to comply and withdraw all government support from any companies that fail to do so. Roz Foyer, STUC general secretary The first minister ends by saying the government has shared today's information in an ""unvarnished way"" to try to give context to decisions which may have to be made in the future. She says they also want to underline that none of us are powerless to make a difference. She urges people to get vaccinated, test, wash hands, wear face coverings and increase ventilation. Asked about schools, and if isolation rules will see schools closed ""by the back door"", the first minister says schools must be kept open at all costs. She says that if there are cases in schools, isolating groups of children is about keeping schools open. If children end up sick and off school, this will lead to the closure of schools by the back door. She says the government has to try to reduce the need for further mitigations and that they cannot let the disease run. I can't stand here and say no class will be disrupted. I will bust a gut to keep schools open. Of course if there are outbreaks there will be a response but I am conscious of minimising disruption to children's education. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister The Scottish Sun's reporter asks if there is any further evidence on how Omicron was seeded in Scotland. Dr Smith says he can speculate that the first case probably came from a Southern African country. He says the first cases were from testing after an event on or around 20 November and that the variant was in the country at that point. He says the exact source is completely unknown. And that Omicron's transmissibility means it had spread right across the world so it was inevitable that it arrived here. He says travel restrictions will reduce the speed of the spread. The Daily Mail question asks about planning social gatherings at home and asks if restrictions could be introduced on the numbers involved in household mixing. The first minister hopes that current advice will help to drive the situation in a better direction. She says we need to take things a day at a time and is asking people to do all the things she is asking to minimise the need for restrictions down the line. On the BBC Scotland programme, Scottish Labour's Jackie Baillie says transmissibility of Omicron is clearly ""much greater"". She warns there is the potential for the NHS to be overwhelmed ""very quickly indeed"". Ms Baillie says that in the face of a serious public health crisis, the Scottish and UK governments should work together to make sure support is in place for businesses. She adds that the FM gave a ""stark warning"" today and was ""laying the groundwork for further restrictions to come"". She says she suspects the government will look at numbers mixing in households. The Press Association asks about the impact of Omicron on hospital admissions. Bed-blocking issues in Edinburgh are mentioned. Dr Gregor Smith says he is keeping a close eye on this and that with the size of wave he sees shaping up he has no doubt we will see a rise in hospital admissions. He says discussions are ongoing on how to respond to this and how to improve resilience within the system to cope with that. This may result in changes to services. Prof Leitch says there are two issues - the number of patients expected to come in the expected ""tsunami"" plus the numbers of health staff who may have to isolate. Bauer media asks about support from Westminster for the hospitality sector who are now faced with Christmas cancellations. He asks that if that support comes, how likely is the FM to bring back restrictions. The first minister says that re-introducing restrictions will be a ""last resort"". She says that because the Scottish government has no borrowing powers, she has to rely on the UK Treasury to activate that. She adds that there will be a four-nations discussion this afternoon and expects other nations to make the point about financial support.  On the BBC Scotland programme, Tory MSP Sandesh Gulhane says he is very concerned about the variant. ""Our best form of defence is to ensure we're all vaccinated,"" he says. He adds that we need to do better in Scotland, to get more jabs into arms. He calls for mass vaccination centres to be re-opened. Asked about the impact on hospitality businesses of cancelling Christmas parties, he acknowledges that businesses will be struggling. He says if there are additional measures brought in which affect businesses then he would expect the UK government to provide more financial support. Back at the briefing, a question from Global asks about casualties of the pandemic from other harms including suicide or missing health screening or medical appointments. The reporter says people are ""terrified"" of a return to Covid rules. The FM is asked what she would say to put people's minds at ease right now. Ms Sturgeon says she cannot describe the despondency she feels at this. She says two weeks ago she announced that the vaccination certification scheme would not be extended because cases looked like they were on a downwards trend. She says she felt a sense of optimism she had not felt for a long time. But then within 48 hours it all changed with the emergence of Omicron. I feel that despondency, that anxiety and that fear of going backwards. But if we take the option of just letting it happen, all the harm will happen anyway because the weight of infections will overwhelm the NHS, paralyse workplaces and interrupt services. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister On the BBC Scotland coronavirus programme, NHS Grampian's Jillian Evans says people must ""absolutely"" change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus. Ms Evans stresses the importance of daily testing now, adding that the smallest encounter could create a transmission event. She says it's crucial that the spread is slowed while people get their boosters. Anyone who is yet to be vaccinated must come forward, she adds. ITV Border asks how people can celebrate Christmas safely this year. Ms Sturgeon says we should be mindful of which contacts are necessary. She says people we come into contact with may be infected with the Omicron variant. She adds that we should test every time we leave the house to meet other people. Dr Gregor Smith says that getting into the habit of testing regularly safeguards those we are meeting and ensures we do not pass the virus on.   A question comes from STV asking what changed to prompt Public Health Scotland (PHE) to issue guidance on Christmas parties. The FM says that in the days to come, advice will change quickly and information may come from different agencies as data and information is assessed daily and hourly. She says the doubling rate of two days is unprecedented and that they have to act very quickly. She asks the public to ""bear with us"" on the changes to come. BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke asks the first minister to provide a clear definition of a Christmas party. Ms Sturgeon says she is focusing on work events as they are resulting in rapid spread of this infection which pose a big risk to workplaces. She says the bigger the event, the more those risks are very real. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she says. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with... make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand,"" she adds. The FM urges the public to use their good sense when deciding whether to meet up. While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has put out anevidence paper,externallooking at the impact of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. It says Omicron is spreading at a rate that threatens a rapid and large surge of Covid-19 cases. Case numbers are higher for females for all age groups except the under 20s and
over 70s. The paper says it is likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation. It concludes by saying the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure. The evidence that Omicron is here and is spreading fast, and uncertainty over how it responds to vaccines and how much severe illness it causes, are grounds for concern about what might happen as it becomes the dominant strain of the virus."" Scottish government evidence paper Ms Sturgeon ends by saying this is not a briefing she wanted to deliver as we approach Christmas. She says the only way through this challenging period is by doing it together. She adds that even with Omicron, we know the things we can do to reduce the risk. She says that by sticking to mitigations we will be in the best position possible heading into Christmas and the New Year.  Ms Sturgeon says we face ""a situation that has no easy options"". She says any measures will cause social and economic harms but she says early intervention is the best way of acting proportionately. She adds that she cannot rule out further measures. Ms Sturgeon ends with a plea to abide by all the basic protections and reminds us to get vaccinated, to test ourselves regularly and when we are meeting other people. She reminds us to wear face coverings where required, ventilate rooms and stick to hand hygiene rules. She reiterates her call to work from home. She describes what she has set out today as ""grim"". Ms Sturgeon refers to Public Health Scotland's advice that work Christmas parties should be deferred, adding: ""There is a significant risk with Omicron."" She says we are ""already seeing the realities"" of the situation with parties or events with lots of people in attendance becoming super-spreader events. There is a risk to individual health and to workplaces she adds, referring back to the 60 ScotRail cancellations today and the Lanarkshire A&E department outbreaks she referred to earlier.

Ms Sturgeon outlines new rules around self-isolating. She says given that Omicron is becoming dominant, the rules must change.

Ms Sturgeon says this is essential to ease transmission. However, some exemptions will be made for critical services. Non-household contacts should isolate pending a PCR result.

But if we take the option of just letting it happen, all the harm will happen anyway because the weight of infections will overwhelm the NHS, paralyse workplaces and interrupt services. Nicola Sturgeon, First minister On the BBC Scotland coronavirus programme, NHS Grampian's Jillian Evans says people must ""absolutely"" change their behaviour to slow the spread of the virus. Ms Evans stresses the importance of daily testing now, adding that the smallest encounter could create a transmission event. She says it's crucial that the spread is slowed while people get their boosters. Anyone who is yet to be vaccinated must come forward, she adds. ITV Border asks how people can celebrate Christmas safely this year. Ms Sturgeon says we should be mindful of which contacts are necessary. She says people we come into contact with may be infected with the Omicron variant. She adds that we should test every time we leave the house to meet other people. Dr Gregor Smith says that getting into the habit of testing regularly safeguards those we are meeting and ensures we do not pass the virus on.   A question comes from STV asking what changed to prompt Public Health Scotland (PHE) to issue guidance on Christmas parties. The FM says that in the days to come, advice will change quickly and information may come from different agencies as data and information is assessed daily and hourly. She says the doubling rate of two days is unprecedented and that they have to act very quickly. She asks the public to ""bear with us"" on the changes to come. BBC Scotland's Aileen Clarke asks the first minister to provide a clear definition of a Christmas party. Ms Sturgeon says she is focusing on work events as they are resulting in rapid spread of this infection which pose a big risk to workplaces. She says the bigger the event, the more those risks are very real. ""My advice would be to consider deferring work Christmas events,"" she says. ""If they are small events that you wish to go ahead with... make sure you and everybody else in the group is testing beforehand,"" she adds. The FM urges the public to use their good sense when deciding whether to meet up. While the first minister has been speaking, the Scottish government has put out anevidence paper,externallooking at the impact of the new Omicron strain of the coronavirus. It says Omicron is spreading at a rate that threatens a rapid and large surge of Covid-19 cases. Case numbers are higher for females for all age groups except the under 20s and
over 70s. The paper says it is likely that a proportion of these infections will result in hospitalisation. It concludes by saying the rapid rise in Omicron infections could put significant additional pressure on hospitals and other health and care services, close to the point in the winter when they are already likely to be at peak pressure. The evidence that Omicron is here and is spreading fast, and uncertainty over how it responds to vaccines and how much severe illness it causes, are grounds for concern about what might happen as it becomes the dominant strain of the virus."" Scottish government evidence paper Ms Sturgeon ends by saying this is not a briefing she wanted to deliver as we approach Christmas. She says the only way through this challenging period is by doing it together. She adds that even with Omicron, we know the things we can do to reduce the risk. She says that by sticking to mitigations we will be in the best position possible heading into Christmas and the New Year.  Ms Sturgeon says we face ""a situation that has no easy options"". She says any measures will cause social and economic harms but she says early intervention is the best way of acting proportionately. She adds that she cannot rule out further measures. Ms Sturgeon ends with a plea to abide by all the basic protections and reminds us to get vaccinated, to test ourselves regularly and when we are meeting other people. She reminds us to wear face coverings where required, ventilate rooms and stick to hand hygiene rules. She reiterates her call to work from home. She describes what she has set out today as ""grim"". Ms Sturgeon refers to Public Health Scotland's advice that work Christmas parties should be deferred, adding: ""There is a significant risk with Omicron."" She says we are ""already seeing the realities"" of the situation with parties or events with lots of people in attendance becoming super-spreader events. There is a risk to individual health and to workplaces she adds, referring back to the 60 ScotRail cancellations today and the Lanarkshire A&E department outbreaks she referred to earlier.

Ms Sturgeon outlines new rules around self-isolating. She says given that Omicron is becoming dominant, the rules must change. From tomorrow, the advice is that all household contacts of any confirmed Covid case should isolate for 10 days regardless of vaccination status - even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Ms Sturgeon says this is essential to ease transmission. However, some exemptions will be made for critical services. Non-household contacts should isolate pending a PCR result. If it is negative, they can leave isolation at this point as long as they are double vaccinated. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

LadBaby enlist Ed and Elton for Christmas singleThe YouTube stars team up with pop royalty to go for a record fourth festive number one in a row.,"LadBaby have recorded a spoof of Ed Sheeran and Elton John's own Christmas single LadBaby are going for a record fourth UK Christmas number one in a row - with help from Ed Sheeran and Elton John. YouTube stars Mark and Roxanne Hoyle have raised money for the Trussell Trust food bank charity with their sausage roll-themed singles since 2018. This year's attempt is a cheeky version of Ed and Elton's Merry Christmas, called Sausage Rolls For Everyone. LadBaby could overtake the Spice Girls and Beatles as the act with the most consecutive Christmas number ones. The Beatles had three in a row in the 1960s and the Spice Girls achieved the same feat in the 90s, with LadBaby matching the record over the past three years. Sheeran was the last artist before the Nottinghamshire couple to have a festive number one, with his 2017 love song Perfect. The star said he was ""proud"" to be supporting and featuring on LadBaby's single this Christmas. ""All profits will be donated to The Trussell Trust, which is a very wonderful and important charity, so make sure you stream it, buy it and play it on repeat,"" Sheeran said. In a statement, Hoyle said: ""Ed and Elton are pop royalty and they've both had huge success at Christmas, so we're honoured and excited to be coming together to help families this Christmas... with the power of sausage rolls."" The charity song will be released on 17 December, but bookmakers have already made it odds-on favourite to top the festive charts. Allow YouTube content?

No clichÃ© is left unwrapped in this gaudily-decorated ode to gathering around the tree and kissing under the mistletoe. The video pays homage to dozens of Christmas classics from yesteryear, recreating scenes from Last Christmas, Walking in the Air, Stay Another Day and the David Bowie/Bing Crosby duet Little Drummer Boy. Released last Friday, it amassed 46,265 sales in its first five days and is almost certain to headline this week's Top 40. But can it withstand LadBaby's sausage roll assault?

Comedians Adam Rowe and Dan Nightingale have a running joke on their Have A Word podcast, in which Dan is told his wife, Laura, has left him. Dan replies with ""Where's she gone?"", with the hosts and their guests trading increasingly bizarre tales of Laura's suave new suitors and their globetrotting adventures. That, somehow, has become a song, written and performed by the duo's producer Finnlay. Presumably funny if you're in on the joke, it otherwise sounds like a Stereophonics b-side. Dan and Adam are supporting a good cause, though, with all proceeds going to ZoÃ«'s Place Baby Hospice, which provides palliative care for terminally ill children, and the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust.

Adele's comeback single has been sitting atop the charts for the last seven weeks, in the face of heavyweight competition from Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa. With streams of the album going strong, the track could hold on for Christmas - but a quirk of the chart rules might make that harder. In order to stop old songs clogging up the top 40, compilers have a ruled called ""accelerated decline"", which says if sales of a song decline for three weeks in a row, it needs 300 streams to count as one ""sale"", instead of the usual 150:1 ratio. Sales of Easy On Me decreased from 100,627 to 69,372 last week. If the trend continues, Adele will go into accelerated decline just in time for the Christmas chart. Even without that penalty, her current sales are no match for the 157,733 singles LadBaby sold in Christmas week last year, so her chances look slim. Bookmakers' odds:20/1 Allow YouTube content?

She's been asking for 27 years, but Mariah Carey still hasn't got you in her stockings (oh shush). But what she does have is the chart equivalent of Coca-Cola's ""Holidays are coming"" jingle. Christmas only really starts when her tinselled tonsils appear on the radio. A perennial presence in the Christmas top 10, itreached number one for the first time last year, only to be deposed by LadBaby before the big day. It's already in the top three this year, even though chart rules dictate that old songs have their streaming tallies halved when calculating the top 40. There's too much competition for her to reach the summit this year. However, she's all-but-guaranteed a top five finish. Bookmakers' odds: 33/1 Allow YouTube content?

Earlier this year, Wigan band The Lathums beat Drake to number one with their debut album, How Beautiful Life Can Be. Now, they're hoping to score a similar upset on the Christmas charts with their festive offering. Technically an anti-Christmas song, it's set at the end of the world, with frontman Alex Moore singing: ""Santa ain't coming this year / Your Christmas will be cancelled anyway."" Inspired by an episode of the BBC Two comedy series Inside No.9, the darkness of its lyrics are offset by a jangly Merseybeat shuffle.

Amazon Music has been commissioning new Christmas songs for a couple of years now, adding them to their festive playlists and staging sneak attacks on the top 40. The tactic has already produced a number one single, in Ellie Goulding's 2019 cover of Joni Mitchell's River. This year, George Ezra has recorded a new version of Charles Brown's Come On Home For Christmas. Recorded in September, while wearing a Santa outfit, Ezra said the song's message struck a chord after the tribulations of 2020. ""Last year was the first Christmas I've experienced where, completely out of anyone's control, we weren't able to see the people we would hope to see.

Gypsy Pistoleros are basically the Flamenco version of Kiss - a sleazy glam-rock band wearing Day of the Dead make-up. Their bid for Christmas number one is a retread of Livin' La Vida Loca that trades the original's camp joie de vivre for dreary pub band clichÃ©s. The song's most redeeming quality is that the proceeds go to housing and homeless charity Shelter. An early publicity campaign helped it gain favourable odds, but with the video only attracting 20,000 views in the course of a month, its ranking has slipped.

Football fans spending millions on crypto-tokens,"FC Barcelona and Juventus FC are selling fan tokens Football clubs have potentially made hundreds of millions of pounds selling controversial crypto ""fan tokens"". Analysis commissioned by BBC News estimates more than Â£262m ($350m) has been spent on the virtual currencies. Some of the tokens are marketed as offering real-world perks to the buyer. But critics say these perks are insignificant - one offered the chance to vote for songs to be played in stadiums - and clubs have insufficient protection for supporters. So far, across the five major European leagues 24 different clubs have launched or are considering fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides. Most offer tokens akin to a club-specific crypto-currency - virtual coins can be bought and sold and their value rise and fall depending on supply and demand. Some clubs, such as Manchester City, also sell digital collectibles known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Most of the clubs offering fan tokens have signed up to a company called Socios that organises the initial sale and subsequent trading of the virtual coins - but other platforms, including Binance and Bitci, are growing too. Listen toTech Tent: When crypto met footballon BBC Sounds. Socios told BBC News it had sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app. It would not say how much money goes directly to clubs. Buyers must first convert their money into the company's own crypto-currency, Chiliz. The research, by crypto-analysts Protos, suggests many buyers are speculatively trading their tokens like other crypto-currencies in an attempt to make money. But the value of many fan tokens had decreased since they were initially sold by the clubs. BBC News asked every Premier League team and some major European sides about their plans for, and views on, the new trend. Only one was happy to comment. A Brighton and Hove Albion spokesman said: ""We have not sold these products and have no plans to enter these markets."" What are the fan tokens given to Messi by PSG? What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? Twelve-year-old boy makes Â£290,000 from whale NFTs Since crypto-currency products are based on a public ledger, known as the blockchain, Protos was able to determine: Lazio, Manchester City, Porto, and Santos appeared to generate the most sales the fan tokens to have generated the most revenue were Lazio's - up to $130m Manchester City and Lazio tokens had dropped the most in value - down 50% and 70% since the end of the first day of trading the tokens of two clubs, Inter Milan and Turkish side Trabzonspor, had increased in value more than Bitcoin over the past year ""Fan tokens are being traded more actively than you'd expect for this type of fan-engagement product,"" Protos director of news David Canellis said. ""Generally, small crypto-currencies like these fan tokens can be incredibly volatile due to the small amount of people who want to trade them. ""Speculators know this, so I would consider much of the trade in fan-token markets to be powered purely by speculators seeking short-term profits."" Socios disputed the claim that many of its users were speculators, saying that the ""vast majority"" held tokens to engage with their clubs, with ""most holding just a few tokens"". Another criticism of the current system is clubs hold on to the vast majority of tokens, rather than selling them to fans, which distorts the market. Trading is a prominent part of the Socios 'fan tokens' app The value of tokens held by the top 13 clubs together exceeds $1.9bn - but individual buyers currently hold only $376m worth. On average, clubs control 80% of their fan tokens' supply. ""Clubs themselves must balance not selling too much at once"" Mr Canellis said. ""If they sell too much at once, they run the risk of crashing the price. ""We can clearly see this happening with the Lazio, FC Porto, Santos FC, and Manchester City sales."" Some fan groups are also worried about exploitation. ""My knowledge of the crypto market is sketchy to say the least - and I'm probably representative of a large number of run-of-the-mill football supporters who are not traders on the crypto market,"" Sue Watson, who chairs the West Ham United Supporters Trust, told the BBC News's Tech Tent podcast. ""It's not regulated, it's not secure and I question what protection clubs have in place for their supporters."" The Socios app has club-token information organised like other crypto marketplaces, with price fluctuations displayed and prominent buy and sell buttons. But Max Rabinovitch, from Socios, said the system was designed to reward fans who held on to tokens rather than trading them. Offers such as ""permanent 5% discounts in the digital shop, possibilities to win tickets"" were more important to fans than making ""five or ten bucks"" selling their tokens, he said. ""There's no value to be had from trading,"" Mr Rabinovitch said. ""If you want to gather up loyalty points for a team, if you want to vote for the team, you always have that token to use. ""The entire point is buy it and hold it."" The benefits offered to token holders are decided by the clubs. But Mr Rabinovitch said he wants clubs to offer more meaningful perks than votes on minor issues such as ""what song should we play in the stadium as the players walk out"". Another way clubs are getting into crypto products is through NFTs or Non-fungible Tokens. Manchester City, Rangers and Juventus have all issued official NFTs, with some spending tens of thousands on these unique digital images and videos with built in code representing owenrship. One, millionaire NFT collector Mike Bousis, said he had spent about $40,000 on five of these. Public records indicate Manchester City made $80,000 from two sets of NFTs ""When I saw the release of Manchester City NFTs, I had to have it,"" Mr Bousis said. ""I always liked Man City - I like the team, their flash and pizzazz - and I thought it was a cool thing to buy and to have. ""I own it - it's mine, I can display it anywhere I like - and it's a piece of art."" The National Basketball Association (NBA), in the US, was one of the first sports organisations to sell NFTs, offering video clips of basketball games. But Protos research shows the value of these TopShot NFTs has dropped by 90% since early 2021. Companies such as Sorareare also offering collectable and playable football-player cards as NFTs These are increasing in popularity, with $142m spent by fans since their launch, in April 2019, Protos data shows. And sale prices have stayed steady all year. But football writer Martin Calladine said supporters should be cautious about investing in NFTs - and fan tokens. ""The thing about crypto-currency is it's unregulated,"" he said. ""It's the only product being endorsed in football which has no legal oversight. ""Don't buy into it because you sense that it could be a way of making money. ""Some people are going to be making a lot of money out of it - but it almost certainly isn't going to be the average football fan on the street.""

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data.

Cambo oil field development being paused,"The firm behind the controversial Cambo oil field off Shetland is ""pausing"" the project, BBC Scotland has learned. Siccar Point Energy's decision comes a week afterShell pulled outof the North Atlantic development. Forty four contractors - 29 in Aberdeen and 15 in Singapore -  are set to lose their jobs. Its 37 permanent staff are not affected. The firm said Shell's announcement meant the project could not progress on the ""originally planned timescale"". Chief executive officer Jonathan Roger said: ""We are pausing the development while we evaluate next steps."" ""We continue to believe Cambo is a robust project that can play an important part of the UK's energy security, providing homegrown energy supply and reducing carbon intensive imports, whilst supporting a just transition,"" he added. Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? The move has been welcomed by climate change campaigners who have long been critical of the project. Greenpeace called on the UK and Scottish governments to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure. However concerns have been raised about the security of gas supplies, and energy worker jobs. Approval from the UK government is needed to develop the field. Located in the North Atlantic, about 125km (75 miles) north west of the Shetland islands. Major stakeholder is Siccar Point Energy, with a 70% stake, backed by private equity firm investors. Siccar Point Energy says Cambo could deliver 170 million barrels of oil over 25 years, and 53.5 billion cubic feet of gas. The exploration licences dates back to 2001, but UK government must approve drilling - which could start as early as 2022. The UK government Department for Business said that while this was ""ultimately a commercial decision"" by Siccar Point Energy, it was committed to the domestic offshore oil and gas sector. Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeonsaid Cambo ""should not get the green light"". She had previously called for the development to be reassessed, but had stopped short of opposing it outright. But she told MSPs: ""I don't think we can go on extracting oil and gas forever, and I don't think we can continue to give the go-ahead to new oil fields."" Responding to Siccar Point Energy's decision, Sam Chetan-Welsh of Greenpeace UK said: ""The economics of Cambo were looking decidedly shaky, and the climate maths never did make sense. ""Both the Westminster and Scottish government now need to end support for new oil and gas infrastructure."" Today's decision definitely makes it less likely that the controversial Cambo field will be developed but it does not kill it off. The critical move to watch is whether the consent application to the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) is withdrawn. If it isn't - and the company won't confirm their plan - then it could easily be 'unpaused' at a later date. Even if it is, there's nothing to stop it being revived once the dust settles. This project has been a key test of the apparent contradictions of the UK government and whether or not is will support new oil and gas while also promoting a transition to renewables. Only they can kill it off completely. But politically they'll be hoping they don't have to make that decision. Friends of the Earth Scotland's head of campaigns Mary Church described it as ""another nail in the coffin"" for Cambo oil field. ""The UK government must officially reject the Cambo proposal once and for all,"" she said. Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which has been campaigning against Cambo, said it was yet another signal that the project needed to be rejected. And Scottish Greens climate spokesman Mark Ruskell said it should not come as a surprise that Cambo was looking ""increasingly unlikely"". Activists at the COP26 summit called for the Cambo development to be blocked However industry body Oil and Gas UK insisted developments such as Cambo are still needed. OGUK's supply chain and operations director Katy Heidenreich said: ""Continued investment will be required to avoid increasing reliance on imported energy, protect security of supply and deliver a homegrown energy transition."" Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative spokesman for net zero and energy, said: ""This announcement from Siccar Point Energy is extremely concerning for the oil and gas industry. ""Without investment in these projects, we risk becoming even more dependent on foreign imports rather than making use of Scotland's domestic reserves of oil and gas."" And Gary Smith, general secretary of the GMB union, said:  ""It's meant to be a transition to a low carbon economy, not a surrender of the national interest. ""The cheerleaders for Cambo's shutdown aren't just throwing energy workers under the bus, but also our security of supply for the gas we will still need on the road to 2050."" Shell had faced widespread criticism over its 30% stake in Cambo. Announcing its decision to pull out of the development last week, it said it believed the economic case for investment was ""not strong enough"".

Economic growth stutters before impact of Omicron,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in October, official figures show, despite a strong performance by the health sector and second-hand car sales. A fall in people dining out in restaurants and reductions in oil extraction and gas use meant growth came in lower than expected. Growth was stalling even before the emergence of the Omicron variant. One economist said the figures showed the ""steam has well and truly been taken out of the UK economic recovery"". Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International, warned October might be the ""closest the economy gets to reaching 'normal levels' until deep into 2022"". ""Supply chain issues, worker shortages and surging inflation put the dampeners on growth in October,"" she said. Ms Currie added there was a ""creeping sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"" over the impact Covid was having on the economy, with the government reintroducing somecoronavirus restrictions in a bid to limit the spread of the new variant. ""Workers are heading back to their kitchen tables and the big festive season that retailers and the hospitality sector had their hopes pinned on - while starting on a high during Black Friday - might not have as much sparkle as hoped,"" she said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy was still 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels, but added the services sector had returned to pre-pandemic levels. That has been driven a growth in GP face-to-face appointments, and an increase in staff employed in cleaning, building and security jobs. Art and entertainment services also increased as theatres full reopened. The slower overall economic growth has led to predictions the Bank of England will not put up interest rates next week. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said although a rate rise couldn't be completely ruled out, ""most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon"", given the latest economic figures and uncertainty surrounding the Omicron coronavirus variant. She said a rate rise in February was ""more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then"", unless further Covid restrictions were put in place. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC said the latest figures on the economy were ""a little bit weaker than expected"", with economists expecting a 0.4% rise in October. In September, economic growth was 0.6%. Ms Martins told the Today programme the ""economy was stuttering a little bit"", despite the emergence of Omicron, which was largely due to supply chain issues and material and product shortages. ""It's public sector services, like those GP appointments, that's driving growth,"" she added. ""So, a little bit of private sector weakness here, no growth in manufacturing, and a fall in construction. ""The recovery is on pause in December at least, and hopefully we'll be able to restart in the New Year."" The ONS said the strong services output was due to the ""continued rise"" of face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries in England. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Read more about GDP here. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said the ""UK health sector again grew strongly while second-hand car sales and employment agencies also boosted the economy"". However, Mr Fitzner said the construction industry saw its biggest drop since April 2020, with ""notable falls in house building and infrastructure work, ""partly driven by shortages in raw materials"". Though the health sector was the main driver behind October's growth in services, other industries such as travel and entertainment also increased. Responding to the figures, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said the government had ""always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery"". ""We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low,"" he added. While you always have to be cautious not to over-interpret the official ONS estimates for economic growth over just one month, if the figures are borne out they show the economy slowing almost to a stop in October. This was the month that began with petrol stations that couldn't get enough petrol and energy prices jumping. It had previously been expected that the economy might be back to its pre-pandemic level by then. And remember - this is before the economy was hit by the Omicron variant and new restrictions. The chances that growth in 2021 will hit the level predicted in the Autumn Budget and Spending Review of 6.5% now look vanishingly small. And some economists are now saying it's touch-and-go whether we continue to grow in December - or head back into an economic contraction. The chances of a rise in interest rates to tame inflation in December, already low before this morning's news, are now even lower.

Economic growth stutters before impact of OmicronThe UK's economy slowed further in October despite strong growth in health services and used car sales.BusinessComments,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in October, official figures show, despite a strong performance by the health sector and second-hand car sales. A fall in people dining out in restaurants and reductions in oil extraction and gas use meant growth came in lower than expected. Growth was stalling even before the emergence of the Omicron variant. One economist said the figures showed the ""steam has well and truly been taken out of the UK economic recovery"". Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International, warned October might be the ""closest the economy gets to reaching 'normal levels' until deep into 2022"". ""Supply chain issues, worker shortages and surging inflation put the dampeners on growth in October,"" she said. Ms Currie added there was a ""creeping sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"" over the impact Covid was having on the economy, with the government reintroducing somecoronavirus restrictions in a bid to limit the spread of the new variant. ""Workers are heading back to their kitchen tables and the big festive season that retailers and the hospitality sector had their hopes pinned on - while starting on a high during Black Friday - might not have as much sparkle as hoped,"" she said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy was still 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels, but added the services sector had returned to pre-pandemic levels. That has been driven a growth in GP face-to-face appointments, and an increase in staff employed in cleaning, building and security jobs. Art and entertainment services also increased as theatres full reopened. The slower overall economic growth has led to predictions the Bank of England will not put up interest rates next week. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said although a rate rise couldn't be completely ruled out, ""most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon"", given the latest economic figures and uncertainty surrounding the Omicron coronavirus variant. She said a rate rise in February was ""more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then"", unless further Covid restrictions were put in place. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC said the latest figures on the economy were ""a little bit weaker than expected"", with economists expecting a 0.4% rise in October. In September, economic growth was 0.6%. Ms Martins told the Today programme the ""economy was stuttering a little bit"", despite the emergence of Omicron, which was largely due to supply chain issues and material and product shortages. ""It's public sector services, like those GP appointments, that's driving growth,"" she added. ""So, a little bit of private sector weakness here, no growth in manufacturing, and a fall in construction. ""The recovery is on pause in December at least, and hopefully we'll be able to restart in the New Year."" The ONS said the strong services output was due to the ""continued rise"" of face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries in England. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Read more about GDP here. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said the ""UK health sector again grew strongly while second-hand car sales and employment agencies also boosted the economy"". However, Mr Fitzner said the construction industry saw its biggest drop since April 2020, with ""notable falls in house building and infrastructure work, ""partly driven by shortages in raw materials"". Though the health sector was the main driver behind October's growth in services, other industries such as travel and entertainment also increased. Responding to the figures, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said the government had ""always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery"". ""We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low,"" he added. While you always have to be cautious not to over-interpret the official ONS estimates for economic growth over just one month, if the figures are borne out they show the economy slowing almost to a stop in October. This was the month that began with petrol stations that couldn't get enough petrol and energy prices jumping.

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal. Readherefor more details on where Covid cases are happening around the globe. Reality Check As we've been reporting, top civil servant Simon Case is to investigate allegations of government gatherings last Christmas - including two in Downing Street - while the country was in lockdown. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has been ""repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken"". But what is being examined? The investigation, announced by the PM on Wednesday will examine:  Case will look at the purpose of the events, who attended and whether rules were followed. No date has been given on when his report will be published. Take a look at how the row startedand what has happened since. Â© 2025 BBC.

So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

UK economy stutters as health sector drives growth,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in October, official figures show, despite a strong performance by the health sector and second-hand car sales. A fall in people dining out in restaurants and reductions in oil extraction and gas use meant growth came in lower than expected. Growth was stalling even before the emergence of the Omicron variant. One economist said the figures showed the ""steam has well and truly been taken out of the UK economic recovery"". Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International, warned October might be the ""closest the economy gets to reaching 'normal levels' until deep into 2022"". ""Supply chain issues, worker shortages and surging inflation put the dampeners on growth in October,"" she said. Ms Currie added there was a ""creeping sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"" over the impact Covid was having on the economy, with the government reintroducing somecoronavirus restrictions in a bid to limit the spread of the new variant. ""Workers are heading back to their kitchen tables and the big festive season that retailers and the hospitality sector had their hopes pinned on - while starting on a high during Black Friday - might not have as much sparkle as hoped,"" she said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy was still 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels, but added the services sector had returned to pre-pandemic levels. That has been driven a growth in GP face-to-face appointments, and an increase in staff employed in cleaning, building and security jobs. Art and entertainment services also increased as theatres full reopened. The slower overall economic growth has led to predictions the Bank of England will not put up interest rates next week. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said although a rate rise couldn't be completely ruled out, ""most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon"", given the latest economic figures and uncertainty surrounding the Omicron coronavirus variant. She said a rate rise in February was ""more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then"", unless further Covid restrictions were put in place. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC said the latest figures on the economy were ""a little bit weaker than expected"", with economists expecting a 0.4% rise in October. In September, economic growth was 0.6%. Ms Martins told the Today programme the ""economy was stuttering a little bit"", despite the emergence of Omicron, which was largely due to supply chain issues and material and product shortages. ""It's public sector services, like those GP appointments, that's driving growth,"" she added. ""So, a little bit of private sector weakness here, no growth in manufacturing, and a fall in construction. ""The recovery is on pause in December at least, and hopefully we'll be able to restart in the New Year."" The ONS said the strong services output was due to the ""continued rise"" of face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries in England. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Read more about GDP here. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said the ""UK health sector again grew strongly while second-hand car sales and employment agencies also boosted the economy"". However, Mr Fitzner said the construction industry saw its biggest drop since April 2020, with ""notable falls in house building and infrastructure work, ""partly driven by shortages in raw materials"". Though the health sector was the main driver behind October's growth in services, other industries such as travel and entertainment also increased. Responding to the figures, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said the government had ""always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery"". ""We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low,"" he added. While you always have to be cautious not to over-interpret the official ONS estimates for economic growth over just one month, if the figures are borne out they show the economy slowing almost to a stop in October. This was the month that began with petrol stations that couldn't get enough petrol and energy prices jumping. It had previously been expected that the economy might be back to its pre-pandemic level by then. And remember - this is before the economy was hit by the Omicron variant and new restrictions. The chances that growth in 2021 will hit the level predicted in the Autumn Budget and Spending Review of 6.5% now look vanishingly small. And some economists are now saying it's touch-and-go whether we continue to grow in December - or head back into an economic contraction. The chances of a rise in interest rates to tame inflation in December, already low before this morning's news, are now even lower. A stagnating economy, combined with rapidly rising inflation and restrictions discouraging travel, is an unpleasant prospect over Christmas both for businesses and households. Especially without any new emergency support. Second-hand car sales soar amid new model shortage UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Households face 'double-whammy' tax rise next yearCouncil tax is set to increase in many areas of England, according to BBC research.","This video can not be played Council tax increase 'is going to make people worry even more' Families are facing a ""double-whammy"" of rising bills next year, as council tax across much of England is set to increase at the same time as National Insurance, according to BBC research. Two-thirds of councils in England that responded to a BBC survey said they were considering a rise in council tax to help fund services. Many other councils said they were unable to rule it out. Working households face an increase in National Insurance from next April. The increase is to help pay for health and social care, but with the bulk of the money initially due to go to the NHS, many council leaders have told the BBC they will still face funding shortfalls and so council tax increases are inevitable. Council tax could rise by Â£220, say researchers Covid: What is council tax and should it go up in the pandemic? The Local Government Association said it could leave hard-pressed residents feeling that they are ""shelling-out twice"" for social care services. The BBC contacted 152 councils in England that are responsible for social care and 121 responded, with two-thirds saying they are considering a tax rise from next April. Final decisions will be taken after councils get more detail about the funding they will receive from government, which is expected next week. Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said: ""It will be the communities the government promised to 'level-up' who will be hit hardest - in towns and villages across the country, with older populations where people are already struggling to make ends meet. ""Instead of delivering for people in these communities, the government's 'double whammy' National Insurance and council tax will leave people worse off."" Ministers are likely to confirm councils can increase tax by 2%, with an additional 1% allowed for the councils which have responsibility for social care. What that means for household bills will differ from place to place, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has calculated that a 2.8% rise would add an average of around Â£40 to household bills from next April. That is less than in recent years and will mean council tax won't rise as fast as some other household bills, but the IFS says it comes after many years of above-inflation increases. Research Economist Kate Ogden said: ""The biggest uncertainty for budgets next year is probably the impact of Covid which will continue to mean falls in incomes and significant spending by councils on the public health response. ""Councils are being allowed a smaller council tax rise than they have been allowed in recent years, but they've also been promised lots of extra funding from government. ""It's hard to say whether this will be enough, although we can expect to see many councils put up their council tax bills in an attempt to stem the gap."" Employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound forNational Insurance(NI) from April 2022. But from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a newHealth and Social Care Levy. The government says the changes are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years. The Local Government Association said councils were acutely aware of the burden tax increases placed on households, but many were facing tough choices about how to raise funds. Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, said: ""In recent years, the government has relied on council tax raising powers to increase councils' core spending power. ""While council tax is an important funding stream, it has never been the solution to the long-term pressures facing our local services, raising different amounts in different parts of the country, which is not related to need. ""Increasing council tax to pay for social care is a double whammy for hard-pressed residents, who may also feel they are shelling out twice for a service now that the Health and Social Care Levy is being introduced."" Some council leaders in the north of England say relying on council tax for funding leaves them at a disadvantage because they can raise less than councils in part of the south. Paul Dennett, Labour Mayor of Salford, said: ""Different parts of the country can raise more money through council tax because they have properties that are in higher council tax bands paying more in council tax, but also different parts of the country have different demands on services. ""Salford is the 18th most deprived area in the country, and as a consequence of that the demand for public services is higher in places like Salford than it is in other parts of the country."" The government said councils are responsible for setting tax levels, and local people have the ability to veto excessive rises through referendums. MPs back change to social care funding in England Social care changes at-a-glance A spokesman said: ""We are committed to reforming health and social care and are investing an additional Â£5.4bn over three years, with Â£1bn allocated, to improve the lives of those who receive care. ""We are also providing an additional Â£1.6bn in core local government funding in each year of the next Spending Review, which will allow councils to increase their spending on vital public services, such as Children's and Adults Social Care, to ensure they respond effectively to rising demand."" The leaders of England's largest councils - many of which are Tory-led - have warned that even with extra funding from government they are still facing a shortfall of over Â£500m next year and so will have to ""reluctantly"" raise council tax to keep services running. Cllr Tim Oliver, chairman of the County Councils Network and Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said that many councils will face a gap in their finances. ""We recognise that our residents will be feeling the pinch after a tough 18 months with the cost of living rising, whilst some may be facing uncertain employment prospects,"" he said. ""County residents already pay the highest rates and those county leaders that do propose rises of the maximum permitted will be doing so as they have little choice other than to substantively reduce local services.""

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule. ""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue.

""We shouldn't have reached the point where we are confronted
with a winter surge, especially with the vaccine at our
disposal, and I share many New Yorkers' frustration that we are
not past this pandemic yet,"" Hochul said. While about 80% of New Yorkers are fully vaccinated, the state has seen a surge in cases in recent weeks. The state-wide seven-day average has seen cases rise by 43% since the Thanksgiving holidays last month and hospitalisations have increased by 29%. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Volunteers wearing PPE arrange food supplies at a residential block which is under Covid restrictions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province of China There
have only been 37 cases of Covid-19 confirmed today in China. However,
there are reports on how China has taken steps to tighten its border with
Vietnam amid fresh concerns that cases of the virus could spill over from the country. There
have been reports in the last week about how two people illegally entered Chinaâs
Guangxi, and tested positive for Covid-19. This is the region that borders
Vietnam. In
recent months, China has already taken steps to tighten its borders with
Myanmar, Mongolia and Russia, after spates of cases were confirmed at cities
close to their borders. Even
though two cases spilling over from Vietnam may sound like a small number to
enforce tighter restrictions, China has a zero-Covid strategy, and locks down
communities the moment a single case is identified. Top medical specialists
project this strategymay be in force until the end of spring next year,external. However,
China is already close to meeting its local threshold for herd immunity. There
have been more than 2.5bn vaccinations in the country, and at least 78.5% of
Chinaâs 1.4bn population have been fully vaccinated.
Children as young as three are eligible for vaccinations, and booster jabs are
under way in major cities. Specialists
have repeatedly said that herd immunity will equate to when 80% of the
population is vaccinated. The UK faces ""a deeply concerning situation"", Michael Gove has said, after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting on the latest Covid data. The levelling-up secretary says he and the leaders of the UK's four nations were presented with some ""very challenging new information"". After the highest number of Covid infections across the UK since January were reported today, he said: ""We know that the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England - and possibly even faster in Scotland. ""We know that 30% of reported cases in London are the Omicron variant."" The cabinet minister emphasised he thought the UK government's current approach was ""proportionate"" and said it ""absolutely"" needed to keep everything under review. He acknowledged the importance of balancing people's ability to get on with their lives with the need to protect them against Covid, but he said ""action is absolutely required"". Action is absolutely required - and as new data comes in we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data."" Michael Gove, Levelling-up secretary Smith does not believe Norwich's possible positive cases are linked to last week's defeat at Spurs, who have since been hit by an outbreak of the virus Norwich boss Dean Smith says the club are waiting anxiously on coronavirus test results before their Premier League game against Manchester United on Saturday. The Canaries' last game was a 3-0 defeat by Tottenham, who have since been hit by a coronavirus outbreak. ""There's a couple of players who we are worried about, so we have tested and we will wait for the PCR results,"" Smith says. ""They are just feeling a little bit unwell, but it is not likely to be linked to the game last week with Tottenham."" Leicester also had a number of Covid-related absences for their Europa League defeat at Napoli on Thursday. Given the rising number of positive coronavirus cases driven by the Omicron variant, and the new measures in England, thePremier League has told its 20 clubsto return to the emergency measures brought in at the start of the season. Clubs with high vaccination rates had relaxed some of them, which include social distancing and wearing masks indoors, but must now tighten restrictions again to help limit the spread of the Omicron variant. Read more This video can not be played Inside Britainâs top secret research laboratory We reported earlier on the analysis of Omicron cases in the UK - which would have been carried out by the UK's top secret laboratory. So, what happens inside the Ministry of Defence's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) - otherwise known as Porton Down? Based five miles (8km) outside Salisbury, in Wiltshire, it is highly secretive, under armed guard and is very hard to get into. And for good reason. The laboratories are where some of the country's top scientists carry out research into the world's most dangerous pathogens - diseases that can kill us. Ebola, plague and anthrax are among the life-threatening diseases under study at this secluded base. It's also where scientists analysed samples confirming that a Novichok nerve agent had been used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. In 2019, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner was given rare access to the facility. As we've reported, the UK has reported the highest number of Covid cases today since 9 January. Meanwhile, more than 22 million people have now received a booster jab in the UK. Here are the numbers in charts: UK scientists analysed data from 581 Omicron cases and thousands of Delta cases to calculate how effective the vaccines are against the new variant. It showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer. However, thethird dose increased the protection against getting Covid symptoms to between 70 and 75%, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the agency, said: ""These early estimates should be treated with caution but they indicate that a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain."" Today's data on Omicron shows how important booster jabs are, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says. âThey are our best
defence and we have turbocharged our roll-out programme, inviting seven million
more people over the age of 40 to get their booster jab so even more people get
protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he has been ""repeatedly assured that the rules were not broken"". But what is being examined?

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus stories this afternoon:  Today's live page has been edited by Paul Gribben, with Jennifer Meierhans, Emma Harrison, Jo Couzens and Matt Murphy on writing duties. Millions of Brazilians were left unable to access digital vaccine certificates after the country's health ministry was hit by a massive cyber attack on Friday. Hackers took several systems offline and posted a message on the health ministry's website saying that vaccine data had been copied and deleted. ""Contact us if
you want the data back,"" the message read, including what appeared to be the hackers' e-mail and Telegram
contact information. The health ministry said it was working to restore the systems and minister Marcelo Queiroga told reporters that no data
will be lost, claiming that the ministry still holds all the information
that was stolen by the hackers. But the attack has seen the government delay the implantation of new Covid-19 regulations by a week. The rules are set to include a rule requiring unvaccinated travellers to quarantine upon arrival in the country. Brazil is widely viewed as being wildly under-prepared for a cyber attack and earlier this year a huge data leak saw tax numbers, facial images and addresses belonging to 223 million people posted for sale on the dark web.  New York's governor has announced that face coverings must be worn in all indoor venues starting next week, as the state battles a rapidly rising number of Covid-19 cases. Kathy Hochul said the measure will come into effect on Monday and will last until 15 January. Venues that have implemented a separate vaccine requirement will be exempt from the rule.

protection from this disease,"" he says. ""I urge you to come forward as soon as youâre
eligible to help keep yourself and your loved ones safe.â So far in the UK more than 22 million people have had a booster. Read more:How can I get a booster jab? The UK Health Security Agency also says there is evidence showing that Omicron is growing much faster than Delta in England. The new variant is projected to become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December,
     based on current trends, it says. Vaccine protection against mild symptomatic disease from Omicron may be substantially reduced, new data suggests. The UK Health Security Agency says there is evidence that boosters show good effectiveness, ""although
with some reduction compared to Delta"". The new Omicron Covid variant has meant the UK's rules for self-isolation have changed. Travellers to the UK and suspected contacts of people with Omicron are among those affected. And the rules for anyone in close contact with someone who tests positive for Covid have also changed. Here's a reminder of all the UK Covid self-isolation rules now. We've got some more information now on where the new Omicron cases have been confirmed in the UK. The UK Health Security Agency says 443 additional cases of that variant have been reported acrossEngland. The total found in England so far is 1,139. InScotland, one new case has been reported, bringing the total to 110. InWales, there are four new Omicron cases, bringing the total to 13. No additional cases have been reported inNorthern Ireland, which has had three confirmed cases so far, up to 9 December. Another 448 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK, according to data from the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total to 1,265 Omicron cases in the UK. A further 58,194 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, according to the latest government statistics. This is the highest number of cases reported since 9 January, when there were 59,937. Another 120 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been recorded. âConcert hallsâ are included in new rules for England,externalwhich mean visitors to most public indoor venues must wear a face covering. So, audience members at a gig need to wear masks, as do staff. However, face coverings are not currently required in places such as pubs and bars as âthey cannot be worn while eating or drinkingâ. So, you can remove your mask if you are eating or drinking in a separate bar area at the venue. However, if you want to buy a drink to take away from the bar - into an auditorium, for example - you must keep your mask on, except for when drinking. Separately, proof of your Covid status â via the NHS Covid Pass or proof of a negative Covid test - will be required at some venues from 15 December. Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people are included, but a gig for about 200 people would not be. You could double-check how many people will be going by asking the venue. We've answered more of your questions here All adults arriving in Ghana must show proof of full Covid vaccination from midnight on Sunday - authorities there are concerned about a surge of infections over the festive period. These measures appear to be some of the strictest in the world. Many other countries such as members ofthe European Union,externalandthe United States,externalhave avoided an outright blanket ban on unvaccinated arrivals by giving such travellers the option of self-isolating on arrival. Ghanaian citizens and residents abroad are exempt for up to two weeks, but will be required to get jabbed upon landing at the airport.. Alongside the new measures, Ghanaian authorities will also still insist that all arrivals present a negative PCR test. All Ghanaians flying out of the country willalso need to be fully vaccinated. South Africa will next month start giving Pfizer booster jabs against coronavirus, a health official says, a day after the country reported a near-record high in daily cases. The more transmissible Omicron variant was first discovered by South African scientists. Pfizer says three doses of its vaccine provide asimilar level of antibodies against Omicronto that of two doses against other variants. Dr Nicolas Crisp, director general at the health ministry, tells a weekly news conference the first people who will qualify for the booster dose in South Africa will be those over the age of 60. The daily number of new Covid infections in the country surged to a high of 22,391 on Thursday, when nearly 30 per cent of tests were positive. The highest daily tally so far was in early July, when the country hit more 26,000 new infections. South Africa is the worst-hit country in the continent for coronavirus, recording a cumulative 3.09 million cases, of which over 90,000 have been fatal.

"Beauticians breaking under-18s law on lip fillersSome practitioners are offering underage lip fillers on social media, a BBC investigation has found.Health","Some beauty practitioners are illegally offering lip fillers on social media, the BBC has found. It isagainst the lawfor under-18s to receive dermal fillers for cosmetic reasons in England. This includes making an appointment or agreeing to undertake the procedure for underage clients via online sites. Following this investigation, Facebook says it has introduced measures which will make it harder for users to search for lip treatments. Currently no qualifications are required to buy or inject filler, which can add volume and fill lines in areas like the lips or cheeks. The age restriction was put in place two months ago to protect teenagers from an industrydescribed as the ""wild west"". Cosmetic doctors say aesthetic work for under-18s is ""completely unnecessary"" and can cause mental harm if things go wrong. Physical complications include infection, lumps, bruising, scarring and even blindness. The BBC investigated how the law was working by creating a Facebook profile named ""Jennie May"". It included a unique image of a 16-year-old girl generated by an Artificial Intelligence (AI) programme. Facebook says listings on its Marketplace must not promote the sale of cosmetic procedures such as fillers. But ""Jennie"" was able to contact more than 200 practitioners. The message requested a lip filler appointment so she could ""feel confident"" for her upcoming 17th birthday. While the majority of the 184 respondents refused the request, more than one in five who replied said they were willing to treat underage ""Jennie"". Responding to the BBC's findings, a Facebook spokesperson has confirmed ""search terms"" have now been ""blocked"" and listings which violate its guidelines will be removed.

She had wanted the procedure for two years because she didn't like the fact that her gums were visible when she smiled. Like the majority of patients, she found her practitioner on social media - a woman who was offering cheap treatments because she was still in training. Liv says: ""It did hurt, but afterwards the practitioner held the mirror up and I loved how they looked. She said, 'you're going to be addicted now'."" Now aged 19, Liv doesn't think she's addicted, but she has visited multiple practitioners for more lip treatments as well as getting filler injected into her cheeks, jaw and chin. Some work was free or at a discounted price because she agreed to share her experiences with her tens of thousands of followers on social media. ""It'll usually be a lot cheaper and it's obviously directed at young people who probably have less money. It attracts them to come forward and be like, 'you can practice on my lips'."" On one occasion Liv was in so much pain that she cried and walked out of the appointment with filler only in her top lip. She says it is wrong young girls are being used as ""test dummies"" and she now will only go to qualified practitioners. Liv supports the ban, but understands the pressure teenagers feel to look a certain way. ""When I got my lips done at 16 it didn't feel wrong,"" she explains. ""You look at someone getting all these likes on social media and you think 'I'm going to make myself look like that because that's what everyone wants me to look like.'

Dozens of English councils eyeing council tax rise,"This video can not be played Council tax increase 'is going to make people worry even more' Families are facing a ""double-whammy"" of rising bills next year, as council tax across much of England is set to increase at the same time as National Insurance, according to BBC research. Two-thirds of councils in England that responded to a BBC survey said they were considering a rise in council tax to help fund services. Many other councils said they were unable to rule it out. Working households face an increase in National Insurance from next April. The increase is to help pay for health and social care, but with the bulk of the money initially due to go to the NHS, many council leaders have told the BBC they will still face funding shortfalls and so council tax increases are inevitable. Council tax could rise by Â£220, say researchers Covid: What is council tax and should it go up in the pandemic? The Local Government Association said it could leave hard-pressed residents feeling that they are ""shelling-out twice"" for social care services. The BBC contacted 152 councils in England that are responsible for social care and 121 responded, with two-thirds saying they are considering a tax rise from next April. Final decisions will be taken after councils get more detail about the funding they will receive from government, which is expected next week. Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said: ""It will be the communities the government promised to 'level-up' who will be hit hardest - in towns and villages across the country, with older populations where people are already struggling to make ends meet. ""Instead of delivering for people in these communities, the government's 'double whammy' National Insurance and council tax will leave people worse off."" Ministers are likely to confirm councils can increase tax by 2%, with an additional 1% allowed for the councils which have responsibility for social care. What that means for household bills will differ from place to place, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has calculated that a 2.8% rise would add an average of around Â£40 to household bills from next April. That is less than in recent years and will mean council tax won't rise as fast as some other household bills, but the IFS says it comes after many years of above-inflation increases. Research Economist Kate Ogden said: ""The biggest uncertainty for budgets next year is probably the impact of Covid which will continue to mean falls in incomes and significant spending by councils on the public health response. ""Councils are being allowed a smaller council tax rise than they have been allowed in recent years, but they've also been promised lots of extra funding from government. ""It's hard to say whether this will be enough, although we can expect to see many councils put up their council tax bills in an attempt to stem the gap."" Employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound forNational Insurance(NI) from April 2022. But from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a newHealth and Social Care Levy. The government says the changes are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years. The Local Government Association said councils were acutely aware of the burden tax increases placed on households, but many were facing tough choices about how to raise funds. Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, said: ""In recent years, the government has relied on council tax raising powers to increase councils' core spending power. ""While council tax is an important funding stream, it has never been the solution to the long-term pressures facing our local services, raising different amounts in different parts of the country, which is not related to need. ""Increasing council tax to pay for social care is a double whammy for hard-pressed residents, who may also feel they are shelling out twice for a service now that the Health and Social Care Levy is being introduced."" Some council leaders in the north of England say relying on council tax for funding leaves them at a disadvantage because they can raise less than councils in part of the south. Paul Dennett, Labour Mayor of Salford, said: ""Different parts of the country can raise more money through council tax because they have properties that are in higher council tax bands paying more in council tax, but also different parts of the country have different demands on services. ""Salford is the 18th most deprived area in the country, and as a consequence of that the demand for public services is higher in places like Salford than it is in other parts of the country."" The government said councils are responsible for setting tax levels, and local people have the ability to veto excessive rises through referendums. MPs back change to social care funding in England Social care changes at-a-glance A spokesman said: ""We are committed to reforming health and social care and are investing an additional Â£5.4bn over three years, with Â£1bn allocated, to improve the lives of those who receive care. ""We are also providing an additional Â£1.6bn in core local government funding in each year of the next Spending Review, which will allow councils to increase their spending on vital public services, such as Children's and Adults Social Care, to ensure they respond effectively to rising demand."" The leaders of England's largest councils - many of which are Tory-led - have warned that even with extra funding from government they are still facing a shortfall of over Â£500m next year and so will have to ""reluctantly"" raise council tax to keep services running. Cllr Tim Oliver, chairman of the County Councils Network and Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said that many councils will face a gap in their finances. ""We recognise that our residents will be feeling the pinch after a tough 18 months with the cost of living rising, whilst some may be facing uncertain employment prospects,"" he said. ""County residents already pay the highest rates and those county leaders that do propose rises of the maximum permitted will be doing so as they have little choice other than to substantively reduce local services.""

High Street Â£100 voucher cards deadline extended,"Many people are waiting anxiously for their post The deadline for spending the Â£100 High Street voucher has been extended until midnight Sunday 19 December, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said. By Wednesday afternoon, more than 99% of cards had been delivered, according to the Department for the Economy. Mr Lyons said ""there has been a delay"" in dispatching some cards. As the deadline for Northern Ireland's Spend Local voucher scheme nears, thousands are still waiting for their card to be delivered. However, as more than 1.4m people have applied for a voucher, the department's spokesman said ""approximately 10,000"" cards were still to be received. Mr Lyons said the deadline ""was tight for some people"" but he is ""convinced we will get those extra cards out to people"". He toldBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programmethat over 10,000 cards will be dispatched this week and ""they will get to people over the next few days"". ""Some applicants submitted evidence late, some errors were made and some duplicate applications were made and those had to be verified before they were sent out,"" he said. He said Â£118m has been injected into the local economy since the scheme began. He added the scheme has helped increase the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland to their highest point so far compared to pre-pandemic levels. ""It gives a few days to get out and get them spent - it's in our interest and in business' interest to get money back into local economy and get those cards spent,"" he added. Thousands waiting for High Street Â£100 voucher Advice group 'being called all time' over card problems Retail NI chief Glyn Roberts said ""it was only right"" the minister extended the deadline because there was ""a small but significant amount of cards that hadn't been dispatched"". ""This is a very short-term boost for many of those traders, but it still helps them, as a lot of retailers are still trying to pay off the last lockdown,"" Mr Roberts told BBC Radio Foyle.. Every resident in Northern Ireland aged 18 and over has been offered a Â£100 voucher from the Northern Ireland Executive, in an effort to encourage consumer spending and give the local economy a boost. The Â£145m High Street voucher scheme was introduced by Stormont ministers to help bricks-and-mortar businesses recover from the disruption to trade caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The aim was to increase footfall in high streets, which have been badly affected by lockdowns, but the cards can be spent in a variety of businesses. The pre-paid cards have been arriving through letterboxes since early October Just over 1.436m applications have been received to date by Stormont's Department for Economy, which is responsible for running the voucher scheme. At the outset, the department had estimated about 1.4m people would qualify under its rules. By Wednesday afternoon, 1,339,500 people had been ""approved"" for a Spend Local card - just 500 short of the department's 1.4m estimate. A spokesman for the Department for the Economy said more than 99% of cards had been delivered. On Thursday, the department said cards have been delivered to 99% of applicants and 10,000 cards are currently out for delivery this week. It said the delay in dispatching some cards is due to a number of reasons including applicants submitting evidence late; errors in applications; late submissions and some applications identified as duplicates before being verified. The High Street voucher schemeopened for applications on 27 September and saw huge demandin the early days of operation, with almost 500,000 requests on the first day. The original cut-off date for spending the voucher had been 30 November, but that deadline was later extended to 19 December after problems administering some cards. In total, the public as a whole were given just over 11 weeks to spend their voucher. However, not everyone received their cards as quickly as had been expected and many are still waiting. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has been promoting the voucher scheme in recent weeks There have been several problems administering the unprecedented scheme which has delayed the delivery of thousands of the requested vouchers. At the start, the department said cards were expected to arrive by post between seven and 10 days after an application was submitted, with everyone getting at least a month to spend the money. However, there were initial problems with the application page on the NI Direct website with some users complaining the site crashed after 500,000 people tried to apply on the first day. By late October, thedepartment said it could not automatically verify the identity of about 100,000 applicants,externalfrom existing data and had to contact them to request more information. There have also been complaints from a small number of users whose cards were rejected when they tried to pay in shops and other businesses. Last month,the charity Advice NI said it was taking phone calls ""all the time""from people having problems with the Â£100 Spend Local cards. The department said some of the reasons for delays included applications being incorrectly identified as duplicates. It also received 1,500 late submissions. ""To date more than Â£118m has been injected into the local economy as a result of this scheme,"" the Department for the Economy said in a statement on Wednesday. It added: ""Encouraging figures from the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium have also shown that footfall on our high streets has significantly improved compared to other areas of the UK."" Spend Local cards can be used to pay for goods and services at any business with a premises in Northern Ireland, as long as they have the equipment to accept card transactions. However, the cards cannot be used for online shopping or to fund gambling. They also cannot be used to withdraw cash or to settle fines such as parking tickets. After receiving your voucher by post, you will be issued with a PIN code which you will need in order to you use your card for the first time. After that it can be used for contactless payments. It is a matter of ""use or lose it"" as all Spend Local cards are due to expire on 19 December 2021 and cannot be used after this date. The Department for the Economy said any unspent money remaining on cards after the deadline will return to its coffers. It said it ""encourages everyone to fully spend their card right up to the scheme closing date"". Yes. The Department for the Economy stopped accepting new applications at midnight on 25 October 2021. Many applicants were also asked for extra documentation to verify their identity and the deadline for submitting this information was midnight on Friday 12 November.

Plan to ban animal trophies criticised as too slow,"Animal trophies are brought into the UK each year Conservation groups and campaigners have called on the government to move faster with plans to ban the import of animal hunting trophies. On Friday, the government published its long-awaited response to a public consultation on the issue and promised a ban. But it stopped short of naming a date when legislation would be introduced. Trophies made from hunted lions and elephants are brought into the UK each year. ""The longer it goes on, the more animals are being shot and brought back to Britain as trophies,"" Campaign to Ban Trophy Hunting founder  Eduardo Goncalves told BBC News. ""It's encouraging that the government is setting out its plans - but it's deeply frustrating that we still don't have any timetable"". Every year, hunters from the UK travel abroad, often to southern Africa, and pay thousands of pounds to legally shoot animals such as lions and elephants. With the right paperwork, they can then bring trophies, such as stuffed heads or horns, back to the UK. Announcing details of the new bill, Environment Secretary George Eustace said the legislation would go further than originally promised. The import ban would include not just endangered and threatened species but also more than 1,000 others, such as zebra and reindeer. Animals such as elephants are hunted for trophies to be displayed in the UK ""This would be one of the toughest bans in the world, and goes beyond our manifesto commitment,"" Mr Eustace said. ""We will be leading the way in protecting endangered animals and helping to strengthen and support long-term conservation."" In 2020, despite the pandemic restricting travel, elephant tusks, hippo skulls, lion, baboon and giraffe were among the trophies legally brought back to the UK from southern Africa, the latest, incomplete data shows. And between 2015 and 2019, there were 335 documented imports of trophies from animals covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the government report says. Banning trophy hunting 'doesn't protect animals' When is it hunting and when is it poaching? Trophy hunting removes 'good genes' A ban on the import of hunting trophies was included in the Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto and the Queen's Speech that followed and has been mentioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson several times in Parliament. But asked in early December when the legislation would be brought to Parliament, Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg replied: ""In the fullness of time."" On Friday, Labour MP John Spellar will table a private member's bill that would ban the import of trophies - but it has little chance of success without government backing. ""The public will be rightly outraged by dither and delay,"" Mr Spellar said. ""It's time to put an end to this vile trade once and for all. ""The government should either allow my private member's bill to progress or rapidly introduce its own legislation."" This video can not be played On frontline with Kenya's anti-poaching force But although 86% of the 44,000 responses to the public consultation called for tighter restrictions on the import of hunting trophies and a ban has cross-party support in the Commons, some conservationists say hunting provides funds that can be used to protect endangered animals and their habitats. ""This decision is a triumph of propaganda over science, and prejudice over evidence,"" Christopher Graffius, from the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, told BBC News. ""What aid will the government give to replace income from hunting to seriously economically and environmentally challenged communities around the world? ""This ban will be bad for animals, people and the land they live on."" .

Breaking|Breaking newsUK economic growth slows to 0.1% in OctoberThe economy grew by 0.9% between August and October as the UK continues to recover from the pandemic.Business,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in October, official figures show, despite a strong performance by the health sector and second-hand car sales. A fall in people dining out in restaurants and reductions in oil extraction and gas use meant growth came in lower than expected. Growth was stalling even before the emergence of the Omicron variant. One economist said the figures showed the ""steam has well and truly been taken out of the UK economic recovery"". Maike Currie, investment director at Fidelity International, warned October might be the ""closest the economy gets to reaching 'normal levels' until deep into 2022"". ""Supply chain issues, worker shortages and surging inflation put the dampeners on growth in October,"" she said. Ms Currie added there was a ""creeping sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu"" over the impact Covid was having on the economy, with the government reintroducing somecoronavirus restrictions in a bid to limit the spread of the new variant. ""Workers are heading back to their kitchen tables and the big festive season that retailers and the hospitality sector had their hopes pinned on - while starting on a high during Black Friday - might not have as much sparkle as hoped,"" she said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the economy was still 0.5% below pre-pandemic levels, but added the services sector had returned to pre-pandemic levels. That has been driven a growth in GP face-to-face appointments, and an increase in staff employed in cleaning, building and security jobs. Art and entertainment services also increased as theatres full reopened. The slower overall economic growth has led to predictions the Bank of England will not put up interest rates next week. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said although a rate rise couldn't be completely ruled out, ""most bets are off that the Bank will push them up so soon"", given the latest economic figures and uncertainty surrounding the Omicron coronavirus variant. She said a rate rise in February was ""more likely to be on the table, as the inflation kettle is set to be whistling loudly by then"", unless further Covid restrictions were put in place. Liz Martins, UK economist at HSBC said the latest figures on the economy were ""a little bit weaker than expected"", with economists expecting a 0.4% rise in October. In September, economic growth was 0.6%. Ms Martins told the Today programme the ""economy was stuttering a little bit"", despite the emergence of Omicron, which was largely due to supply chain issues and material and product shortages. ""It's public sector services, like those GP appointments, that's driving growth,"" she added. ""So, a little bit of private sector weakness here, no growth in manufacturing, and a fall in construction. ""The recovery is on pause in December at least, and hopefully we'll be able to restart in the New Year."" The ONS said the strong services output was due to the ""continued rise"" of face-to-face appointments at GP surgeries in England. GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Read more about GDP here. Grant Fitzner, ONS chief economist, said the ""UK health sector again grew strongly while second-hand car sales and employment agencies also boosted the economy"". However, Mr Fitzner said the construction industry saw its biggest drop since April 2020, with ""notable falls in house building and infrastructure work, ""partly driven by shortages in raw materials"". Though the health sector was the main driver behind October's growth in services, other industries such as travel and entertainment also increased. Responding to the figures, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak said the government had ""always acknowledged there could be bumps on our road to recovery"". ""We have still been recovering quicker than expected, with more employees on payrolls than ever before and redundancies remaining low,"" he added. While you always have to be cautious not to over-interpret the official ONS estimates for economic growth over just one month, if the figures are borne out they show the economy slowing almost to a stop in October. This was the month that began with petrol stations that couldn't get enough petrol and energy prices jumping. It had previously been expected that the economy might be back to its pre-pandemic level by then. And remember - this is before the economy was hit by the Omicron variant and new restrictions. The chances that growth in 2021 will hit the level predicted in the Autumn Budget and Spending Review of 6.5% now look vanishingly small. And some economists are now saying it's touch-and-go whether we continue to grow in December - or head back into an economic contraction. The chances of a rise in interest rates to tame inflation in December, already low before this morning's news, are now even lower. A stagnating economy, combined with rapidly rising inflation and restrictions discouraging travel, is an unpleasant prospect over Christmas both for businesses and households. Especially without any new emergency support. Second-hand car sales soar amid new model shortage UK growth slows as supply issues hit the recovery How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Football fans spending millions on crypto-tokensSupporters have spent at least Â£260m on controversial fan tokens from major clubs, data suggests.Technology","FC Barcelona and Juventus FC are selling fan tokens Football clubs have potentially made hundreds of millions of pounds selling controversial crypto ""fan tokens"". Analysis commissioned by BBC News estimates more than Â£262m ($350m) has been spent on the virtual currencies. Some of the tokens are marketed as offering real-world perks to the buyer. But critics say these perks are insignificant - one offered the chance to vote for songs to be played in stadiums - and clubs have insufficient protection for supporters. So far, across the five major European leagues 24 different clubs have launched or are considering fan tokens, including eight Premier League sides. Most offer tokens akin to a club-specific crypto-currency - virtual coins can be bought and sold and their value rise and fall depending on supply and demand. Some clubs, such as Manchester City, also sell digital collectibles known as NFTs (non-fungible tokens). Most of the clubs offering fan tokens have signed up to a company called Socios that organises the initial sale and subsequent trading of the virtual coins - but other platforms, including Binance and Bitci, are growing too. Listen toTech Tent: When crypto met footballon BBC Sounds. Socios told BBC News it had sold $270m-300m worth of coins through its app. It would not say how much money goes directly to clubs. Buyers must first convert their money into the company's own crypto-currency, Chiliz. The research, by crypto-analysts Protos, suggests many buyers are speculatively trading their tokens like other crypto-currencies in an attempt to make money. But the value of many fan tokens had decreased since they were initially sold by the clubs. BBC News asked every Premier League team and some major European sides about their plans for, and views on, the new trend. Only one was happy to comment. A Brighton and Hove Albion spokesman said: ""We have not sold these products and have no plans to enter these markets."" What are the fan tokens given to Messi by PSG? What are NFTs and why are some worth millions? Twelve-year-old boy makes Â£290,000 from whale NFTs Since crypto-currency products are based on a public ledger, known as the blockchain, Protos was able to determine: Lazio, Manchester City, Porto, and Santos appeared to generate the most sales the fan tokens to have generated the most revenue were Lazio's - up to $130m Manchester City and Lazio tokens had dropped the most in value - down 50% and 70% since the end of the first day of trading the tokens of two clubs, Inter Milan and Turkish side Trabzonspor, had increased in value more than Bitcoin over the past year ""Fan tokens are being traded more actively than you'd expect for this type of fan-engagement product,"" Protos director of news David Canellis said. ""Generally, small crypto-currencies like these fan tokens can be incredibly volatile due to the small amount of people who want to trade them. ""Speculators know this, so I would consider much of the trade in fan-token markets to be powered purely by speculators seeking short-term profits."" Socios disputed the claim that many of its users were speculators, saying that the ""vast majority"" held tokens to engage with their clubs, with ""most holding just a few tokens"". Another criticism of the current system is clubs hold on to the vast majority of tokens, rather than selling them to fans, which distorts the market. Trading is a prominent part of the Socios 'fan tokens' app The value of tokens held by the top 13 clubs together exceeds $1.9bn - but individual buyers currently hold only $376m worth. On average, clubs control 80% of their fan tokens' supply. ""Clubs themselves must balance not selling too much at once"" Mr Canellis said. ""If they sell too much at once, they run the risk of crashing the price. ""We can clearly see this happening with the Lazio, FC Porto, Santos FC, and Manchester City sales."" Some fan groups are also worried about exploitation. ""My knowledge of the crypto market is sketchy to say the least - and I'm probably representative of a large number of run-of-the-mill football supporters who are not traders on the crypto market,"" Sue Watson, who chairs the West Ham United Supporters Trust, told the BBC News's Tech Tent podcast. ""It's not regulated, it's not secure and I question what protection clubs have in place for their supporters."" The Socios app has club-token information organised like other crypto marketplaces, with price fluctuations displayed and prominent buy and sell buttons. But Max Rabinovitch, from Socios, said the system was designed to reward fans who held on to tokens rather than trading them. Offers such as ""permanent 5% discounts in the digital shop, possibilities to win tickets"" were more important to fans than making ""five or ten bucks"" selling their tokens, he said. ""There's no value to be had from trading,"" Mr Rabinovitch said. ""If you want to gather up loyalty points for a team, if you want to vote for the team, you always have that token to use. ""The entire point is buy it and hold it."" The benefits offered to token holders are decided by the clubs. But Mr Rabinovitch said he wants clubs to offer more meaningful perks than votes on minor issues such as ""what song should we play in the stadium as the players walk out"". Another way clubs are getting into crypto products is through NFTs or Non-fungible Tokens. Manchester City, Rangers and Juventus have all issued official NFTs, with some spending tens of thousands on these unique digital images and videos with built in code representing owenrship. One, millionaire NFT collector Mike Bousis, said he had spent about $40,000 on five of these. Public records indicate Manchester City made $80,000 from two sets of NFTs ""When I saw the release of Manchester City NFTs, I had to have it,"" Mr Bousis said. ""I always liked Man City - I like the team, their flash and pizzazz - and I thought it was a cool thing to buy and to have. ""I own it - it's mine, I can display it anywhere I like - and it's a piece of art."" The National Basketball Association (NBA), in the US, was one of the first sports organisations to sell NFTs, offering video clips of basketball games. But Protos research shows the value of these TopShot NFTs has dropped by 90% since early 2021. Companies such as Sorareare also offering collectable and playable football-player cards as NFTs These are increasing in popularity, with $142m spent by fans since their launch, in April 2019, Protos data shows. And sale prices have stayed steady all year. But football writer Martin Calladine said supporters should be cautious about investing in NFTs - and fan tokens. ""The thing about crypto-currency is it's unregulated,"" he said. ""It's the only product being endorsed in football which has no legal oversight. ""Don't buy into it because you sense that it could be a way of making money. ""Some people are going to be making a lot of money out of it - but it almost certainly isn't going to be the average football fan on the street.""

Dozens of councils eyeing rise in council tax,"This video can not be played Council tax increase 'is going to make people worry even more' Families are facing a ""double-whammy"" of rising bills next year, as council tax across much of England is set to increase at the same time as National Insurance, according to BBC research. Two-thirds of councils in England that responded to a BBC survey said they were considering a rise in council tax to help fund services. Many other councils said they were unable to rule it out. Working households face an increase in National Insurance from next April. The increase is to help pay for health and social care, but with the bulk of the money initially due to go to the NHS, many council leaders have told the BBC they will still face funding shortfalls and so council tax increases are inevitable. Council tax could rise by Â£220, say researchers Covid: What is council tax and should it go up in the pandemic? The Local Government Association said it could leave hard-pressed residents feeling that they are ""shelling-out twice"" for social care services. The BBC contacted 152 councils in England that are responsible for social care and 121 responded, with two-thirds saying they are considering a tax rise from next April. Final decisions will be taken after councils get more detail about the funding they will receive from government, which is expected next week. Lisa Nandy, shadow secretary of state for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said: ""It will be the communities the government promised to 'level-up' who will be hit hardest - in towns and villages across the country, with older populations where people are already struggling to make ends meet. ""Instead of delivering for people in these communities, the government's 'double whammy' National Insurance and council tax will leave people worse off."" Ministers are likely to confirm councils can increase tax by 2%, with an additional 1% allowed for the councils which have responsibility for social care. What that means for household bills will differ from place to place, but the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has calculated that a 2.8% rise would add an average of around Â£40 to household bills from next April. That is less than in recent years and will mean council tax won't rise as fast as some other household bills, but the IFS says it comes after many years of above-inflation increases. Research Economist Kate Ogden said: ""The biggest uncertainty for budgets next year is probably the impact of Covid which will continue to mean falls in incomes and significant spending by councils on the public health response. ""Councils are being allowed a smaller council tax rise than they have been allowed in recent years, but they've also been promised lots of extra funding from government. ""It's hard to say whether this will be enough, although we can expect to see many councils put up their council tax bills in an attempt to stem the gap."" Employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound forNational Insurance(NI) from April 2022. But from April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a newHealth and Social Care Levy. The government says the changes are expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. A proportion will then be moved into social care system over the next three years. The Local Government Association said councils were acutely aware of the burden tax increases placed on households, but many were facing tough choices about how to raise funds. Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association's Resources Board, said: ""In recent years, the government has relied on council tax raising powers to increase councils' core spending power. ""While council tax is an important funding stream, it has never been the solution to the long-term pressures facing our local services, raising different amounts in different parts of the country, which is not related to need. ""Increasing council tax to pay for social care is a double whammy for hard-pressed residents, who may also feel they are shelling out twice for a service now that the Health and Social Care Levy is being introduced."" Some council leaders in the north of England say relying on council tax for funding leaves them at a disadvantage because they can raise less than councils in part of the south. Paul Dennett, Labour Mayor of Salford, said: ""Different parts of the country can raise more money through council tax because they have properties that are in higher council tax bands paying more in council tax, but also different parts of the country have different demands on services. ""Salford is the 18th most deprived area in the country, and as a consequence of that the demand for public services is higher in places like Salford than it is in other parts of the country."" The government said councils are responsible for setting tax levels, and local people have the ability to veto excessive rises through referendums. MPs back change to social care funding in England Social care changes at-a-glance A spokesman said: ""We are committed to reforming health and social care and are investing an additional Â£5.4bn over three years, with Â£1bn allocated, to improve the lives of those who receive care. ""We are also providing an additional Â£1.6bn in core local government funding in each year of the next Spending Review, which will allow councils to increase their spending on vital public services, such as Children's and Adults Social Care, to ensure they respond effectively to rising demand."" The leaders of England's largest councils - many of which are Tory-led - have warned that even with extra funding from government they are still facing a shortfall of over Â£500m next year and so will have to ""reluctantly"" raise council tax to keep services running. Cllr Tim Oliver, chairman of the County Councils Network and Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said that many councils will face a gap in their finances. ""We recognise that our residents will be feeling the pinch after a tough 18 months with the cost of living rising, whilst some may be facing uncertain employment prospects,"" he said. ""County residents already pay the highest rates and those county leaders that do propose rises of the maximum permitted will be doing so as they have little choice other than to substantively reduce local services.""

People urged to cancel Christmas parties in ScotlandPublic Health Scotland said a number of outbreaks caused by Omicron were linked to Christmas parties.Scotland,"Public Health Scotland said a number of Omicron Covid outbreaks were linked to parties People in Scotland have been urged to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases of the Omicron Covid variant. Public Health Scotland said a number of outbreaks caused by Omicron were linked to Christmas parties. Dr Nick Phin, its director of Public Health Science, said postponing plans would help to ""protect ourselves"". The first minister said earlier this week that sheexpected Omicron cases to rise rapidly in Scotland. One case of the new variant was recorded on Thursday, taking the total to 109, according to the latest figures - although the actual number of cases is believed to be much higher. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Scotland had 16 coronavirus deaths and 3,196 new cases in the past 24 hours. The Public Health Scotland (PHS) announcement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnsontold a Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday that: ""We don't want people to cancel such events."" PHS said early evidence suggested that the Omicron variant is much more transmissible that previous strains of the virus. Dr Phin added: ""The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties. ""We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now."" Dr Phin said that to minimise the further spread of the virus, PHS is asking people to ""defer their Christmas parties to another time"". ""I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones,"" he said. UK Hospitality Scotland said the announcement had come ""like a bolt out of the blue"". Executive director Leon Thompson toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""There was no prior notification that Public Health Scotland would be issuing this plea to the public to cancel going out for Christmas. ""This will be setting our members reeling this evening as they will be listening to their phones ringing and seeing all the cancellations coming in by email as we speak."" Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said that Christmas trade was ""a very big deal"" Scotland's finance secretary Kate Forbes said she understood it was a blow for the hospitality sector, but said she could not offer financial help unless Westminster provided more funding. She told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I would like to be in a position to provide additional support for businesses and I've made that clear to them, but with a fixed budget I can't create money overnight. ""We have joined with the Welsh government to speak to the Treasury to see if additional funding could be made available to help businesses through this very challenging period. ""They only get the Christmas trade once a year - they didn't get it last year - it's a very big deal."" What are the rules for wearing masks? Will Scotland hit its January booster jabs target? Less than an hour before the announcement, the Scottish government's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch had told Radio Clyde that people could still hold parties if they ""do it carefully"". He said: ""The present guidance today is to be careful - don't cancel your arrangements but think about testing, think about vaccination and think about following the guidance ""But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your Christmas."" This is not a legally-enforceable  ban on Christmas parties. The Covid rules have not changed. But the advice carries the weight of Scotland's public health agency. The fear is that the Omicron variant could lead to a surge in new cases followed by a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths. The question is whether many of the people planning big parties will listen to the advice.  During lockdown, police broke up a number of parties being held in contravention of the rules. Today, the number of people in Scotland who have had booster jabs passed the two million milestone. However, more than a fifth of people aged between 18 and 30 remain completely unvaccinated. Will younger people planning a Christmas night out who have not listened to the advice on vaccination listen to advice to call off a party? Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, stressed that the PHS announcement was an appeal, rather than an instruction. She said: ""With many reports of super-spreader events - with Omicron being the cause of a lot of the transmission and linked to Christmas parties - it seems right to issue an appeal. ""It's not telling people not to have their Christmas parties but it's appealing to people's better nature, if you can, do the right thing."" Nicola Sturgeon is expected to give a televised update on Omicron in Scotland on Friday. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What are the current rules?

High Street Â£100 voucher cards deadline extendedEconomy Minister Gordon Lyons extends the deadline to spend cards until midnight on 19 December.Northern IrelandRich countries could hoard jabs over Omicron - WHOThere are concerns that booster rollouts in wealthy nations could threaten supply to poorer countries.World,"Many people are waiting anxiously for their post The deadline for spending the Â£100 High Street voucher has been extended until midnight Sunday 19 December, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has said. By Wednesday afternoon, more than 99% of cards had been delivered, according to the Department for the Economy. Mr Lyons said ""there has been a delay"" in dispatching some cards. As the deadline for Northern Ireland's Spend Local voucher scheme nears, thousands are still waiting for their card to be delivered. However, as more than 1.4m people have applied for a voucher, the department's spokesman said ""approximately 10,000"" cards were still to be received. Mr Lyons said the deadline ""was tight for some people"" but he is ""convinced we will get those extra cards out to people"". He toldBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programmethat over 10,000 cards will be dispatched this week and ""they will get to people over the next few days"". ""Some applicants submitted evidence late, some errors were made and some duplicate applications were made and those had to be verified before they were sent out,"" he said. He said Â£118m has been injected into the local economy since the scheme began. He added the scheme has helped increase the number of shoppers in Northern Ireland to their highest point so far compared to pre-pandemic levels. ""It gives a few days to get out and get them spent - it's in our interest and in business' interest to get money back into local economy and get those cards spent,"" he added. Thousands waiting for High Street Â£100 voucher Advice group 'being called all time' over card problems Retail NI chief Glyn Roberts said ""it was only right"" the minister extended the deadline because there was ""a small but significant amount of cards that hadn't been dispatched"". ""This is a very short-term boost for many of those traders, but it still helps them, as a lot of retailers are still trying to pay off the last lockdown,"" Mr Roberts told BBC Radio Foyle.. Every resident in Northern Ireland aged 18 and over has been offered a Â£100 voucher from the Northern Ireland Executive, in an effort to encourage consumer spending and give the local economy a boost. The Â£145m High Street voucher scheme was introduced by Stormont ministers to help bricks-and-mortar businesses recover from the disruption to trade caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The aim was to increase footfall in high streets, which have been badly affected by lockdowns, but the cards can be spent in a variety of businesses. The pre-paid cards have been arriving through letterboxes since early October Just over 1.436m applications have been received to date by Stormont's Department for Economy, which is responsible for running the voucher scheme. At the outset, the department had estimated about 1.4m people would qualify under its rules. By Wednesday afternoon, 1,339,500 people had been ""approved"" for a Spend Local card - just 500 short of the department's 1.4m estimate. A spokesman for the Department for the Economy said more than 99% of cards had been delivered. On Thursday, the department said cards have been delivered to 99% of applicants and 10,000 cards are currently out for delivery this week. It said the delay in dispatching some cards is due to a number of reasons including applicants submitting evidence late; errors in applications; late submissions and some applications identified as duplicates before being verified. The High Street voucher schemeopened for applications on 27 September and saw huge demandin the early days of operation, with almost 500,000 requests on the first day. The original cut-off date for spending the voucher had been 30 November, but that deadline was later extended to 19 December after problems administering some cards. In total, the public as a whole were given just over 11 weeks to spend their voucher. However, not everyone received their cards as quickly as had been expected and many are still waiting. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has been promoting the voucher scheme in recent weeks There have been several problems administering the unprecedented scheme which has delayed the delivery of thousands of the requested vouchers. At the start, the department said cards were expected to arrive by post between seven and 10 days after an application was submitted, with everyone getting at least a month to spend the money. However, there were initial problems with the application page on the NI Direct website with some users complaining the site crashed after 500,000 people tried to apply on the first day. By late October, thedepartment said it could not automatically verify the identity of about 100,000 applicants,externalfrom existing data and had to contact them to request more information. There have also been complaints from a small number of users whose cards were rejected when they tried to pay in shops and other businesses. Last month,the charity Advice NI said it was taking phone calls ""all the time""from people having problems with the Â£100 Spend Local cards. The department said some of the reasons for delays included applications being incorrectly identified as duplicates. It also received 1,500 late submissions. ""To date more than Â£118m has been injected into the local economy as a result of this scheme,"" the Department for the Economy said in a statement on Wednesday. It added: ""Encouraging figures from the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium have also shown that footfall on our high streets has significantly improved compared to other areas of the UK."" Spend Local cards can be used to pay for goods and services at any business with a premises in Northern Ireland, as long as they have the equipment to accept card transactions. However, the cards cannot be used for online shopping or to fund gambling. They also cannot be used to withdraw cash or to settle fines such as parking tickets. After receiving your voucher by post, you will be issued with a PIN code which you will need in order to you use your card for the first time. After that it can be used for contactless payments. It is a matter of ""use or lose it"" as all Spend Local cards are due to expire on 19 December 2021 and cannot be used after this date. The Department for the Economy said any unspent money remaining on cards after the deadline will return to its coffers. It said it ""encourages everyone to fully spend their card right up to the scheme closing date"". Yes. The Department for the Economy stopped accepting new applications at midnight on 25 October 2021. Many applicants were also asked for extra documentation to verify their identity and the deadline for submitting this information was midnight on Friday 12 November.

People urged to cancel Christmas parties in ScotlandPublic Health Scotland said a number of outbreaks caused by Omicron were linked to Christmas parties.,"Public Health Scotland said a number of Omicron Covid outbreaks were linked to parties People in Scotland have been urged to cancel Christmas parties due to the rising number of cases of the Omicron Covid variant. Public Health Scotland said a number of outbreaks caused by Omicron were linked to Christmas parties. Dr Nick Phin, its director of Public Health Science, said postponing plans would help to ""protect ourselves"". The first minister said earlier this week that sheexpected Omicron cases to rise rapidly in Scotland. One case of the new variant was recorded on Thursday, taking the total to 109, according to the latest figures - although the actual number of cases is believed to be much higher. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Covid: Is an office Christmas party too risky? Scotland had 16 coronavirus deaths and 3,196 new cases in the past 24 hours. The Public Health Scotland (PHS) announcement came after Prime Minister Boris Johnsontold a Downing Street press briefing on Tuesday that: ""We don't want people to cancel such events."" PHS said early evidence suggested that the Omicron variant is much more transmissible that previous strains of the virus. Dr Phin added: ""The impact of this transmissibility has been seen in recent weeks, with a number of Omicron outbreaks linked to parties. ""We still need to learn more about the severity of disease caused by Omicron and the effectiveness of vaccines, but there are important things that we can do to help protect ourselves and our families now."" Dr Phin said that to minimise the further spread of the virus, PHS is asking people to ""defer their Christmas parties to another time"". ""I appreciate that everyone is keen to celebrate this festive season, particularly after the pressures of the last twenty months, but by postponing some plans we can all do our bit to protect ourselves and our loved ones,"" he said. UK Hospitality Scotland said the announcement had come ""like a bolt out of the blue"". Executive director Leon Thompson toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: ""There was no prior notification that Public Health Scotland would be issuing this plea to the public to cancel going out for Christmas. ""This will be setting our members reeling this evening as they will be listening to their phones ringing and seeing all the cancellations coming in by email as we speak."" Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said that Christmas trade was ""a very big deal"" Scotland's finance secretary Kate Forbes said she understood it was a blow for the hospitality sector, but said she could not offer financial help unless Westminster provided more funding. She told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I would like to be in a position to provide additional support for businesses and I've made that clear to them, but with a fixed budget I can't create money overnight. ""We have joined with the Welsh government to speak to the Treasury to see if additional funding could be made available to help businesses through this very challenging period. ""They only get the Christmas trade once a year - they didn't get it last year - it's a very big deal."" What are the rules for wearing masks? Will Scotland hit its January booster jabs target? Less than an hour before the announcement, the Scottish government's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch had told Radio Clyde that people could still hold parties if they ""do it carefully"". He said: ""The present guidance today is to be careful - don't cancel your arrangements but think about testing, think about vaccination and think about following the guidance ""But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy your Christmas."" This is not a legally-enforceable  ban on Christmas parties. The Covid rules have not changed. But the advice carries the weight of Scotland's public health agency. The fear is that the Omicron variant could lead to a surge in new cases followed by a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths. The question is whether many of the people planning big parties will listen to the advice.  During lockdown, police broke up a number of parties being held in contravention of the rules. Today, the number of people in Scotland who have had booster jabs passed the two million milestone. However, more than a fifth of people aged between 18 and 30 remain completely unvaccinated. Will younger people planning a Christmas night out who have not listened to the advice on vaccination listen to advice to call off a party? Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, stressed that the PHS announcement was an appeal, rather than an instruction. She said: ""With many reports of super-spreader events - with Omicron being the cause of a lot of the transmission and linked to Christmas parties - it seems right to issue an appeal. ""It's not telling people not to have their Christmas parties but it's appealing to people's better nature, if you can, do the right thing."" Nicola Sturgeon is expected to give a televised update on Omicron in Scotland on Friday. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What are the current rules?
