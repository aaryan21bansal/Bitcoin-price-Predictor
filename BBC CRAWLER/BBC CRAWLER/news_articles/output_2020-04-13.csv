"New York explores reopening as cases 'plateau'""The state boundaries mean very little to this virus,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday.","This video can not be played Governor Andrew Cuomo: 'We don't have a king, we have a president' New York Governor Andrew Cuomo accused President Donald Trump of ""spoiling for a fight"", as the US leader lashed out at ""Democrat Governors"". Several states, including New York, have begun cautious talks on reopening, but Mr Trump has claimed he has ""total"" power to lift virus lockdowns. Mr Cuomo refuted the claim on Tuesday as Mr Trump took to Twitter to criticise the governor. The US is the epicentre of the pandemic with 592,743 cases and 25,239 deaths. New York state has the most cases, with almost 190,000 cases and over 10,000 deaths. However, it has seen signs of improvement, with the number of people hospitalised due to coronavirus falling for the first time on Tuesday. On Monday, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that deciding when to reopen states was ""the decision of the president"", not state governors, although he added that he would make his decision ""in conjunction with governors"". The US Constitution says that states maintain public order and safety. So far, it has been individual state governors who have issued lockdown or shelter-in-place orders. Also on Monday, several US state governors discussed plans to resume economic activity without apparent input from the Trump administration. Ten states - seven on the East Coast, led by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, and three on the West Coast, led by California Governor Gavin Newsom, said they would co-ordinate how to reopen businesses after the outbreak is contained. All but one of the states is led by a Democratic governor. Now, a row has erupted over who has the ultimate authority to lift lockdown orders. On Monday night, Mr Trump gave a combative press conference where he feuded with reporters, criticised their coverage of how he handled the outbreak, and said that when it came to reopening the economy, ""the president of the United States calls the shots"". This video can not be played WATCH: Reporter challenges President Trump at briefing ""When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,"" he said, adding: ""They can't do anything without the approval of the president of the United States."" His position has been contradicted by governors and legal experts. It also contrasts with his earlier position that the responsibility for fighting the outbreak and order lockdowns lies primarily with state governors. The row continued on Tuesday, as Mr Cuomo told CBS Mr Trump did not have total authority to decide when to reopen businesses, because ""we don't have a king, we have a president"". During his daily press briefing, Mr Cuomo criticised Mr Trump, adding he would ""not engage"" in a fight with him, but would have ""no choice"" if the president the threatened the welfare of New Yorkers. He added: ""I put my hand out in total partnership and co-operation with the president."" Meanwhile, Mr Trump took the row to Twitter on Tuesday, criticising Mr Cuomo and issuing an oblique snipe at other governors. ""Tell the Democrat Governors that 'Mutiny On The Bounty"" was one of my all time favourite movies,"" Mr Trump, a Republican, wrote. This video can not be played ""Dear Class of 2020"": Graduating high school seniors' messages to their peers ""A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain."" The tale tells of a ship's revolt in which mutineers meet with unhappy ends, with Mr Trump appearing to compare himself to the captain. The president aimed particular fire at Mr Cuomo, who he said was calling ""daily, even hourly, begging for everything,"" like hospitals, beds, ventilators for his state. New York remains the US state hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, reporting 778 deaths in the past 24 hours. However, Mr Trump struck a less combative tone later on Tuesday, saying he would make a decision on the economy ""in conjunction with governors"" soon. ""We have tremendous support from governors, and what I do is going to be done in conjunction with governors.""

The current White House recommendations for Americans to avoid restaurants and non-essential travel and keep in-person gatherings to no more than 10 people expire on 30 April. However, the US's top infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, told AP on Tuesday that the 1 May date might be ""a bit overly optimistic"". Referring to testing and tracing procedures, he said: ""We have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on, and we're not there yet.""

The Chinese province of Wuhan, where coronavirus was first reported last December, has partially reopened after more than two months of isolation. Spain has allowed around 300,000 nonessential workers to return to their jobs. Italy - the hardest-hit country in Europe - will allow a narrow range of businesses to resume operations this week. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has announced the country's near-lockdown will extend until 11 May. The UK government has said no one should expect any changes to its lockdown restrictions this week. Mr Trump told Monday's briefing he did not intend to fire Anthony Fauci - a day after the president shared a tweet with the hashtag ""#firefauci"". Dr Fauci incurred the ire of the president's supporters after he told CNN that lives could have been saved if the US had shut down earlier during the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Trump invited Dr Fauci - a key member of the White House coronavirus task force - to the stage in the opening minutes of the briefing. The president said that he and Dr Fauci had been on the same page ""from the beginning"" and declared he liked the respected doctor. ""I think he's a wonderful guy,"" Mr Trump said, while adding that not everyone was happy with the health expert. Dr Fauci has contradicted or corrected Mr Trump on scientific matters during the public health crisis. But on Monday, he conceded he had used ""a poor choice of words"" in his CNN interview. While Mr Trump initially played down the threat of coronavirus, he was by no means alone among US public officials in doing so. Dr Fauci himself on 17 February said the danger from coronavirus is ""just minuscule"" compared with the ""real and present danger"" of flu.

'Without the deliveries my children would starve',"Volunteers are providing food delivery services to people across large parts of rural England Families in parts of rural England say they are totally dependent on volunteers delivering food during the coronavirus crisis. Catherine Boyes from North Yorkshire said her son has cystic fibrosis and she was shielding him by staying home. In rural England many households face long journeys to buy food and this is more difficult if families are self-isolating. The Countryside Alliance said volunteers were ""plugging gaps"". Underlockdown restrictions, shopping for food is one of only four reasons why people are allowed to leave their home. Ms Boyes said: ""Without these deliveries my children would starve."" The mother of six, who lives on a farm on the edge of the North York Moors National Park, said she had struggled to get a regular delivery from a supermarket due to surging demand and is reliant on the Pickering Help Network to deliver supplies. Catherine Boyes from North Yorkshire said local food delivery volunteers were essential for her family ""My eldest son has cystic fibrosis so we can't go to the shops and risk coming into contact with this hideous disease,"" she said. ""This crisis really has brought out how isolated we are."" Families across the country are facing difficulties receiving regular home deliveries from the big supermarkets. Tesco has said it willnot be able to meet all requests for home deliveries. Sainsbury's has said it will prioritise vulnerable people for delivery slots while Asda has said if people can shop safely in stores they should do so to free up deliveries for those who need them.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Pauline Hewitt is one of around 100 volunteers who are helping to deliver food parcels from the rural town of Pickering in North Yorkshire. Pauline Hewitt is one of hundreds of volunteers who have come forward to help deliver food in North Yorkshire ""There's a real sense of fear and panic among some people about how they are going to get their shopping in an area like this,"" said Mrs Hewitt, who also works in the care sector. ""As volunteers we've had to spend a lot of time reassuring people that whatever happens we will be able to deliver them a weekly supply of food. ""Even in normal times, there are lots of people in North Yorkshire who can't just pop to the end of the road for a loaf or a pint of milk."" In England figures produced by theDepartment for Transport,externalshow a wide variation in journey times for people travelling to a local food store. In parts of central London it takes an average of eight minutes to make a round trip from home to a food store on foot or using public transport, excluding time in the shop. In Eden in Cumbria a similar journey would take an average of over half an hour each way, the data suggested. Across England the average one-way journey time in a car to a food store in a major town or city is seven minutes. A similar journey made from a small rural village would take on average 11 minutes and thirty six seconds. Sarah Lee from the Countryside Alliance said rural businesses and volunteer groups were providing a lifeline to many of the most isolated people in the country. ""I think a lot of rural residents who are vulnerable aren't automatically on a government or council priority list for online food deliveries from the supermarkets,"" she said. ""What we are seeing though is a huge amount of resilience from rural communities and local shops and volunteers, who are plugging gaps when services are struggling to reach people"". The Countryside Alliance said rural businesses were playing a vital role in keeping people fed during the coronavirus crisis Councils across England are helping to coordinate the efforts of volunteer groups to ensure that vital supplies reach those most in need Carl Les, leader of North Yorkshire County Council, said: ""We're doing everything we can to make sure that people don't fall through the safety net"". ""On the weekly conference calls we have with government ministers we're being told to spend what we need to get through this emergency and that the government will pick up the bill."" Councils in England are being given Â£1.6bn in emergency coronavirus funding. Announcing the extra money in March, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""The work of local authorities to deliver social care and other vital public services has never been more important than it is now, and will be in the days and weeks ahead.""

Deadly olive tree disease 'could costs billions',"The impact of infection with Xylella - the trees on the right have not yet been exposed to the bacterium Researchers say the economic costs of a deadly pathogen affecting olive trees in Europe could run to over â¬20 billion. They've modelled the future worst impacts of theXylella fastidiosapathogen which has killed swathes of trees in Italy. Spread by insects, the bacterium now poses a potential threat to olive plantations in Spain and Greece. The disease could increase the costs of olive oil for consumers. Olive tree killer still threatens EU Revealed: The secret life of the spittlebug Olive killer disease reaches Spain Xylella is considered to be one of the most dangerous pathogens for plants anywhere in the world. At present there is no cure for the infection. It can infect cherry, almond and plum trees as well as olives. It has become closely associated with olives after a strain was discovered in trees in Puglia in Italy in 2013. The organism is transmitted by sap-sucking insects such as spittlebugs. The infection limits the tree's ability to move water and nutrients and over time it withers and dies. Plants infected with the bacterium have to be destroyed to prevent the spread In Italy, the consequences of the spread of the disease have been devastating, with an estimated 60% decline in crop yields since the first discovery in 2013. ""The damage to the olives also causes a depreciation of the value of the land, and to the touristic attractiveness of this region,"" said Dr Maria Saponari, from the CNR Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection in Italy. ""It's had a severe impact on the local economy and jobs connected with agriculture."" As well as in Italy, the Xylella bacterium has now been found in Spain, France and Portugal. Tackling it at present involves removing infected trees and trying to clamp down on the movement of plant material and the insects that spread the disease. But if these measures fail, what will be the financial impact of the infection? Inthis new study,,externalresearchers modelled different scenarios including what would happen if all growing ceased due to tree death. They also compared this worst case with a scenario where replanting with resistant varieties occurred. The team made projections for Italy, Spain and Greece, which between them account for 95% of European olive oil production. Olive trees dry up and ultimately die from the Xylella infecton In Spain, if the infection expanded and the majority of trees became infected and died, the costs could run to â¬17 billion over the next 50 years. A similar scenario in Italy would amount to over five billion, while in Greece, the losses would be under two billion. If the rate of infection is slowed down, or resistant varieties are planted instead, then these costs would be significantly reduced. However, the authors believe, whatever happens, there will likely be a knock-on impact on consumers. ""The expected effect could be that there would be a shortage of supply,"" said lead author Kevin Schneider from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. ""And I would expect that if prices go up, consumers will be worse off."" The authors say that while their analysis looks at economics, there are also potentially large touristic and cultural losses caused by the bacterium that can't be ignored. ""You really hear devastating stories of infected orchards that were inherited over generations,"" said Dr Schneider. ""It's the same orchard that their grandparents were once working on. So how do you put an economic number on the loss of something like this. The cultural heritage value would be far larger than we could compute."" There are a growing number of scientific initiatives to try and take the fight to the bacterium, including using insect repelling clays, vegetative barriers and genetic analysis to determine why some plants are more susceptible to the infection than others. Ultimately, the researchers believe that beating the pathogen will require trees that are resistant to the disease. ""Seeking resistant cultivars or immune species is one of the most promising, and environmentally sustainable, long-term control strategies to which the  European scientific community is devoting relevant research efforts,"" said Dr Saponari, ""Sustainable strategies to reduce the population of the insects is the other pillar for the control of the vector-borne disease, in this regard, mechanical intervention to remove weeds in spring is one of the most efficacious applications to reduce the populations of the insect, indeed several other strategies are also being studied to implement the control of the insects,"" she added. While two varieties of olive tree have been found to have some resistance, the authors are calling for research in this area to be significantly boosted.

French F1 Grand Prix set to be postponed,"Lewis Hamilton beat Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to win the 2019 French Grand Prix The French Grand Prix is set to be the next Formula 1 event to be postponed as a result of the coronavirus crisis. French President Emmanuel Macron said in a televised address to the nation on Monday that restrictions on public events would continue until mid-July. France's round of the F1 championship is due to be held at the Circuit Paul Ricard, near Marseille, on 28 June. F1 was unable to officially confirm the situation surrounding the race when contacted by BBC Sport. Macron said France's lockdown would be extended until 11 May, after which creches and schools would progressively reopen, while bars, restaurants, and cinemas would stay shut. There would be no summer festivals ""before mid-July"". The move seems to make it impossible to hold an event that was attended by 135,000 people last year. The race would be the 10th grand prix to be called off at the start of a season that has been laid waste by the coronavirus crisis. Formula 1: UK-based teams receive more than 20,000 orders from NHS The latest coronavirus news F1 says it is considering all options as it looks for a way to reconfigure the season later this year. The hope is the season can start in Europe in the summer, and it is possible that the first races at least could be held behind closed doors. Ross Brawn, F1's managing director, said last week that a viable World Championship seasoncould be held before the end of the year,even if the first race did not take until October. But he added that the season could run into January 2021 to fit in more races. F1 is facing a serious financial shortfall as a result of the lack of racing as all three of its main revenue streams are under threat - race-hosting fees, broadcast rights and sponsorship income. Only one race has so far been cancelled permanently, with Monaco deciding to give up on its event this year because it said it could not find a suitable alternative slot. All the others have been postponed in the hope of finding alternative dates once racing can get under way. The F1 teams are on a factory shutdown, having brought the traditional summer break forward from August so as to be in the best place possible once travel restrictions are lifted. Five of the seven UK-based teams have placed many of their staff on enforced leave as a result of the lack of action. And F1's bosses have taken a series of steps to cut costs with the future so uncertain. Measures include the postponement by a year of a major regulation change that was scheduled to come into force in 2021, and the requirement for teams to use the same cars for the 2021 season as they will this year. And bosses are in the midst of negotiations over lowering the budget cap that is set to come into force next year at $175m (Â£137.9m). A reduction to $150m has already been agreed informally and there is ameeting scheduled for this weekto discuss the idea of potentially reducing it to $125m.

Eamonn Holmes under fire over 5G comments,"Eamonn Holmes with co-host and wife Ruth Langsford on This Morning TV presenter Eamonn Holmes is at the centre of a controversy after casting doubt on media outlets that debunk the myth that 5G causes coronavirus. ""What I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true,"" the ITV This Morning host said. ""It's very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative."" He was criticised on social media and by scientists whohave dismissed the theories as ""complete rubbish"". ""The opinions of  the mainstream media or the state hardly come into the debate,"" said Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading. ""Numerous doctors and scientists around the world have said that the disease is caused by a virus, something completely different to a mobile phone signal."" 5G radio signals are electromagnetic waves, he explained. ""Electromagnetic waves are one thing, viruses are another, and you can't get a virus off a phone mast. ""Similarly, sensible studies have failed to corroborate the claim that the signals emitted by 5G masts are able to suppress our immune systems."" No, 5G does not spread coronavirus YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interview Tech firms summoned over 'crackpot' 5G conspiracies Holmes made the remarks on Monday in a segment with the programme's consumer editor Alice Beer, who said the 5G theory, which has led a number of phone masts to be set alight or vandalised, was ""not true and it's incredibly stupid"". He told her: ""I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true. ""No-one should attack or damage or do anything like that, but it's very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative. ""That's all I would say, as someone with an inquiring mind."" On Twitter, scientist and author Dr David Robert Grimes suggested the presenter should ""talk to the scientists & physicians who are experts 1st"". Allow Twitter content?

A government spokesperson said: ""We are aware of a number of attacks on phone masts and abuse of telecoms engineers apparently inspired by crackpot conspiracy theories circulating online. ""Those responsible for these criminal acts will face the full force of the law."" ITV declined to comment. Scientists have called the rumours that there is a link between 5G and coronavirus ""complete rubbish"" and a biological impossibility. However, that has not stopped false claims being shared on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Some posts have now been removed, but in recent weeks the conspiracy theory has been shared by verified accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers. This highlights the difficulty with covering misinformation about coronavirus. A lack of information and complex explanations often fail to satisfy a desire for immediate answers.

Could the UK government change its guidance about wearing masks outdoors? That was the question asked by the BBC's David Shukman at today's UK government virus briefing, as more countries introduce recommendations to wear them outside. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, said it would change its mind if the evidence showed it was the right thing to do. He said there was a review ongoing at the moment over evidence on the impact of wearing masks, and said they had already seen ""more persuasive"" data to show that it stopped you passing on the virus, rather than catching it. But the advice has yet to change, he added. Earlier on Monday, World Health Organization special envoy Dr David Nabarro has suggested that more widespread use of maskswill become ""the norm"". Criticism of the decision to shut a drive-in testing centre for key workers on Bank Holiday Monday shows a ""complete lack of understanding of how the system works"", the Welsh Government has said. Public Health Wales said the closure of the testing centre at the Cardiff City Stadium was due to the ""low number of key workers anticipated to be working"" that day. The movesparked indignation from Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives. In response, a Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Key workers canât just turn up to this centre, they have to be booked in. ""Because of the small number booked in for today, they were all tested yesterday instead. ""Testing happens in a variety of locations and we now have a capacity to test up to 1,300 a day.â The Welsh Government has welcomed an announcement of a further Â£350m from the UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak. But it called for further cash. âThis latest consequential is welcome but, as the pandemic progresses, we will need further funding from the UK government to meet the costs associated with responding to this virus and longer-term support to rapidly rebuild the Welsh economy to pre-coronavirus levels,"" a spokesperson said.  Work continued today on Dragon's Heart Hospital, a 2,000-bed field hospital being built at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, as these pictures show.. About 300 beds were released to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board on Sunday. Hundreds have been employed to either work at the hospital or backfill at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales to replace relocating staff. The hospital will have a mobile x-ray, CT scanners and an end-of-life pathway - care for people in the last weeks or days of their life. The decision to close a Codiv-19 testing centre for key workers on Bank Holiday Monday appears ""very strange"", an AM has said. Welsh Tory Andrew RT Davies added his voice to thosecriticising the decisionto shut the testing centre at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday. Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was closed due to the ""low number of key workers anticipated to be working"" that day. ""This does appear a very strange move from Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government,"" the South Wales Central AMtweeted,external. ""Surely we should be exhausting all avenues to get people tested not simply shutting up shop because itâs a bank holiday?"" The Welsh Government has been asked for comment. Volunteers helping to provide meals for staff at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales have cooked up a batch for Tuesday. The project has raised more than Â£50,000 so far through crowd funding and delivered more than 8,100 main meals. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Welsh Government says it has been ""overwhelmed"" by the response of the public and businesses to the challenge of providing more personal protective equipment (PPE) to front-line workers. It was asked to respond after Cardiff man Richard Blackwell, who has made thousands of protective visors for NHS staff, said hehad been told he cannot give them to front-line workers because of red tape. ""If other companies would like to help they should contact theWales Life Sciences Hub,external,"" the statement added. Rugby star George North has sent a message of thanks and support to ambulance and NHS staff. In a video tweeted by the Welsh Ambulance Service, the Wales international addressed ambulance service staff and the whole NHS. ""I just want to say a huge thank you, your work is incredible. You put yourselves at risk to save everyone,"" he said. ""From myself and everyone in the country, we can't thank you enough.""   Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price criticised the closure of the testing centre on Monday The closure of a Covid-19 testing centre for key workers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday ""beggars belief"",the Plaid Cymru leader has said. Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was closed due to the ""low number of key workers anticipated to be working"" that day. But Mr Price questioned the decision at a time when Wales was testing less than other countries. And the Welsh Conservatives said there was no valid reason to have shut the centre. The Welsh Government has been asked to comment. The Cardiff City Stadium centre is one of several drive-in testing centres being set up to provide testing to key workers with symptoms and is the only one operating so far.  The UK is ""tracking behind Italy"" on deaths from coronavirus, the UK government's chief scientific adviser has said. Speaking at today's UK government virus briefing, Sir Patrick Vallance said he expected deaths to plateau for a while then decrease. Here is the UK government's global graph.  Dominic Raab has confirmed the total number of deaths in the UK has reached 11,329. Speaking at the UK government daily briefing, he said despite the ""grizzly figures"", there was some hope in the numbers, saying the lockdown measures were slowing the spread. The foreign secretary is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who's recovering after spending a week in hospital with coronavirus. He said didn't expect any changes to be made to lockdown measures currently in place across the UK until they can be confident they can be made safely. Mr Raab asked people to keep following the guidance and to stay home. ""If we let up now the virus will only take advantage, spread faster and kill more people,"" he added. ""Our plan is working. Please stick with it and we will get through this crisis together."" The Welsh Government will receive a further Â£350m from the UK Treasury to support its response to the coronavirus outbreak, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has
announced. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said this would take the total amount provided by Downing Street to First Minister Mark Drakeford's administration to Â£600m. Mr Hart said: âThe Chancellor promised to do whatever it takes to help the UK defeat coronavirus. This Â£350m of extra funding delivers on that promise. ""This is on top of funding to help support individuals and businesses and will provide our incredible front-line staff with the resources they need to save lives. ""This means that Wales will receive a total cash boost of almost Â£2bn from the UK government to help tackle coronavirus in Wales.â Â© 2025 BBC.

'Up to 50m pints' going to waste in empty pubs,"Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Fifty million pints - give or take. That's the amount of beer expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries. ""It's a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer,"" says Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). ""People won't get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing."" Mr Stainer estimates the UK's 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time.Most are kegs containing 11 gallons (88 pints) each,external- although many real ales come in nine-gallon (72-pint) casks. The best-before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - are usually three to four months after delivery. Those for real ales and other unpasteurised beer are usually set at six to nine weeks. Can't do takeaways - Keris De Villiers and husband Lee So most stock could go to waste if social distancing measures remain in place for several months. Keris De Villiers, landlady of the Ram Inn, the Old Sergeant and the Pig and Whistle in Wandsworth, south-west London, says barrelled beer worth about Â£10,000 could go off in her cellars - while 1,000 litres (1,760 pints) more beer remains in vats at the SlyBeast microbrewery she and husband Lee have recently set up. ""We could do takeaways,"" she says, ""but that would mean selling beer on the corner of a very small pavement. That wouldn't be socially responsible, with the need for people to keep their distance from one another. The whole situation is heart-breaking. ""Our brewer literally talks to his tanks when he's at work every day. People really care about the beer they're making. It's a craft and people are passionate about it.""

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Supermarket alcohol salesincreased by more than a fifth last month,externalas pubs - along with cafes and restaurants - closed on 20 March. ""People are missing these things in their lives,"" says Mr Stainer. ""It's not the biggest issue that the country is dealing with, but aspects of life like going to the cinema or cafe, or going for a pint, are something we treasure."" Many breweries and distributors have offered to take back barrels at no charge once the lockdown is over, taking some of the financial pressure off landlords. Some pubs are offering takeaways to prevent beer being wasted Iain Crockett, director of Gloucestershire-based Severn Brewing, says draymen - people who deliver beer - face the ""worst week of their lives"" when the pub trade returns, having to lift full barrels - rather than empties - out of cellars. He wants there to be at least a couple of weeks' notice before pubs are allowed to reopen. ""All the little brewers are going to be completely shafted otherwise,"" Mr Crockett says. While the big brewers have large storage capacities, small operators will be starting more ""from scratch"", he adds. Before that, though, there's the question of how to get rid of tens of millions of pints. Can we expect scenes like those following the introduction of Prohibition in the US a century ago, where bottles and barrels were smashed, their contents poured away? Probably not. In the US, bar owners have been toldnot to tip out-of-date beer down storm drains,,externalbecause it's illegal and environmentally damaging. Some UK publicans, have, however,already resorted to this,external. The British Institute of Innkeeping is advising against such action, amid concern it could leave landlords further out of pocket. Under Treasury rules, when publicans get rid of large amounts of spoilt beer, duty doesn't need to be paid on it. Brewery representatives normally oversee this process, but because of social distancing they can't visit premises at the moment. The government has temporarilyallowed brewers to appoint publicans to oversee,externalthe dumping of beer. But they must keep a proper record of it, including perhaps filming a video as proof it's been destroyed, rather than put aside for profit. One option that publicans and brewers who spoke to the BBC would love to try is converting out-of-date beer into hand sanitiser, by extracting the alcohol. Independent brewer Brewdog is already making hand sanitiser at its Aberdeenshire premises, while the government is giving manufacturers who want to do the same""priority"" access to the methylated spirits,external- or ""denatured alcohol"" - they need. Despite these difficult times, Mrs De Villiers says pub owners and tenants are doing ""all we can"" to survive and ""assist the community"". ""The breweries are helping us and they want us to survive,"" she adds. ""Everyone's ready to help everyone else."" In an effort to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus, the government has offered Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. ""Pubs are at the heart of our communities and an important part of local economies,"" says a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. ""We've asked them to temporarily close in order to help protect people and reduce the spread of the virus. But we are also delivering support to help businesses, including pubs, through the coronavirus pandemic.""

Gown supply 'critically low' in some hospitals,"An NHS boss has warned the number of protective gowns available to front-line staff in parts of the country has become ""critically low"" in recent days. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, has called for a ""more sustainable supply"" of gowns, which are imported from China. On Sunday, the health secretary said the amount of available PPE - personal protective equipment - was increasing. It came as deaths in UK hospitals rose to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, a review of the UK's lockdown measures will take place later this week. Mr Hopson, from NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns available to NHS staff in some parts of the country was ""very, very low"". Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered ""a whole load of stock"" weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: ""If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. ""This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply."" Has the NHS got enough PPE? Who should wear face masks? At the government's daily briefing on Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was ""working night and day to make sure we get the right PPE"". ""I'm glad to say there are now record amounts [of PPE] in the system,"" he said, adding: ""Daily we're delivering millions of items to the frontline."" On gowns, he said: ""In the last two days 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country and more are going out today and in the week to come."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Mr Hopson said that ""the vast majority"" of preparations for the outbreak within the NHS had gone well, with ""nearly all"" stocks of PPE ""flowing in the way that trusts would like"". ""The bit where there's a particular problem was gowns,"" he said. ""We know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. ""No trust, as far as I'm aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very, very low."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed public services will receive more than Â£14bn from the government's coronavirus emergency response fund, including more than Â£6bn for health services. The Treasury said the funding would go towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering ""urgent priorities"" such as acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. The World Health Organization says,externalgowns should be worn by all doctors, nurses and cleaners who enter coronavirus patients' rooms in hospitals. They should also be used by those handling coronavirus samples in labs and healthcare workers, cleaners and ambulance crews in places where patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms are seen. Public Health England guidance,externalsays hospital staff can sometimes use gowns for a whole session, such as a ward round or when caring for several patients in ICU. Otherwise, a single use is recommended. It comes as Downing Street denied that cabinet minister Michael Gove's daughter being tested for coronavirus was an example of ""double standards"". Tests arenot yet availablefor most people and mainly reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. The prime minister's spokesman said the test was carried out ""on the advice of the chief medical officer and in line with medical guidance"". The spokesman said Mr Gove's job is a ""central role in the government's response"" and the test meant he ""could get back to work"". Latest government figures show,external18,000 tests were carried out on Saturday. There are 23 drive-through testing sites now open for NHS staff, No 10 said. Meanwhile, No 10 has said Mr Johnson will recover at Chequers - the PM's official country residence - as it was ""considered to be a suitable place"". The spokesman added Mr Johnson will not be carrying out government work. Mr Raab is currently in charge of running the government. Caring for PM in hospital 'surreal' for nurse Boris Johnson: 'It could have gone either way' Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK On Sunday, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital in London, where he was being treated for Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus. This video can not be played In a video message posted on Twitter, the PM thanked the NHS staff that cared for him It is unclear whether the prime minister will take part in the lockdown review, which is due to be carried out by Thursday. Wales' health minister said last week that the lockdown wouldremain for ""several more weeks at the very least"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warnedthere was ""no likelihood or prospect""of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. NHS England said on Monday that a further 667 patients with coronavirus had died in the country, while a further 15 deaths were recorded in Wales, and a further nine in Scotland. This video can not be played 'Hannah' lost her husband to coronavirus after he cared for her when she was ill with the virus. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was ""really laboured"". ""It is not a nice, quiet way to go,"" she said. Hannah added: ""This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week."" This video can not be played ""I don't want any other family to have to go through this"" - Wendy, daughter of coronavirus patient Wendy's father fell ill with coronavirus around a month ago and he has now been taken off a ventilator in hospital. ""They've given him medication to keep him calm and relaxed and it is a matter of just waiting now for him to fade away peacefully,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. ""The nurses are with him, they are holding his hand, they've been absolutely marvellous,"" Wendy added. ""We had to make the decision for the ventilator to be removed and for him to pass away peacefully."" Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. It comes as 13 residents of a County Durham care homehave now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus.

The NHS staff who have died,"Tens of thousands of people across the UK have now died with coronavirus, including more than 100 NHS staff and other healthcare workers. The BBC has been tracking their deaths during the pandemic. Among them are a pregnant nurse who died before she could meet her daughter; a father-of-seven whose family say he was let down over a lack of personal protective equipment; and a grandmother who colleagues say was one the unsung heroes of the NHS. Many of them came to the UK from other countries to work for the NHS. Most were working on the frontline and caring for patients, while some were retired but continued to work. Here are 100 of their stories. Renowned surgeon Dr El Tayar worked in the NHS for 11 years before moving back to his native Sudan to help establish a transplant programme. He returned to the UK in 2015, working as a locum surgeon before his death. He gave the ""precious gift of life to so many people around the world"", fellow surgeon Abbas Ghazanfar wrote in a tribute.

Mr Raab - who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from coronavirus - said a meeting of scientific advisers would take place to review evidence relating to the current lockdown restrictions this week. ""We don't expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won't until we're confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made,"" he said.

However, he said the ""overwhelming"" majority of people stayed at home.

""The next phase of this is understanding how and when to release these measures in a way that is safe."" The number of deaths in UK hospitals has risen to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. It has become a vexed issue in this pandemic and the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the country's stance was being reviewed. So far the UK has advised against the use of face masks by the general public. There remains concern that wearing one gives people a false sense of security leading to them slacking off other measures such as hand washing. But the United States changed its mind and recommends that even healthy people do wear them. That shift was in part due to the science showing people were infectious for a day before they start showing symptoms. The World Health Organization's special envoy on coronavirus, Dr David Nabarro, said he thought wearing face masks would become the ""norm"". He said the priority was health care workers and then for people who have the disease to minimise their risk of spreading it. But in the future he can see face masks being recommended for people who can't socially distance in their jobs, such as hairdressers, and then eventually everyone. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing that 92 care homes had detected an outbreak of coronavirus in the last day alone. ""If an outbreak is suspected public health authorities will go in to do testing to check if an outbreak has taken place,"" he said. The Department of Health later confirmed to the BBC that coronavirus outbreaks have been detected at 2,099 facilities in England so far. Prof Whitty added that he would like to have ""much more extensive testing"" in care homes due to the ""large numbers of vulnerable people"" there. ""One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks,"" he said. Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes ""so we know the true scale of the problem and how fast it is spreading"".

Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK,"Restrictions on daily life in many parts of the UK - to try to curb the spread of coronavirus - have been eased in recent weeks. Employers in England can bring staff back to the workplace and people can use public transport for non-essential journeys (while wearing face coverings). Many pubs, shops and restaurants have reopened, while most of those who have been shielding are no longer advised to stay at home. There are places where the easing of lockdown measures has been halted - Leicester and Greater Manchester, for example. But, overall, how have people in the UK responded? More people have started visiting their workplaces and going to non-grocery shops, according to Google mobility data. But these visits are still about a third lower than pre-lockdown in February. Visits to recreational sites such as parks and beaches have increased, with people making the most of the warmer weather. Trips apparently fell during the recent wet weather in late July, after a rise at the start of England's school summer holidays - even though most children have not been into school since March. The late May Bank Holiday also saw a spike in recreational trips, as people flocked to beaches, followed by another spike a month later when the good weather saw thousands head to coastal areas like Bournemouth and Poole. While more people are returning to the workplace, these trips are still well below February levels. In London, in the week to 25 July, workplace visits were down by about 45% compared with January. Cardiff has a similar rate, while in Edinburgh levels are still down by more than half and in Belfast by about 40%. After the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, workplace visits fell by 75% according to the data, which tracks the mobile phones of people with their location history turned on. While supermarkets stayed open throughout the pandemic, ''non-essential'' shops had to close, which was bad news for the embattled UK High Street. After falling sharply, sales of non-food items started to recover in May, and have bounced back further since shops were allowed to reopen in June. While many shops continued to sell goods online, the surge in online sales didn't cancel out the decline of in-store purchases, with total non-food sales down 15.9% in June compared with pre-lockdown levels. For department stores, online sales more than doubled in June, but overall sales fell more than 5% compared with February. By contrast, stores selling household goods bucked the trend with a slight overall sales increase, boosted by the home improvements boom. Just under one in five workers (18.5%) in the UK were on furlough in the first half of July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This included nearly two-thirds of those in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which is still greatly affected by the restrictions. More than nine million jobs have been covered bythe furlough schemesince March. It pays up to 80% of the salary of those placed on leave (up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month) because of the coronavirus pandemic. From 4 July, pubs, restaurants and hotels in England could reopen. This prompted about 15% of all workers in accommodation and food services to return to their jobs in the first half of the month, the highest proportion of any sector. Bookings are creeping back up again now that restaurants and other food venues are allowed to reopen. However, they are still down by more than a third compared with last year, according to figures from booking service OpenTable. Some restaurants have introduced a bookings-only policy to help manage capacity under social distancing rules, but some have complained thatcustomers are not showing up. In the five days to 19 July, 52% of UK adults surveyed by the ONS said they would feel comfortable eating at a restaurant, up from 47% the week before. But restaurant visits may increase under the government's''eat out to help out''August discount scheme, which is designed to help boost confidence in dining out. The 2.2 million people in England classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have been told they can stop shielding, but they are advised to take extra care outside the home. The level of commitment to shielding fell slightly by June 24-30, as the lockdown started to ease for other groups. But over half of those shielding in England were still following the guidance ''completely'' - 58%, down from 63% in May. Almost nine out of 10 people shielding reported having no visitors except for care reasons in May. By the end of June it was 77%. A higher proportion of women (62%) than men (54%) followed shielding advice to the letter, according to the ONS Police handed out more than 18,000 fixed penalty notices in England and Wales between 27 March and 20 July. These peaked around the Easter Bank Holiday and were mainly for breaking restriction of movement rules. In Scotland, more than 3,000 were handed out over the same period. Since restrictions have started to ease, the number of fines has fallen sharply. Across Scotland, England and Wales, Cumbria and North Yorkshire handed out the highest proportion of fines, and Staffordshire and West Midlands the least. In England, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport on 15 June, and in many enclosed public spaces on 24 July. Between 15 June and 20 July, 32 people in England and Wales were fined for not wearing a face covering on public transport, while just one person was fined for not obeying quarantine rules after returning from abroad. As the long-term financial effects of the pandemic start to take hold, it appears some employers are putting hiring plans on ice. About half as many online job adverts were posted during 17-24 July as the 2019 average, ONS analysis of job website Adzuna suggests. The number of available jobs plummeted in some areas, with vacancies in the charity and voluntary sector falling by more than 85%, and management and consulting jobs down about 78%. But availability in some sectors has almost returned to last year's levels. Health and social care vacancies are at about 93% of their 2019 level, rising to 98% for jobs in facilities and maintenance. In the spring, lower levels of travelling made a difference to the environment, with air pollution dropping compared with last year. Average readings of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main pollutants from vehicles, were lower throughout lockdown than on equivalent days of the week in 2019. But the gap narrowed after restrictions started to ease in May, and most people were able to travel further afield. At some points in June and July, readings were as high or higher than the equivalent day last year. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"Gown supply 'critically low' in some hospitalsIt comes as the number of coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals rises to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday.UK","An NHS boss has warned the number of protective gowns available to front-line staff in parts of the country has become ""critically low"" in recent days. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, has called for a ""more sustainable supply"" of gowns, which are imported from China. On Sunday, the health secretary said the amount of available PPE - personal protective equipment - was increasing. It came as deaths in UK hospitals rose to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, a review of the UK's lockdown measures will take place later this week. Mr Hopson, from NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns available to NHS staff in some parts of the country was ""very, very low"". Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered ""a whole load of stock"" weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: ""If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. ""This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply."" Has the NHS got enough PPE? Who should wear face masks? At the government's daily briefing on Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was ""working night and day to make sure we get the right PPE"". ""I'm glad to say there are now record amounts [of PPE] in the system,"" he said, adding: ""Daily we're delivering millions of items to the frontline."" On gowns, he said: ""In the last two days 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country and more are going out today and in the week to come."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Mr Hopson said that ""the vast majority"" of preparations for the outbreak within the NHS had gone well, with ""nearly all"" stocks of PPE ""flowing in the way that trusts would like"". ""The bit where there's a particular problem was gowns,"" he said. ""We know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. ""No trust, as far as I'm aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very, very low."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed public services will receive more than Â£14bn from the government's coronavirus emergency response fund, including more than Â£6bn for health services. The Treasury said the funding would go towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering ""urgent priorities"" such as acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. The World Health Organization says,externalgowns should be worn by all doctors, nurses and cleaners who enter coronavirus patients' rooms in hospitals. They should also be used by those handling coronavirus samples in labs and healthcare workers, cleaners and ambulance crews in places where patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms are seen. Public Health England guidance,externalsays hospital staff can sometimes use gowns for a whole session, such as a ward round or when caring for several patients in ICU. Otherwise, a single use is recommended. It comes as Downing Street denied that cabinet minister Michael Gove's daughter being tested for coronavirus was an example of ""double standards"". Tests arenot yet availablefor most people and mainly reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. The prime minister's spokesman said the test was carried out ""on the advice of the chief medical officer and in line with medical guidance"". The spokesman said Mr Gove's job is a ""central role in the government's response"" and the test meant he ""could get back to work"". Latest government figures show,external18,000 tests were carried out on Saturday. There are 23 drive-through testing sites now open for NHS staff, No 10 said. Meanwhile, No 10 has said Mr Johnson will recover at Chequers - the PM's official country residence - as it was ""considered to be a suitable place"". The spokesman added Mr Johnson will not be carrying out government work. Mr Raab is currently in charge of running the government. Caring for PM in hospital 'surreal' for nurse Boris Johnson: 'It could have gone either way' Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK On Sunday, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital in London, where he was being treated for Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus. This video can not be played In a video message posted on Twitter, the PM thanked the NHS staff that cared for him It is unclear whether the prime minister will take part in the lockdown review, which is due to be carried out by Thursday. Wales' health minister said last week that the lockdown wouldremain for ""several more weeks at the very least"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warnedthere was ""no likelihood or prospect""of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. NHS England said on Monday that a further 667 patients with coronavirus had died in the country, while a further 15 deaths were recorded in Wales, and a further nine in Scotland. This video can not be played 'Hannah' lost her husband to coronavirus after he cared for her when she was ill with the virus. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was ""really laboured"". ""It is not a nice, quiet way to go,"" she said. Hannah added: ""This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week."" This video can not be played ""I don't want any other family to have to go through this"" - Wendy, daughter of coronavirus patient Wendy's father fell ill with coronavirus around a month ago and he has now been taken off a ventilator in hospital. ""They've given him medication to keep him calm and relaxed and it is a matter of just waiting now for him to fade away peacefully,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. ""The nurses are with him, they are holding his hand, they've been absolutely marvellous,"" Wendy added. ""We had to make the decision for the ventilator to be removed and for him to pass away peacefully."" Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. It comes as 13 residents of a County Durham care homehave now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus.

More people have started visiting their workplaces and going to non-grocery shops, according to Google mobility data. But these visits are still about a third lower than pre-lockdown in February. Visits to recreational sites such as parks and beaches have increased, with people making the most of the warmer weather. Trips apparently fell during the recent wet weather in late July, after a rise at the start of England's school summer holidays - even though most children have not been into school since March. The late May Bank Holiday also saw a spike in recreational trips, as people flocked to beaches, followed by another spike a month later when the good weather saw thousands head to coastal areas like Bournemouth and Poole. While more people are returning to the workplace, these trips are still well below February levels. In London, in the week to 25 July, workplace visits were down by about 45% compared with January. Cardiff has a similar rate, while in Edinburgh levels are still down by more than half and in Belfast by about 40%. After the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, workplace visits fell by 75% according to the data, which tracks the mobile phones of people with their location history turned on. While supermarkets stayed open throughout the pandemic, ''non-essential'' shops had to close, which was bad news for the embattled UK High Street. After falling sharply, sales of non-food items started to recover in May, and have bounced back further since shops were allowed to reopen in June. While many shops continued to sell goods online, the surge in online sales didn't cancel out the decline of in-store purchases, with total non-food sales down 15.9% in June compared with pre-lockdown levels. For department stores, online sales more than doubled in June, but overall sales fell more than 5% compared with February. By contrast, stores selling household goods bucked the trend with a slight overall sales increase, boosted by the home improvements boom. Just under one in five workers (18.5%) in the UK were on furlough in the first half of July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This included nearly two-thirds of those in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which is still greatly affected by the restrictions. More than nine million jobs have been covered bythe furlough schemesince March. It pays up to 80% of the salary of those placed on leave (up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month) because of the coronavirus pandemic. From 4 July, pubs, restaurants and hotels in England could reopen. This prompted about 15% of all workers in accommodation and food services to return to their jobs in the first half of the month, the highest proportion of any sector. Bookings are creeping back up again now that restaurants and other food venues are allowed to reopen. However, they are still down by more than a third compared with last year, according to figures from booking service OpenTable. Some restaurants have introduced a bookings-only policy to help manage capacity under social distancing rules, but some have complained thatcustomers are not showing up. In the five days to 19 July, 52% of UK adults surveyed by the ONS said they would feel comfortable eating at a restaurant, up from 47% the week before. But restaurant visits may increase under the government's''eat out to help out''August discount scheme, which is designed to help boost confidence in dining out. The 2.2 million people in England classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have been told they can stop shielding, but they are advised to take extra care outside the home. The level of commitment to shielding fell slightly by June 24-30, as the lockdown started to ease for other groups. But over half of those shielding in England were still following the guidance ''completely'' - 58%, down from 63% in May. Almost nine out of 10 people shielding reported having no visitors except for care reasons in May. By the end of June it was 77%. A higher proportion of women (62%) than men (54%) followed shielding advice to the letter, according to the ONS Police handed out more than 18,000 fixed penalty notices in England and Wales between 27 March and 20 July. These peaked around the Easter Bank Holiday and were mainly for breaking restriction of movement rules. In Scotland, more than 3,000 were handed out over the same period. Since restrictions have started to ease, the number of fines has fallen sharply. Across Scotland, England and Wales, Cumbria and North Yorkshire handed out the highest proportion of fines, and Staffordshire and West Midlands the least. In England, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport on 15 June, and in many enclosed public spaces on 24 July. Between 15 June and 20 July, 32 people in England and Wales were fined for not wearing a face covering on public transport, while just one person was fined for not obeying quarantine rules after returning from abroad. As the long-term financial effects of the pandemic start to take hold, it appears some employers are putting hiring plans on ice. About half as many online job adverts were posted during 17-24 July as the 2019 average, ONS analysis of job website Adzuna suggests. The number of available jobs plummeted in some areas, with vacancies in the charity and voluntary sector falling by more than 85%, and management and consulting jobs down about 78%. But availability in some sectors has almost returned to last year's levels. Health and social care vacancies are at about 93% of their 2019 level, rising to 98% for jobs in facilities and maintenance. In the spring, lower levels of travelling made a difference to the environment, with air pollution dropping compared with last year. Average readings of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main pollutants from vehicles, were lower throughout lockdown than on equivalent days of the week in 2019. But the gap narrowed after restrictions started to ease in May, and most people were able to travel further afield. At some points in June and July, readings were as high or higher than the equivalent day last year. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

"No ease to UK virus lockdown this week, Raab says","The government does not expect to make changes to coronavirus lockdown restrictions this week, Dominic Raab has said. The foreign secretary said the UK's plan ""is working"" but that ""we are still not past the peak of this virus"". ""Keep this up, we have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacrificed too much to ease up,"" he said. It came as the government said it might change its advice to the public on wearing face masks outdoors. Will face masks become the new norm? The UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the daily Downing Street news conference the guidance was subject to an ongoing review. He added that the government had already seen ""more persuasive"" data suggesting masks can stop a person passing the virus to someone else, rather than preventing them from catching it. The World Health Organization said,externalit remains the case that medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers, not the general public. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Mr Raab - who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from coronavirus - said a meeting of scientific advisers would take place to review evidence relating to the current lockdown restrictions this week. ""We don't expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won't until we're confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made,"" he said. He told the news conference that easing restrictions too early would ""risk a second wave"" of infections. Responding to claims the government lacks an exit strategy, Mr Raab said it was ""crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public's focus"" off social distancing measures. He admitted the government had been ""concerned"" people ""might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine"" over the Easter weekend. However, he said the ""overwhelming"" majority of people stayed at home. Speaking on ITV's Coronavirus Q&A programme, Sir Patrick Vallance said of the lockdown: ""It is important that we continue it long enough and that we do not just say 'victory - remove it immediately in totality'. ""The next phase of this is understanding how and when to release these measures in a way that is safe."" The number of deaths in UK hospitals has risen to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. It has become a vexed issue in this pandemic and the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the country's stance was being reviewed. So far the UK has advised against the use of face masks by the general public. There remains concern that wearing one gives people a false sense of security leading to them slacking off other measures such as hand washing. But the United States changed its mind and recommends that even healthy people do wear them. That shift was in part due to the science showing people were infectious for a day before they start showing symptoms. The World Health Organization's special envoy on coronavirus, Dr David Nabarro, said he thought wearing face masks would become the ""norm"". He said the priority was health care workers and then for people who have the disease to minimise their risk of spreading it. But in the future he can see face masks being recommended for people who can't socially distance in their jobs, such as hairdressers, and then eventually everyone. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing that 92 care homes had detected an outbreak of coronavirus in the last day alone. ""If an outbreak is suspected public health authorities will go in to do testing to check if an outbreak has taken place,"" he said. The Department of Health later confirmed to the BBC that coronavirus outbreaks have been detected at 2,099 facilities in England so far. Prof Whitty added that he would like to have ""much more extensive testing"" in care homes due to the ""large numbers of vulnerable people"" there. ""One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks,"" he said. Liz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes ""so we know the true scale of the problem and how fast it is spreading"". It came as 13 residents of one 72-bed care home in County Durham were confirmed to havedied after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Sir Patrick warned the number of deaths recorded in the UK is likely to rise in the coming days before they could plateau. He said: ""I think this week we are going to see a further increase, thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social-distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease.""

667 people have been revealed to have died in hospitals in England with
Covid-19, latest NHS statistics show. Of those announced today, 316 were over the age of 80 while 279 were aged 60 to 79 and 65 were aged 40 to 59. Six were aged 20 to 39 and one was aged under 19. These latest figures include 322 people who died on Saturday and 118 who died on Easter Sunday. As with most days, some deaths have been announced that happened some time ago.

'Up to 50m pints' going to waste in empty pubsMillions of pints of ale and lager could be lost if pub closures last into the summer.UK,"Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Fifty million pints - give or take. That's the amount of beer expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries. ""It's a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer,"" says Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). ""People won't get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing."" Mr Stainer estimates the UK's 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time.Most are kegs containing 11 gallons (88 pints) each,external- although many real ales come in nine-gallon (72-pint) casks. The best-before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - are usually three to four months after delivery. Those for real ales and other unpasteurised beer are usually set at six to nine weeks. Can't do takeaways - Keris De Villiers and husband Lee So most stock could go to waste if social distancing measures remain in place for several months. Keris De Villiers, landlady of the Ram Inn, the Old Sergeant and the Pig and Whistle in Wandsworth, south-west London, says barrelled beer worth about Â£10,000 could go off in her cellars - while 1,000 litres (1,760 pints) more beer remains in vats at the SlyBeast microbrewery she and husband Lee have recently set up. ""We could do takeaways,"" she says, ""but that would mean selling beer on the corner of a very small pavement. That wouldn't be socially responsible, with the need for people to keep their distance from one another. The whole situation is heart-breaking. ""Our brewer literally talks to his tanks when he's at work every day. People really care about the beer they're making. It's a craft and people are passionate about it."" LIVE:China reports no new virus deaths for first time A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Supermarket alcohol salesincreased by more than a fifth last month,externalas pubs - along with cafes and restaurants - closed on 20 March. ""People are missing these things in their lives,"" says Mr Stainer. ""It's not the biggest issue that the country is dealing with, but aspects of life like going to the cinema or cafe, or going for a pint, are something we treasure."" Many breweries and distributors have offered to take back barrels at no charge once the lockdown is over, taking some of the financial pressure off landlords. Some pubs are offering takeaways to prevent beer being wasted Iain Crockett, director of Gloucestershire-based Severn Brewing, says draymen - people who deliver beer - face the ""worst week of their lives"" when the pub trade returns, having to lift full barrels - rather than empties - out of cellars. He wants there to be at least a couple of weeks' notice before pubs are allowed to reopen. ""All the little brewers are going to be completely shafted otherwise,"" Mr Crockett says. While the big brewers have large storage capacities, small operators will be starting more ""from scratch"", he adds. Before that, though, there's the question of how to get rid of tens of millions of pints. Can we expect scenes like those following the introduction of Prohibition in the US a century ago, where bottles and barrels were smashed, their contents poured away? Probably not. In the US, bar owners have been toldnot to tip out-of-date beer down storm drains,,externalbecause it's illegal and environmentally damaging. Some UK publicans, have, however,already resorted to this,external. The British Institute of Innkeeping is advising against such action, amid concern it could leave landlords further out of pocket. Under Treasury rules, when publicans get rid of large amounts of spoilt beer, duty doesn't need to be paid on it. Brewery representatives normally oversee this process, but because of social distancing they can't visit premises at the moment. The government has temporarilyallowed brewers to appoint publicans to oversee,externalthe dumping of beer. But they must keep a proper record of it, including perhaps filming a video as proof it's been destroyed, rather than put aside for profit. One option that publicans and brewers who spoke to the BBC would love to try is converting out-of-date beer into hand sanitiser, by extracting the alcohol. Independent brewer Brewdog is already making hand sanitiser at its Aberdeenshire premises, while the government is giving manufacturers who want to do the same""priority"" access to the methylated spirits,external- or ""denatured alcohol"" - they need. Despite these difficult times, Mrs De Villiers says pub owners and tenants are doing ""all we can"" to survive and ""assist the community"". ""The breweries are helping us and they want us to survive,"" she adds. ""Everyone's ready to help everyone else."" In an effort to limit the economic damage caused by coronavirus, the government has offered Â£330bn in loans, Â£20bn in other aid, a business rates holiday, and grants for retailers and pubs. ""Pubs are at the heart of our communities and an important part of local economies,"" says a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. ""We've asked them to temporarily close in order to help protect people and reduce the spread of the virus. But we are also delivering support to help businesses, including pubs, through the coronavirus pandemic.""

Huawei warns UK against 5G U-turn after pandemic,"Chinese telecoms company Huawei has said that disrupting its involvement in the rollout of 5G would do Britain ""a disservice"". In January, the UK governmentapproved a limited role for Huaweiin building the country's new data networks. But in March,a backbench rebellion within the Conservative partysignalled efforts to overturn the move. In an open letter,the firm also said it was focused on keeping,externalthe UK connected during the Covid-19 crisis. But the pandemic may increase pressure on the government to take a tougher line on the company. In the letter, Huawei's UK chief Victor Zhang says home data use has increased by at least 50% since the virus first hit the UK, placing ""significant pressure"" on telecoms systems. Huawei says it has been working with partners like BT, Vodafone and EE to deal with the growth and has also set up three new warehouses around the country to ensure spare parts stay in supply. Mr Zhang also says the current crisis has highlighted how many people, especially in rural communities, are ""stuck in a digital slow lane"". And he warns that excluding Huawei from a future role in 5G would be a mistake. ""There are those who choose to continue to attack us without presenting any evidence,"" he writes. ""Disrupting our involvement in the 5G rollout would do Britain a disservice."" The government has banned Huawei from the most sensitive parts of the UK's mobile networks, and limited it to 35% of the periphery, which includes its radio masts. But critics argue it is a security risk to allow the Chinese company to play any role at all because of fears it could be used by Beijing to spy on or even sabotage communications. In early March, 38 Conservatives MPs rebelled on the issue, a larger number than expected. That points to a potential upset when the Telecoms Infrastructure Bill comes before Parliament, which is planned to happen later in the year. The coronavirus crisis highlights the tension between economic and national security issues that makes the topic so contentious. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health On one side is the need for greater connectivity to boost economic growth. Supporters of Huawei's role argue that excluding it would both slow down and raise the cost of delivering faster and more reliable networks. On the other side is anger directed at China from some quarters because of its perceived mishandling of the initial Covid-19 outbreak, as well as the wider concerns over growing dependence on its technologies and companies. Unnamed ministers and senior officials were recently quoted as saying there would have to be a ""reckoning"" once the current crisis is over. Part of that could involve a reversal of January's decision -  a concern which may explain the decision to write the letter. On 4 April a group of 15 Conservative MPs called for a rethink on relations with China in their own letter to the Prime Minister, written a day before he was admitted to hospital. ""Over time, we have allowed ourselves to grow dependent on China and have failed to take a strategic view of Britain's long-term economic, technical and security needs,"" the group wrote. Among the signatories were Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis and Bob Seely.

"UK enters fourth week of lockdown ahead of reviewUnder coronavirus emergency legislation, ministers will take stock of social distancing rules this week.UK","Ministers urged the public to stay at home over the Easter bank holiday weekend The UK is facing its fourth week in lockdown, with the government set to review by Thursday whether social distancing measures can be changed. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, after three weeks of telling Britons to stay at home. It comes as an NHS boss has warned staff are facing a ""hand-to-mouth"" supply of protective gowns. Meanwhile, the PM has thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital. The mother of a nurse who Boris Johnson specifically praised saidshe was ""exceptionally proud"" of her daughter. Wales' health minister said last week that the coronavirus lockdown wouldremain for ""several more weeks at the very least"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warnedthere was ""no likelihood or prospect""of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend. On Sunday, the UK's total number of hospital deaths linked to coronavirus reached 10,612. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns - imported from China - available to NHS staff in some parts of the country has fallen ""critically low"" in recent days. Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered ""a whole load of stock"" weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: ""If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. ""This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply."" Caring for PM in hospital 'surreal' for nurse Boris Johnson: 'It could have gone either way' Mr Johnson had spent a week at St Thomas' Hospital in London - including three nights in intensive care - where he was being treated for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister - who is now recuperating at Chequers, his country home in Buckinghamshire - will take part in the lockdown review. In a video message to the nation recorded after he left hospital, 55-year-old Mr Johnson said it ""could have gone either way"" as he thanked NHS staff for saving his life. Ms McGee is back at St Thomas' Hospital working the overnight shift after caring for Mr Johnson He singled out two nurses - Jenny McGee from New Zealand and Luis Pitarma from Portugal - for caring for him at his bedside for 48 hours at the most critical time. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is currently in charge of running the government, with aidesreportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for as long as a month. Asked how long it would be before Mr Johnson returned to work, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would be a ""clinical decision for his doctors to take with him"". Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Sunday, Mr Hancock insisted the government is ""operating perfectly efficiently within the strategy that he set out."" This video can not be played In a video message posted on Twitter, the PM thanked the NHS staff that cared for him Labour shadow cabinet minister Rachel Reeves said her party is calling on the government to publish its exit strategy for ending the lockdown. Under the current rules,external, people are urged to stay at home and to only go out if they have a ""reasonable excuse"", which includes exercise, shopping for basic necessities, healthcare and essential travel to or from work. Ms Reeves suggested ways of easing restrictions could include rolling out mass testing, shielding the most vulnerable while others get back to normal life and lifting the restrictions temporarily but reintroducing them if the virus starts to spread again. ""Although it's not the moment now to end the lockdown we need to think about where we are going to be in two, three, four weeks' time and now start looking at that plan,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Live page: China reports highest infection count in weeks Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK Speaking ahead of the Easter Bank holiday weekend, Mr Raab said it was still ""too early"" to lift lockdown restrictions,insisting they would need to stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. But ministers may also have toconsider any economic fallout of the lockdown measures, with a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) think-tank suggesting 25% of the UK economy could be lost by the summer due to the current controls in place. Business Secretary Alok Sharma, when asked about the NIESR report, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there would ""no doubt"" be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures. The BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said it is expected that social distancing measures will be continued, but he added that ""ministers are having to weigh up their responsibility to fight the disease with protecting the economy"".

Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was ""really laboured"". ""It is not a nice, quiet way to go,"" she said. Hannah added: ""This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week. ""I was alone at home, and I'm now alone at home. Nobody can give me a hug. ""My friends have rallied around, my church and everybody have been fabulous, but nobody can give me a hug. ""And I'm not lonely, I want to make that clear, I'm not lonely but I am alone."" On Sunday, 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths were recorded, taking the total number to 10,612. Mr Hancock said it marked a ""sombre day"" for the nation, as it became the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be ""one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe"". The latest UK figures only include deaths recorded in hospitals, not those who died in care homes or in the community. Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members. He said the provider - which runs 90 care homes and 43 retirement living sites - was ""somewhat in the dark"" about the exact number of deaths, because not everyone who died was tested, although they may have been showing symptoms.

Record deal to cut oil output ends price warOil producing nations agree a deal that will see output reduced by nearly 10 million barrels a day.Business,"The deal represents the largest cut in oil production ever agreed Opec producers and allies have agreed a record oil deal that will slash global output by about 10% after a slump in demand caused by coronavirus lockdowns. The deal, agreed on Sunday via video conference, is the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. Opec+, made up of oil producers and allies including Russia, announced plans for the deal on 9 April, but Mexico resisted the cuts. Opec has yet to announce the deal, but individual nations have confirmed it. The only detail to have been confirmed so far is that 9.7 million barrels per day will be cut by Opec oil producers and allies. On Monday in Asia, oil rose over $1 a barrel in early trading with global benchmark Brent up 3.9% to $32.71 a barrel and US grade West Texas Intermediate up 6.1% to $24.15 a barrel. Shares in Australia jumped 3.46% led by energy exporters, but Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.35% on continued concerns of poor global demand because of the spread of the coronavirus. ""This is an unprecedented agreement because it's not just between Opec and Opec+... but also the largest supplier in the world which is the US as well as other G-20 countries which have agreed to support the agreement both in reducing production and also in using up some of the surface supply by putting it into storage,"" Sandy Fielden, director of Oil Research at research firm Morningstar, told the BBC. US President Donald Trump and Kuwait's energy minister Dr Khaled Ali Mohammed al-Fadhel tweeted the news, while Saudi Arabia's energy ministry and Russia's state news agency Tass both separately confirmed the deal on Sunday.

Global oil demand is estimated to have fallen by a third as more than three billion people are locked down in their homes due to the coronavirus outbreak. Prior to that,oil prices slumped in Marchto an 18-year-low after Opec+ failed to agree cuts. Talks were complicated by disagreements between Russia and Saudi Arabia, but on 2 April oil prices surgedafter President Trump signalled that he expected the two countries to end their feud. The initial details of the deal, outlined by Opec+ on Thursday, would have seen the group and its allies cutting 10 million barrels a day or 10% of global supply from 1 May. Another five million barrels were expected to be cut by other nations outside the group such as the US, Canada, Brazil and Norway. It said the cuts would be eased to eight million barrels a day between July and December. Then they would be eased again to six million barrels between January 2021 and April 2022. Independent oil market analyst Gaurav Sharma told the BBC that the deal agreed on Sunday was ""marginally lower"", compared to the 10 million barrels per day that was originally announced on Thursday. Mexico had balked at making these production cuts, which delayed the deal being signed off. Then on Friday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said thatMr Trump had offered to make extra US cuts on his behalf, an unusual offer by the US president, who has long railed against Opec. Mr Trump said Washington would help Mexico by picking up ""some of the slack"" and being reimbursed later, but he did not detail how the arrangement would work. US backs Opec deal with cuts to boost oil price Coronavirus: Oil prices surge on hopes of a price war truce Oil plunges in Asia as producers start price war ""Now a rehashed deal placating Mexico has resurfaced to calm the market, yet, look closer and the doubts surface,"" Mr Sharma said. ""The bulk of the output cuts are predicated on Russia and Saudi Arabia cutting 2.5 million barrels per day from agreed - and somewhat inflated - levels of 11 million barrels per day. More importantly, for most of 2019, Russia displayed very poor form in complying with previously agreed Opec+ cuts. So the market is unlikely to take the announced cut at face value."" He added that forecasts for a drop in demand in the summer appear to be ""dire"", with even the most optimistic forecasts pointing to a reduction of 18.5 million barrels per day. Mr Sharma said: ""The announcement can stem the bleeding, but cannot prevent what is likely to be a dire summer for oil producers with the potential to drag oil prices below $20 (Â£16; â¬18).""

US backs Opec deal with cuts to boost oil price Coronavirus: Oil prices surge on hopes of a price war truce Oil plunges in Asia as producers start price war ""Now a rehashed deal placating Mexico has resurfaced to calm the market, yet, look closer and the doubts surface,"" Mr Sharma said. ""The bulk of the output cuts are predicated on Russia and Saudi Arabia cutting 2.5 million barrels per day from agreed - and somewhat inflated - levels of 11 million barrels per day. More importantly, for most of 2019, Russia displayed very poor form in complying with previously agreed Opec+ cuts. So the market is unlikely to take the announced cut at face value."" He added that forecasts for a drop in demand in the summer appear to be ""dire"", with even the most optimistic forecasts pointing to a reduction of 18.5 million barrels per day. Mr Sharma said: ""The announcement can stem the bleeding, but cannot prevent what is likely to be a dire summer for oil producers with the potential to drag oil prices below $20 (Â£16; â¬18).""

South Asia faces worst economic growth in 40 years,"Low paid workers in countries like India could bear the brunt of economic decline South Asia faces its worst economic performance in 40 years because of the coronavirus, the World Bank has said. The effects will unravel decades of progress in the region's battle against poverty. Economies such as India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have reported relatively few virus cases but experts fear they could be the next hotspots. The South Asia region is home to 1.8 billion people and some of the worldâs most densely populated cities. ""South Asia finds itself in a perfect storm of adverse effects. Tourism has dried up, supply chains have been disrupted, demand for garments has collapsed and consumer and investor sentiments have deteriorated,""said the World Bank report.,external 'Virus means millions will be left in poverty' World Bank pledges $12bn coronavirus aid package Confirmed global coronavirus cases pass a million It has slashed its growth forecast for the region this year to 1.8% to 2.8% from its original projection of 6.3% made before the virus outbreak. At least half the countries in this region could fall into ""deep recession"". The worst hit economy will be the Maldives, a nation of small islands in the Arabian Sea where the collapse of high-end tourism could see its economic output shrink by as much as 13%, warned the World Bank. India, the biggest economy in South Asia, could see growth of just 1.5% in its financial year, down from a figure of around 5%, the World Bank predicted. It has advised governments to ""ramp up action to curb the health emergency, protect their people, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, and set the stage now for fast economic recovery"". The World Bank also recommended temporary work programmes for migrant workers, and debt relief for businesses and individuals while cutting red tape on essential imports and exports. Last week the Washington DC-based lender said it would deploy up to $160bn (Â£128bn) in financial support over the next 15 months to help vulnerable countries deal with the pandemic and bolster their economic recovery.

"Gown supply 'critically low' in some hospitalsAn NHS boss says there is a ""particular problem"" with stocks of protective gowns for healthcare workers.UK","An NHS boss has warned the number of protective gowns available to front-line staff in parts of the country has become ""critically low"" in recent days. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers in England, has called for a ""more sustainable supply"" of gowns, which are imported from China. On Sunday, the health secretary said the amount of available PPE - personal protective equipment - was increasing. It came as deaths in UK hospitals rose to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday. The Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, a review of the UK's lockdown measures will take place later this week. Mr Hopson, from NHS Providers in England which represents hospital trusts, told BBC Breakfast that the number of protective gowns available to NHS staff in some parts of the country was ""very, very low"". Mr Hopson said that the NHS ordered ""a whole load of stock"" weeks ago, but delays have been caused by the gowns sometimes failing safety tests, while other batches have been mislabelled - meaning the NHS has ended up with additional masks. He added: ""If everything had been flowing exactly as had been ordered and if all of the material had properly passed its safety test, there would not be an issue. ""This is all really hand-to-mouth in terms of gown delivery, and we need to get to a more sustainable supply."" Has the NHS got enough PPE? Who should wear face masks? At the government's daily briefing on Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was ""working night and day to make sure we get the right PPE"". ""I'm glad to say there are now record amounts [of PPE] in the system,"" he said, adding: ""Daily we're delivering millions of items to the frontline."" On gowns, he said: ""In the last two days 121,000 gowns have been delivered around the country and more are going out today and in the week to come."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health LOCKDOWN:How do we lift restrictions? Mr Hopson said that ""the vast majority"" of preparations for the outbreak within the NHS had gone well, with ""nearly all"" stocks of PPE ""flowing in the way that trusts would like"". ""The bit where there's a particular problem was gowns,"" he said. ""We know that over the last 72 hours some trusts have run critically low on gowns. ""No trust, as far as I'm aware, has actually run out but some of the stocks are very, very low."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak has confirmed public services will receive more than Â£14bn from the government's coronavirus emergency response fund, including more than Â£6bn for health services. The Treasury said the funding would go towards freeing up hospital beds and delivering ""urgent priorities"" such as acquiring ventilators, diagnostic tests and protective equipment for NHS staff. A gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus. It should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus. The World Health Organization says,externalgowns should be worn by all doctors, nurses and cleaners who enter coronavirus patients' rooms in hospitals. They should also be used by those handling coronavirus samples in labs and healthcare workers, cleaners and ambulance crews in places where patients with suspected coronavirus symptoms are seen. Public Health England guidance,externalsays hospital staff can sometimes use gowns for a whole session, such as a ward round or when caring for several patients in ICU. Otherwise, a single use is recommended. It comes as Downing Street denied that cabinet minister Michael Gove's daughter being tested for coronavirus was an example of ""double standards"". Tests arenot yet availablefor most people and mainly reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital. The prime minister's spokesman said the test was carried out ""on the advice of the chief medical officer and in line with medical guidance"". The spokesman said Mr Gove's job is a ""central role in the government's response"" and the test meant he ""could get back to work"". Latest government figures show,external18,000 tests were carried out on Saturday. There are 23 drive-through testing sites now open for NHS staff, No 10 said. Meanwhile, No 10 has said Mr Johnson will recover at Chequers - the PM's official country residence - as it was ""considered to be a suitable place"". The spokesman added Mr Johnson will not be carrying out government work. Mr Raab is currently in charge of running the government. Caring for PM in hospital 'surreal' for nurse Boris Johnson: 'It could have gone either way' Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK On Sunday, Mr Johnson thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital in London, where he was being treated for Covid-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Wales' health minister said last week that the lockdown wouldremain for ""several more weeks at the very least"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warnedthere was ""no likelihood or prospect""of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend.

This video can not be played 'Hannah' lost her husband to coronavirus after he cared for her when she was ill with the virus. Recently widowed Hannah - not her real name - has told how her husband of more than 40 years died after contracting coronavirus. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her husband was in hospital for about a week before he died, and was put on a CPAP machine, which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator, to aid his breathing during that time. Describing his death, she said his breathing was ""really laboured"". ""It is not a nice, quiet way to go,"" she said. Hannah added: ""This is such a cruel disease. Apart from the medical staff that he saw when he had to, [my husband] was alone for a week."" This video can not be played ""I don't want any other family to have to go through this"" - Wendy, daughter of coronavirus patient Wendy's father fell ill with coronavirus around a month ago and he has now been taken off a ventilator in hospital. ""They've given him medication to keep him calm and relaxed and it is a matter of just waiting now for him to fade away peacefully,"" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. ""The nurses are with him, they are holding his hand, they've been absolutely marvellous,"" Wendy added. ""We had to make the decision for the ventilator to be removed and for him to pass away peacefully."" Sam Monaghan, the head of the UK's largest charity care provider MHA, told BBC Breakfast that about 150 of its residents had died with confirmed or suspected coronavirus, as well as two staff members.

"UK enters fourth week of lockdown ahead of reviewUnder coronavirus emergency legislation, ministers will take stock of social distancing rules this week.","Ministers urged the public to stay at home over the Easter bank holiday weekend The UK is facing its fourth week in lockdown, with the government set to review by Thursday whether social distancing measures can be changed. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, after three weeks of telling Britons to stay at home. It comes as an NHS boss has warned staff are facing a ""hand-to-mouth"" supply of protective gowns. Meanwhile, the PM has thanked NHS staff after being discharged from hospital. The mother of a nurse who Boris Johnson specifically praised saidshe was ""exceptionally proud"" of her daughter. Wales' health minister said last week that the coronavirus lockdown wouldremain for ""several more weeks at the very least"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warnedthere was ""no likelihood or prospect""of measures being lifted after the Easter weekend.

Caring for PM in hospital 'surreal' for nurse Boris Johnson: 'It could have gone either way' Mr Johnson had spent a week at St Thomas' Hospital in London - including three nights in intensive care - where he was being treated for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. It is unclear whether the prime minister - who is now recuperating at Chequers, his country home in Buckinghamshire - will take part in the lockdown review. In a video message to the nation recorded after he left hospital, 55-year-old Mr Johnson said it ""could have gone either way"" as he thanked NHS staff for saving his life. Ms McGee is back at St Thomas' Hospital working the overnight shift after caring for Mr Johnson He singled out two nurses - Jenny McGee from New Zealand and Luis Pitarma from Portugal - for caring for him at his bedside for 48 hours at the most critical time. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is currently in charge of running the government, with aidesreportedly expecting Mr Johnson to be out of action for as long as a month. Asked how long it would be before Mr Johnson returned to work, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it would be a ""clinical decision for his doctors to take with him"".

Under the current rules,external, people are urged to stay at home and to only go out if they have a ""reasonable excuse"", which includes exercise, shopping for basic necessities, healthcare and essential travel to or from work. Ms Reeves suggested ways of easing restrictions could include rolling out mass testing, shielding the most vulnerable while others get back to normal life and lifting the restrictions temporarily but reintroducing them if the virus starts to spread again. ""Although it's not the moment now to end the lockdown we need to think about where we are going to be in two, three, four weeks' time and now start looking at that plan,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Live page: China reports highest infection count in weeks Six ways the lockdown has changed the UK Speaking ahead of the Easter Bank holiday weekend, Mr Raab said it was still ""too early"" to lift lockdown restrictions,insisting they would need to stay in place until evidence showed the UK had moved beyond the peak of the virus. But ministers may also have toconsider any economic fallout of the lockdown measures, with a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) think-tank suggesting 25% of the UK economy could be lost by the summer due to the current controls in place. Business Secretary Alok Sharma, when asked about the NIESR report, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show there would ""no doubt"" be economic repercussions following the lockdown measures. The BBC's political correspondent Ben Wright said it is expected that social distancing measures will be continued, but he added that ""ministers are having to weigh up their responsibility to fight the disease with protecting the economy"".

On Sunday, 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths were recorded, taking the total number to 10,612. Mr Hancock said it marked a ""sombre day"" for the nation, as it became the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be ""one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe"".

Chris Stokel-Walker In less than three months an 87-year-old grandfather has gathered a huge following on the video-sharing app TikTok, despite the fact that most of its users are children. And for a long time he was unaware of his growing fame.Here's how it happened. With measures to tackle coronavirus leaving so many people unable to meet family and friends, how can we make more meaningful connections when we're on phone calls or using video apps? Experts offer their hacks. Duncan LeatherdaleBBC News Online Thirteen residents of a County Durham care home have now died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus. Managers at Stanley Park care home in Stanley said they were ""devastated"" by the deaths. The first death was in late March with the latest confirmed by home operator Care UK on Monday.
It has not been disclosed how many other residents at the 72-bed home are ill, although one who tested positive for the virus is in hospital.  Care UK said the latest resident to die had some symptoms that could indicate Covid-19, though no test has been carried out. Pubs, like other public venues, look set to stay shut for the foreseeable future. But what's going to happen to the contents of their cellars? Some pubs are offering takeaways to prevent beer being wasted Fifty million pints of beer are expected to go unused in barrels if pubs remain closed into the summer because of coronavirus. Publicans are currently unable to sell their lagers, ales and ciders - save for takeaways and home deliveries.Here's what is happening to it. Dr Alex Aldren trained in medicine, but left the profession to become a tenor. He has now returned to the NHS to help during the coronavirus crisis and is using his singing skills on the wards of the Royal London Hospital and Newham Hospital. A video of the doctor singing, which was shared online, has since gone around the world.

"UK coronavirus deaths top 10,000","This video can not be played Heath Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Today is a sombre day"" in UK coronavirus battle The UK has recorded 737 new coronavirus-related hospital deaths, taking the total number to 10,612. It comes after one of the government's senior scientific advisers saidthe UK was likely to be among the worst-affected European countries. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""today marks a sombre day"", but welcomed the efforts people had made to stay at home. The number of reported deaths does not include deaths outside of hospitals. Meanwhile,Boris Johnson thanked healthcare workers for saving his lifeafter being discharged from hospital. Mr Hancock told the daily press briefing: ""Today marks a sombre day in the impact of this disease as we join the list of countries who have seen more than 10,000 deaths related to coronavirus. ""The fact that over 10,000 people have now lost their lives to this invisible killer demonstrates just how serious this coronavirus is and why the national effort that everyone is engaged in is so important."" Boris Johnson: 'It could have gone either way' UK could be 'worst affected' country in Europe Latest on coronavirus from around the world The UK is the fifth country to surpass 10,000 deaths, joining the US, Spain, Italy and France. Earlier, Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the UK was likely to be ""one of the worst, if not the worst affected country in Europe"". In comparison, he said, the ""remarkable"" scale of testing in Germany had been key to keeping the number of hospital admissions for coronavirus lower than in the UK. ""Undoubtedly there are lessons to learn from that,"" he said. Responding to Sir Jeremy's comments, the health secretary said: ""The future of this virus is unknowable as yet because it depends on the behaviour of millions of people and the great British public."" Mr Hancock added that the government took advice from experts ""very seriously"". Public Health England medical director Professor Yvonne Doyle said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus in London was stabilising, but it was increasing in north-west England, Yorkshire and north-east England. Speaking about the loved ones of those who had died, Mr Hancock said: ""Their grief is our grief and their stories will not be forgotten."" Janice Graham, 58, was the first NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus. Her son said he would miss ""everything about her"". Read the tributes to Janice Graham Remembering NHS staff who have died The health secretary also congratulated the British public for ""rising to this challenge"" of staying at home. ""Your steadfast commitment to following these social distancing rules is making a difference,"" he added. Ministers are continuing to urge people to stay at home over the Easter weekend to curb the spread of the virus, despite warm and sunny weather across parts of the UK. Today's fall in the number of newly announced deaths of people with coronavirus is of little comfort as we pass the tragic milestone of 10,000. And we know that the true death toll to date is higher: this figure doesn't include people who have died with coronavirus but whose death has not yet been reported to the Department for Health. But it could have been worse. Up until last weekend, this figure was doubling every three and a half days. Had that continued, we might have seen more than 2,500 deaths announced today. That growth has not happened. Today's fall could be attributed to less reporting of deaths over a bank holiday. Even if we have not turned the corner, the number of deaths announced each day has held below 1,000 throughout the week. That is still a terrifying figure. But the slowdown in the growth of new cases, of people hospitalised with coronavirus and in deaths all add to the evidence that the lockdown is working. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health The health secretary alsoannounced plans for an NHS appthat will warn users if they have recently been in close proximity to someone suspected of having been infected by the coronavirus. Mr Hancock also addressed ongoing criticism over the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) for NHS staff. He denied that the government had been too slow to stockpile PPE and said supplies had been ""significant"", but acknowledged there was ""always more to be done"". There were now ""record amounts in the system"", he added. Mr Hancock said there was more spare capacity for critical care than there was when coronavirus ""first hit our shores"". As of Sunday, there were 2,295 spare critical care beds across Great Britain, up by 150 from Saturday, he said. In other developments: Parliament might be able to return virtually on 21 Aprilto debate coronavirus measures, authorise spending and make laws. ""More money needs to go out faster"" to businesses applying for emergency loans,the government has admitted. A ""close-knit"" care home near Bristolhas lost ""a significant number"" of its residentsto Covid-19. Some key medicines used in intensive care are ""in relatively short supply"", the BBC understands.

Could the UK government change its guidance about wearing masks outdoors? That was the question asked by the BBC's David Shukman at today's UK government virus briefing, as more countries introduce recommendations to wear them outside. Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, said it would change its mind if the evidence showed it was the right thing to do. He said there was a review ongoing at the moment over evidence on the impact of wearing masks, and said they had already seen ""more persuasive"" data to show that it stopped you passing on the virus, rather than catching it. But the advice has yet to change, he added. Earlier on Monday, World Health Organization special envoy Dr David Nabarro has suggested that more widespread use of maskswill become ""the norm"". Criticism of the decision to shut a drive-in testing centre for key workers on Bank Holiday Monday shows a ""complete lack of understanding of how the system works"", the Welsh Government has said. Public Health Wales said the closure of the testing centre at the Cardiff City Stadium was due to the ""low number of key workers anticipated to be working"" that day. The movesparked indignation from Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives. In response, a Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Key workers canât just turn up to this centre, they have to be booked in. ""Because of the small number booked in for today, they were all tested yesterday instead. ""Testing happens in a variety of locations and we now have a capacity to test up to 1,300 a day.â The Welsh Government has welcomed an announcement of a further Â£350m from the UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak. But it called for further cash. âThis latest consequential is welcome but, as the pandemic progresses, we will need further funding from the UK government to meet the costs associated with responding to this virus and longer-term support to rapidly rebuild the Welsh economy to pre-coronavirus levels,"" a spokesperson said.  Work continued today on Dragon's Heart Hospital, a 2,000-bed field hospital being built at Cardiff's Principality Stadium, as these pictures show.. About 300 beds were released to Cardiff and Vale University Health Board on Sunday. Hundreds have been employed to either work at the hospital or backfill at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales to replace relocating staff. The hospital will have a mobile x-ray, CT scanners and an end-of-life pathway - care for people in the last weeks or days of their life. The decision to close a Codiv-19 testing centre for key workers on Bank Holiday Monday appears ""very strange"", an AM has said. Welsh Tory Andrew RT Davies added his voice to thosecriticising the decisionto shut the testing centre at Cardiff City Stadium on Monday. Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was closed due to the ""low number of key workers anticipated to be working"" that day. ""This does appear a very strange move from Public Health Wales and the Welsh Government,"" the South Wales Central AMtweeted,external. ""Surely we should be exhausting all avenues to get people tested not simply shutting up shop because itâs a bank holiday?"" The Welsh Government has been asked for comment. Volunteers helping to provide meals for staff at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales have cooked up a batch for Tuesday. The project has raised more than Â£50,000 so far through crowd funding and delivered more than 8,100 main meals. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Welsh Government says it has been ""overwhelmed"" by the response of the public and businesses to the challenge of providing more personal protective equipment (PPE) to front-line workers. It was asked to respond after Cardiff man Richard Blackwell, who has made thousands of protective visors for NHS staff, said hehad been told he cannot give them to front-line workers because of red tape. ""If other companies would like to help they should contact theWales Life Sciences Hub,external,"" the statement added. Rugby star George North has sent a message of thanks and support to ambulance and NHS staff. In a video tweeted by the Welsh Ambulance Service, the Wales international addressed ambulance service staff and the whole NHS. ""I just want to say a huge thank you, your work is incredible. You put yourselves at risk to save everyone,"" he said. ""From myself and everyone in the country, we can't thank you enough.""   Allow Twitter content?

Adam Price criticised the closure of the testing centre on Monday The closure of a Covid-19 testing centre for key workers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday ""beggars belief"",the Plaid Cymru leader has said. Public Health Wales (PHW) said it was closed due to the ""low number of key workers anticipated to be working"" that day. But Mr Price questioned the decision at a time when Wales was testing less than other countries. And the Welsh Conservatives said there was no valid reason to have shut the centre. The Welsh Government has been asked to comment. The Cardiff City Stadium centre is one of several drive-in testing centres being set up to provide testing to key workers with symptoms and is the only one operating so far.  The UK is ""tracking behind Italy"" on deaths from coronavirus, the UK government's chief scientific adviser has said. Speaking at today's UK government virus briefing, Sir Patrick Vallance said he expected deaths to plateau for a while then decrease. Here is the UK government's global graph.  Dominic Raab has confirmed the total number of deaths in the UK has reached 11,329. Speaking at the UK government daily briefing, he said despite the ""grizzly figures"", there was some hope in the numbers, saying the lockdown measures were slowing the spread. The foreign secretary is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who's recovering after spending a week in hospital with coronavirus. He said didn't expect any changes to be made to lockdown measures currently in place across the UK until they can be confident they can be made safely. Mr Raab asked people to keep following the guidance and to stay home. ""If we let up now the virus will only take advantage, spread faster and kill more people,"" he added. ""Our plan is working. Please stick with it and we will get through this crisis together."" The Welsh Government will receive a further Â£350m from the UK Treasury to support its response to the coronavirus outbreak, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has
announced. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said this would take the total amount provided by Downing Street to First Minister Mark Drakeford's administration to Â£600m. Mr Hart said: âThe Chancellor promised to do whatever it takes to help the UK defeat coronavirus. This Â£350m of extra funding delivers on that promise. ""This is on top of funding to help support individuals and businesses and will provide our incredible front-line staff with the resources they need to save lives. ""This means that Wales will receive a total cash boost of almost Â£2bn from the UK government to help tackle coronavirus in Wales.â Â© 2025 BBC.
