Seat-by-seat result forecasts,"The UK is to have a hung parliament after the Conservatives failed to win an overall majority in the general election. The Conservatives ended the night with 318 seats, Labour with 262, the SNP with 35 and the Lib Dems with 14. Parties require 326 seats to command a majority. Prime Minister Theresa May's party may now have to depend on Northern Irish Unionist support to maintain its position in office. Based on analysis byprofessor of politics John Curtice,externaland his team, this page tracked undeclared seats where the main parties were still likely to make gains or where the result was too close to call.

Enter a postcode or seat name  Election results live updates Full UK results breakdown,external Analysis for this page is carried out by professor of politics John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, and his team. The BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll is conducted by asking a random sample of voters at 144 polling locations scattered around the country to complete in private a mock ballot paper to indicate how they just voted. Nearly all the locations are ones in which the 2015 exit poll was also conducted. The share of the vote recorded for each party at each polling location this time around is compared with the share obtained in the 2015 exit poll in order to derive 144 estimates of change in support for each party. These estimated changes in vote share are then statistically modelled to (i) ascertain any systematic geographical variation in the estimated changes in vote shares, and (ii) derive estimated vote shares for every party in every constituency in Great Britain. From the latter, the probability as to which party will win each seat is derived. For each party the exit poll forecast of seats won is the sum of these probabilities of winning across all constituencies. Once declarations begin, forecasts are then based on a combination of exit poll and real results.

While there is no other conceivable administration in the new parliament other than a Conservative-led one, it remains to be seen whether the PM will retain her position.

What happens if no-one wins the election?,"The general election has ended in a hung Parliament, where no party has the 326 seats needed to get an overall majority in the House of Commons. So what happens now? Theresa May remains prime minister. She plans to form a minority government, relying on the Democratic Unionist Party for support. Election results live updates Election night at-a-glance Full UK results breakdown,external If the DUP supports the Conservatives, then yes, they would together have more than the 326 seats required for a majority to pass a legislative programme. The two parties are currently in discussion, DUP leader Arlene Foster said. And the Conservatives, as the government in power before the general election, get the first attempt at forming an administration. In theory, if they fail to secure DUP backing, Labour could attempt to form its own minority government. But this is unlikely. The Conservatives and the DUP: 328 Labour, SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green: 314 A reminder: The magic number required for a Commons majority is 326. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  If the Conservatives go forward as a minority administration, they will fill all the ministerial positions themselves. But they will rely on the support of the DUP to help them pass legislation. Key to this is an arrangement called ""confidence and supply"" whereby the DUP would support the Tories if a vote of no confidence was called and help them to pass their Budget. Negotiations would still be needed to prevent ordinary day-to-day government business from being defeated. Theresa May has said her government will provide ""stability"" going into Brexit negotiations. And the next general election isn't due until 2022. But maintaining party unity and passing the government's bills will be a tricky task with so little room for rebellion - and the DUP are sure to make their own demands in return for propping up Mrs May's government. The BBC's Mark D'Arcypredictsa Conservative/DUP alliance faces a ""long, precarious high-wire act"", which will be ""beset by troubles and entanglements at every turn"". If the government grinds to a halt as a result, another general election could become unavoidable. This can only happen if: Two-thirds of MPs vote for it. In practice, it would need to be supported by both Labour and the Conservatives. Or: MPs pass a motion of no confidence in the government AND an existing or new government cannot win a confidence vote in the Commons within 14 days of the no-confidence vote Several elections resulted in minority government in the early part of the 20th century. Governments have also started out with majorities which were then lost due to by-elections and defections. Labour had a majority of three after the 1974 general election - but this had vanished by 1977, and it stayed in power thanks to a ""pact"" with the Liberal Party. And John Major's Conservative government started out with a majority of 21 in 1992 but was a minority government by the 1997 general election. The first deadline isTuesday 13 June, when the new Parliament meets for the first time. Mrs May has until this date to put together a deal to keep herself in power or resign,according to official guidance issued by the Cabinet Office.,external She is entitled to wait until the new Parliament to see if she has the confidence of the House of Commons. The government then needs to see if it can assemble the votes it needs to get its programme of proposed new laws passed in the Queen's Speech, which is scheduled forMonday 19 June. This is when it will be relying on the DUP's support. David Cameron and Nick Clegg led a coalition after the 2010 general election A coalition is when two or more parties join forces to govern as a single unit. The junior partners are given ministerial jobs and a joint programme for government is set out. This is what happened in 2010, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems teamed up, but it is unlikely this time given the numbers involved and the parties' statements. Labour has ruled one out - and in any case an alliance with the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens would still leave it short of a majority. The talks are currently due to begin on 19 June but if it takes a while to form a government it could ask the EU for a delay. The EU Parliament's chief negotiator said the outcome ""will make already complex negotiations even more complicated"". What would you like to know about the election results and what happens next?

Tories set to be largest party - exit poll,"This video can not be played Theresa May says the UK needs a period of stability The UK has woken up to a hung parliament with the Conservatives as the largest party, after the general election produced no overall winner. With nearly all results in, Theresa May faces ending up with 12 fewer seats than when she called the election. The Tories are set to get 319, Labour 261, the SNP 35 and the Lib Dems 12. An overall majority requires 326 seats. The BBC understands the PM will try to form a government, but Jeremy Corbyn also says he is ""ready to serve"". The prime minister said the country needed ""stability"" after the inconclusive election result and the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mrs May intended to try and govern on the basis that her party had won the largest number of votes and seats. Election Live: Rolling text and video updates Election 2017: Key points at-a-glance What happens if no-one wins the election? Full UK results breakdown,external There has been speculation she may seek some kind of informal arrangement with the Democratic Unionists, which won 10 seats in Northern Ireland, which could see it support the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said she expects ""some contact"" with the Tories over the coming days but she also told the BBC she believes Mrs May will find it ""difficult to survive"". After a better-than-expected night for Mr Corbyn, Labour is set to pick up 29 seats. The Tories are on course to lose 13 seats. The SNP are down by 22, losing seats to the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems, in a major setback for Nicola Sturgeon. Turnout so far is 68.7% - up 2% up on 2015 - but it has been a return to two-party politics in many parts of the country, with Labour and the Conservatives both piling up votes in numbers not seen since the 1990s and both set to top 40% of the vote. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: An ""incredible result"" for the Labour party This video can not be played The Tories haven't won an overall majority UKIP's vote slumped dramatically but rather than moving en masse to the Tories, as they had expected, their voters also switched to Labour. Mr Corbyn, speaking after being re-elected in Islington North, said it was time for Mrs May to ""make way"" for a government that would be ""truly representative of the people of this country"". He later told the BBC it was it was ""pretty clear who has won this election"". ""We are ready to serve the people who have put their trust in us,"" he said - but he also stressed he would not enter into any ""pacts or deals"" with other parties. Corbyn: Theresa May should go UKIP: May put Brexit 'in jeopardy' The biggest political upsets of the night Scotland: A tale of two Tory parties Wales: Labour hails 'fantastic' result The Conservatives have said in the event of a hung Parliament, Mrs May would get the opportunity to form a government first, as her predecessor David Cameron did in 2010 when there was also no clear winner but the party had comfortably more seats than their nearest rival. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party; as I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister, Anna Soubry, has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me ""I can't see how she can stay"". A minister texts to say the Tory party is ""absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in"". One Tory source says it is ""50:50"" that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. Read Laura's full blog Lord O'Donnell, formerly the UK's top civil servant, told the BBC that the prime minister had a duty to stay in post ""for now"" and had the right to seek the confidence of the House of Commons by asking it to approve a Queen's Speech, scheduled for 19 June. He added that he would be advising her to seek an audience with The Queen later on Friday to explain her intentions over the coming days. However, Labour has said it is ready to try and form a minority government of its own, while there is also a chance that the UK could be facing a fresh election later this summer. Could the DUP be kingmakers? Analysis: What this means for Brexit Did the youth vote cause a hung Parliament? How the world reacted Questions are also being asked about the potential impact on the upcoming Brexit negotiations which are due to start on 19 June. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has hinted that this could now be delayed,tweeting that,externalthe talks should begin only when the UK is ""ready"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry has given a frank assessment of her party's campaign Although one party needs to get 326 seats to get an overall majority, in practice the Conservatives would be expected to be able to get a Queen's Speech through with 318 MPs, if they had the backing of the DUP MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who is against Brexit, said it had been a ""dreadful campaign"" and Mrs May should ""now consider her position"". But her Brexit-supporting colleague Steve Baker said it was essential the party supported Mrs May to ""provide all the stability we can"". The Conservatives are forecast to win 42% of the vote, Labour 40%, the Lib Dems 7%, UKIP 2% and the Greens 2%. Speaking at her count in Maidenhead, Theresa May said the full picture had yet to emerge, but added: ""At this time more than anything else, this country needs a period of stability. ""And if... the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes, then it will be incumbent on us to ensure we have that period of stability - and that is exactly what we will do.""

The Lib Dems, which are to end up with four more seats, have ruled out going into coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Angus Robertson, has lost his seat to Conservative Douglas Ross and the Tories also took Angus, in North East Scotland, from the SNP. In other major developments: The SDLP and UUP were wiped out, losing all their seats The pound fell sharply as the markets opened Labour's Diane Abbott won a huge majority of 35,139 in Hackney North & Stoke Newington Home Secretary Amber Rudd narrowly held her seat with a majority of just 346 Tory MP Philip Davies said his party had made ""a pig's ear"" of the campaign FellowTory MP Nigel Evans saidhis party  had ""shot ourselves in the head"". SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""disappointed"" to have lost a number of seats but claimed her party had still ""won the election in Scotland"". She said she would like the SNP to ""play a part in a progressive alternative to a Tory government"" but would wait to see the final results. The Green Party are unchanged with one seat and Plaid Cymru still have three MPs, while the Lib Dems are on course to gain five.

Pound down after early election results,"The pound has fallen sharply as traders react to the results of the general election. The currency markets had been expecting a clear victory for Theresa May's Conservatives, but the party does not appear set to win a Commons majority. Sterling fell as lowas $1.27, down about two and a half cents from its level late on Thursday. It has since recovered to be down 1.5% at $1.2760, but the market is volatile and traders remain cautious. The BBC is projecting that the Conservatives will be the largest party with 318 seats - eight short of a majority. Given the surprise outcome of the poll so far, the pound could have been expected to fall even more sharply. However, the fact it has not slipped further may reflect the diminishing prospect of a ""hard"" Brexit. Although a hung parliament would mean uncertainty, Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said that a ""softer version of Brexit"" was now more likely. ""Mrs May's mandate to push through her clean, hard Brexit has evaporated. Voters didn't want to hand her the blank cheque for Brexit. It may leave negotiations in limbo but would also tend to suggest that the downside for sterling is limited,"" he said. When will we know who's won? Seat-by-seat result forecasts Election results live updates Election 2017: At a glance Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that suggested the UK's membership of both the single market and customs union would now be ""back on the table"". Sir Vince is returning to the Commons after regaining the seat of Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats. Sterling fell after an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky released as the polls closed at 22:00 cast doubt on an overall Conservative majority, raising concerns about increased uncertainty and a possible delay to Brexit negotiations. Sterling has been trading in a range between $1.28 and $1.30 in recent weeks. Against the eurothe pound is down 1% at 1.142 euros. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

How election results are calculated and reported by the BBC,"Key questions about general election results, and how the BBC reports them, are answered below. By winning more seats in the House of Commons than all the other parties put together. If a party does that, it has what is known as amajority. There are 650 seats available, which means 326 seats are needed to win an overall majority. However, an effective majority could be smaller as the Speaker and his deputies, although MPs, do not usually vote. Also, Sinn Fein, which won four seats in Northern Ireland in 2015, traditionally refuses to swear allegiance to the Queen, and is not entitled to vote as a consequence. Also called aseat, in a general election, this is where the political battles are fought. Voters in each constituency choose just one MP. No. But a reduction in the number of MPs from650 to 600and changes to some constituency boundaries was proposed in September 2016 and is now under public consultation. Final proposals are expected to be made in 2018. The Speaker of the House of Commons is an MP and has to stand for re-election as Speaker in his, or her, constituency at every general election. Traditionally the biggest parties in the House of Commons do not stand against the Speaker however some parties, such as UKIP and the Green Party do. The current Speaker,John Bercow, is standing for election in Buckingham. The Speaker is a neutral figure in Parliament, so Mr Bercow is no longer a member of the Conservative Party as he was before his election to the role (by parliament). However, for the purposes of calculating the number of seats belonging to each party - and calculating those held, gained or lost by each party - Mr Bercow's seat is regarded as being a Conservative constituency, as he won it for the party in 1997, 2001 and 2005 before being elected speaker. If Mr Bercow wins again, the result inBuckinghamwill be described as ""Speaker hold"" - and his seat will be added to the Conservative total. The BBC follows the same principle at every general election. What matters most is how many ""seats"" each party wins, and for things to change political parties need to win seats from each other. Because winning seats from each other is so important, a special language is used to show this. Seats that are won can mainly fall into two categories:holdorgain. Hold:If a party wins a seat that it won in 2015, this is described as a ""hold"" Gain:If a party wins a seat that it did not win in 2015, this is called a ""gain"" Win:Where there has been a by-election since the 2015 election and that by-election resulted in a different party gaining the seat compared with the general election result Clearly these are really important to the opposition parties. If they are to form a new government, they need to win seats from the existing government and other parties to make ""gains"", while they retain or ""hold"" all the seats they had last time. By-elections are one-off elections in seats where, for example, the sitting MP has stood down or died.  There have been 10 by-elections since 2015. When the BBC reports general election results, all of these interim by-elections are ignored, to allow for straightforward comparison with 2015's seats. The BBC uses slightly different terminology to describe results where seats have changed hands in by-elections. For example:  in 2016 Liberal Democrat Sarah Olney wonRichmond Parkfrom Conservative Zac Goldsmith. If Zac Goldsmith regains the seat on 8 June, the result will be described as a ""Conservative Win"". It will not appear as a net gain in the Conservatives' overall UK seat tally. However, if an entirely different party wins a by-election seat, that result will be described as a ""gain"" from whichever party won the seat in 2015. The BBC adopts this policy in recognition of the very particular circumstances which often shape the outcome of by-elections. Comparing seat change from 2015 represents a fairer way of representing how the political expression of voters has altered from general election to general election. To win an election, a party must win enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government.  To do that simply one party needs to get one more seat than all the others added together. That is called anoverall majority, but in the shorthand language of elections it is just called amajority. There are 650 seats in Parliament, so to get one more than everyone else put together a party must get 326 or more to get a ""majority"". Of course it makes things much easier for a government if they have many more MPs than all the others put together. That number is called thesize of the majority. So, if one party were to win 326 seats, then all the other parties added together would be 324. The majority is therefore 326 minus 324: two. So the smallest majority possible is not one seat but two. Another quick way of working this out is to take away 325 from the number of seats that the winning party has got and double the result. For example: If the winning party has 350 seats what is the majority? 350-325=25 25x2=50 So the majority is 50. A tip for any office sweepstake on the size of the majority is never bet on an odd number. A hung parliament happens when no single party wins a majority. A party can stay in power without an absolute majority by trying to forge an alliance with a smaller party to create acoalition government. Alternatively, it can aim to reach agreements with smaller parties to support it in parliament in the event of aconfidence motionaimed at bringing down the government. Another possibility is for the biggest party to form aminority governmentwith no agreements with other parties, and just try to form majorities in favour of each individual bill as it comes up - an arrangement sometimes calledconfidence and supply. If no party is prepared to go down one of these paths then parliament will be dissolved again and there will be another election. The general election in 2010 ended in a hung parliament, with the Conservatives the largest party. After negotiation, a coalition government was formed between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. Anexit pollis conducted by approaching voters as they leave polling stations and asking them to fill in a mock ballot paper to indicate how they have just voted. The exit poll is carried out by polling companies GfK and Ipsos Mori for the BBC, ITV News and Sky News. The results of the exit poll will allow BBC analysts to forecast approximately how many seats each party has won. When polls close at 22:00 BST, the BBC will broadcast the results of the exit poll.  The projected seats for the top five parties based on the exit poll will be displayed in the summary graphic as grey bars. When the first results are declared, around an hour later, parties will begin to be ordered left to right by number of seats won at that time. As the night progresses, the summary results graphic will always display the top five parties according to seats won. All other parties' seats will be amalgamated into ""Others"". The BBC's 2015 results summary graphic Full results are always available via the link to the results homepage, which contains a listings and breakdown of seats, votes and vote share by party. When all results are known, the summary graphic will conclude by displaying the top five parties by seats won in the new Parliament. In the event of a tie in the top five - eg two parties have two seats  - the party with the most votes will be named. There are no seat predictions available for parties in Northern Ireland, as the exit poll is carried out in Great Britain (GB) only. The technology has changed, but the principles remain To appear as a named party in either the overall UK scoreboard or a nation scoreboard, a party must fulfil one of the following criteria: Standing in one-sixth of seats in any UK nation Fielding more than five candidates either across the UK or in a single nation Achieved greater than 1% of the vote at UK or nation level at the last general election Had a sitting MP in the last parliament All parties which do not meet these criteria are amalgamated into a group called Others. An aggregated tally of votes for the 191 independent candidates is also shown on the main UK scoreboard. Each constituency page will always name every party and independent standing in that constituency. The BBC only recognises parties which are registered as political parties by the Electoral Commission. On election night, the BBC calculates percentage turnout by dividing the number of valid votes cast for all candidates by the number of people eligible to vote (known as the electorate) Spoilt or rejected ballots are not included. The UK and nations turnout figures update through the night, based on electorates divided by valid votes of all constituencies declared so far.

A new rover built by Nasa and named Perseverance will land on Mars in February 2021 using the ""sky crane"" method. A giant parachute and rocket motors will slow the mission's descent before the rover is lowered to the surface using cables. Perseverance - a six-wheeled robotic machine with 23 cameras and a drill - will seek signs of ancient life in a large crater called Jezero. It will collect rock and soil samples that look like they may have been altered by contact with micro-organisms. The rover will store its samples in metal canisters - but leave them behind on the Martian surface to continue its mission. Perserverance's plutonium-based power supply could keep the rover trundling around Mars for 10 years or more. Later this decade - after 2026 - a second, smaller rover, to be built by the European Space Agency (Esa), will arrive on Mars. This ""fetch rover"" will travel across the surface picking up the sample canisters left behind by Perseverance. The canisters will be loaded into a protective container and placed into a small rocket - the Mars Ascent Vehicle or MAV. This will blast into the sky, placing the container into orbit around Mars. The sample container will be met in orbit and caught by a European satellite. This ""return orbiter"" will act like a cargo ship, bringing the precious rock and soil specimens back to Earth. We don't expect the satellite to arrive home until at least 2031, by which time the sample container will have been packaged in a heavily protected capsule, to be sent into Earth's atmosphere to land in North America. Scientists will then study the rocks and soil using advanced techniques, including some that have yet to be invented because there should be enough material to investigate for decades ahead. The samples will shed light on Mars' history and whether it has ever supported microbial lifeforms.

"'I raised Â£52,000 after Manchester... I wish I hadn't'","From attending vigils to laying flowers, getting bee tattoos to giving blood, people have felt a need to act in response to the recent terror attacks inManchesterandLondon.But while launching a fundraising appeal can be one of the most effective ways of helping, some good Samaritans end up ruing the day they decided to become involved. ""If I could go back, if I could envisage the problems and stress it would cause, I would have avoided it."" So says Michael Johns who was ""compelled"" to raise money for a campaign for a homeless man who helped the victims of the suicide bombing at the end of the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester on 22 May. But ever since, ""multiple, multiple times"", he has wished he had not. The 25-year-old, from Nottingham, set up a page on the GoFundMe website for Chris Parker after reading about how he had come to the aid of people caught up in the Manchester Arena attack. ""Hopefully this campaign will go some way to helping Chris off the streets and also show our gratitude for his actions,"" Michael stated as the aim on his funding page. Joy shines through pain at benefit gig Attack staff pint fundraiser raises Â£13k Fraud fear over terror victim fundraising The response was ""unprecedented"", surpassing Â£52,000 - his original target was Â£1,000. But getting people to donate was just the start. Getting the money to Chris has proved much more complicated. ""It has gone from being a fairly straightforward case of just handing over a relatively small amount to having an amount that is potentially life-changing,"" he said. Michael initially struggled to track down the 33-year-old. People then started asking for refunds after a woman in Manchester wrote on social media about bumping into Chris, who said he was still homeless and had no money - and the post went viral. Michael has faced accusations of not doing enough and trying to gain financially out of the situation, and has received abusive messages online. The pair did eventually manage to meet up and Michael came up with a model to have the money put into a trust with five trustees - donors, a solicitor, an accountant, a homelessness outreach worker and a homelessness support professional. Michael negotiated with GoFundMe to release a small amount of the money so Chris's ""needs can be met in the meantime"". Chris, says Michael, is a ""vulnerable person"" who had had to deal with a terror attack, a reunion with his mother and unprecedented press coverage in a short space of time. But he says that despite offers of help from a number of organisations, Chris ""is actively not engaging with that support"". ""Whilst this is the case, the process will be slow and there are likely to be other Facebook posts that do not bother to grasp the complexities of the situation,"" Michael added in an update on the appeal site. ""I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place but I'm trying my hardest to plough on with this in the correct direction."" Rochdale-based tattoo shop Inkspire saw fundraising idea turn sour When Rochdale-based tattoo shop Inkspire started another appeal for the victims of the Manchester attacks, it never expected to end up facing criticism. Inkspire offered bee tattoos - the symbol of the city - to customers for a donation of Â£25, raising more than Â£1,000. Staff then decided, rather than donating the money to the official We Love Manchester appeal which had already raised millions of pounds, they would donate to the ""Save Samantha fund"" set up to help a local mother with a rare genetic condition. In a Facebook post, later deleted, they wrote: ""As such a huge amount has been raised already for such a great cause we thought perhaps we would also help another of our own from the Manchester/Rochdale area."" Samantha Smith, who suffers from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and is trying to raise Â£150,000 for life-saving surgery in the US, was subjected to vile messages and numerous death threats online. Samantha Smith became inadvertently caught up in a social media storm about fundraising donations The 30-year-old, left ""heartbroken and exhausted"" by the reaction, transferred the Â£1,285 donation herself to the Red Cross appeal for the Manchester victims. Inkspire have since posted: ""All the funds raised for Manchester victims has been donated as originally planned. ""We deeply apologise for any upset caused as we promise this was never our intention. ""We have also decided to re-donate Â£1,285 to Samantha Smith a local mother who is in need of life saving medical assistance."" One of the most high-profile crowdfunding campaigns in the UK ended with the woman behind it never wanting to do charity work again. Beautician Katie Cutler, from Gateshead, set up an internet appeal which raised hundreds of thousandsfor disabled pensioner Alan Barnes,after he was mugged in 2015. Katie Cutler raised more than Â£300,000 for disabled pensioner Alan Barnes But she was then taken to the small claims court by a PR company, who gave the campaign publicity, and wasordered to pay Â£6,200 for an unpaid bill. After the hearing, a tearful Miss Cutler said: ""I'm happy that I have done some nice things and have helped some people. ""But because of this I will not do any more charity work. I won't take part in anything for anyone else because I am so disappointed.""

Couple's photo sparks body image debate,"When 25-year-old student Jasmine ""Jazzy"" Owensshared an Instagram image,externalof herself and her husband Keenen in their bathing suits, she recalled how she ""could never understand why"" he would be with her. Her picture went viral and has sparked a conversation about how society judges female bodies, compared to their male partners.  Now she's spoken to BBC Trending about how a bout with depression inspired her to chronicle her journey to accepting her body as it is. Owens wrote on Instagram that while she had struggled with her body confidence, her husband had loved ""every curve, every roll, and every stretch mark on my body"".  She added that she was now on a path to accepting herself as she is and encouraged other women to do the same. This image of Jazzy and Keenen went viral on Instagram The post has received more than 69,000 likes and hundreds of comments hailing her as ""great role model for women"" and ""inspiring"". But the online conversation also brought out the attitudes that she's trying to fight back against - with people ready to judge her by her looks. Jazzyreposted,externalone that told her to ""stop your delusion, these pics are gross and has already been shared as a meme.""  Others comments were far more vitriolic - pointing to how Jazzy's body type was different to that of her gym-honed husband. Jazzy told BBC Trending that she has been called ""fat, ugly, unhealthy, that I'm going to die young, that my husband is cheating on me or only in it because I am rich"" - something which she points out is not true. ""I never thought that it would blow up like it did,"" she says. ""When it happened, I was in complete shock. Anxiety through the roof, mixed emotions of happy and scared at the same time."" The couple have known each other since they were teenagers and have two children - MaKaylah (3) and Keenen Jr (5) Jazzy decided to make her Instagram page public and share images of herself on a ""journey to loving my body"" after she had experienced a bout of depression. ""I hated the way I looked during the depression. But when I started feeling better, I thought I should share that experience and inspire other women that may be going through the same thing to feel the same way."" Jazzy decided to document her journey to body confidence on Instagram after a bout of depression ""Even though it scares me to have the whole world see me, it also brings me joy to know that I am not hiding any longer."" The couple live in Honolulu with their two children, where Keenen is posted in the US military. They've known each other since school. The husband in the picture, Keenan, told BBC Trending that he is supportive of his wife's decision to share her fitness goals on Instagram. ""It felt amazing to see my wife's story being shared across the world as inspiration for other young women,"" he says. Jazzy shares images of herself and Keenen exercising together on her Instagram page But  has Jazzy been put off sharing more images by the negative comments? ""Not at all,"" she says. ""This response has motivated me to love myself even more and to try to help other women and men love themselves - no matter what they look like.""

General election voting coming to an end,"A launderette in Oxford has been turned into a temporary polling station for the election Voting is coming to an end in the UK general election. Polls opened at 07:00 BST on Thursday at more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, with counting starting once voting ends at 22:00 BST. A total of 650 Westminster MPs will be elected, with about 46.9 million people registered to vote. That is up from the last general election, in 2015, when there were 46.4 million registered voters. The turnout in 2015 was 66.4%. Latest updates Guide: How to vote Find your constituency and candidates What CAN'T you do in a polling station? Manifesto guide on where the parties stand How to follow results night and what to watch for Some votes had already been cast, through postal voting, which accounted for 16.4% of the total electorate at the 2015 general election. People with an undelivered postal vote can still deliver it by hand to their local polling station. Overall turnout in 2015, when the Conservatives won 331 out of 650 seats, was 66.4%, up from 2010.

Enter a postcode or seat name  Most polling stations are in schools, community centres and parish halls, but pubs, a launderette and a school bus have been used in the past. Police have increased security at polling stations, including patrols by armed officers in some areas, following the recent terror attacks. Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May cast their votes on Thursday after a seven-week campaign Lib Dem leader Tim Farron looked cheerful despite the rain after voting in Kendal, Cumbria Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas voted with her husband Richard Savage in Brighton UKIP leader Paul Nuttall cast his ballot in Congleton, Cheshire In Glasgow, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon voted at a local community hall Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood went to vote in Penygraig A handful of seats are expected to be declared by midnight, with the final results expected on Friday afternoon. Unusually, no local elections are taking place at the same time, so results might come through earlier than in recent general elections. In 2015 the first seat to declare was Houghton and Sunderland South, at 22:48 BST. To form a majority in the House of Commons one party must win 326 seats - in 2015 a Conservative majority was not confirmed until 13:34 BST. The weather forecast is for some rain in south-west England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales on Thursday, with south-east England remaining cloudy and dry. Dogs at polling stations have become a familiar sight Polls close at 22:00 BST, but officials say anyone in a polling station queue at this time should be able to cast their vote. The BBC's main election programme, fronted by David Dimbleby, starts at 21:55 BST, with live coverage from scores of counts. Dimbleby, fronting his 10th election night broadcast, will be joined by Mishal Husain, Emily Maitlis, Jeremy Vine. David Dimbleby will front BBC television coverage Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will have their own overnight programmes but will join Huw Edwards from 07:00 BST on 9 June. On the radio, an overnight broadcast by BBC Radio 4 will be hosted by Jim Naughtie and Carolyn Quinn. On BBC Radio 5 live, the overnight show will be hosted by Stephen Nolan and Emma Barnett.

This time last night, the two main parties were pouring cold water all over the exit poll that put Theresa May's future in doubt. Tonight that question is very much on Tory minds. She said today that she wants to stay and is in the process of working out how to deal more closely with the DUP (not without controversy) to get her business through Parliament. Yet, there is an increasing mood that she might not get the chance to do so for very long. One minister predicted that, ""slowly and reluctantly"", the party might rally round her. But sentiment in the party, never scientific, seems to be drifting away from allowing that situation to happen. Three MPs have publicly questioned her right to stay on. One senior Conservative told me tonight she ""has to go"", suggesting she has a ""responsibility to the party"" to get the Queens Speech through, show the Conservatives can form the government, and then she ought to move aside. Full UK election results breakdown,external Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name  Other MPs are gently exploring the possibility of submitting letters to the chairman of the 1922 committee - 48 would be required to trigger a leadership contest. Another former minister told me: ""I just can't see how she stays."" To stay, there are already demands that Theresa May changes her ways of working. Her loyal chiefs of staff could be forced to go and a deputy prime minister might be appointed to create a less brittle and vulnerable government. But moves from her might not be enough. Her gamble may not ultimately have just cost the Tories their majority, but for her, her political career. This situation is changing fast and could feel totally different by the morning. But the rallying round the prime minister that has given her the chance to form a government may turn out to be only a brief window of opportunity - a space to allow her the time to come to her own conclusions. She stays, for today. After a few hours of wild uncertainty, Theresa May will head to Buckingham Palace to seek permission from the Queen to form a government. She has the understanding and assurance from the DUP to be able to form a government, it seems. The PM has experienced a political disaster of her own making. But uniquely perhaps for a prime minister in this situation she is, despite her ruthless party's DNA, planning to stay. The reason? Brexiteers don't want to rock the boat. No-one wants another election. And there is paranoia, whatever the EU says publicly, that Brussels would use the opportunity to cause the maximum amount of trouble. The way it's hoped at top levels of the party to avoid that is to leave 'the boss' as they call her, in place. But only for now. I am yet to talk to a Tory source today who believes she can stay for as long as she likes. She is being seen as a caretaker PM, here for continuity at a time of great volatility - strangely the sort of reasons cited when she was nominated for the leadership. That was of course, before Theresa May revealed herself to be a gambler too. A trait only revealed once she moved into Number 10 - a trait that might be her political undoing, even if she keeps the address for now. In the last few minutes the PM has made it plain she will try to stay on and form a government. That's her right to do so, and as the party with the largest number of seats and votes the Tories will almost definitely form the next government. But there is already pressure on her to go. The question is not just whether enough Tory MPs are happy to keep backing her but also if it is vaguely realistic for her to stay on with her authority so challenged. The conversations have started not just about whether the Tories will be able to form a government, but whether or not Theresa May can stay in her job. There is no one prevailing mood inside the Tory party. As I write, Mrs May is holed up with her advisers inside Tory HQ. But a former minister Anna Soubry has called for her to ""consider her position"" - political code for calling for her to resign. Another senior MP tells me 'I can't see how she can stay'. A minister texts to say the Tory party is 'absolute monarchy, ruled by regicide and that's the territory we are in'. One Tory source says it is '50:50' that she will quit in the morning. But others are urging caution, calling for reflection, a period of calm. It's clear the Tory party won't allow her to stay on to fight another General Election campaign in some years hence. But cooler heads may press on her to stay, not to walk away. This is the election none of the main parties predicted. Just as David Cameron finished off his own career by gambling with the EU referendum he didn't have to have, Theresa May has followed him by calling a national vote when it was not required, because of our relationship with the European Union, and ended her career in the same way. It's only just after two am. There are lots of seats to come in. But at this stage, Tory ministers are saying they do not expect to outperform the exit poll. That means, despite all of those Tory expectations, that confidence they regained in the last week or so of the campaign, the disbelief there was when our exit poll was announced, that privately at the highest level the Conservatives are now beginning to give up on achieving a majority. It's just not clear yet whether or not they will be the largest party. Our exit poll suggests that they will. But either way, Theresa May is damaged, ""strong and stable"" sounds less like an irritating political catchphrase, and more like a parallel universe. She called this election only because she thought she would achieve a much bigger majority than the Tories already had. Even if the Conservatives still end up ahead in terms of the number of seats, her authority looks set to be seriously damaged. It is hard to see how her reputation will recover, and she will have achieved the opposite effect of what she had hoped. This election could produce a more uncertain political picture, a wounded Prime Minister trying to take on the most complicated task any Prime Minister has faced -  that's if, of course, the Tories remain the largest party, and she hangs on. This video can not be played Laura Kuenssberg: Theresa May has played a high risk political game If these numbers are correct, Theresa May played a high-risk political game and has lost it  - she didn't have to call this election, and only did so in order to give herself a mandate and breathing space during the bumpy ride of Brexit. Just a few weeks ago at the start of all of this she seemed unassailable, but a shaky campaign and an insurgent Labour Party may have dashed the Tories' hopes. This exit poll result is not what either parties were predicting privately - this would be another political surprise - the public again defying the expectations of both the main sides. The Conservatives do look set to be the largest party - it's not clear on these numbers if they will be able to govern alone. Theresa May's promise throughout was to offer her catchphrase ""strong and stable leadership"" - instead she may end diminished - but only of course, your votes, and the real results, will determine through the course of the night what really happens next.

Kamal Ahmed: Election uncertainty stalks the market,"Uncertainty - we'll be hearing a lot more of that word over the next few hours. When the general election exit poll was revealed at 10pm, the pound immediately dropped by 2% as investors took a position that a hung parliament was a possible outcome of the general election. Why would that cause the currency to decline? Because a hung parliament means that the government's direction of travel would be less certain. Deals would have to be done, and those vital Brexit negotiations possibly become all the more difficult. The future of the UK economy could be confused by a fog of political to-ing and fro-ing. Nervousness would increase and investors in charge of large amounts of global capital could decide to move their money to more attractive markets, such as the eurozone where growth has picked up and political risk (the major Dutch and French elections are behind us for example) has reduced. In any election investors would rather a large majority, frankly for either the Conservatives or for Labour, as that means the threat of another general election recedes. The direction of travel for the economy also becomes more certain. Now, since that exit poll, the first results have suggested that the Conservatives may be doing slightly better than that exit poll suggested. The pound has also rallied a little. What looks likely, though, is that the result is going to be tight, and whoever forms the next government will not have the certainty investors would prefer.

Four days behind the Taliban front line,"This video can not be played The BBC is given rare access to see life under the Taliban Sixteen years after they were ousted in the US-led invasion, the Taliban have fought their way back to control swathes of Afghanistan. The country remains mired in conflict, and recent months have seen a series of bloody attacks. In the south, key towns are now Taliban territory. The BBC's Auliya Atrafi was invited by the militants to spend four days behind the front line in Helmand province witnessing life under their control. In the town of Sangin, two dozen men sat cross-legged inside a huge mud compound. Under the full moon, their black turbans cast deep shadows over their sunburned features. These were the Taliban's special forces; the Red Unit. They sat quietly as they listened to their commander Mullah Taqi telling war stories, gently cradling their M4 machine guns. The M4s, with their night-vision scopes, were one of the main reasons they had captured nearly 85% of Helmand province from less-well-armed Afghan forces. But these victories had presented Taliban leaders with an unexpected challenge. The people they now ruled had lived with government services for more than a decade. Schools, hospitals, development - residents had become accustomed to them. So how could a group entirely focused on taking territory evolve into one that could attempt to run it? Men at the market in Musa Qala - women are rarely seen in public Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualtieshit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Setting up our visit to Taliban territory took months. It had been years since a journalist with international media had secured such access. But in mid-May, we crossed the frontline in Gereshk, following a boy on a motorbike. We drove on the main Kabul-Herat highway towards Kandahar. Just by an Afghan National Army post, the boy suddenly turned left, leaving the highway behind, and rode into scattered settlements. He handed us over to two Taliban guards who were manning a makeshift base. One sat with us in the car, while the other led us on a motorbike towards the Zanbulai area. There, waiting for us. was Mullah Taqi, the head of Taliban special forces. He stood with a group of his men, all nursing sophisticated weaponry. Throughout the visit we were accompanied by a Taliban media team who controlled what we saw. We were not allowed to film anything to do with opium.  The opium trade is synonymous with this region - Afghanistan produces about 90% of the world's opium - and helps fund the Taliban. I tried to explain to their media head, Asad Afghan, the English concept of ""an elephant in the room"". He put his hand on my shoulder and said: ""Opium is our economic necessity, but we hate it as much as you do."" The fact is the Taliban need the money they get from drugs - it buys arms and helps fund their fight. Taliban special forces are well armed Bomb damage at what's left of the police station in Sangin Our first encounter with Taliban governance came in the market. Sangin has been fiercely contested for more than a decade - hundreds of UK, US and Afghan troops lost their lives here - and finally fell to the Taliban in March this year. The old Sangin bazaar had been flattened in the battle for the city. We walked through its makeshift replacement, a sea of tarpaulin and boxes. Two men were arguing by a food stall. ""I can't read!"" shouted shopkeeper Haji Saifullah. ""How was I supposed to know the biscuits were out of date?"" He fidgeted with his turban, pushing it to one side nervously. The Taliban mayor of Sangin, clutching petrol jugs The other man was the Taliban mayor of Sangin, Noor Mohammad. He ordered Haji Saifullah to be imprisoned for three days and to pay a fine. Next on the mayor's list was inspecting petrol containers to see if they had been altered to pour under the promised gallon. After that came examinations for people who claimed to be doctors, but who he suspected were lying. Later we drove to Musa Qala, the Taliban's de facto capital. Just short of the town, we stopped at a travelling bazaar set up on a dry riverbed. Young traders in Musa Qala Musa Qala is famous for the opium trade but it is also a commercial lifeline for the district. Traders come here all the way from the Afghan-Pakistan border areas. At the bazaar you could buy motorbikes, cows, ice-cream - and less conventional commodities such as ammunition. Bullets for an AK47 were 25 cents (15p) each. Bullets for a Russian machine-gun used to be 40 cents each, but were reduced to 15 cents because - according to the shopkeeper - too many of them had been captured from the Afghan security forces. Bullets on sale in the market in Musa Qala While the Taliban focus on health, safety and trading standards in Sangin was surprising, more discoveries awaited us in Musa Qala. Despite it being the Taliban capital, the school and hospital were still being funded by the government in Kabul. Read more about the conflict: Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' Mistrust and fear in battle for Helmand UK military deaths in Afghanistan: Full list ""The government recently did their inspections; our schools were officially registered; our salaries that were locked for a year were later released,"" said Abdul Rahim, the government's head of education for Musa Qala. He said the Taliban did not have any problem with government inspectors, and that the system was working. ""The government give us stationery and everything else, we implement the government syllabus and the Taliban don't have a problem with it,"" he said. Girls get primary education but after that schools cater for boys under the Taliban But not everything was running smoothly. Across Afghanistan, about 40% of pupils enrolled in schools are female, according to US Aid. Not in Musa Qala, however. No girls over the age of about 12 were being educated in the Taliban capital. But girls were deprived of education here even before the Taliban took hold, because it is a very conservative area. For the boys, meanwhile, there were not enough basic supplies. ""The way our school is run is good, as in security, but we have one problem and that's we don't have enough books,"" said one student, Dadul-Haq. ""One student will be missing maths, the other chemistry - not all pupils have the same books."" It struck me that in education, at least, the Taliban are tentatively experimenting by allowing wider access to education - at least for boys - than during their earlier regime. Under them, before 2001, many fewer boys went to school in the countryside. But experiences like Haji Saifullah's - the biscuit seller in Sangin - have made rural Afghans realise that education and literacy are essential. They will not turn you into an infidel, as their forefathers feared. Now the Taliban appear to have realised that they cannot fight the modern world forever, so some have opted to join it on their own terms. Electricity is something people in Helmand are now used to Asad Afghan, the Taliban's media co-ordinator, used a proverb to make his point. ""The fire may have burnt our house, but it made our walls stronger,"" he said. He meant that the Taliban had learned from the past mistake of isolating themselves from modernisation. Many say the Taliban have brought some security - albeit with limited freedoms - to the countryside they control. Areas used to years of fighting between troops and militants are now seeing a dramatic rise in trade. Many people say they prefer the Taliban's swift - but flawed - system of justice to the previous administration, which they say was riddled with corruption and patronage. Profile: Taliban chief Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada Money from honey: Expert views on how the insurgency funds itself What happened after Taliban founderMullah Omar died? We visited the district hospital which, like the school, was funded by the government but run by the Taliban. It is meant to serve 120,000 people, but lacked many basic facilities. There was not one female doctor; neither was there a paediatric specialist. It wasn't even possible to get a chest X-ray. To cater for women the Taliban had built a separate facility next door, run by female staff. One doctor said the dual system had created a responsibility vacuum and opened the door to corruption. ""I haven't been paid in the past six months - not only me but also the entire staff of the hospital,"" he said. ""[Government] supervisors write things on paper that don't turn into reality. Our medicine for three months doesn't last us more than a month and halfâ¦ this is because sometimes the Taliban come and want medicine for themselves."" We asked the Taliban's supervisor for health services, Attaullah, if we could interview a female nurse, but he refused. Her husband told him that he had no problem with the interview, but Attaullah said: ""It is your right to allow the interview and my responsibility to stop it. ""What would be the difference between us and the government if we allowed interviews with women?"" During the four days I was in Taliban territory, I only saw women in clinics and being transported around by their male relatives. But men here have always preferred women to stay at home out of sight. Even if the Taliban were not here, it is unlikely things would be very different. Some activities were limited. In Musa Qala, using mobile phones and the internet was banned for security and religious reasons - our Taliban media handlers communicated via walkie-talkies. Filming and playing musical instruments are also not allowed. One young man told me he was given 40 lashes for watching a Bollywood film. The Taliban have cracked down on bachabaze - dance parties involving teenage boys that can often end in sexual abuse. They also come down hard on homosexuality, although it appears the Taliban legal process can be influenced with a mixture of pulling strings and bribes. You just didn't see posters like this under the Taliban in the past There are contradictions. We were allowed in to film, for example. And we passed billboards that featured pictures of Western women advertising dental clinics - a far cry from the days when the Taliban banned such images. Despite the internet ban, there are wi-fi hotspots providing a connection to the outside world. A few dedicated fans of Turkish and Indian soap operas have televisions connected to small satellite dishes. ""Aren't you scared the Taliban will find out?"" I asked one teenager. ""They know about our TV and the wi-fi,"" he said. ""But I think they are just watching and waiting, to see what happens."" During our visit, we were aware that the Taliban were treating us carefully, mindful of creating a good impression. Equally, Sangin and Musa Qala are important to them, so keeping local people happy matters. We heard reports that Taliban control in other places was more rigid. For the Taliban, beginning to adapt in the face of modernity seems to be a painful dilemma: embrace it and you lose control and religious legitimacy; reject it and you become an island. When it comes to governance, the Taliban's Achilles heel is thought to be their political philosophy, or rather the lack of it. From the start, their focus has been on war and there has been little scope for political thinking to evolve. Their success has become their greatest nemesis. As a white-bearded school headmaster put it: ""The Taliban see everything through the prism of war, and they see winning wars as their sole purpose in life."" What does the future hold for these Musa Qala boys growing up under militant rule? I reminded him that the Taliban also had a culture of obedience and were disciplined, so didn't he think they would be able to direct their devotion to war into the art of politics? He dropped his head, thought for a moment and shook his head doubtfully. He didn't think so. At night, we would dine with local Taliban leaders and discuss these themes. One evening a Taliban leader strove to convince us of the benefits of life under the Taliban by contrasting it with the failings of the Afghan government. But it struck me that the world they wanted to create was too absolute for a human society. I suggested that society was messy, complicated and always in transition, and wondered how successful any government would be trying put it in a fixed framework. The leader, Musavir Sahib, was a tiny man, with long beard and blue eyes. He was adamant: ""Our governance is based on sacred scripture; it is the best solution for any human society. ""Afghans are adaptable people,"" he added. ""When we took over the country for the first time, very soon people started dressing up like us. And then when the Americans came, they started dressing up like the Americans. So surely they will adopt our governance again."" He could not conceive that people could oppose Taliban rule and were coerced by them into doing what they wanted. The police headquarters in Sangin bears the name of the UK regiment that was based in the area Back inside government-held territory, I realised that describing the insurgent group had become less straightforward and full of contradictions. The Taliban have changed significantly while at the same time they are stuck in their past; they feel they have to adapt to the modern world while thinking theirs is the best way of governance. In the areas they hold, they seem to be trying to provide a peaceful existence, but elsewhere they continue carrying out their deadly bombings. Their goal to create their specific kind of extreme Islamic state is unchanged and they are still fighting because they see themselves as winning. But they now face a new challenge. In the areas they control, people now expect life-changing improvements like healthcare and electricity - a lasting legacy of the billions of dollars that poured in with foreign forces to rebuild Afghanistan in the years after 9/11. How will the Taliban cope with that shift? The BBC team in Helmand province were Auliya Atrafi, Ali Hussaini and Attahullah Safi.

Is refusing terrorists funerals a deterrent?,"Many Muslims have condemned the terrorist attacks in London and Manchester After the terrorist attacks in London, more than 200 British Muslim leaders said they would refuse to conduct an Islamic funeral for the perpetrators. It follows a similar approach by Manchester's mosques following the suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert. Could this stance actually discourage potential terrorists? The attackers who targeted people on London Bridge and Borough Market last weekend declared they were acting in the name of Islam. However, this claim has prompted outrage among many Muslims.In a strongly-worded statement issued on Monday,,externalreligious leaders described the terrorists' ""indefensible actions"" as ""completely at odds with the lofty teachings of Islam"". They added that carrying out such an attack, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, demonstrated ""how utterly misguided and distant the terrorists are from our faith and the contempt which they hold for its values"". As a further snub to the terrorists, the signatories said they would ""not perform the traditional Islamic funeral prayer for the perpetrators"" and urged others to follow their example. To understand why this is significant, it's vital to know the importance of funeral prayers - known asjanaza- to Muslims. Mosques in Manchester have said they would refuse to hold a funeral for terrorist Salman Abedi Their purpose is to ask for the forgiveness of the deceased person. Muslim funerals usually have an ""open house"" approach where anyone can join the service, even if they did not know the deceased and it is not uncommon to see large congregations. ""The more people there are, the more beneficial it is for the deceased person as there are more praying for their soul,"" says Dr Asim Yusuf, an Islamic scholar and psychiatrist who signed Monday's statement. ""By not doing it, you're effectively frowning on them. It's like saying I'm not going to pray for that person's forgiveness, which is a horrible thing to do. ""Although theologically it is not an excommunication, the idea that you won't have a janaza is effectively the community turning its back on you."" Dr Asim Yusuf is among Muslim leaders who said they would not bury the London attackers Ahmed Patel, a campaigner against extremism, chose not to attend the funeral of his brother-in-law Mohammed Sidique Khan, one of the four suicide bombers who carried out the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. ""I didn't go to his burial,"" he says. ""I don't even know where he was buried and I don't care."" He thinks denying terrorists funeral rites could be effective in persuading potential perpetrators not to carry out attacks. ""I think the fact that they are saying we will not bury you, we will not even do your janaza, is a lot more powerful than going out with placards or holding vigils. ""It's a very, very powerful message that no Muslim will bury him, no Muslim will wash his body, no Muslim will stand over him in prayer."" It is not the first time Muslim leaders have refused to bury a terrorist -some mosques in the US were reported,externalto have said they would not conduct the funeral of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the perpetrators of the Boston marathon attack in 2013. However, the remains of Shehzad Tanweer, one of the 7/7 bombers, were given an Islamic burialnear his ancestral town in Pakistan.,external Islamist terrorists often use a Quranic verse, known as the verse of the sword, as justification for their actions. It says ""kill the pagans wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them... But if they should repent [...] let them go on their way."" Dr Yusuf says it refers to an incident during the time of Prophet Muhammad where the Muslim army were ""given permission to attack pagan tribes that had broken a treaty, following a four-month respite to renegotiate"". He says the verse is often taken out of context, adding: ""The only thing that can be extrapolated from it is that if there is a group of people who have broken a pact with you, then you can go to war with them but that is something that is done at a state level... the Muslim state reserves the right to go to war but it's not an obligation. ""Even in war there are codes of conduct, the first of which is no killing of innocents. You can only go to war with people who are at war with you, not bystanders."" Jacqui Putnam,who survived the 7/7 attacks, welcomed Monday's response from Muslim leaders, saying: ""It's very encouraging to know that there is a strong element in the Muslim community that are against this, and are prepared to stand up and say we're not having this, this is not acceptable. ""These last couple of months have been very difficult for people who have been on the sharp end of terrorist activity and that's an understatement... anything that is going to discourage people from engaging in this kind of activity has got to be a good thing."" Dr Yusuf says there is a very ""strong precedent in Islamic law"" for refusing to conduct a janaza. ""But it's a decision that has very, very rarely been taken because of the gravity of the funeral prayer. ""Muslims do not have a unified priesthood so it's up to the individual to determine if they wish to perform a particular action or not. ""What this statement represents is a voluntary agreement that the signatories will not perform the prayer and they encourage others not to perform it either."" Islamic funeral prayers can sometimes draw large congregations He says the fact the London attackers claimed they were acting in the name of Islam ""was a crime against the religion itself and brings the religion into disrepute"". ""It is a major sin to kill one person, to say nothing of killing multiple people,"" he said. ""For those who are in a position of religious leadership, we need to make it clear that if anyone is under a misapprehension, especially misguided Muslims, that this is some religious duty they are performing, then it absolutely isn't.""

The 81-year-old woman inspiring a nation to recycle,"An 81-year-old who set up an all-woman rubbish collection team in her village in Lebanon now has a stream of visitors asking how she did it. For nine months in 2015 and 2016 rubbish piled up on the streets of the capital, Beirut, and even now a lack of landfill sites means some of the city's waste is being thrown in the sea.  Zeinab Mokalled has shown that when government fails, do-it-yourself local initiatives can work. ""There used to be dirt everywhere and the kids were filthy,"" Zeinab Mokalled tells me. She is remembering the 1980s and 90s, when Israel occupied part of the south of the country for 15 years, and waste collection came to a halt in her village, Arabsalim. As the years went by, it piled up, and Mokalled went to the regional governor to ask for help. ""Why do you care? We are not Paris,"" he told her. ""I knew that day that I had to take it upon myself,"" she says. Mokalled called on the women of the village to help, not the men - partly because she wanted to empower them, and partly because she thought they would do a better job. Khadija Farhat bought a lorry to collect recycling It would also have been up to the women to sort the recycling, and probably to put out the rubbish. So Zeinab needed volunteers to go door-to-door to get the message to the women in every house - and for this job, in a Lebanese Muslim community in the mid-1990s, men would have been inappropriate. They had no equipment, and no infrastructure. So how to begin? Mokalled's friend Khadija Farhat bought a lorry out of her own pocket. Mokalled herself turned her back garden into a storage area for recyclable waste. It didn't seem likely that the 10,000 villagers would pay to have their rubbish collected, so the volunteers paid for it themselves. Nineteen years later they still do, each of 46 members putting in about $40 each year. ""Household recycling was the best way forward,"" says Mokalled, who named the organisation Call of the Earth. Listen toRecycling Beirutfor Assignment on the BBC World Service.Click herefor transmission times, or to listen via the BBC iPlayer. To begin with they recycled glass, paper and plastic. Recently they started collecting electronic waste and have employed a researcher to find the best way of making compost in the hot and dry conditions of southern Lebanon. The only help the waste collectors received from the local authorities, after three years' work, was a gift of 300 plastic bins and a piece of land, which enabled Mokalled to get her garden back. At the same time they started renting a lorry to work alongside Farhat's, and hired a male driver - though they continued to accompany him to ensure he was not alone when approaching women. After 10 years they received a grant from the Italian embassy to build a warehouse, which is where Mokalled now receives visitors - schoolchildren, students and activists - who come to study how Call of the Earth works. And the numbers have increased since the closure of Beirut's main landfill site in 2015 led waste to pile up around the city, and the surrounding area of Mount Lebanon. A river of rubbish in Beirut before it was moved to a landfill site in March 2016 Attempts to find a new home for the city's waste quickly descended into farce. The Not-In-My-Backyard syndrome was amplified by the country's sectarian divisions - neither Christian, Sunni or Shia communities wanted to host the dump. Then the government said it would export the rubbish only to reverse the decision months later. The waste had to go somewhere, though, so it was dumped near the airport, but this attracted flocks of seagulls, which became a hazard for aircraft. Attempts to shoot the gulls brought howls of protest, so machines were brought in to play loud music that would frighten them away. A court has now ordered the closure of this site, though seagulls continue to circle. More worryingly, an old waste dump has been re-opened. As well as taking in new waste, lorries can be seen carrying old waste - much of it reportedly contaminated with chemicals - from the mountain and tipping it into the Mediterranean. Trucks have been observed taking rubbish and dumping it in the Mediterranean Sea In the long term, the government says it wants to burn the waste and generate electricity from it. But critics fear it won't be properly sorted, and that plastics and other materials capable of creating toxic fumes will be buried along with cleaner organic waste. So perhaps it's not surprising that Zeinab Mokalled's simple community recycling scheme is now attracting attention. The women of the nearby village of Kaffaremen have recently set up their own initiative, which is similar, except that it is funded by the villagers, rather than the volunteers. The nearby town of Jaarjoua has also decided to follow suit. ""When I look at them, it is like looking back at ourselves 20 years ago,"" says Mokalled. This video can not be played The volunteer bin-women of Lebanon When they were children, she used to teach some of the Kaffaremen volunteers Arabic literature, now she is their mentor on environmental issues. ""You will face many challenges. But it's all about patience and determination,"" she tells them. Wafaa, one of her former students, holds her hand very tightly and says: ""She is a role model for me. She never gave up."" As well as ensuring that Arabsalim is clean and tidy, Mokalled also found time to study for a PhD in Arabic studies, which was awarded at the age of 70. A temporary landfill site called Costa Brava, right by the sea by Beirut airport What is she most proud of? ""Planting the idea in people's minds that caring for the earth is our responsibility in this part of the world. Whether we do it or not, our politicians won't care. It's down to us. ""If everyone does what we did in Arabsalim, there'd be no rubbish problem anywhere in Lebanon.""

"Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big?","Are the tech giants getting too big to control? The US tech giants Apple, Google's parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook are the five biggest companies in the world by market capitalisation. Their increasing dominance is fuelling concerns about competition and data privacy. So are regulators about to get tough? Shares in Amazon and Alphabet raced past the $1,000-mark this month, the latest sign of the companies' growing might. Google is expected to attract more than 40% of digital advertising dollars this year; Amazon is on track to collect half of US online sales by 2021, according to at least one analyst. But as investors cheer their rise, it's also causing concern amongst the powers that be. US regulators have long lagged Europe when it comes to cracking down on anti-competitive behaviour but Jonathan Kanter, a Washington-based antitrust attorney at Paul Weiss, believes attitudes may be changing. Online retailer Amazon has now moved into bricks and mortar shops, too ""People are asking questions about whether the tools and principles that have been used previously are the right ones to continue using. ""There are certainly lots of people who think that there needs to be some change."" John Kwoka, a professor of economics at Northeastern University in Boston, believes that taking a tougher line on mergers and acquisitions won't necessarily be enough to combat the rising power of giants like Amazon. These firms also gain power as they amass user data and shape the flow of information, controlling consumer access to the firms using their platforms, he argues. Amazon: Monopoly or capitalist success story? Safe Harbour: Tech firms shudder as watchdogs meet How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think ""They steer choice and do so in ways that have ripple effects throughout a broader economy,"" Prof Kwoka says. Lina Khan, a fellow at the New America think tank, published a paper about Amazon earlier this year. She says there are examples of tech firms skirting the rules on competition, pointing to Amazon's battle with diapers.com, the baby products retailer. Amazon lowered prices, undercutting the firm, then eventually acquired it. Google is still being investigated by European regulators for alleged anti-competitive behaviour There are signs that the politicians and regulators are waking up. This spring, the US Congress moved to dismantle a set of Obama-era laws protecting the privacy of consumer data. Then shortly afterwards, a group of Republicans introduced abroader proposal,externalthat would require firms such as Google and Amazon - in addition to traditional internet providers - to get user permission before sharing their data. Could the US adopt the more muscular approach of European regulators? In 2013, the European Commissionfined Microsoftfor giving preferential treatment to its own browser, Internet Explorer. This year, itfined Facebookfor providing ""incorrect or misleading"" information during its acquisition of messaging service WhatsApp. Critics say the tech giants have a near-monopolistic power than needs to be curbed Last month, Amazonpromised,externalthe European Commission it would stop enforcing contracts deemed anti-competitive for other e-book publishers. And aninvestigation,externalinto Google's parent company, Alphabet, over how it allegedly gives preferential treatment to its own shopping services in search results, is still proceeding. The EU actions show that ""there are things that could be done,"" Prof Kwoka says. ""Whether they would be a big deal or a little deal, it's hard to know, but the EU has taken a crack at it and we've mostly taken a pass."" It's not clear how President Trump wants to steer policy. As a candidate he adopted populist rhetoric, describing Amazon as a monopoly and saying boss Jeff Bezos had a ""huge antitrust problem,external"". He chose Makan Delrahim, a traditional Republican, to lead the Department of Justice antitrust division. Say what? Amazon boss Jeff Bezos was unimpressed by President Trump's comments On the Federal Trade Commission, the other key regulatory body, several vacancies remain. But the agency said it would host a 2018 conference on privacy questions raised by emerging technologies, its third on the subject. Prof Kwoka and others say they don't expect to see major changes any time soon. And are these tech giants as anti-competitive as some think? Amazon may dominate digital sales, but bricks-and-mortar shopping still dwarfs the online market. Walmart alone reported sales worth more than three times Amazon's last year. Heavy hitters, including Microsoft and Google, are competing for customers in cloud services with the likes of IBM and Salesforce. In the tech sector, consumers are free to head to new players from emerging markets. Could Chinese online retail giant Alibaba take on Amazon? The Chinese tech giants - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - are resisting the US hegemony pretty well, non-interventionists argue. ""It's a competitive market just because of consumer choice,"" says Ronald Josey, an internet and digital media analyst at JMP Securities. ""That's a really important point to the whole story."" Even if US regulators do begin to flex their muscles, financial analysts say they aren't worried about a crackdown hurting companies, even in Europe. Their growth potential outweighs any regulatory risks, argues Paul Gallant, a technology policy analyst at investment firm Cowen & Co.. ""Investors are aware that companies with this kind of power and market share are inevitably on the minds of antitrust regulators. They're also aware that Trump has said some negative things,"" says Mr Gallant. How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think WannaCry: What can you do to protect your business? Click here for more Technology of Business features,external ""It's in the back of investors' minds, but it's not close to overcoming what investors love about these companies,"" he says. Google and Facebook have made efforts - effective or otherwise - to address issues such as fake news, in part to pre-empt regulator action. How did Google become the world's most valuable company? Why is the EU gunning for Google? But James McQuivey, an analyst at the research firm Forrester, says the recent dramatic increases in share prices could be a sign investors are underestimating the likelihood of regulator action. ""If you'd said to me a year ago, 'Is the risk factored in to the stock price?' I would have said yes. Where it is now, at least some of the more recent buyers may not be paying attention to those risks,"" he says. Amazon and Google declined to comment for this feature.

Enter a postcode or seat name  Election results live updates Full UK results breakdown,external Analysis for this page is carried out by professor of politics John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, and his team. The BBC/ITV/Sky exit poll is conducted by asking a random sample of voters at 144 polling locations scattered around the country to complete in private a mock ballot paper to indicate how they just voted. Nearly all the locations are ones in which the 2015 exit poll was also conducted. The share of the vote recorded for each party at each polling location this time around is compared with the share obtained in the 2015 exit poll in order to derive 144 estimates of change in support for each party. These estimated changes in vote share are then statistically modelled to (i) ascertain any systematic geographical variation in the estimated changes in vote shares, and (ii) derive estimated vote shares for every party in every constituency in Great Britain. From the latter, the probability as to which party will win each seat is derived. For each party the exit poll forecast of seats won is the sum of these probabilities of winning across all constituencies. Once declarations begin, forecasts are then based on a combination of exit poll and real results.

Turning the tables on online scammers,"Every year tens of thousands of people are conned by online scammers, but it is not only the authorities taking action: a network of tech-savvy volunteers is also working to expose them. ""We waste scammers' time, we waste their resources and we make them believe they are not as good as they think they are,"" Jill - not her real name - explains to theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. She is part of a global network of so-called scam baiters, who spend their evenings trying to unearth online con artists by pretending to fall for their tricks. The ruses can range from emails saying the recipients have won the lottery, to ""long-lost relatives"" who have left them an inheritance. ""Scammers are always going to be there but if we can take them down a peg and take a victim away from them any time we can, then we are doing something good,"" Jill adds. One of the main techniques, explains Wayne - a scam baiter who often works with Jill - is by leaking scammers' details and their conversation scripts online. The aim is for these to filter through to search-engine results, so potential victims will be alerted if they type in the scammer's name. Wayne says police and other authorities use the data, too. Wayne admits the scam baiters are not always the best people to help police the internet The scam baiters say they do not earn a penny from their work and that they have other reasons for taking on the con artists. One man from the US, who wished to remain anonymous, wanted to turn the tables after his mother was caught up in a ""grandparent scam"", and came close to losing $5,000 (Â£3,900). For Wayne, the motivation is simply the ""buzz"" he receives from knowing he can help someone. He says people have contacted him via his website on the verge of suicide. Questions remain, however, over whether scam baiters are sufficiently equipped - or best placed - to deal with scammers rather than the authorities. Official advice is to report any suspected offenders to Action Fraud - the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime centre, which focuses much of its resources on prevention and raising awareness. And Wayne says scam baiters do point people towards the official routes when they feel out of their depth. But Jill argues they still play an important role, as advances in technology and the fact many of the scammers are overseas mean it is difficult for authorities to catch such criminals. And they reject the label vigilante. ""Vigilantes work outside the law,"" says Wayne. Wayne's set-up is rudimentary. He works under various aliases, mostly named after characters from his favourite children's television shows of his youth. He often makes himself seem more vulnerable - and potentially gullible - by pretending to have recently broken up from a partner. ""To bait you do need to have something of a twisted sense of humour,"" he jokes. Both Wayne and Jill always wait to be approached by scammers, rather than seeking them out. But they don't have to wait long. Their names are on a so-called ""suckers list"" - effectively a database of people thought to be easy to con - which is passed around by scammers online. The latest to get in touch is a man who emails Jill to say she has won the lottery in Africa. Pretending to be husband and wife, Wayne and Jill make a joint call back, the aim being to waste the scammer's time by arguing about which one of them gets the money. They often have other scam baiters on stand-by who can be brought in to play other characters in their facade, to confuse the scammer - and waste their time - for as long as they wish. Surprisingly, Jill considers her biggest success to be the time she received a death threat from a scammer she had targeted. ""If you get a death threat you know you've really wound someone up. I had one scammer driving round Madrid for a day trying to find 'Lynn', who had gone to Madrid. ""Of course, I hadn't gone to Madrid, I was in my front room. He got so upset and said, 'I'm going to come and find you. I don't care what the penalty for murder is in the UK, I'm going to find you'."" Jill says scammers ""deserve to be treated as criminals"" Jill tells it as a funny anecdote, but it underlines the dangers involved. ""I take great care in protecting my online persona,"" she says. ""I bait with email addresses that aren't traceable. I don't use any of my real-life information. All of my characters are based somewhere 100 miles away from where I live."" Asked whether the death threat suggested scam baiters were taking their cause too far, she firmly disagrees. ""None of us are taking this far enough. These people are criminals. They don't deserve our sympathy. ""They rob our elderly relatives, so they deserve to be treated as criminals. If we could get them arrested, we would.""

"Rising Tory support, contrary to exit poll","David Mundell says Theresa May is still the best person to lead the country into Brexit negotiations.

She has achieved neither of those aims. The Tories have made 20 gains across the UK - with 12 of them in Scotland - thus emphasising how poor the result for the Conservatives is in England. They are now looking to a hung parliament - with the Tories presumably dependent on the DUP to secure votes in the Commons. This will mean that the issue of Ireland takes immediate centre stage in Brexit talks - at least for the UK government. Alex Salmond says the SNP have won the election in Scotland. Handling defeat with dignity and humour, he insisted the SNP would be in a position of influence in the Commons. He said they would build a progressive alliance, if possible. Alex Salmond defeated in Gordon. This will characterise the night for the SNP, despite them holding many key seats. Ruth Davidson very blunt on indyref2.  Says it is ""dead"". Theresa May's party are set to win the most seats. And she looks as if she has swallowed a wasp. Nicola Sturgeon's party are set to win the most seats in Scotland. And she sounds cautious and constrained. Isn't politics remarkable? It is, as ever, a question of momentum and relativity. If Nicola Sturgeon sounds faintly disappointed, Theresa May looked crushed. Her acceptance speech was downbeat. She urged unity - without suggesting she was able to offer it - then left the stage swiftly. Speculation will increase that she is not likely to be long in office. Nicola Sturgeon says it is the second best result in Westminster polling for the SNP. But also says she will need time to reflect upon the issue of a referendum. Intriguing stuff ahead? Alex Salmond is laying emphasis upon the prospect that the SNP will win the election in Scotland. Not upon the seats lost. He says Labour experienced a late surge on the basis of support for Jeremy Corbyn. He also says the SNP will be even more influential in what might be a hung parliament. Tories take Aberdeen South and Ayr. And so the record swing is overturned. Anne McLaughlin won Glasgow North East with a 39% swing last time. But Labour has now overturned that. Kezia Dugdale, asked whether Jeremy Corbyn had won the right to stay as Labour leader, replied:  ""Absolutely"". Huge cheers as David Linden holds Glasgow East for SNP. This was where Natalie McGarry was elected two years ago - but withdrew from the party whip. Jo Swinson took the East Dunbartonshire seat for the Liberal Democrats Very good victory for Jo Swinson for the Lib Dems in East Dunbartonshire. She says she is humbled - and suggests that the SNP might now show comparable humility by abandoning indyref2. Intriguing though that the Tory vote here is up by more than the LibDems. Still, to the victor the prize. For the SNP, it is a question of relativity. Relative to their historic performance in Westminster elections, tonight still looks good. Relative to the result in 2015, tonight looks notably poor. And so the Portillo moment occurs. Douglas Ross wins Moray. However the SNP perform, this will colour their night. They have lost their deputy leader and a strong Westminster performer, Angus Robertson. Same pattern in the Western Isles. The SNP returned with pro-Union parties all putting on votes. Again, in East Kilbride, pro-Union parties all put on votes. The SNP won, with a reduced share. Same pattern in Dunbartonshire West. Labour up. Tories up more. SNP hold. More re Paisley. Labour failed to emerge as sole challenger. Indeed, their vote went down when other pro-Union parties, Lib Dems and especially Tories, registered an increase. Could that division in the pro Union vote help the SNP to hold on in other seats, if replicated? The SNP's Mhairi Black retains her seat in Paisley and Renfrewshire South Mhairi Black is back in Paisley and Renfrewshire South. Especially good victory for her and the SNP, given expectations elsewhere. And further evidence that we have to await detailed outcomes from individual seats. The Scottish Secretary David Mundell is blunt. He says the SNP bubble has burst and the voters ""deeply dislike"" Nicola Sturgeon. Kevin Pringle, former SNP spin doctor and special adviser, says the 2015 result was ""unrepeatable"" for the SNP. A narrative which may well be pursued if the results continue to follow the exit poll pattern in Scotland, with SNP defeats. Labour candidate Gerard Killen takes the first seat from the SNP Winning MP in Rutherglen says result is rejection of austerity and of indyref2. First seat to change hands tonight. James Kelly, the Labour MSP, had tipped this from the outset. Labour up in Rutherglen. Tories up. SNP well down in voting share. Labour take Rutherglen - where Labour's Scottish campaign was lost. Huge cheers from Labour supporters at the count. Derek Mackay, who co-ordinated the SNP campaign, is saying that it was always going to be tough to replicate 2015. But he says that a victory is a victory. The expectation from the outset was that the SNP would win the election in Scotland, but lose ground. Question right now is: how much ground? More thoughts. In English seats, particularly in the North-east, the Tory vote is holding up better than the exit poll would suggest. But how will the UKIP slump play out in core seats in the English Midlands and North-west? In Scotland, talk is all of tight contests - including in the Western Isles, an SNP stronghold of late. Julie Elliott who won the Sunderland Central constituency - one of the first few results declared Three results in (none Scottish). Each Labour victories. But each with rising Conservative support, apparently contrary to the exit poll. Another point. UKIP vote sharply down, even in Leave-voting Sunderland. Are they being squeezed - or is the conclusion that it is job done on UKIP's principal objective? Quick reminder. Exit poll was by GFK /Ipsos Mori for three broadcasters: BBC, ITV, Sky. Sample was 30,450 voters leaving 144 polling stations. Ten sampling stations in Scotland. Could Nicola Sturgeon's popularity be on the decline? Murdo Fraser, from the Scottish Tories, says the exit poll, if proved correct, takes indyref2 off the table. IF - and remember it is if - the exit poll is correct, then to what might one attribute the decline in SNP strength? Douglas Alexander, who lost his seat two years ago, reckons one factor is growing discontent with Nicola Sturgeon. Jeane Freeman of the SNP says she finds it hard to see where the SNP's ""lost"" 22 seats - as identified in the exit poll - might come from. Might she well have a point?  We shall see. Another thought re the exit poll. It is, as I said on air, only a sample, albeit a pretty big one. Final campaign polls mostly suggested a big lead for Tories although one or two indicated much smaller. Exit poll suggests 314 for Tories, short of majority. If it is correct, then she has lost any pretension to a renewed mandate for negotiating Brexit - and would face big questions from within her party. In Scotland, poll suggests 34 for the SNP, down 22. Jeane Freeman for SNP places emphasis on poor result for Tories.

Pound slides after exit polls released,"The pound has fallen sharply as traders react to the results of the general election. The currency markets had been expecting a clear victory for Theresa May's Conservatives, but the party does not appear set to win a Commons majority. Sterling fell as lowas $1.27, down about two and a half cents from its level late on Thursday. It has since recovered to be down 1.5% at $1.2760, but the market is volatile and traders remain cautious. The BBC is projecting that the Conservatives will be the largest party with 318 seats - eight short of a majority. Given the surprise outcome of the poll so far, the pound could have been expected to fall even more sharply. However, the fact it has not slipped further may reflect the diminishing prospect of a ""hard"" Brexit. Although a hung parliament would mean uncertainty, Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said that a ""softer version of Brexit"" was now more likely. ""Mrs May's mandate to push through her clean, hard Brexit has evaporated. Voters didn't want to hand her the blank cheque for Brexit. It may leave negotiations in limbo but would also tend to suggest that the downside for sterling is limited,"" he said. When will we know who's won? Seat-by-seat result forecasts Election results live updates Election 2017: At a glance Former Business Secretary Sir Vince Cable said ""the whole Brexit approach will have to be rethought"". BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that suggested the UK's membership of both the single market and customs union would now be ""back on the table"". Sir Vince is returning to the Commons after regaining the seat of Twickenham in southwest London for the Liberal Democrats. Sterling fell after an exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky released as the polls closed at 22:00 cast doubt on an overall Conservative majority, raising concerns about increased uncertainty and a possible delay to Brexit negotiations.

Missing People Choir boy found,"A boy whose image was shown during the Missing People Choir's performance in the Britain's Got Talent final has been found. The 13-year-old, who has not been named, called his mother when he saw his photo. ""He is now home safe and well"", the charity said. The choir, which is made up of relatives and friends of missing people, share images and names of their loved ones while performing. After the shows, new information about Tom Moore was also reported to the Missing People Choir's helpline. He has been missing for 14 years. Meanwhile, West Midlands Police said earlier this month that another of those featured, Natalie Putt, who was 17 when she vanished, is believed to have been murdered. Missing teen's father 'wants closure' The force said they have been given permission to dig up graves in Ruiton Cemetery in the Upper Gornal area of the Black Country.

Exit poll predicts SNP to lose 22 seats,"Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader and Scottish first minister, was defeated in Gordon Alex Salmond and Angus Robertson were among the high-profile casualties as the SNP lost more than a third of its seats in the general election. The party won 35 of the 59 Scottish constituencies - a fall of 21 seats from the 56 they won in 2015. The Conservatives secured 13 seats in Scotland - the party's best performance in the country since 1983. Labour won seven seats and the Lib Dems four. The three pro-UK parties had won just one seat each in 2015. The Tories saw big increases in their vote across the country, with the SNP vote dropping sharply. Election 2017: Scottish results Election 2017: At-a-glance The election result in maps What does the result mean for Scotland? May under pressure after election losses Kuenssberg: Can Theresa May stay as PM? Deputy First Minister John Swinney admitted that the issue of a second referendum on Scottish independence had played a ""significant"" role in the result. The SNP MSP told the BBC: ""We will take time and care to reflect on the outcome of this result. ""But we have to acknowledge that the question of a second independence was a significant motivator of votes against the SNP in this election, and we have to be attentive to that point."" The SNP won 36.9% of the votes, a drop of 13.1 percentage points since 2015. The Scottish Tories doubled their share of the vote to 28.6%, with Labour up by 2.8 points at 27.1% and the Lib Dems down slightly to 6.8%. The SNP's former leader Alex Salmond saw his majority crumble in Gordon, where Tory Colin Clark took the seat with 21,861 votes. This video can not be played The winners and losers in Scotland Despite his defeat, Mr Salmond insisted that people have ""not seen the last of my bonnets and me"". He added: ""The SNP have lost many fine parliamentarians this evening and that's a grievous blow to the SNP. ""But overall the result in Scotland shows the SNP will have won a majority of the seats in this country and the majority of the vote, something which I suspect the prime minister would like to be able to claim in the early hours of this morning but is not able to do so."" Douglas Ross of the Tories overturned a majority of 9,065 to defeat the SNP's leader at Westminster Angus Robertson by 4,200 votes in Moray. This video can not be played Sturgeon: 'SNP have won the election in Scotland' The SNP's Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh also lost Ochil and South Perthshire to the Tories, who were a distant third in 2015. John Nicolson of the SNP lost Dunbartonshire East to Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, who also saw Alistair Carmichael hold his Orkney and Shetland seat. The final Scottish seat to declare was Fife North East, where there were three recounts before Stephen Gethins of the SNP was declared the winner after finishing justtwo votes ahead of the Lib Dem candidate. The results mean that the SNP has lost its Westminster leader, chief whip, foreign affairs spokesman and international trade spokeswoman. Mr Robertson (with yellow rosette) was defeated by Douglas Ross, who has been a Conservative MSP But the picture is less positive for the Conservatives across the UK, with the partylosing its majority at Westminsterand the prime minister facing calls for her resignation. Speaking as she arrived at the Glasgow count, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the SNP had won the election in Scotland, with the party achieving its second best performance ever in a Westminster election. Asked about the impact of the lost SNP seats on her desire to hold a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: ""Like most politicians I have not had any sleep and I am not going to take any rash decisions. ""Clearly I have to reflect on the result of the election and I will take time to do that. But it would be the wrong thing for me to do at this hour to take decisions before having had the opportunity to properly think about it. ""But properly think about it I will certainly do"". Ruth Davidson said the prospect of a second independence referendum was now ""dead"" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson hailed a ""historic"" night for her party, which she said was largely due to Ms Sturgeon's attempts to ""ram-raid through"" a second independence referendum. She added: ""I think we have seen the country's reaction in the number of SNP seat's falling. Indyref2 is dead."" ""Now it's time to get back to what matters to the people of Scotland - that's sorting out our schools, growing our economy and looking at our public services."" And Labour's Ian Murray, whoincreased his majority in Edinburgh to more than 15,000, said voters had ""hammered the final nail into the independence coffin"". Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale celebrated her party's improved performance with Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray The Tories have seen their vote surge across the country as they took several seats from the SNP There was better news for the SNP in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, where Mhairi Black kept her seat despite a big drop in her share of the vote. Ms Black, the youngest MP at Westminster in the last parliament, had her majority over Labour cut from about 6,000 to about 2,500. Elsewhere, Stewart Hosie held Dundee East - which had been the safest seat in Scotland - for the SNP, while Angus MacNeil held on in the Western Isles, despite his share of the vote falling by nearly 14%. Pete Wishart also held on for the SNP in Perth and Perthshire North after finishing just 21 votes ahead of the Tory candidate, while Tommy Sheppard held Edinburgh East. An exit poll had predicted that the SNP would lose 22 of the 56 seats it won in the last election in 2015. The poll, which was taken at polling stations across the UK, also suggested the Conservatives would fall short of an overall majority at Westminster. SNP politicians had cast doubt on the exit poll result when it was first published - with many insisting the party would not lose as many as 22 seats. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.

Video shows police shooting London attackers,"A video has emerged showing armed police shooting dead the three men who carried out the London terror attack. CCTV footage shows the three men attacking a pedestrian in Borough Market before charging at armed officers. The men are then shot dead. It comes after police investigating Saturday's attack - which left eight people dead - made three fresh arrests during raids in east London. In total, 17 people have been arrested and five remain in custody. Read more about the victims of the attack London attack: What we know so far Who were the attackers? How people fought back Italy's 'clear conscience' over attacker Full story: London Bridge attack Police have named Youssef Zaghba, a 22-year-old Moroccan-Italian man who lived in east London, Khuram Butt, 27, from Barking, and Rachid Redouane, 30, who also lived in Barking, as the men who carried out the attack. The three men drove into pedestrians on London Bridge before stabbing people in Borough Market. The video shows armed officers getting out of a police car They can then be seen pointing rifles at the three men Officers then surround the men having shot them The new footage - which first emerged on social media - shows police shooting dead the men within seconds of arriving in Borough Market. Police have been praised for ending the attack within eight minutes of the first 999 call. The video shows a person walking into shot, before being chased and apparently being stabbed by the three men. While the attack is ongoing, armed police arrive, prompting the three men to then charge at officers. However, the three men are shot dead within seconds. Armed officers can then be seen examining the bodies of the men, who were wearing fake suicide vests. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said 46 shots had been fired at the three attackers by eight police officers - five from the Met and three from the City of London force. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the London Bridge attackers The footage makes both compelling and harrowing viewing. The first grainy images show a man being set upon by the three attackers as he walks along one of the narrow roads around Borough Market. They repeatedly stab him, bundling him to the ground, before a police car arrives. Armed officers, guns raised, get out of the car.  Six seconds later the attackers are dead. The speed, professionalism, nerve and expertise shown by the firearms officers shines through in the video. Their actions undoubtedly saved many lives. Separately, CCTV footage of Butt, Redouane and Zaghba apparently meeting at about 00:10 BST on Monday 29 May - five days before the attack - has also beenpublished by the Times,external. The film shows the men meeting outside a gym in Barking, according to the newspaper. It shows Redouane throwing his mobile phone on the floor and walking off camera with the other two attackers, for about 10 minutes, before returning to collect his mobile. The footage has been passed to police, the Times added. Rachid Redouane, Khuram Butt, and Youssef Zaghba (from left) meeting last month On Wednesday night, two men were arrested on a street in Ilford, the Metropolitan Police said. A 27-year-old man was held on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts. A 33-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to supply controlled drugs, and was later further arrested over firearms allegations. A third man, aged 29, was arrested on suspicion of the preparation of terrorist acts at an address in Ilford. The other two men arrested were held under the Terrorism Act earlier on Wednesday - a 30-year-old detained in Ilford and a 27-year-old  in Barking. Twelve people arrested after the day after attack have been released without charge. This video can not be played ""I was shocked - he was quite a kind person, quite a jolly person"" says the receptionist at Khuram Butt's gym NHS England said 29 patients remained in London hospitals, with 10 in a critical condition. A British Transport Police officer who was seriously injured after confronting the three attackers armed only with a baton has said he did ""everything I could"" to fight them off. The officer, who has not been named, has been praised for his bravery, and added: ""I want to say sorry to the families that lost their loved ones. I'm so sorry I couldn't do more."" Clockwise from top left: Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard and James McMullan were all killed in the attack Read more about the victims of the attack The family of French national Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter at Boro Bistro, in Borough Market, said he was stabbed to death while working on the restaurant's terrace. ""Alexandre was a marvellous son, a perfect older brother and a radiant young man,"" they said in a statement. ""All his friends praised his kindness, his good humour and his generosity."" On Wednesday, police searching for French national Xavier Thomas, 45, said they had recovered a body from the Thames, bringing the death toll to eight. Mr Thomas's next of kin have been told, police said, but formal identification has not yet taken place. A ""peace wall"" of post-it notes has been growing at London Bridge Meanwhile, the prime minister of Spain said Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, who died defending a woman with his skateboard, should be given a posthumous award - the Silver Cross of the Order of Civil Merit.Mr EcheverrÃ­a was from Madridand was working for HSBC bank in London. The others killed in the attack have been named as Sebastien Belanger, 36, from France, Australians Sara Zelenak and Kirsty Boden, Canadian national Chrissy Archibald, and James McMullan, from Hackney, London. It earlier emerged that Khuram Butt was known to police and MI5 in 2015, but the Metropolitan Police said there had been no evidence of a plot. Butt had appeared in a Channel 4 documentary The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year. An Italian police source confirmed to the BBC that Youssef Zaghba had been placed on a watch list, which is shared with many countries, including the UK. In March 2016, Italian officers stopped him at Bologna airport and found IS-related materials on his mobile phone. He was then stopped from continuing his journey to Istanbul. But speaking at her house in Bologna,Zaghba's mother told the BBCshe believed her son was radicalised in the UK. Rachid Redouane claimed to be a Moroccan-Libyan. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. His ex-wifesaid she was ""deeply shocked, saddened and numbed""by his actions. Islamic scholar reported London attacker.

A beginner's guide to election night,"It's Westminster's X-Factor. For politicians election night is a never-ending thrill ride where the direction of a swingometer can leave a long-standing back bencher in tears and even the most experienced pollster in a state of shock. If you're planning on staying up this election night, here are nine things to watch out for. This video can not be played Timelapse video of the BBC election set being built Every iconic programme has its own recognisable theme - Match of the Day, EastEnders and Doctor Who to name a few - and the BBC's election night coverage is no different. The theme remained the same from 1979-2005, and it showed. The theme tune featured a rather garish synthesizer. But those days are long gone, and since 2010 the British public has been treated to an anthemic piece - the politico's call to armchairs - not dissimilar from the theme music to Black Beauty. Politics fans cannot help but stand to attention, invigorated and shaking with anticipation for the next 16 hours of rolling coverage. BBC Election 2017 studio One of the most recognisable faces in political broadcasting, David Dimbleby has hosted nine election nights and will complete his 10th and final overnight broadcast on 8 June. For nine hours Dimbleby steers the election night coverage through hundreds of declarations, hours of pollster speculation, and the odd technical fault. His diet for the nine-hour overnight stint is a well-guarded secret, but there is speculation that he quickly snaffles his packed lunch off-camera as Emily Maitlis breaks down the declared votes. Hopefully this year his snacking will remain clandestine, unlike in 1987 when he was caught on air with a mouth full of Mars bar. This video can not be played David Dimbleby gets caught eating on election night in 1987 Famous for his love of a bold tie, speculation is rife over which one Dimbleby will pick for the big night. BBC News has heard it might be a lavender and sunflower yellow polkadot, but we cannot be sure. This video can not be played General election 2017: History of the TV swingometer In 1959 the British people were introduced to the swingometer; the pendulum that can spell triumph or disaster for political parties. It was a rather crude piece of card attached to a board which showed how many percentage points the vote had changed by. But over the years it has become increasingly more elaborate and helps psephologists (otherwise known as election academics) predict an election outcome. Robert McKenzie helped refine the swingometer and was a recognisable face on election night night coverage in the 50s and 60s This video can not be played Behind the scenes in the BBC's election studio with Jeremy Vine King of swing Peter Snow, who famously presented the chart for more than two decades, brought it into the 21st Century in 2005 with the BBC's first virtual swingometer. But since the 2007 local elections Jeremy Vine has taken up the mantle, with increasingly whacky and outlandish graphics. This video can not be played Paddy Ashdown: ""It's the very last time I will question a BBC exit poll"" In the 2015 general election the BBC's exit poll predicted the Conservatives would remain the largest party. In denial over the prediction, former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown said that if the poll was right he would eat his hat. He attempted to row back from his initial statement, saying he would eat a hat if it was made of marzipan. The BBC's exit poll was right, and true to his word Baron Ashdown ate the edible piece of head gear on Question Time. After his fall from grace it is unlikely that any politician will make such idle threats again. The North East get pretty competitive over vote counts It's the Magpies v the Black Cats, it's the electoral grudge match of Tyne and Wear. Every general election Newcastle and Sunderland battle for supremacy to see who will be the first to declare their votes. But since 1992 Houghton and Sunderland South (known as Sunderland South until 2010) has been the first constituency to declare a result in the general election. Newcastle is hoping to triumph over their derby foes this year, but 25 years of winning form will be hard to beat. How to follow election results on the BBC Which constituency am I in, and who are the candidates?,external Emily Maitlis has become a staple of election night coverage since 2010, she does the unthinkable and predicts which political parties will win or lose marginal seats using the exit poll. She's also one of the few presenters capable of using a six-metre interactive touch screen. This video can not be played Emily Maitlis and election touch screen Like the Withnail and I version, anyone attempting to play an election night drinking game is in for a world of pain As the exit poll comes through and political commentators are wheeled into the studio, you can be sure that a few common phrases will crop up. ""I've never known an election like it,""is a firm favourite with ministers, former advisors and the odd BBC political editor. The irony being that every election is unique. ""The British people have spoken""is another stock phrase which is repeated far too often by former front benchers who lose their seats. ""The pollsters got it wrong""is a recent addition, but expect to be hearing a lot more of it this election night. And who could forget""The only poll that matters is the result"". Using these phrases as the basis of a drinking game is a futile endeavour, as they are repeated so frequently that you will be under the table before the first result is declared. Alan 'Howling Laud' Hope of the Monster Raving Loony Party congratulates David Cameron on his victory in Witney in 2015 Every general election cycle some protest candidates descend on the incumbent prime minister's constituency to offer some light-hearted relief on an evening of nail-biting tension.

Rail drama as actor mistaken for terrorist,"The actor had apparently chosen to rehearse in the toilet so as not to upset his fellow passengers When a train conductor heard the English words ""gun"" and ""weapon"" from a toilet on board a high-speed train travelling through southern France, he feared the worst. A day after an attacker was foiled outside Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, tension was high as police boarded the train at Valence station. But the suspect in the train's toilet was just an actor rehearsing a part. He was taken off the train for questioning and eventually released. The drama unfolded on Wednesday afternoon as the high-speed TGV buzzed through the French countryside  en route from Marseille to Paris,France Bleu website reports,external(in French). The suspicious speech emanating from the WC went on for some time. The man, an unnamed Parisian comic actor aged 35, could be heard speaking loudly in English and reportedly Dutch too. It is not known what play he was rehearsing for. The conductor decided to act, alerting his bosses who contacted local police. The TGV made an unscheduled stop at Valence and even the military were called in. This should come as no surprise, considering France is under a state of emergency and an express train in France was targeted in a terror attack less than two years ago. Paris Notre-Dame attacker identified Three French victims of London attack France 2015 Thalys train shooting: What we know ""Bearing in mind the current state of terrorism and the national alert level, the conductor wanted to avoid any risk or doubt and had the person questioned,"" a spokesman for French rail company SNCF told AFP news agency. The suspect was taken to a police station outside Valence for questioning but it soon became clear that he posed no danger. He said he had been preparing for an audition and had chosen to practise the part in the toilet so as not to annoy his fellow passengers in the first-class carriage. Although the unnamed actor missed his train, one French commentator suggested that at least he could say he had given a convincing performance.

Comey: Trump White House 'lied' about FBI,"This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments Ex-FBI chief James Comey told Congress that the Trump administration's comments about him and the FBI were ""lies plain and simple"". Mr Comey told a Senate committee they were wrong to denigrate the agency and its leadership. He was also ""confused"" by the ""shifting explanations"" for his sacking, which came as he led a probe into any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. President Donald Trump later said he never sought to impede the inquiry. Mr Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said in a statement Mr Comey's testimony ""finally confirmed publicly"" that the president was not under investigation as part of any probe in Russian political meddling. In the statement, Mr Trump also denied asking Mr Comey for his loyalty or to drop an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn during private meetings. In his testimony, Mr Comey said Mr Trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a ""great"" job. He also suggested he was fired to ""change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted"". The former FBI boss remained largely composed throughout almost three hours of testimony but became impassioned when delivering his opening remarks. He told the panel that the White House ""chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI"" by claiming the agency was ""poorly led"". ""Those were lies, plain and simple. And I'm so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them,"" he continued. How the drama unfolded Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? What questions remain? Trump v Comey: Who said what This video can not be played A blockbuster that lived up to the hype. Watch the explosive first 10 minutes ""The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is and always will be independent,"" he said in his opening remarks. Mr Comey was leading one of several Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as ""fake news"". His spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Thursday hit back at Mr Comey, saying: ""I can definitively say the president is not a liar."" For Donald Trump the good news from James Comey's testimony is that the former FBI director clearly said the president was not directly under FBI investigation at the time he was fired. The bad news was, well, everything else. On multiple occasions, Mr Comey said he was either concerned or knew that the president or his administration was lying ""plain and simple"" - about the circumstances of his dismissal and about the nature of his meetings with the president. It's clear the president woefully mishandled this, for which he has paid a high price ever since. By unceremoniously sacking him, and offering a muddle of explanations for it, he created an adversary with both the means and the motivation to respond in the most damaging way. Mr Comey had a friend leak disturbing information about the president's actions to the media. He was given the biggest spotlight in a generation to publicly air further details. He stood before a Senate committee not just to defend himself, but also the honour of the FBI. The White House may claim today's testimony is a technical exoneration. Politically, however, it's a staggering blow. And when it comes to the presidency, politics is everything. Five takeaways from Comey's testimony Man in the spotlight - Comey takes the oath During Thursday's testimony, Mr Comey emphasised that Russia's political meddling was ""not a close call"", adding: ""There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever."" When asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee whether the president tried to stop the Russia investigation, Mr Comey said: ""Not to my understanding, no."" He said he it was not for him to say whether Mr Trump's actions were an obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the committee's vice chairman, pressed Mr Comey on why he decided to keep a record of his conversations with Mr Trump. Comey 'confused' by Clinton probe order Key quotes in Comey prepared statement The Trump-Russia story - in 200 words ""I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting"" he said. This video can not be played Comey hearing 'is our Super Bowl' James Comey: From 'brave' to fired Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Mr Comey, who published his prepared remarks a day before the hearing, detailed one meeting with Mr Trump in which the president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House aide Jared Kushner to leave the Oval Office. ""I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to,"" he said. ""I remember thinking that that was a very disturbing development."" This video can not be played Comey on Flynn conversation: ""It's not for me to say if obstruction of justice"" During another meeting with Mr Trump, Mr Comey said the president appealed to him to ""let go"" an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to the Kremlin. After US media reported the conversation, the president warned Mr Comeyin a tweet, saying he ""better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"". Mr Comey told the committee he hoped there were tapes, calling on Mr Trump to release them. ""The president surely knows whether he taped me, and if he did my feelings aren't hurt. Release all the tapes, I'm good with it,"" he said. The White House has refused to say whether any such tapes exist. After Mr Trump's tweet about potential tapes, Mr Comey said he realised it was important to release his own account of the story. This video can not be played President Trump's statement: He was not under investigation and never said ""let Flynn go"" He revealed that he asked a ""good friend of mine"" who is a professor at Columbia Law School to share contents of the memo with a reporter, in order to build pressure for a special counsel. As a result of this episode, former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to lead an independent investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin. Mr Comey said he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was also looking at whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Trump attacked Mr Comey for leaking the documents, saying it showed that members of the US government are ""actively attempting to undermine this administration"". ""He's new in government, and so therefore I think he's learning as he goes,"" said Republican House SpeakerPaul Ryan. ""I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse. It's just my observation."" ""If you want to convict the president of being inappropriate, putting Comey in a bad spot, being rude, crude and a bull in a china shop, you would win,"" SenatorLindsey Grahamtold the BBC. ""The American people elected a bull in a china shop to help them with their lives, not this.""

Bigbang perform at the 2014 Asian Games in South Korea ""He was in a state of stupor and deep drowsiness and only responded to very strong stimulation,"" the newspaper said. ""He is still not breathing properly and is recovering. We are currently attempting to treat him but he's in an unresponsive state."" The newspaper said that another doctor believed the singer could recover in a week. T.O.P. had been embroiled in a controversy over marijuana use before his hospitalisation. It is alleged he smoked marijuana on multiple occasions, even though the drug is illegal in South Korea. As a result, he was transferred from his compulsory service posting at a police station in affluent Gangnam, where he had been serving for months, to another station.

Charlie Gard parents' appeal bid fails,"Charlie's rare disease has left him unable to cry and made him deaf The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by the parents of sick baby Charlie Gard, over plans to take him to the US for treatment. Chris Gard and Connie Yates want the 10-month old, who suffers from a rare genetic condition, to undergo a therapy trial. His mother broke down and screamed as the decision was announced. Charlie can stay on life support for 24 hours to give the European Court of Human Rights a chance to give a ruling. He has been in intensive care at Great Ormond Street Hospital since October last year. The hospital said therapy proposed by a doctor in America is experimental and that Charlie's life support treatment should stop. Charlie has mitochondrial depletion syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the genetic building blocks that give energy to cells. This video can not be played Family spokesperson: ""Chris and Connie are absolutely devastated, they are inconsolable"" The family division of the High Court agreed two months ago that the hospital could withdraw Charlie's life support. His parents have raised more than Â£1.3m through an internet appeal, in the hope they could take him to America for an experimental treatment. A spokesperson for Great Ormond Street Hospital said it was a ""very sad day"" for Charlie's parents and family. ""It is never easy when medical and judicial opinion goes against the wishes of the parents but our first responsibility at Great Ormond Street Hospital remains to put the interests of the child first and foremost. ""It is also hugely difficult for any clinically-trained professional to be asked to treat a child who has no chance of survival or even improvement in his quality of life"", the hospital added. ""For now, our priority is to ensure Charlie remains well cared for and to offer our support to Charlie's devoted parents at this distressing time."" Following the ruling Ms Yates screamed outside court: ""How can they do this to us?"" Friends of the family stood outside the court ahead of the hearing holding pictures of the 10-month-old and chanting 'Save Charlie Gard' and ""give him a chance"". Inside his parents waited for the decision. This is the final court in the UK able to hear their case. Justice Lady Hale began by praising their devotion, as parents we would all want to do the same she said. But as judges and not as parents they were concerned with the legal position and the proposed appeal she said was refused. Charlie's mother Connie left the court wailing and shouting ""they've put us through hell"". Chris, Charlie's father, held his head in hands and cried. This may though not be the end. They want to try and take their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Katie Gollop QC, leading Great Ormond Street's legal team, said the case was ""sad"" but not ""exceptional"". She said the couple seemed to be suggesting that ""parents always know best"". ""Fundamentally the parents don't accept the facts,"" she said.  ""They don't accept that nucleoside therapy will be futile."" The court had earlier heard how Charlie could not could see, hear, move, cry or swallow. Ms Gollop added: ""He is on a machine which causes his lungs to move up and down because his lungs cannot go up and down. ""Charlie's condition affords him no benefit."" Following the ruling Ms Yates screamed outside court: ""How can they do this to us?"" ""They are lying. Why don't they tell the truth?"", she said. Charlie's life support machine will continue until Friday at 17:00 BST to give judges in Strasbourg, France, time to look at the case, the court said.

General election voting into last hour,"A launderette in Oxford has been turned into a temporary polling station for the election Voting is coming to an end in the UK general election. Polls opened at 07:00 BST on Thursday at more than 40,000 polling stations across the country, with counting starting once voting ends at 22:00 BST. A total of 650 Westminster MPs will be elected, with about 46.9 million people registered to vote. That is up from the last general election, in 2015, when there were 46.4 million registered voters. The turnout in 2015 was 66.4%. Latest updates Guide: How to vote Find your constituency and candidates What CAN'T you do in a polling station? Manifesto guide on where the parties stand How to follow results night and what to watch for Some votes had already been cast, through postal voting, which accounted for 16.4% of the total electorate at the 2015 general election. People with an undelivered postal vote can still deliver it by hand to their local polling station. Overall turnout in 2015, when the Conservatives won 331 out of 650 seats, was 66.4%, up from 2010.

Nor has the president shared his thoughts on Twitter. Yet. It can't be long, though, can it? He is currently at an ""infrastructure week"" function in the State Dining Room of the White House.

Hairdryer gran is 'national hero',"This video can not be played Bikers get the hairdryer treatment A hairdryer-wielding grandmother who became an internet sensation says schoolchildren in her area now consider her a ""national hero"". Jean Brooks uses the hairdryer as a pretend speed gun outside her home in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire. A video of her has been viewed more than 33 million times on theBBC Radio Nottingham Facebook page,external. Since her new-found fame, she said she is asked for selfies and fans visit her home. This video can not be played A hitchhiker from Germany visited Jean Brooks after seeing the video ""People come up to me and hug me and say 'thank you for making the street safer',"" said the 63-year-old. ""As far as the local school kids are concerned, I'm a national hero. ""If the traffic slows down nobody's going to get hurt. I've already got a cat that's only got three legs because he didn't know his green cross code."" The video has since spawned memes quoting parts of the interview, in which Ms Brooks said: ""If we can't be safe in our own streets, how the hell are we going to be safe in the world?"" People have also quoted the ""neooooow, neooooow, neoooow"" noise she made when imitating the sound of vehicles speeding past her home. A hitchhiker from Germany turned up at her home with a gift on Wednesday after seeing the hairdryer video. ""I nearly burst into tears when I saw him,"" she said. ""I hugged him so hard I thought I was going to crack his ribs, bless him."" Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Bartek Zabel, from Hamburg, said: ""It's brilliant because you don't need expensive equipment to slow the drivers down."" He has sent the video to his friends and said they loved it too. ""I just had to visit her because she's like a local hero and like a celebrity,"" he added. ""I've already got a cat that's only got three legs because he didn't know his green cross code,"" said Jean A man who viewed the hairdryer video also delivered a van of nearly 200 toys to her home on Saturday night, which she gave to children on her estate.

Qatar 'won't surrender' in regional rift,"Saudi Arabia and several other Arab states have suspended flights to and from Qatar Qatar has vowed it will ""not surrender"" its foreign policy in a row with other Arab states over its alleged connections to extremism. Foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said he favoured diplomacy to resolve the escalating crisis and that there was no military solution, Reuters reported. Qatar rejects claims it is a leading supporter of Islamist extremism. Meanwhile, Qatar's Al Jazeera network said it was suffering a cyber-attack. ""Al Jazeera Media Network under cyber-attack on all systems, websites and social media platforms,""it tweeted,external. The network has been in the crosshairs in the current dispute, and other Gulf countries blocked it in late May. On its website, Al Jazeera said its services were all still working but the attacks ""are gaining intensity and taking various forms"". Meanwhile, Qatar's state-run TV station later said it was shutting down its website temporarily because of hacking attempts. In other developments: Egypt urged the UN Security Council to launch an investigation into claims that Qatarpaid a ransomof up to $1bn (Â£770m) to secure the release of royal family members kidnapped while hunting in southern Iraq Saudi Arabia's foreign minister flew to Oman for talks but officials did not elaborate. Oman has so far not been involved in the action against Qatar. Saudi Arabia and other states cut travel and diplomatic links on Monday. The emir of Kuwait is trying to mediate the row, carrying out shuttle diplomacy between Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Can Al Jazeera survive? Diplomatic tensions behind the row This is a region largely of absolute monarchs - kings or emirs - who have in common a very firm grip on politics at home to head off any dissent that could represent a threat to their individual regime survival. But the emir of Qatar pursues a series of policies that simply don't fit into the rigid orthodoxy expected by most of the others, notably Saudi Arabia, the superpower of Sunni Islam. His unconventional foreign policy is seen as a threat to Sunni solidarity, particularly because the emir and his ministers promote dialogue and a search for good relations with the rival regional superpower, Shia Muslim Iran. Saudi Arabia is deeply hostile to that approach, and now feels empowered to turn that hostility to action, in the certain knowledge that a new US president, Donald Trump, is at Saudi King Salman's side. Read more from James Addressing reporters in Doha on Thursday, Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar had been isolated ""because we are successful and progressive"". ""We are a platform for peace not terrorism. This dispute is threatening the stability of the entire region,"" he said, adding: ""We are not ready to surrender, and will never be ready to surrender, the independence of our foreign policy."" He said Iran had offered the use of three of its ports to ship food and water to Qatar as supplies ran low, but he said the offer had not yet been accepted. Food, flights and football at risk Five things you may not know about Qatar I'm flying through the Gulf: How will this affect me? Qatar is heavily dependent on food imports and the crisis has led to stockpiling and shortages. Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar had never before experienced such hostility. In another development, Russia said Sheikh Mohammed would fly to Moscow for talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, on Saturday. They will discuss ""urgent international"" issues, Tass news agency reported, but there were no further details. This video can not be played The economic disruption could have an impact on Qatar if the dispute drags on BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says Russia's intervention could complicate existing efforts to defuse the situation. Several countries including the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Egypt cut diplomatic and flight links with Qatar on Monday. Saudi Arabia also closed its land border, a vital lifeline for supplies. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir has said Qatar needs to cut ties with Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in the occupied territories, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, if it wanted to end its isolation. Meanwhile, Bahrain has joined the UAE in threatening jail terms for anyone voicing support for Qatar. ""Any expression of sympathy with the government of Qatar or opposition to the measures taken by the government of Bahrain, whether through social media, Twitter or any other form of communication, is a criminal offence punishable by up to five years in prison and a fine,"" a statement from the interior ministry said. Turkey, in an apparent act of support for Qatar, has approved a bill allowing more troops to be based there. The Turkish president has also offered to mediate. Qatar is also home to the biggest American air base in the region. US President Donald Trump urged Gulf unity in a call to Saudi Arabia's King Salman, US officials said on Wednesday. However, he hadearlier claimed creditfor the pressure placed on Qatar saying his recent visit to Saudi Arabia was ""already paying off"". Can Al Jazeera survive Qatar crisis?

Grim reviews unravel The Mummy,"Annabelle Wallis co-stars in The Mummy with Tom Cruise The reboot of The Mummy starring Tom Cruise has received some scathing reviews from critics. The film, which is released in the UK on 9 June, also stars Annabelle Wallis and Russell Crowe. Writing inThe Guardian,external, Peter Bradshaw said: ""This has some nice moments but is basically a mess. ""The plot sags like an aeon-old decaying limb: a jumble of ideas and scenes from what look like different screenplay drafts."" Empire,externalwas slightly more kind, with Dan Jolin awarding the film three stars. ""It's running and jumping grin-flashing business as usual for Cruise, once more on safe character territory as an Ethan Hunt-esque action protagonist who couples up with a much younger woman, while another woman chases after him,"" he wrote. ""And if the next instalment-teasing conclusion is anything to go by, Cruise seemed to have enough fun making this that he may just return for more."" Geoffrey Macnab gave the film two stars in his review forThe Independent,external. ""The stunts are by far the best element here,"" he said. Whether it's planes being torn apart, Cruise and Wallis driving through the woods with the Mummy in pursuit or the very spectacular finale, the visual effects are first rate. ""Whenever the action stops, though, the film becomes derivative and empty headed."" Writing inRolling Stone,external, Peter Travers described the film as a ""monster fail"". ""For all the huffing and puffing and digital desperation from overworked computers, this reboot lands onscreen with a resounding thud,"" he said. ""Tom Cruise should have played the Mummy - that way his face would be swathed in bandages and his fans wouldn't have to see him sweat so hard to get this lumbering loser off the ground."" Needless to say, he gave the film one star. Owen Gleiberman ofVariety,externalsaid the film was ""too busy to be much fun"". ""The problem at its heart is that the reality of what the movie is - a Tom Cruise vehicle - is at war with the material,"" he said. The Telegraph,external's Rebecca Hawkes gave the film three stars but criticised some aspects of the film, writing: ""Perhaps the real problem, ultimately, is the characters themselves."" She added: ""The reason the Marvel shared universe, which took years to build up, works, is because all of its superheroes feel engagingly human: Fully-formed characters we actually want to spend time with. Here, the writing is one-note, and the leads little more than placeholders. ""Universal's monster franchise has made it out of the tomb, just about  - but if this rebirth is going to sustain itself long term, it's going to need a little more meat under its bandages.""

Episcopal Church approves gay marriage,"The Scottish Episcopal Church has voted to allow gay couples to marry in church. It makes it the first major Christian church in the UK to allow same-sex marriages. The vote to amend canon law on marriage, removing the stipulation that it is between a man and a woman, was carried by the Synod in Edinburgh. It means that gay Christians from any Anglican Church can now ask to be married in a Scottish Episcopal Church. Clergy who wish to officiate at gay marriages will have to ""opt-in"". The church said this meant that those who disagreed with gay marriage would be protected and not have to act against their conscience. The Episcopal Church's Bishop of Edinburgh, The Right Reverend Dr John Armes, said: ""I am very pleased for the couples who can now have their relationships recognised by the church and blessed by God. ""I'm also pleased for what this means about our church and the way we have been able to do this. But obviously any change like this creates pain and hurt in some as well, so as a bishop of the church I feel for them."" This video can not be played Scottish Episcopal Church allows gay church marriage The vote to allow same-sex marriage - which required the backing of at least two thirds of each house of Bishops, Clergy and Laity - has left the church at odds with most of the rest of the worldwide Anglican Communion. A group of global Anglican traditionalists have now announced that they will appoint a missionary bishop ""to serve the needs of those who oppose gay marriage"". A senior figure in the group, Archbishop Foley Beach, said: ""Today's decision by the Scottish Episcopal Church to change the biblical and historic definition of marriage has highlighted the need to respond to the cries and pleas of those Scots who today have been marginalised by their leaders. ""The attempt to redefine marriage is not one that a faithful Christian can support."" At last year's Synod, members of the Churchagreed to send the issue for discussion to its seven dioceses. Six of them voted in favour of amending the law. Only Aberdeen and Orkney voted against the proposal. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is the Anglican Communion's spiritual head This vote to change canon law, opening marriage to same sex couples, isn't just the latest skirmish in the religious war between traditionalist Christians and those of a more liberal leaning. It will have profound consequences, because the issue of gay relationships has become a touchstone for those who believe that the Anglican Church has lost its way, and needs to be renewed. Many Christians who live in the global south, where the 80-plus million Anglican Communion is at its strongest, look with horror at what they see as moves to legitimise gay relationships and lifestyles. They not only disapprove of those lifestyles, but they see moves such as the ordination of gay clergy as evidence that the church is ignoring the will of God. The head of the Anglican Communion is the Archbishop of Canterbury and he's come under enormous pressure from bishops in Africa and Asia to stand firm on this issue. Those bishops are growing in influence and have formed an organisation - Gafcon - which is directly challenging the more liberal Christians of the global north. They will be emboldened by this vote, even if they disapprove of it - and it may hasten a split in the communion, with power moving south to the churches of Africa. Same sex marriage became legal in Scotland at the end of 2014 but the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church opposed the move. The issue has provoked passionate debate within the Anglican Communion. In January last year,the communion sanctioned the US Episcopal Churchwhen it decided to allow gay marriage in church. However, last month the Church of Scotland voted to approve a report which could allow ministers to conduct same-sex weddings in the future. And in February, a report opposing gay marriage was opposed by the Church of England's Synod. The Secretary General of the Anglican Communion described the Episcopal Church's decision as ""a departure from the faith and teaching upheld by the overwhelming majority of Anglican provinces on the doctrine of marriage"". Archbishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon said: ""The churches of the Anglican Communion are autonomous and free to make their own decisions on canon law. The Scottish Episcopal Church is one of 38, soon to be 39, provinces covering more than 165 countries around the world. ""As Secretary General, I want the churches within the Anglican Communion to remain committed to walking together in the love of Christ and to working out how we can maintain our unity and uphold the value of every individual in spite of deeply-held differences. It is important to stress the Communion's strong opposition to the criminalisation of LGBTIQ+ people. ""The primates of the Communion will be meeting in Canterbury in October. I am sure today's decision will be among the topics which will be prayerfully discussed. There will be no formal response to the SEC's vote until the primates have met."" The equality campaign group Stonewall Scotland said it was ""delighted"" with the outcome of the vote. The groups's director Colin Macfarlane said: ""This step allows couples to celebrate their love within their faith and sends a really positive message to other LGBT people, both here and around the world. ""It signals that members of the church welcome, recognise and respect LGBT people as part of the faith community."" The Student Christian Movement UK said: ""We hope this is a watershed for LGBT inclusion in UK churches. ""Our prayers go out to all LGBT Christians who have been hurt by the Episcopal Church, and we hope this may be a turning point for healing and reconciliation.""

Capsized yacht boss accused over deaths,"Yachting crew members James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin all died A company boss on trial over the deaths of four sailors when a yacht capsized had been cutting costs, a court heard. James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic. Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip. Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence. The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner. Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"". The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added. The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014. The overturned hull of the Cheeki Rafiki after it was discovered by a U.S. Navy warship east of Cape Cod The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened. Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel. Mr Lickley said it was a ""tragedy"" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht. He said: ""Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,"" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013. Douglas Innes denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada. The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board. Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a ""rapid capsize"" and the men on deck would have been ""jettisoned"" into the water while those inside would have been trapped. He added: ""What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too."" The US Coastguard was criticised for calling off its search after two days. However, following protests from family and friends, and intervention by the British government, it was restarted and the boat was discovered, the court heard. The trial continues.

IS kills 230 civilians fleeing Mosul - UN,"This video can not be played IS snipers targeting Mosul civilians The UN has received reports that 231 Iraqi civilians have been killed by so-called Islamic State while attempting to flee Mosul over the past two weeks. At least 204 are believed to have been shot dead by militants during clashes with Iraqi security forces in the Shifa district last Thursday and Saturday. The UN said it had noted a ""significant escalation"" in such killings. There are also reports of between 50 and 80 civilians being killed in an air strike on the Zanjili area on 31 May. Pro-government forces launched an offensive to retake Mosul in October with the support of a US-led multinational coalition. Western Mosul is the last major IS urban stronghold in Iraq They managed to take full control of the eastern half of Mosul in January and started an assault on the west the following month. Fewer than 1,000 militants are now besieged in IS-controlled parts of the Old City and several adjoining northern districts, along with some 100,000 civilians. The battle for Mosul: The story so far Why Mosulâs Great Mosque of al-Nuri matters Islamic State group: The full story The UN Human Rights officesaid,externalit had documented IS ""use of civilians as human shields and its slaughter of those attempting to flee"" since the start of the operation, but that recent reports indicated ""a significant escalation in such killings"". On 26 May, militants reportedly shot at civilians trying to flee Shifa, killing 27 people, including 14 women and five children. Another 163 civilians were allegedly shot dead next to a Pepsi factory in the same district last Thursday. Their bodies were reportedly left on the street for days. The UN said the intentional directing of an attack against civilians was a war crime And on Saturday, IS reportedly shot and killed at least 41 civilians as they attempted to flee Shifa towards Iraqi security forces locations. That day, Reuters news agency journalistssaw,externalthe bodies of dozens of civilians lying along a road leading out of Zanjili. ""Shooting children as they try to run to safety with their families - there are no words of condemnation strong enough for such despicable acts,"" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad al-Hussein said. ""I call on the Iraqi authorities to ensure that those who are responsible for these horrors are held accountable and brought to justice in line with international human rights laws and standards. The victims of such terrible crimes must not be forgotten."" Iraqi security forces are facing fierce resistance from the remaining militants holed up in Mosul Mr Zeid also called on the Iraqi security forces and their coalition partners to ensure that their operations fully complied with international humanitarian law and that all possible measures were taken to avoid the loss of civilian lives. In March, a coalition air strike on a building in western Mosul killed more than 100 Iraqi civilians by inadvertently setting off a large amount of explosives that IS militants had placed there, a US military investigation concluded last month. The UN says at least 2,174 civilians have been killed and 1,516 injured across Nineveh province since the start of the Mosul offensive almost eight months ago. More than 800,000 people - about a third of the pre-war population of Mosul - have been displaced over the same period, including 633,000 from the west of the city.

Knife attack 'a suspected hate crime',"The woman was attacked in Hermon Hill An attack on a nursery school worker who was kicked and suffered a cut to the hand with a knife is being treated as a hate crime, say police. The victim, who is in her 30s, was assaulted in Hermon Hill, Wanstead, by three female suspects at about 09:30 BST on Wednesday. She was taken to hospital for treatment and has since been discharged.

Counter-terrorism police were informed but police are not treating it as a terror-related incident. Nursery manager Karrien Stevenssaid the victim told her she was slashedby three Asian women dressed in black. Ms Stevens, who runs Little Diamonds nursery in Hermon Hill, said the woman told her that she was attacked while on her way to work from Wanstead High Street. The attackers slashed her arm from the wrist upwards before running off down the street, she said, and shouted out ""something to do with Allah and the Koran"".

Comey: Trump administration 'lied',"This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments Ex-FBI chief James Comey told Congress that the Trump administration's comments about him and the FBI were ""lies plain and simple"". Mr Comey told a Senate committee they were wrong to denigrate the agency and its leadership. He was also ""confused"" by the ""shifting explanations"" for his sacking, which came as he led a probe into any links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. President Donald Trump later said he never sought to impede the inquiry. Mr Trump's attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said in a statement Mr Comey's testimony ""finally confirmed publicly"" that the president was not under investigation as part of any probe in Russian political meddling. In the statement, Mr Trump also denied asking Mr Comey for his loyalty or to drop an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn during private meetings. In his testimony, Mr Comey said Mr Trump had repeatedly told him he was doing a ""great"" job. He also suggested he was fired to ""change the way the Russia investigation was being conducted"". The former FBI boss remained largely composed throughout almost three hours of testimony but became impassioned when delivering his opening remarks. He told the panel that the White House ""chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI"" by claiming the agency was ""poorly led"". ""Those were lies, plain and simple. And I'm so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them,"" he continued. How the drama unfolded Is Trump closer to obstruction of justice? What questions remain? Trump v Comey: Who said what This video can not be played A blockbuster that lived up to the hype. Watch the explosive first 10 minutes ""The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is and always will be independent,"" he said in his opening remarks. Mr Comey was leading one of several Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him. US intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as ""fake news"". His spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Thursday hit back at Mr Comey, saying: ""I can definitively say the president is not a liar."" For Donald Trump the good news from James Comey's testimony is that the former FBI director clearly said the president was not directly under FBI investigation at the time he was fired. The bad news was, well, everything else. On multiple occasions, Mr Comey said he was either concerned or knew that the president or his administration was lying ""plain and simple"" - about the circumstances of his dismissal and about the nature of his meetings with the president. It's clear the president woefully mishandled this, for which he has paid a high price ever since. By unceremoniously sacking him, and offering a muddle of explanations for it, he created an adversary with both the means and the motivation to respond in the most damaging way. Mr Comey had a friend leak disturbing information about the president's actions to the media. He was given the biggest spotlight in a generation to publicly air further details. He stood before a Senate committee not just to defend himself, but also the honour of the FBI. The White House may claim today's testimony is a technical exoneration. Politically, however, it's a staggering blow. And when it comes to the presidency, politics is everything. Five takeaways from Comey's testimony Man in the spotlight - Comey takes the oath During Thursday's testimony, Mr Comey emphasised that Russia's political meddling was ""not a close call"", adding: ""There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever."" When asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee whether the president tried to stop the Russia investigation, Mr Comey said: ""Not to my understanding, no."" He said he it was not for him to say whether Mr Trump's actions were an obstruction of justice. Democratic Senator Mark Warner, the committee's vice chairman, pressed Mr Comey on why he decided to keep a record of his conversations with Mr Trump. Comey 'confused' by Clinton probe order Key quotes in Comey prepared statement The Trump-Russia story - in 200 words ""I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting"" he said. This video can not be played Comey hearing 'is our Super Bowl' James Comey: From 'brave' to fired Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake How Trump's Russia trouble unfolded Mr Comey, who published his prepared remarks a day before the hearing, detailed one meeting with Mr Trump in which the president asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House aide Jared Kushner to leave the Oval Office. ""I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to,"" he said. ""I remember thinking that that was a very disturbing development."" This video can not be played Comey on Flynn conversation: ""It's not for me to say if obstruction of justice"" During another meeting with Mr Trump, Mr Comey said the president appealed to him to ""let go"" an investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn and his ties to the Kremlin. After US media reported the conversation, the president warned Mr Comeyin a tweet, saying he ""better hope there are no 'tapes' of our conversations"". Mr Comey told the committee he hoped there were tapes, calling on Mr Trump to release them. ""The president surely knows whether he taped me, and if he did my feelings aren't hurt. Release all the tapes, I'm good with it,"" he said. The White House has refused to say whether any such tapes exist. After Mr Trump's tweet about potential tapes, Mr Comey said he realised it was important to release his own account of the story. This video can not be played President Trump's statement: He was not under investigation and never said ""let Flynn go"" He revealed that he asked a ""good friend of mine"" who is a professor at Columbia Law School to share contents of the memo with a reporter, in order to build pressure for a special counsel. As a result of this episode, former FBI chief Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel to lead an independent investigation into the Trump campaign's potential ties to the Kremlin. Mr Comey said he was ""sure"" Mr Mueller was also looking at whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. Mr Trump attacked Mr Comey for leaking the documents, saying it showed that members of the US government are ""actively attempting to undermine this administration"". ""He's new in government, and so therefore I think he's learning as he goes,"" said Republican House SpeakerPaul Ryan. ""I'm not saying it's an acceptable excuse. It's just my observation."" ""If you want to convict the president of being inappropriate, putting Comey in a bad spot, being rude, crude and a bull in a china shop, you would win,"" SenatorLindsey Grahamtold the BBC. ""The American people elected a bull in a china shop to help them with their lives, not this.""

Renewables' electricity supply tops 50%,"Renewable sources of energy have generated more electricity than coal and gas in Great Britain for the first time. National Grid reported that, on Wednesday lunchtime, power from wind, solar, hydro and wood pellet burning supplied 50.7% of UK energy. Add in nuclear, and by 2pm low carbon sources were producing 72.1% of electricity in Great Britain. Wednesday lunchtime was perfect for renewables being both sunny and windy. Records for wind power are being set across Northern Europe. The National Grid, the body that owns and manages the power supply around the UK, said in a tweet: ""For the first time ever this lunchtime wind, nuclear and solar were all generating more than both gas and coal combined."" On Tuesday, a tenth of the UK's power was coming from offshore wind farms - a newcomer on the energy scene whose costs have plummeted far faster than expected. So much power was being generated by wind turbines, in fact, that prices fell to a tenth of their normal level. Environmentalists will salute this new record as a milestone towards the low carbon economy. Critics of renewable energy sources will point to the disruption renewables cause to the established energy system. At the time of Wednesday's record, 1% of demand was met by storage; this will have to increase hugely as Great Britain moves towards a low-carbon electricity system.

Thom Yorke recalls Glastonbury disaster,"The band played Glastonbury two weeks after releasing OK Computer Thom Yorke says he nearly walked off stage during Radiohead's headline performance at Glastonbury in 1997. The show, which took place just two weeks after the release of OK Computer, was beset by technical problems. During the encore, Yorke told the audience ""all the speakers have been blowing up and stuff"", before thanking them for their patience. Speaking to BBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt, he revealed he had been on the verge of abandoning the performance. ""At one point I just went over to Ed [O'Brien, guitarist]. I tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'I'm off mate, see you later,'"" he told Everitt. ""He turned around and went, 'If you do, you'll probably live the rest of your life regretting it.' ""I went, 'Good point.'"" This video can not be played Thom Yorke on Radiohead's 1997 Glastonbury performance Although the band were disappointed by the technical aspects of the show, fans and television viewers barely noticed. Q Magazine once named it the best gig of all time, while Glastonbury organiser Michael Eavis lists it among histop five sets from the festival,external, calling the band's performance ""very, very moving"". Speaking to 6 Music, Yorke admitted he had been against playing the show from the outset. ""I'd burnt myself out,"" he said. ""We had a meeting about what we were going to do for the shows and I was like, 'I can't do Glastonbury'. ""I just needed a break. And in fact I didn't get one for another year and a bit, by which point I was pretty much catatonic.""

The band recently announced a limited edition box set of the album, which will contain copies of Yorke's notebook from the era. The singer said he had thought they were lost until recently, when they turned up in a box in the band's office. It was ""fascinating"" going through the pages, he said, ""and making friends with whoever this nutter was"". ""Oh my God,"" he laughed, describing ""pages where [I thought], 'Seriously, mate, you need to take a break'"". Among the pages are ""30 or 40 different versions of Paranoid Android"", the album's ambitious, multi-faceted lead single. Yorke described how he spent days ""endlessly writing out and re-writing"" the lyrics. ""I'd only change like five words. It was like a meditation,"" he said. ""Underlying this, for me, was the sense that I didn't have a real job, but this was work and my notebooks at the time were my point of focus - pulling everything together, whether it was ideas about arrangements, or observations or random drawings. ""It was like, 'I have a job. This is my job'. Which is nuts, but that's how I dealt with the factâ¦ There was a bit of guilt involved.""

The rubbish-women of Lebanon,"An 81-year-old who set up an all-woman rubbish collection team in her village in Lebanon now has a stream of visitors asking how she did it. For nine months in 2015 and 2016 rubbish piled up on the streets of the capital, Beirut, and even now a lack of landfill sites means some of the city's waste is being thrown in the sea.  Zeinab Mokalled has shown that when government fails, do-it-yourself local initiatives can work. ""There used to be dirt everywhere and the kids were filthy,"" Zeinab Mokalled tells me. She is remembering the 1980s and 90s, when Israel occupied part of the south of the country for 15 years, and waste collection came to a halt in her village, Arabsalim. As the years went by, it piled up, and Mokalled went to the regional governor to ask for help. ""Why do you care? We are not Paris,"" he told her. ""I knew that day that I had to take it upon myself,"" she says. Mokalled called on the women of the village to help, not the men - partly because she wanted to empower them, and partly because she thought they would do a better job. Khadija Farhat bought a lorry to collect recycling It would also have been up to the women to sort the recycling, and probably to put out the rubbish. So Zeinab needed volunteers to go door-to-door to get the message to the women in every house - and for this job, in a Lebanese Muslim community in the mid-1990s, men would have been inappropriate. They had no equipment, and no infrastructure. So how to begin? Mokalled's friend Khadija Farhat bought a lorry out of her own pocket. Mokalled herself turned her back garden into a storage area for recyclable waste. It didn't seem likely that the 10,000 villagers would pay to have their rubbish collected, so the volunteers paid for it themselves. Nineteen years later they still do, each of 46 members putting in about $40 each year. ""Household recycling was the best way forward,"" says Mokalled, who named the organisation Call of the Earth. Listen toRecycling Beirutfor Assignment on the BBC World Service.Click herefor transmission times, or to listen via the BBC iPlayer. To begin with they recycled glass, paper and plastic. Recently they started collecting electronic waste and have employed a researcher to find the best way of making compost in the hot and dry conditions of southern Lebanon. The only help the waste collectors received from the local authorities, after three years' work, was a gift of 300 plastic bins and a piece of land, which enabled Mokalled to get her garden back. At the same time they started renting a lorry to work alongside Farhat's, and hired a male driver - though they continued to accompany him to ensure he was not alone when approaching women. After 10 years they received a grant from the Italian embassy to build a warehouse, which is where Mokalled now receives visitors - schoolchildren, students and activists - who come to study how Call of the Earth works. And the numbers have increased since the closure of Beirut's main landfill site in 2015 led waste to pile up around the city, and the surrounding area of Mount Lebanon. A river of rubbish in Beirut before it was moved to a landfill site in March 2016 Attempts to find a new home for the city's waste quickly descended into farce. The Not-In-My-Backyard syndrome was amplified by the country's sectarian divisions - neither Christian, Sunni or Shia communities wanted to host the dump. Then the government said it would export the rubbish only to reverse the decision months later. The waste had to go somewhere, though, so it was dumped near the airport, but this attracted flocks of seagulls, which became a hazard for aircraft. Attempts to shoot the gulls brought howls of protest, so machines were brought in to play loud music that would frighten them away. A court has now ordered the closure of this site, though seagulls continue to circle. More worryingly, an old waste dump has been re-opened. As well as taking in new waste, lorries can be seen carrying old waste - much of it reportedly contaminated with chemicals - from the mountain and tipping it into the Mediterranean. Trucks have been observed taking rubbish and dumping it in the Mediterranean Sea In the long term, the government says it wants to burn the waste and generate electricity from it. But critics fear it won't be properly sorted, and that plastics and other materials capable of creating toxic fumes will be buried along with cleaner organic waste. So perhaps it's not surprising that Zeinab Mokalled's simple community recycling scheme is now attracting attention. The women of the nearby village of Kaffaremen have recently set up their own initiative, which is similar, except that it is funded by the villagers, rather than the volunteers. The nearby town of Jaarjoua has also decided to follow suit. ""When I look at them, it is like looking back at ourselves 20 years ago,"" says Mokalled. This video can not be played The volunteer bin-women of Lebanon When they were children, she used to teach some of the Kaffaremen volunteers Arabic literature, now she is their mentor on environmental issues. ""You will face many challenges. But it's all about patience and determination,"" she tells them. Wafaa, one of her former students, holds her hand very tightly and says: ""She is a role model for me. She never gave up."" As well as ensuring that Arabsalim is clean and tidy, Mokalled also found time to study for a PhD in Arabic studies, which was awarded at the age of 70. A temporary landfill site called Costa Brava, right by the sea by Beirut airport What is she most proud of? ""Planting the idea in people's minds that caring for the earth is our responsibility in this part of the world. Whether we do it or not, our politicians won't care. It's down to us. ""If everyone does what we did in Arabsalim, there'd be no rubbish problem anywhere in Lebanon.""

Iran FM lashes out at 'repugnant' Trump,"This video can not be played CCTV footage shows the moment gunmen burst into Tehran's parliament building Iran's foreign minister has denounced as ""repugnant"" a White House statement on Wednesday's terror attack in Tehran that said Iran was a ""terror sponsor"". President Trump had said he was praying for the victims, but added that ""states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote"". But Javad Zarif said Iran ""rejected such claims of friendship"" and claimed the attackers from so-called Islamic State had been ""backed by US clients"". Thirteen people died in the attacks. Gunmen and suicide bombers targeted parliament and the mausoleum of Islamic Republic founder Ayatollah Khomeini, in an unprecedented twin assault that lasted several hours on Wednesday morning. Iran says the attackers, all of whom were killed, were Iranians who had joined IS. The militant group has threatened further assaults on Iranian Shia Muslims. In an earlier tweet, Mr Zarif appeared to blame its regional rivals for the attack, saying: ""Terror-sponsoring despots threaten to bring the fight to our homeland. Proxies attack what their masters despise most: the seat of democracy."" Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia - a key US ally - and Shia-majority Iran back opposing sides in conflicts across the region. The Saudi authorities have given money and weapons to hardline Islamist rebel factions seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad - Iran's staunch ally. Saudi-based charities and individuals have also been accused of financing Sunni extremist groups across the region over the past two decades. President Trump visited Saudi Arabia last month and made a speech blaming Iran for regional instability. Iran attacks will boost flagging IS morale #PrayforTehran: Solidarity after attacks Iran's powerful Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) have already accused Saudi Arabia and the US of being behind the attacks. Both countries have condemned the violence. However, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has downplayed the attack's significance, saying terrorists ""fumbling with firecrackers"" would not ""affect the will of our nation"". It comes amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia and other Arab statescutting ties with Qatarover alleged support for Islamist militants in the region and closer ties with Iran. Claiming the attack, IS posted a video which showed what it claimed was footage from inside the parliament building. A voice is heard saying, in Arabic: ""We're not going anywhere. We're staying forever."" This video can not be played People were evacuated from the parliament building BBC Persian's Jenny Norton says that despite Iran's active involvement in fighting IS in both Iraq and Syria, the Sunni group has not until now carried out any attacks inside Iran, and appears to have little support in this predominantly Shia country. However, our analyst says, in recent months the group has stepped up its Farsi-language propaganda efforts - targeting Iran's restive Sunni minority. Iranian intelligence agencies claim to have foiled a number of IS-inspired plots. But by mounting a successful attack, IS could claim a major coup against a traditional foe that other Sunni jihadist groups, including its rival al-Qaeda, have failed to target in the past. Middle East analyst Dina Esfandiary says one possible consequence will be increased calls by hardliners for tougher action against IS in Iraq and Syria. Public support for action in Iraq is likely to grow, as it did when IS took swathes of territory in the country in 2014. But Iran's involvement in Syria is not popular, our analyst says - it is seen as having few benefits and costing too many Iranian lives. The attacks will also boost the popularity of the Revolutionary Guards, seen as protectors of the nation.

The women tackling a river of rubbish,"An 81-year-old who set up an all-woman rubbish collection team in her village in Lebanon now has a stream of visitors asking how she did it. For nine months in 2015 and 2016 rubbish piled up on the streets of the capital, Beirut, and even now a lack of landfill sites means some of the city's waste is being thrown in the sea.  Zeinab Mokalled has shown that when government fails, do-it-yourself local initiatives can work. ""There used to be dirt everywhere and the kids were filthy,"" Zeinab Mokalled tells me. She is remembering the 1980s and 90s, when Israel occupied part of the south of the country for 15 years, and waste collection came to a halt in her village, Arabsalim. As the years went by, it piled up, and Mokalled went to the regional governor to ask for help. ""Why do you care? We are not Paris,"" he told her. ""I knew that day that I had to take it upon myself,"" she says. Mokalled called on the women of the village to help, not the men - partly because she wanted to empower them, and partly because she thought they would do a better job. Khadija Farhat bought a lorry to collect recycling It would also have been up to the women to sort the recycling, and probably to put out the rubbish. So Zeinab needed volunteers to go door-to-door to get the message to the women in every house - and for this job, in a Lebanese Muslim community in the mid-1990s, men would have been inappropriate. They had no equipment, and no infrastructure. So how to begin? Mokalled's friend Khadija Farhat bought a lorry out of her own pocket. Mokalled herself turned her back garden into a storage area for recyclable waste. It didn't seem likely that the 10,000 villagers would pay to have their rubbish collected, so the volunteers paid for it themselves. Nineteen years later they still do, each of 46 members putting in about $40 each year. ""Household recycling was the best way forward,"" says Mokalled, who named the organisation Call of the Earth.

Recently they started collecting electronic waste and have employed a researcher to find the best way of making compost in the hot and dry conditions of southern Lebanon. The only help the waste collectors received from the local authorities, after three years' work, was a gift of 300 plastic bins and a piece of land, which enabled Mokalled to get her garden back. At the same time they started renting a lorry to work alongside Farhat's, and hired a male driver - though they continued to accompany him to ensure he was not alone when approaching women. After 10 years they received a grant from the Italian embassy to build a warehouse, which is where Mokalled now receives visitors - schoolchildren, students and activists - who come to study how Call of the Earth works. And the numbers have increased since the closure of Beirut's main landfill site in 2015 led waste to pile up around the city, and the surrounding area of Mount Lebanon. A river of rubbish in Beirut before it was moved to a landfill site in March 2016 Attempts to find a new home for the city's waste quickly descended into farce. The Not-In-My-Backyard syndrome was amplified by the country's sectarian divisions - neither Christian, Sunni or Shia communities wanted to host the dump. Then the government said it would export the rubbish only to reverse the decision months later. The waste had to go somewhere, though, so it was dumped near the airport, but this attracted flocks of seagulls, which became a hazard for aircraft. Attempts to shoot the gulls brought howls of protest, so machines were brought in to play loud music that would frighten them away. A court has now ordered the closure of this site, though seagulls continue to circle. More worryingly, an old waste dump has been re-opened. As well as taking in new waste, lorries can be seen carrying old waste - much of it reportedly contaminated with chemicals - from the mountain and tipping it into the Mediterranean. Trucks have been observed taking rubbish and dumping it in the Mediterranean Sea In the long term, the government says it wants to burn the waste and generate electricity from it. But critics fear it won't be properly sorted, and that plastics and other materials capable of creating toxic fumes will be buried along with cleaner organic waste. So perhaps it's not surprising that Zeinab Mokalled's simple community recycling scheme is now attracting attention. The women of the nearby village of Kaffaremen have recently set up their own initiative, which is similar, except that it is funded by the villagers, rather than the volunteers.

The 81-year-old bin-woman with a PhD,"An 81-year-old who set up an all-woman rubbish collection team in her village in Lebanon now has a stream of visitors asking how she did it. For nine months in 2015 and 2016 rubbish piled up on the streets of the capital, Beirut, and even now a lack of landfill sites means some of the city's waste is being thrown in the sea.  Zeinab Mokalled has shown that when government fails, do-it-yourself local initiatives can work. ""There used to be dirt everywhere and the kids were filthy,"" Zeinab Mokalled tells me. She is remembering the 1980s and 90s, when Israel occupied part of the south of the country for 15 years, and waste collection came to a halt in her village, Arabsalim. As the years went by, it piled up, and Mokalled went to the regional governor to ask for help. ""Why do you care? We are not Paris,"" he told her. ""I knew that day that I had to take it upon myself,"" she says. Mokalled called on the women of the village to help, not the men - partly because she wanted to empower them, and partly because she thought they would do a better job. Khadija Farhat bought a lorry to collect recycling It would also have been up to the women to sort the recycling, and probably to put out the rubbish. So Zeinab needed volunteers to go door-to-door to get the message to the women in every house - and for this job, in a Lebanese Muslim community in the mid-1990s, men would have been inappropriate. They had no equipment, and no infrastructure. So how to begin? Mokalled's friend Khadija Farhat bought a lorry out of her own pocket. Mokalled herself turned her back garden into a storage area for recyclable waste. It didn't seem likely that the 10,000 villagers would pay to have their rubbish collected, so the volunteers paid for it themselves.

Fugitive on the run for 45 years is caught,"Police say they have confirmed the identity of Mr Osaka through DNA tests For one suspected murderer in Japan, it has been a case of being able to run but not being able to hide. Left-wing revolutionary Masaaki Osaka has been arrested and charged for murdering a police officer during Tokyo street protests more than 45 years ago. He allegedly set the officer on fire using a Molotov Cocktail petrol bomb. No other suspected criminal has spent longer evading arrest, Japanese media report. The country has no statute of limitations for murder. The 15-year time limit was abolished in 2010. Where do prison escapees and absconders actually go? Mr Osaka was arrested last month in a Hiroshima apartment belonging to the Chukaku-ha, or the Japan Revolutionary Communist League (JRCL). He is reported by police to have remained silent since being caught. Masaaki Osaka has been wanted by police since the early 1970s The fugitive was initially accused of a separate offence - obstructing the police - before officers claim to have realised who he was. On Wednesday, he was transported from Hiroshima to Tokyo for further questioning, local media reported. Police say they have confirmed his identity through DNA tests because fingerprints were unavailable at the time of the crime. They say Mr Osaka was able to remain on the run for so long because he is a former high-ranking member of the radical left-wing JRCL and was assisted by sympathetic party associates. The fugitive has appeared on wanted posters throughout the last four decades The JRCL was established in the late 1950s and during the 1960s and 1970s earned a reputation for staging violent street protests. Mr Osaka is accused of killing the 21-year-old police officer during a left wing riot in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward in 1971. He is alleged to have assaulted him with a steel pipe before setting him alight. The JRCL was protesting - among other things - against the recognition by Japan of the US military presence in the country. The man alleged to be Mr Osaka's accomplice in the 1971 attack was charged in 1972, but his case was suspended because of mental illness. 1972- Japanese prime minister visits China and normal diplomatic relations are resumed 1993- Government issues historic ""Kono statement"" apologising for Japanese military's war-time use of sex slaves 1995- An earthquake hits central Japan, killing thousands 2011 February- Japan is overtaken by China as world's second-largest economy 2011 March- Huge offshore earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastate miles of shoreline - damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant causes a radiation leak 2014- Japan's government approves a landmark change in security policy, paving the way for its military to fight overseas Where do prisoners 'on the run' go?

Bodies found in Myanmar plane search,"So far, the bodies of mainly women and children have been found The Burmese army says debris and bodies have been found after a military plane went missing with 122 people on board. Dispersed wreckage was found in the Andaman Sea, the military said in a statement on its Facebook page. The aircraft, a Y-8 transporter made in China, was carrying 14 crew. Most of the passengers were military personnel and family members, including children. The plane was flying from Myeik to Yangon and the debris was found in the sea off the coastal town of Dawei. Communication with the flight was lost on Wednesday half an hour into the short routine trip. According to the military, by mid-afternoon on Thursday search teams had recovered 29 bodies - 20 women, eight children and one man. A wheel, several life jackets and some luggage were found earlier. Should everyone on board have died in the crash, the death toll would make it among the country's worst aviation disasters, says the BBC's Myanmar correspondent Jonah Fisher. The reason for the crash remains unclear. There has so far been no report of a mayday call and the dispersed nature of the wreckage suggests it could have broken up in mid air. Although it is monsoon season in Myanmar, there were no reports of bad weather at that time. The plane was purchased from China in March last year and had logged 809 flying hours, according to the military. Myanmar has seen a number of aircraft incidents in recent years. In February 2016, the five-member crew of an air force plane died when the aircraft crashed in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw. A few months later, three officers were killed when a military helicopter crashed in central Myanmar. An Air Bagan commercial aircraftmade an emergency landingin 2012 and burst into flames, killing two people.

'Plot' in KFC and British shark attack,"Political coverage and commentary takes up most of the front pages. The BBC, along with other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning while the polls are open. Away from the election, many of the papers continue to feature reports on the London Bridge attacks. The Daily Telegraphfocuses on a KFC restaurant in Barking,externalwhere one of the attackers - Khuram Butt - worked as an office manager. The paper says another - Youseff Zagbha - is believed to have been employed there at the same time - while the third - Rachid Redouane - was a regular customer. The Telegraph speculates that the attack may have been plotted there, and predicts the restaurant will now become a key feature of the police investigation. The Mirror carries an apology from Transport for London (TfL), afterparking wardens slapped tickets on cars at Borough Market,externalas soon as the police cordon was lifted. The owners of at least six cars were issued with fines of Â£130, according to the paper. A TfL spokesman acknowledged the tickets were ""an insensitive mistake"" and pledged to cancel the penalties. Awarm reunion,externalbetween Prince Harry and the 97-year-old widow of a Victoria Cross recipient is shown in the Daily Express. Daphne Dunne planted a kiss on the Prince's cheek when he visited Sydney in 2015, when he approached her after spotting her wearing the medal. The Express says she waited in torrential rain to see him again, with a kiss on her other cheek as a reward. The Times saysreports of King Edward II's grisly and excruciating death,externalmay have been greatly exaggerated. The 14th-century monarch is commonly held to have murdered with a red-hot poker after being deposed, following defeat at the Battle of Bannockburn. But documents have been produced suggesting he may have escaped to Italy. The Daily Mail tells the story of what it calls a""very British shark attack"",external. Rich Thomson was surfing off the Devon coast when what was thought to have been a smooth hound shark - three feet long - bit his thigh. He bashed it on the head and it swam off, leaving him with a badly cut hand and a bruised leg. Experts tell the Mail that it is the first time a surfer has ever been attacked by a shark in British waters - a fact that did not impress Mr Thomson's wife. On returning home late, Mr Thomson explained he had been bitten by a shark. ""I've heard that one before"", she replied.

Universities challenged on top 1% advert,"Are universities selectively choosing from ranking results? Universities in the UK are being challenged over marketing claims to students that they are in the ""top 1%"" of the world's universities. The University of Reading is going to have to take down such a claim after a complaint to the advertising watchdog. University rankings are increasingly influential for recruitment, particularly for overseas students. In the newWorld University Rankings, the top three are US universities - MIT, Stanford and Harvard,external. Cambridge is the highest ranked UK university, with three other UK universities in the top 10 of this global league table. But the Advertising Standards Authority has been examining a complaint about how university rankings are used in marketing. A description of the University of Reading as being in the top 1% worldwide had been challenged by a complainant, who said such a figure could not be substantiated and could be misleading. The advertising watchdog says that this has been ""informally resolved"", with the university agreeing that it will remove the claim, without going ahead with a formal investigation or ruling. Top 10 QS World University Rankings Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Stanford Harvard California Institute of Technology (Caltech) Cambridge Oxford University College London Imperial College London Chicago ETH Zurich There are many different university rankings, including for individual subjects as well as for institutions, and the results are often used as evidence of international status. And the challenge over how such rankings are used in marketing will have implications for many other universities. Southampton uses the claim ""In the top 1% of universities worldwide,external"" on its website, Liverpool says it is in the""top 1%"",externaland Queen's University Belfast describes itself as ""In the top one per cent of world universities,external."" Charles Heymann, the University of Reading's head of corporate communications, welcomed the clarification over how universities can present global rankings. The University of Reading appears in the top 200 of global rankings ""It now needs to investigate every single other UK university which claims it is in the top 1% in the world, rather than waiting for individual complaints to be made,"" he said of the ASA. Mr Heymann said that Reading was in the top 200 of the Times Higher Education and QS rankings. ""Like dozens of other UK universities in recent years, we judged this put us in the top 1% out of an estimated 20,000 institutions internationally,"" he said. ""We accept, though, the ASA's view that this could not be proved given no league table assesses every single university worldwide."" The latest annual findings of one of the most high profile rankings have been published, listing almost 1,000 universities. The QS World University Rankings shows the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) once again rated as the world's best, with the top three unchanged from last year. The University of Southampton also uses the top 1% claim The rankings take into account factors such as research publications and citation, the views of academics and employers and levels of international engagement. Cambridge, Oxford, UCL and Imperial are all in the top 10, but there has been an overall downward trend for UK universities. There are 76 UK universities in the international rankings, but the compilers say 51 of them are in a lower place than last year. But London has among the highest concentrations of top universities, with four universities in the top 50 and 17 in the overall rankings. QS World University Rankings: UK universities in the top 200 5. Cambridge 6. Oxford 7. University College London 8. Imperial College London 23. King's College London 23. Edinburgh 34. Manchester 35. London School of Economics and Political Science 44. Bristol 57. Warwick 65. Glasgow 78. Durham 82. Sheffield 84. Nottingham 84. Birmingham 92.  St Andrews 101. Leeds 102. Southampton 127.

Reading Ben Sowter, head of research for the QS rankings, says that he is confident that the University of Reading could be described as being ""amongst the top 1% in the world"". He says that there are estimates of 20,000 and 26,000 for the number of universities in the world. But he says that any institutions rated in the top 200 of the World University Rankings would be in this top 1% worldwide. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, blamed a lack of funding for the overall slip in rankings for UK universities. ""The competitiveness of UK universities has been affected by austerity. In particular, tuition fees have been frozen for five years and research funding has not grown as fast as in some other countries,"" said Mr Hillman.

North Korea fires 'anti-ship' missiles,"North Korea displayed anti-ship Styx cruise missiles in a 2012 military parade North Korea has fired several anti-ship cruise missiles off its east coast, South Korea's military says. Authorities said the weapons, launched on Thursday morning near the city of Wonsan, appeared to be short-range ""surface-to-ship"" missiles. They flew about 200km (125 miles) before landing in the water. Repeated ballistic missile tests by the North this year - not all successful but all a breach of UN sanctions - have sparked international alarm. Experts fear the tests indicate progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile. It is unclear whether the latest firing violates the UN Security Council's resolutions against North Korea. The resolution,externalissued on 2 June specifically bans Pyongyang from nuclear activity and ballistic missiles, but also bans launches of ""any other provocation"" and ""any other existing weapons of mass destruction"". South Korean military spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said the latest launch showed the North ""likely wanted to show off its ability to precisely target a large warship"" after recent military drills involving US aircraft carriers and South Korean troops. ""By testing different types of missiles, North Korea also appears to be aiming to secure the upper hand in relations with South Korea and the United States,"" he told reporters. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? Trump fears 'major major' conflict with North Korea North Korea's missile programme Anti-ship cruise missiles are guided missiles which generally skim the water. In 2012, North Korea displayed several such weapons known as Styx. But North Korea has also previously unsuccessfully tested anti-ship ballistic missiles, experts believe. On 29 May, it fired aScud-type ballistic missilefrom the same location, which flew about 450km. The US has been installing a missile defence system on a golf course in Seongju, South Korea Last Friday the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a new resolution to impose targeted sanctions on certain North Korean officials and state entities. The US has also ramped up its military presence in the region, conducting drills with Japan as well as South Korea, and is installing a controversial missile defence system in South Korea, known as Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad). But South Korea said on Wednesday it wassuspending the further deploymentof the system until an environmental assessment is completed. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?

Is Kenya's new railway good value for money?,"The first major new railway line in Kenya for more than a century, running between the capital Nairobi and the coastal city of Mombasa, faces an immediate challenge of justifying its relatively high cost. At $5.6m per kilometre for the track alone, Kenya's line cost close to three times the international standard and four times the original estimate. So it is perhaps not surprising that Kenyans have been asking why they seem to have paid so much. Kenya's new 472km (293 mile) railway is the country's biggest infrastructure investment since its independence in 1963. Built to a modern ""standard gauge"", it runs parallel to the now-dilapidated metre gauge railway line from the colonial era. While everyone agrees that Kenya desperately needs more infrastructure, not everyone agrees that this was the most economically sensible solution. Cost comparisons have been made between this line and Ethiopia's 756km Addis Ababa-Djibouti line launched last year. Both are Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) projects financed by Chinese loans, costing $3.4bn (Â£2.6bn) for Ethiopia and $3.2bn for Kenya. Ethiopia's line is more than 250km longer and is electrified, which is typically more expensive; trains running on Kenya's line will be diesel-powered. In pictures: Kenya's new railway The Kenyan government has said the reasons for this high cost include the terrain that required many bridges and tunnels, land compensation and a need for specifications that would handle greater cargo volumes than Ethiopia's line. Therefore, it says, the two projects are not directly comparable. About 80% of the money for the new railway came through loans from China. The loans are the country's biggest yet - amounting to roughly 6% of Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), which is a measure of a country's economic activity, including all the services and goods produced in a year. Before Kenya started building the railway, government advisers Canadian Pacific Consulting Services (CPSC) challenged its economic viability in a 2009 study. It concluded that the benefit of building a new standard gauge railway would be marginal. It was considered ""cost prohibitive"" using ""even the most optimistic"" traffic and income projections, it said. But Transport Minister James Macharia has said the Kenyan government expects the new line to boost GDP by 1.5%, allowing the Chinese loans to be paid back ""in about four years"". That projection runs counter to recent fears that Kenya may soon become unable to pay the large amounts owing on existing loans. Heavy borrowing has seen public debt rise to more than half of GDP in the last four years, yet there has been no corresponding growth in revenue. Most of the railway's revenue is expected to come from transporting cargo. Only 5% of cargo is currently being transported on the old railway line while 95% goes by road, but Kenya Railways is aiming to push its share to 40% by 2025 with the new track. It is possible that a law will be passed requiring certain goods to be transported by rail to ensure a massive transfer of freight away from the roads. Cost $3.2bn (Â£2.5bn) Funding for the 472km (293 mile) project was provided by China It took three-and-a-half years to build, using Chinese track-laying technology The line is supposed to eventually connect land-locked South Sudan, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia to the Indian Ocean It cuts the journey time between Mombasa and Nairobi to four-and-a-half hours, compared with nine hours by bus or 12 hours on the previous railway An economy class ticket costs 900 Kenyan shillings ($9; Â£7), slightly cheaper than a bus ticket. A business class ticket is $30 The new railway also faces a regional contest. Tanzania and Kenya compete to serve the transit trade of landlocked Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. A 2013 World Bank study,externalpredicted that freight traffic on the entire East Africa Community rail network would grow to approximately 14.4 million tonnes per year by 2030. The same study found that investment in a standard gauge railway appeared ""only to be justified if the new infrastructure could attract additional rail freight in the order of 20-55 million tonnes per year"". By that measure, the railway would need to win all of the freight currently trucked to and from Mombasa - and more. According to the Kenya Ports Authority, Mombasa port handled a total of just over 26 million tonnes of cargo in 2015. The new trains are expected to provide a better experience for passengers Despite these challenges, the new railway will undoubtedly bring several long-term economic benefits. Passengers will enjoy a faster, cheaper journey and the increased freight-carrying capacity reduces wear and tear on the roads. Freight costs per kilometre in the region are more than 50% higher than in the United States and Europe, so a more affordable rail option is a relief for businesses. Jobs have been created directly from the construction and maintenance of the SGR, and more opportunities could come as towns and businesses grow along the railway line. Kenya is the largest exporter and importer in East Africa, and the new railway is a critical part of the plan to connect neighbouring states by rail, making it easier to trade with each other and the rest of the world. There is no doubt that the project is a gleaming symbol of progress, but now it is up to the volume of business it can attract to prove that it was worth the cost.

Funded by the state but run by the Taliban,"This video can not be played The BBC is given rare access to see life under the Taliban Sixteen years after they were ousted in the US-led invasion, the Taliban have fought their way back to control swathes of Afghanistan. The country remains mired in conflict, and recent months have seen a series of bloody attacks. In the south, key towns are now Taliban territory. The BBC's Auliya Atrafi was invited by the militants to spend four days behind the front line in Helmand province witnessing life under their control. In the town of Sangin, two dozen men sat cross-legged inside a huge mud compound. Under the full moon, their black turbans cast deep shadows over their sunburned features. These were the Taliban's special forces; the Red Unit. They sat quietly as they listened to their commander Mullah Taqi telling war stories, gently cradling their M4 machine guns. The M4s, with their night-vision scopes, were one of the main reasons they had captured nearly 85% of Helmand province from less-well-armed Afghan forces. But these victories had presented Taliban leaders with an unexpected challenge. The people they now ruled had lived with government services for more than a decade. Schools, hospitals, development - residents had become accustomed to them. So how could a group entirely focused on taking territory evolve into one that could attempt to run it? Men at the market in Musa Qala - women are rarely seen in public Thehardline Islamic Taliban movementswept to power in Afghanistan in 1996 after the civil war which followed the Soviet-Afghan war, and were ousted by the US-led invasion five years later In power, they imposed a brutal version of Sharia law, such as public executions and amputations, and banned women from public life Men had to grow beards and women to wear the all-covering burka; television, music and cinema were banned They sheltered al-Qaeda leaders before and after being ousted - since then they have fought a bloody insurgency which continues today In 2016, Afghan civilian casualtieshit a new high- a rise attributed by the UN largely to the Taliban Setting up our visit to Taliban territory took months. It had been years since a journalist with international media had secured such access. But in mid-May, we crossed the frontline in Gereshk, following a boy on a motorbike. We drove on the main Kabul-Herat highway towards Kandahar. Just by an Afghan National Army post, the boy suddenly turned left, leaving the highway behind, and rode into scattered settlements. He handed us over to two Taliban guards who were manning a makeshift base. One sat with us in the car, while the other led us on a motorbike towards the Zanbulai area. There, waiting for us. was Mullah Taqi, the head of Taliban special forces. He stood with a group of his men, all nursing sophisticated weaponry. Throughout the visit we were accompanied by a Taliban media team who controlled what we saw. We were not allowed to film anything to do with opium.  The opium trade is synonymous with this region - Afghanistan produces about 90% of the world's opium - and helps fund the Taliban. I tried to explain to their media head, Asad Afghan, the English concept of ""an elephant in the room"". He put his hand on my shoulder and said: ""Opium is our economic necessity, but we hate it as much as you do."" The fact is the Taliban need the money they get from drugs - it buys arms and helps fund their fight. Taliban special forces are well armed Bomb damage at what's left of the police station in Sangin Our first encounter with Taliban governance came in the market. Sangin has been fiercely contested for more than a decade - hundreds of UK, US and Afghan troops lost their lives here - and finally fell to the Taliban in March this year. The old Sangin bazaar had been flattened in the battle for the city. We walked through its makeshift replacement, a sea of tarpaulin and boxes. Two men were arguing by a food stall. ""I can't read!"" shouted shopkeeper Haji Saifullah. ""How was I supposed to know the biscuits were out of date?"" He fidgeted with his turban, pushing it to one side nervously. The Taliban mayor of Sangin, clutching petrol jugs The other man was the Taliban mayor of Sangin, Noor Mohammad. He ordered Haji Saifullah to be imprisoned for three days and to pay a fine. Next on the mayor's list was inspecting petrol containers to see if they had been altered to pour under the promised gallon. After that came examinations for people who claimed to be doctors, but who he suspected were lying. Later we drove to Musa Qala, the Taliban's de facto capital. Just short of the town, we stopped at a travelling bazaar set up on a dry riverbed. Young traders in Musa Qala Musa Qala is famous for the opium trade but it is also a commercial lifeline for the district. Traders come here all the way from the Afghan-Pakistan border areas. At the bazaar you could buy motorbikes, cows, ice-cream - and less conventional commodities such as ammunition. Bullets for an AK47 were 25 cents (15p) each. Bullets for a Russian machine-gun used to be 40 cents each, but were reduced to 15 cents because - according to the shopkeeper - too many of them had been captured from the Afghan security forces. Bullets on sale in the market in Musa Qala While the Taliban focus on health, safety and trading standards in Sangin was surprising, more discoveries awaited us in Musa Qala. Despite it being the Taliban capital, the school and hospital were still being funded by the government in Kabul. Read more about the conflict: Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? World powers jostle in Afghanistan's new 'Great Game' Mistrust and fear in battle for Helmand UK military deaths in Afghanistan: Full list ""The government recently did their inspections; our schools were officially registered; our salaries that were locked for a year were later released,"" said Abdul Rahim, the government's head of education for Musa Qala. He said the Taliban did not have any problem with government inspectors, and that the system was working. ""The government give us stationery and everything else, we implement the government syllabus and the Taliban don't have a problem with it,"" he said. Girls get primary education but after that schools cater for boys under the Taliban But not everything was running smoothly. Across Afghanistan, about 40% of pupils enrolled in schools are female, according to US Aid. Not in Musa Qala, however. No girls over the age of about 12 were being educated in the Taliban capital. But girls were deprived of education here even before the Taliban took hold, because it is a very conservative area. For the boys, meanwhile, there were not enough basic supplies. ""The way our school is run is good, as in security, but we have one problem and that's we don't have enough books,"" said one student, Dadul-Haq. ""One student will be missing maths, the other chemistry - not all pupils have the same books."" It struck me that in education, at least, the Taliban are tentatively experimenting by allowing wider access to education - at least for boys - than during their earlier regime. Under them, before 2001, many fewer boys went to school in the countryside. But experiences like Haji Saifullah's - the biscuit seller in Sangin - have made rural Afghans realise that education and literacy are essential. They will not turn you into an infidel, as their forefathers feared. Now the Taliban appear to have realised that they cannot fight the modern world forever, so some have opted to join it on their own terms. Electricity is something people in Helmand are now used to Asad Afghan, the Taliban's media co-ordinator, used a proverb to make his point. ""The fire may have burnt our house, but it made our walls stronger,"" he said. He meant that the Taliban had learned from the past mistake of isolating themselves from modernisation. Many say the Taliban have brought some security - albeit with limited freedoms - to the countryside they control. Areas used to years of fighting between troops and militants are now seeing a dramatic rise in trade. Many people say they prefer the Taliban's swift - but flawed - system of justice to the previous administration, which they say was riddled with corruption and patronage. Profile: Taliban chief Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada Money from honey: Expert views on how the insurgency funds itself What happened after Taliban founderMullah Omar died? We visited the district hospital which, like the school, was funded by the government but run by the Taliban. It is meant to serve 120,000 people, but lacked many basic facilities. There was not one female doctor; neither was there a paediatric specialist. It wasn't even possible to get a chest X-ray. To cater for women the Taliban had built a separate facility next door, run by female staff. One doctor said the dual system had created a responsibility vacuum and opened the door to corruption. ""I haven't been paid in the past six months - not only me but also the entire staff of the hospital,"" he said. ""[Government] supervisors write things on paper that don't turn into reality. Our medicine for three months doesn't last us more than a month and halfâ¦ this is because sometimes the Taliban come and want medicine for themselves."" We asked the Taliban's supervisor for health services, Attaullah, if we could interview a female nurse, but he refused. Her husband told him that he had no problem with the interview, but Attaullah said: ""It is your right to allow the interview and my responsibility to stop it. ""What would be the difference between us and the government if we allowed interviews with women?"" During the four days I was in Taliban territory, I only saw women in clinics and being transported around by their male relatives. But men here have always preferred women to stay at home out of sight. Even if the Taliban were not here, it is unlikely things would be very different. Some activities were limited. In Musa Qala, using mobile phones and the internet was banned for security and religious reasons - our Taliban media handlers communicated via walkie-talkies. Filming and playing musical instruments are also not allowed. One young man told me he was given 40 lashes for watching a Bollywood film. The Taliban have cracked down on bachabaze - dance parties involving teenage boys that can often end in sexual abuse. They also come down hard on homosexuality, although it appears the Taliban legal process can be influenced with a mixture of pulling strings and bribes. You just didn't see posters like this under the Taliban in the past There are contradictions. We were allowed in to film, for example. And we passed billboards that featured pictures of Western women advertising dental clinics - a far cry from the days when the Taliban banned such images. Despite the internet ban, there are wi-fi hotspots providing a connection to the outside world. A few dedicated fans of Turkish and Indian soap operas have televisions connected to small satellite dishes. ""Aren't you scared the Taliban will find out?"" I asked one teenager. ""They know about our TV and the wi-fi,"" he said. ""But I think they are just watching and waiting, to see what happens."" During our visit, we were aware that the Taliban were treating us carefully, mindful of creating a good impression. Equally, Sangin and Musa Qala are important to them, so keeping local people happy matters. We heard reports that Taliban control in other places was more rigid. For the Taliban, beginning to adapt in the face of modernity seems to be a painful dilemma: embrace it and you lose control and religious legitimacy; reject it and you become an island. When it comes to governance, the Taliban's Achilles heel is thought to be their political philosophy, or rather the lack of it. From the start, their focus has been on war and there has been little scope for political thinking to evolve. Their success has become their greatest nemesis. As a white-bearded school headmaster put it: ""The Taliban see everything through the prism of war, and they see winning wars as their sole purpose in life."" What does the future hold for these Musa Qala boys growing up under militant rule? I reminded him that the Taliban also had a culture of obedience and were disciplined, so didn't he think they would be able to direct their devotion to war into the art of politics? He dropped his head, thought for a moment and shook his head doubtfully. He didn't think so. At night, we would dine with local Taliban leaders and discuss these themes. One evening a Taliban leader strove to convince us of the benefits of life under the Taliban by contrasting it with the failings of the Afghan government. But it struck me that the world they wanted to create was too absolute for a human society. I suggested that society was messy, complicated and always in transition, and wondered how successful any government would be trying put it in a fixed framework. The leader, Musavir Sahib, was a tiny man, with long beard and blue eyes. He was adamant: ""Our governance is based on sacred scripture; it is the best solution for any human society. ""Afghans are adaptable people,"" he added. ""When we took over the country for the first time, very soon people started dressing up like us. And then when the Americans came, they started dressing up like the Americans. So surely they will adopt our governance again."" He could not conceive that people could oppose Taliban rule and were coerced by them into doing what they wanted. The police headquarters in Sangin bears the name of the UK regiment that was based in the area Back inside government-held territory, I realised that describing the insurgent group had become less straightforward and full of contradictions. The Taliban have changed significantly while at the same time they are stuck in their past; they feel they have to adapt to the modern world while thinking theirs is the best way of governance. In the areas they hold, they seem to be trying to provide a peaceful existence, but elsewhere they continue carrying out their deadly bombings. Their goal to create their specific kind of extreme Islamic state is unchanged and they are still fighting because they see themselves as winning. But they now face a new challenge. In the areas they control, people now expect life-changing improvements like healthcare and electricity - a lasting legacy of the billions of dollars that poured in with foreign forces to rebuild Afghanistan in the years after 9/11.

In the areas they hold, they seem to be trying to provide a peaceful existence, but elsewhere they continue carrying out their deadly bombings. Their goal to create their specific kind of extreme Islamic state is unchanged and they are still fighting because they see themselves as winning. But they now face a new challenge. In the areas they control, people now expect life-changing improvements like healthcare and electricity - a lasting legacy of the billions of dollars that poured in with foreign forces to rebuild Afghanistan in the years after 9/11.

Wreckage found in Myanmar plane search,"So far, the bodies of mainly women and children have been found The Burmese army says debris and bodies have been found after a military plane went missing with 122 people on board. Dispersed wreckage was found in the Andaman Sea, the military said in a statement on its Facebook page. The aircraft, a Y-8 transporter made in China, was carrying 14 crew. Most of the passengers were military personnel and family members, including children. The plane was flying from Myeik to Yangon and the debris was found in the sea off the coastal town of Dawei. Communication with the flight was lost on Wednesday half an hour into the short routine trip. According to the military, by mid-afternoon on Thursday search teams had recovered 29 bodies - 20 women, eight children and one man. A wheel, several life jackets and some luggage were found earlier. Should everyone on board have died in the crash, the death toll would make it among the country's worst aviation disasters, says the BBC's Myanmar correspondent Jonah Fisher. The reason for the crash remains unclear. There has so far been no report of a mayday call and the dispersed nature of the wreckage suggests it could have broken up in mid air. Although it is monsoon season in Myanmar, there were no reports of bad weather at that time. The plane was purchased from China in March last year and had logged 809 flying hours, according to the military. Myanmar has seen a number of aircraft incidents in recent years. In February 2016, the five-member crew of an air force plane died when the aircraft crashed in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw. A few months later, three officers were killed when a military helicopter crashed in central Myanmar. An Air Bagan commercial aircraftmade an emergency landingin 2012 and burst into flames, killing two people.

Shanghai arrest over cocaine-made suitcase,"Customs officials in Shanghai have arrested a woman attempting to smuggle two suitcases into China that were almost entirely made of cocaine. Airport authorities X-rayed the luggage of a woman flying from an unnamed South American country. The scan showed her luggage was darker in colour than normal, and also that it was unusually heavy even when it was empty. Testing revealed the luggage was made of more than 10kg (22lb) of cocaine. The incident took place in February but has only now been reported by the police. Drug traffickers have long been dreaming up ways to transport cocaine - making an entire leg cast out of the drug, or dissolving it into wine, as one Chinese couple was caught doing just last month. The usual ways would be to somehow hide the drugs within the luggage or on your body. But constructing suitcases out of hardened cocaine and parading it in plain sight in front of security stands out as a first. When the woman was asked to empty her luggage, there was nothing suspicious at first glance - merely an empty suitcase. If that's how you think it looks, think again What tipped the officers off was that it was significantly heavier than any empty luggage ought to be. Pigeon 'caught with backpack of drugs' Airlifting cocaine from the Netherlands to the UK There have been similar cases in Europe where smugglers used glue and moulds to compress cocaine into a hard substance. Cocaine is a relatively rare drug in China, and the woman is expected to pay a heavy price for her attempt to bring it into the country. Chinese law dictates that anyone convicted of trafficking more than 50g of cocaine will be executed. It's the first time that this particular method of drug smuggling has been uncovered - yet it's unclear how many such suitcases might have passed under the eyes of unsuspecting airport security in the past.

North Korea 'fires land-to-ship missiles',"North Korea displayed anti-ship Styx cruise missiles in a 2012 military parade North Korea has fired several anti-ship cruise missiles off its east coast, South Korea's military says. Authorities said the weapons, launched on Thursday morning near the city of Wonsan, appeared to be short-range ""surface-to-ship"" missiles. They flew about 200km (125 miles) before landing in the water. Repeated ballistic missile tests by the North this year - not all successful but all a breach of UN sanctions - have sparked international alarm. Experts fear the tests indicate progress towards Pyongyang's ultimate goal of putting a nuclear warhead on a missile. It is unclear whether the latest firing violates the UN Security Council's resolutions against North Korea. The resolution,externalissued on 2 June specifically bans Pyongyang from nuclear activity and ballistic missiles, but also bans launches of ""any other provocation"" and ""any other existing weapons of mass destruction"". South Korean military spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said the latest launch showed the North ""likely wanted to show off its ability to precisely target a large warship"" after recent military drills involving US aircraft carriers and South Korean troops. ""By testing different types of missiles, North Korea also appears to be aiming to secure the upper hand in relations with South Korea and the United States,"" he told reporters. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? Trump fears 'major major' conflict with North Korea North Korea's missile programme Anti-ship cruise missiles are guided missiles which generally skim the water. In 2012, North Korea displayed several such weapons known as Styx. But North Korea has also previously unsuccessfully tested anti-ship ballistic missiles, experts believe. On 29 May, it fired aScud-type ballistic missilefrom the same location, which flew about 450km. The US has been installing a missile defence system on a golf course in Seongju, South Korea Last Friday the UN Security Council unanimously adopted a new resolution to impose targeted sanctions on certain North Korean officials and state entities. The US has also ramped up its military presence in the region, conducting drills with Japan as well as South Korea, and is installing a controversial missile defence system in South Korea, known as Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad). But South Korea said on Wednesday it wassuspending the further deploymentof the system until an environmental assessment is completed. Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?
