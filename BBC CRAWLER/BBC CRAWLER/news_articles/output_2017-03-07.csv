Napoli 1-3 Real Madrid (2-6 agg),"Sergio Ramos has eight goals in all competitions for Real Madrid this season Real Madrid came from a goal down against Napoli in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie to progress to the quarter-finals. Napoli were utterly dominant in a one-sided first half and took the lead on 24 minutes when Marek Hamsik put Dries Mertens through on goal as Real's defence went missing. But captain Sergio Ramos netted one and had another header deflected in by Mertens after the break to put the holders in control. Alvaro Morata then followed up Cristiano Ronaldo's shot to complete a comfortable victory. Real's defensive weakness was perfectly exploited by Napoli's game plan in the first-half - a high-press put Pepe and Marcelo under pressure before Hamsik threaded a perfect through ball to Mertens who finished well in the bottom corner. But the Italian side ultimately failed to take their other chances - Hamsik fizzed multiple shots wide before Mertens hit the woodwork and Real eventually made them pay. The Spanish giants have now reached their seventh successive Champions League quarter-final and are unbeaten in their last 12 Champions League matches (W7, D5); their longest run without defeat in the Champions League or European Cup. Ronaldo is just five away from a century of goals in the Champions League Real Madrid increased their Spanish record of scoring in 47 consecutive games with a win in Italy, but their Portuguese star striker is enduring his longest barren patch in the Champions League - Ronaldo has now gone six games without a goal. He has five assists in seven Champions League appearances this term - his most in the competition in a single season for Real - but despite playing his part in Morata's strike, he could claim neither a goal nor an assist as he twice hit the woodwork. Back from injury, having missed Saturday's 4-1 win over Eibar, Ronaldo had Real's best chance in the first half, but he could only hit the woodwork from a tight angle having rounded Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina. Once again Real looked leaky at the back - the likes of Hamsik, Lorenzo Insigne and Mertens carving them open with relative ease during the first half. But captain Ramos came to their rescue and Real never looked back. Ramos has been dismissed a club-record 21 times for Real Madrid The 30-year-old may be a defender by trade and have a reputation for his red card collection, but he has also made a name for himself at the other end of the pitch. Ramos is one of only three defenders to have scored in two different European Cup finals. Alongside Tommy Gemmell (Celtic 1967 and 70),who passed away last week,and Phil Neal (Liverpool 1977 and 84), he scored in both the 2014 and 2016 Champions League finals against Atletico Madrid. And he came to his side's rescue once again in Naples with two emphatic headers, one deflected by Mertens, at a crucial period in the second half. With Real Madrid completely outplayed in the first 40 minutes and a goal down courtesy of Mertens' crisp strike, Ramos rose highest from two Toni Kroos corners straight after the break to silence a 57,000-strong crowd inside the San Paolo stadium. On a tricky night in Italy, where Real Madrid's record is somewhat shaky (18 losses, eight draws and now six wins), the Spain international stepped up when Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo flew under the radar. Real Madrid are unbeaten in the past 12 Champions League matches (W7, D5); their longest run without defeat in the Champions League or European Cup. Real Madrid have reached the Champions League quarter-finals in each of the last seven seasons. Dries Mertens has now scored 17 times in his last 16 games in all competitions for Napoli. Seven of Napoli's past 10 Champions League goals have either been scored (5) or assisted (2) by Dries Mertens. Real Madrid have progressed from each of their last nine Champions League ties in the last 16 or beyond when they've won the first leg. Napoli, meanwhile, have now been eliminated on each of the previous five occasions they have lost the first leg of a last 16 tie in European competition.

'Why do women judge me because of my big breasts?',"Karen Gormley describes herself as ""smiley and quite shy"", but says people see her differently simply because of the size of her breasts. The 45-year-old, from Preston, Lancashire, got in touch with BBC News after the furore over Emma Watson's Vanity Fair photoshoot. Karen says women, in particular, are guilty of judging her character just by her appearance. This is her story: ""I am petite with large breasts. I am 5ft 2. When I was last measured years ago I was a 28G. People assume that my shape means I am promiscuous. I found it all-too familiar whenEmma Watson was criticised as being anti-feminist for showing part of her breastsin a magazine photoshoot. Women who are up in arms about it aren't doing us any favours. I'm also a feminist and believe women should be able to wear whatever they like. Unlike Emma, I'm too shy to be in photographs, but as soon as I wear fitted clothes or a lower neckline, I'm branded as attention-seeking. It began when I was 14. I noticed that middle-aged men would follow me. I was in school uniform but it happened every time I went into town. It was really frightening. But it wasn't always men. A female teacher once told me I couldn't wear a pinafore dress even though it was school uniform because I wasn't ""covered up"". I felt on edge all the time and began wearing baggy clothes, so people thought I was fat. When I was 16 I braved wearing a fitted dress for a party. It wasn't low cut but my cleavage showed a bit - suddenly my friends gasped at how much ""weight"" I'd lost. The worst thing that ever happened was when I was 21 and my boyfriend at the time introduced me to his brother. Instead of saying ""Nice to meet you"" he pointed at my chest and said ""Look at the size of them!"". As part of my job working with young offenders, I have worked in offices full of men and have constantly dealt with comments. I was always seen as the ""easy"" woman to flirt with. I am planning a breast reduction, which I can get on the NHS, due to the size of my breasts, which cause me back problems. The decision is to do with my health but also the way I've been treated. It was a friend-of-a-friend's comment that proved the last straw. She said that I only get attention because I have big boobs. It made me feel like I am nothing except for what hangs on my chest. I don't want to be that person. I have two daughters - 17 and 22 - who are both very pretty and a similar shape to me, and I see them going through the same thing. I used to be over-protective and tell them to take pictures off Facebook, but I don't want my problem to become their problem too. I just tell them that if you wear low-cut stuff, somebody will judge you to have a certain character you don't have. It's not your fault and they don't have the right to do that, but they will. But my daughters aren't shy like me and would tear a strip off anyone who bothers them!"" A nasty remark on social media or even a well-meaning comment from a friend can be hugely damaging to a person's body image - and even drive someone to opt for surgery, according to psychologists. About half of UK women are unhappy with their body shape, which can lead to low self-esteem, depression, eating disorders and body dysmorphias. Dr Emma Halliwell, a psychologist at the Centre for Appearance Research at the University of the West of England, thinks body image is an ""issue that impacts upon all aspects of girls' and women's lives"". Her research into body confidence has found that ""society teaches girls that their appearance is intrinsically linked to their value as a person"". Women are bombarded with a ""beauty ideal"" - one body type, one look, one shape, one colour, one breast or buttock - which is reinforced by friends, on Facebook and in magazines and music videos, she says. As a result, adult women may skip work or a job interview if they feel negative about their looks. ""We need to challenge these messages that female appearance is of central importance,"" she says.

Why young people are now less likely to smoke,"All age groups in the UK are smoking less - but the largest decrease is among 18- to 24-year-olds, according to the Office of National Statistics. Why is that? The latest figures, for 2015, suggest one in every five (20.7%) 18- to 24-year-olds is a smoker. In 2010, this figure was one in every four (25.8%). Today, about 70% of 16- to 24-year-olds have never started smoking cigarettes in the first place, the data suggests - up from 46% in 1974, when records began. And even among the age group most likely to smoke, 24- to 35-year-olds, about 60% - up from 35% in 1974 - have never picked up the habit. Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) says: ""We know that young people who try smoking are highly likely to grow up to become smokers, so the high numbers of young people reporting that they have never even tried smoking is good news."" Model Kylie Jenner was called a bad role modelafter she was pictured smoking on Instagram, perhaps an indicator it is no longer seen as cool. The new data suggests 23.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds quit smoking in 2015, compared with 21.4% in 2010 and 13.4% in 1974. Ash says this has been ""achieved through a combination of effective legislation, policy and support for adults to quit over many decades - much of which has had a big impact on youth uptake as well as quitting"". Policy director Hazel Cheeseman says: ""Creating an environment in which fewer young people try smoking and more smokers quit will protect the health of future generations and avoid hundreds and thousands of premature deaths. ""However, the achievements made to date are at risk. ""The government must urgently publish a new tobacco control plan for England and ensure this is properly funded."" In 2015, three out of every 100 16- to 24-year-olds used electronic cigarettes, up from one in every 100 in 2014, the new data suggests. And, in total, 2.3 million people in the UK are using them - half in order to stop smoking. But some are concerned vaping could prove a gateway to smoking for teenagers. Andcritics saythe fruit flavours of some e-cigarettes could make them more appealing to children. In December 2016, theUS Surgeon General saidthe use of e-cigarettes by children was ""a major public health concern"". But Ash says the latest figures ""confirm that most users are smokers or ex-smokers"". ""The figures also highlight that most users are seeking to improve their health, with the most common reason for use being as an aid to quit smoking,"" it says. ""Where smokers make a complete switch, they can expect to significantly reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals which cause cancer and other smoking-related illnesses."" Paul Hunt, managing director of e-cigarette manufacturerV2Cigs.co.uk,external, said: ""E-cigarettes are supporting thousands of people in quitting smoking every day. ""Information from the NHS states that people who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking can expect similar or better results than when using other nicotine replacement therapies."" ""Of those people who combined NHS stop smoking support with e-cigarettes, two out of three were successful in quitting."" ""As they eliminate chemicals found in regular cigarettes, such as tar, and allow people control over the amount of nicotine they're consuming, e-cigarettes are a great tool in overcoming smoking addiction.""

The selfies that tell a story of depression,"Celine wants to inspire others to be open about their mental health problems Celine is a 19-year-old law student at the University of Hull who has suffered with depression and anxiety for much of her life. She is one of around 80,000 children and young people who suffer from severe depression in the UK. Recently, she posted on Facebook about her mental health struggles and was met with a very positive response. This gave her the confidence to contact us and share her experiences, while receiving treatment at Cygnet Hospital Harrogate. More than anything, she wants to inspire others to be open about their mental health. This is her story. Celine says these photos show how her declining mental health affected her physically ""Since as long as I can remember I have felt unhappy, unmotivated overall unsuccessful, with dark thoughts lingering in my mind. ""People say we cannot see mental health, but I don't agree. The photos above show how gradually mental health has physically affected me. (From left to right) ""It can be seen in the hair that I couldn't be bothered to brush anymore, in the lack of make-up, because - what was the point? ""And it can be seen in the smile, that is in all four photos, but which gradually becomes more and more of a cry for help. ""How can it be possible for a person like me to be so unhappy with their life? I owned two beautiful horses which have played a significant role in helping me cope with my depression and anxiety, among other issues. ""My parents have been more than generous and support me in every possible way. ""Yet I felt incomplete, I felt as if it is almost impossible some mornings to leave my bed because at the end of the day - what was the point? Nothing had a purpose. ""I've had people yell at me and say, 'Just get up', and, 'Stop being lazy', but the truth is, for anyone else that has experienced anything similar, it is not that easy. And the days I do manage to move from my bed, I feel like I deserve a gold medal. ""When I was at my lowest, not only did I feel sad, I began struggling in simple situations. ""It began with speaking in public at a young age. I would avoid school until eventually it wasn't necessary for me to go at all. ""On other occasions, I would find myself in situations in Tesco where someone's laughter was enough to cause me great distress because I began to feel strangers were laughing at me. ""If I caught a glimpse of someone staring at me it was because I must be overweight. So I found myself focusing on girl body builders and models, on how good they looked. ""Seeing myself in the mirror made me feel really down because I did not match up to this image - which girls these days strive to achieve. ""This became another daily stress which has led me to lose weight over the past few months. ""It then started to affect things I enjoyed. I was unable to ride my horse without feeling we weren't good enough - that I was a poor rider and that I'd let my horse down. I would put immense pressure on myself before a riding show, the kind of pressure that not even an Olympian athlete would recognise. ""No-one needs to ever feel like this. No-one needs to feel like they can't do something or are not good enough. ""When I broke up with my boyfriend last year I felt as if I was losing everything, bit by bit. I gave up on wearing make-up and became a bit of a state. I had no motivation. ""I went to see an NHS psychologist but he said I was being melodramatic. ""When I started uni, that was another big stress. Sometimes I would look in the mirror and think, 'I can't do this anymore'. ""During my recent treatment the doctors at the hospital spoke to me as if my problems were completely normal. Finally, someone understood. ""There's been loads of support like group therapy, one-to-one counselling and everyone here talks to each other about their issues. ""I have met many people suffering with the same problems as me but I would never have known unless I had spoken to them about it. ""It was such a huge relief to know I was not alone. I finally realised other people had the same mind thoughts, stress and worries I did. ""Some of us might be OK and that's OK too, but others might need some help along the way. ""There is no shame in waking up and taking a tablet that will make you enjoy your daily life. And having someone to talk to, who will listen to you, will make you feel as if a load has been lifted. ""The brain is an organ like any other. You wouldn't think twice about taking a paracetamol for a hangover so why would you think twice about taking a tablet that will make you feel better."" ""I will hands up say I struggle with mental health issues. I'm going to come out better at the end of it and enjoy the rest of my life. ""There is no shame in mental health. People need to stop worrying that if they are strong enough to say, 'I need help', then they will get the title of a madman or the image of someone from a horror movie. ""I have been called a loony, a psycho, a nut case, not right in the head... But it's in those situations that you realise who your friends are. ""I am forever grateful to the hospital for their help and for the support of wonderful friends and family who haven't judged me or treated me any differently. ""My name is Celine, I'm 19 and a university law student. I speak two languages and I have a beautiful horse. I suffer with mental health issues."" Talk to someone you trust about how you are feeling - don't suffer in silence If it's become a long-term problem, see your GP - you may need medication Help yourself by getting some exercise, eating healthily and doing things you enjoy If the depression has been continuing for some time, you may need to be referred for therapy or counselling YoungMinds,external mental health charity Mind,external Royal College of Psychiatrists' advice on mental health and growing ups,external And you can join the conversation onour Facebook page,external.

Dutch vote turns spotlight on Moroccans,"This video can not be played Meet the Dutch-Moroccans at the centre of an election campaign When Dutch populist leader Geert Wilders accused young Moroccans of making the streets unsafe, they were thrust into the centre of his election campaign. As the 15 March vote approaches, the founder of the anti-immigration Freedom Party (PVV) has faltered in the opinion polls. But Dutch Moroccans, who make up just 2% of the population, have continued to feature prominently in the election debates. With her trendy black trainers and matching hijab, Hafsa Mahraoui is the quintessential image of modern Muslim woman.  She considers herself ""a true Amsterdam girl"" but has been disappointed by the tone of the campaign. ""They say Islam isn't normal, it doesn't belong in Dutch society, and that being hijabi means I am an oppressed person,"" she says. ""It's tiring because we are always in the spotlight and you have to defend yourself. Amsterdam is a big city, there are 180 nationalities here. They talk about a (Dutch) culture, but when I look around I don't see it."" More stories about the Dutch election race: If you don't like it here then leave, says Rutte Wilders scents Dutch victory Are liberal Dutch turning to the right? Hafsa shudders as she recounts having her headscarf ripped off just after the murder of the film-maker Theo van Gogh. He was shot dead by a Dutch-Moroccan man while cycling to work in 2004, a pivotal moment largely seen as hardening Dutch attitudes towards Islam. In a renovated drug den in the edgy district of Amsterdam North, rapper Rachid el Ghazoui - who goes by the name of Appa - explains how he started growing a beard and became interested in radical Islam, because he was ""angry with how society treats us"". Rapper Rachid el Ghazoui says politicians have heightened tensions Then he learned to channel his frustrations through music and is now helping other young people to do the same. ""The PVV is big in this country; they hate us, they hate Muslims. But a lot of Dutch people are scared too,"" he says. He believes Prime Minister Mark Rutte has also heightened tensions by suggesting that people who refused to adapt to Dutch values should leave. ""There's a lot of fear and hate created by politicians who just want votes, and it makes it a little difficult for you as a Moroccan youth."" Neither Geert Wilders nor the prime minister took part in one of the key TV debates, and that enabled other political leaders to seize the limelight. One of them, Jesse Klaver, is part-Moroccan. With his shirtsleeves hitched up, a charismatic twinkle and shaggy hairstyle the 30-year-old father of two is attracting new voters to the Green Left (Groenlinks) party with a progressive, inclusive attitude, quite at odds with Geert Wilders' anti-Islam, anti-immigration rhetoric. Jesse Klaver has become such a hit that he has already ""sold out"" a 6,000-seat hall in Amsterdam. And supporters are comparing him to Canada's Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau. Born to a Moroccan father and Dutch-Indonesian mother, he speaks openly about how his dad walked out on the family when he was a child. His speeches unashamedly draw on campaign themes once used by Barack Obama. From L-R: Centre-right PM Mark Rutte, Populist Geert Wilders, Christian Democrat Sybrand Buma, Liberal Alexander Pechtold and Green Left Jesse Klaver A record 28 parties are contesting the 15 March election; five are jostling for the biggest number of seats Mark Rutte's conservative liberal VVD currently leads in the opinion polls and refuses to go into coalition with Mr Wilders' PVV Also riding high in the polls are the Christian Democrats, Liberal D66, Green Left, the Socialist SP and Labour Dutch governments are formed by coalitions - the last featured the VVD and Labour party (PvdA) This video can not be played The Dutch App that lets you keep politicians as virtual pets Seeking to kick-start his flagging campaign, Geert Wilders' first stop last week was Volendam. The small fishing village famous for its eels is only a 20-minute drive from the graffiti-covered Amsterdam youth club, packed with the children of immigrants perfecting their rap skills. Geert Wilders visited Volendam last week, after pausing his street campaign for security reasons The waterfront high street is almost deserted and feels like Disneyland out of season. Volendam presents a vision of the Netherlands sought by tourists, and in the 2014 European elections almost one in two of its voters backed Mr Wilders' PVV. A waitress serving a thick slice of apple tart says she is fed up with being associated to what she describes as a racist party. ""It's only the old people voting for Wilders now. We don't know what he's doing, and we don't like it."" Volendammers were particularly offended when a national newspaper published a cartoon featuring villagers in traditional costume with their faces superimposed with an image of Adolf Hitler. Geert Wilders has clearly hit some sort of snag in the past fortnight. It may have been his decision to avoid mainstream media. He may also have been damaged by TV satirist Arjen Lubach's decision to train his eye on the Wilders manifesto. Lubach has gone viral before, when his TV programme reacted to President Donald Trump's America First policy by asking ""but can we just say the Netherlands second?"" Arjen Lubach's Sunday night TV programme has become must-see viewing ahead of the vote ""The biggest problem is they have this one sheet of paper explaining what their plans are,"" the satirist told the BBC. ""No matter where you look, it's just one piece of paper. Among the things they want, closing all mosques, forbidding all Korans. How?! Because you'd need to take freedom of speech out of the constitution, you need to take freedom of assembly out of the constitution. ""You'll get into fights with the whole world. I mean it needs some explanation and that goes for almost anything that Geert Wilders is saying."" A video of the segment has attracted well over a million views. And an accompanying hashtag ""How then?"" trended on Twitter. Arjen Lubach, whose show has been compared to Jon Stewart's old Daily Show, also tore into Jesse Klaver's tendency to use Barack Obama-style rhetoric But Lubach does not just single out Geert Wilders. Inanother widely shared video,external, he showed how Green Left's Jesse Klaver drew heavily on the rhetoric of Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign. ""Het kan wel,"" Jesse Klaver promises a crowd in his own Dutch version of ""Yes we can"". When the Green Left leader addresses a US-style rally in Amsterdam this week, commentators believe its scale will be unprecedented in the Netherlands. The party is using a marketing firm hired by Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders - and it shows. Jesse Klaver's team does not object to the association. And it does not seem to be doing him any harm.

The spy boss dragged through the mud,"From humble beginnings, Maurice Oldfield (left) was used as the basis for Alec Guinness' character in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Maurice Oldfield rose from humble beginnings to become one of the UK's greatest ever spy chiefs. He was credited with keeping his country out of the Vietnam War - and also inspired Alec Guinness's portrayal of George Smiley in the TV series Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Yet allegations of child abuse - later proved to be false - dogged his reputation for years. These claims - which centred on a children's home in Belfast, where he was stationed in the late 1970s - were only discounted three months ago, 36 years after his death. His family, who have mounted a posthumous defence for decades, have described the impact as ""devastating"" and ""heartbreaking"". Born on a farmhouse table in Derbyshire, Mr Oldfield had been an unlikely candidate to lead the UK's secret service. Educated at Manchester University, he was an outsider among the elitist, Oxbridge-dominated intelligence services. Despite this, he enjoyed a stellar career, becoming head of MI6 in 1973 - at a time when the spy agency was reeling after years of Soviet infiltration. Over six years he stabilised the ship and - just as he was about to retire in 1979 - prime minister Margaret Thatcher asked him to take on one more job, co-ordinating security and intelligence in Northern Ireland. His time there nearly demolished his legacy. Allegations emerged that Oldfield had abused boys at Kincora children's home Shortly before he died aged 65 in 1981, rumours began circulating about Mr Oldfield's private life while in Northern Ireland. It was alleged he had compromised his position by making a pass at a man in a County Down bar. He was also said to have propositioned a man in a Belfast pub toilets. More seriously, rumours began to emerge connecting him to a boys' home in Belfast, where children had been abused. These stories began to appear in the newspapers from 1987 and never went away, resurfacing when he was named in theHistorical Institutional Abuse Inquiry,externalinto child abuse in Northern Ireland in 2014. Oldfield's great-nephew, Martin Pearce, had a book published on Oldfield's life last year He was also named in the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland inquiry into allegations that a paedophile ring operated in Westminster in the 1970s and 1980s. The latter inquiry ended in March 2016 with no charges being brought against anyone while the Northern Irish investigation concluded in January that allegations against Mr Oldfield had ""no substance"". Mr Oldfield's great-nephew Martin Pearce said the toll on the family over the past three decades had been terrible. ""It was devastating, particularly for his brothers and sisters, most of whom were still alive,"" he said. ""They never believed any of it but, to see their brother who they had been so proud of being dragged through the press in such a negative way, was heartbreaking."" Oldfield was one of the most decorated MI6 leaders He said the government of the 1980s had refused to defend his great uncle as it was ""happy with the distraction"" from the Spycatcher affair, in which MI5 agent Peter Wright had alleged the service had operated beyond the law. ""It seems there has been a lot of incompetence over the years that needn't have happened,"" he said. ""Now Maurice has been fully exonerated we can all move on from that. ""We have always had the absolute confidence and certainty that he was entirely innocent of everything but it's just been horrible to have his name dragged through the mud."" Few of Mr Oldfield's immediate relatives, who tried to defend his name in the years after his death, are themselves still alive. Mr Pearce said it was ""frustrating"" they are not around to see his name cleared. Colin Wallace, a whistleblower on abuse in Northern Ireland and an ex-intelligence officer, said he too was angry at Mr Oldfield's treatment. ""It's important to point out he was the most decorated of all our intelligence officers with a track record... second to none,"" he said. But smears of that nature can stick, according to MI6 historian Stephen Dorrill. ""There's still a mark against him because of that,"" he said. ""His role in Northern Ireland was important, he was always looking for a peaceful way out. MI6's role in talking to the IRA actually did save lives."" Oldfield liked to return to Over Haddon in the Peak District as often as he could It was far from the only success in his career. ""Anybody who achieves chief inside MI6 has done exceptionally well because often it's riddled with factions,"" Mr Dorrill said. ""Coming from Manchester University he would still have been something of an outsider in the service as most came through the Oxbridge route."" MI6 was ""in a mess"" when Mr Oldfield took over as head in 1973, Mr Dorrill added. There had been the scandal of the Cambridge Five - the ring of double agents, including Kim Philby and Guy Burgess, who passed hundreds of files to the Russians. Mr Oldfield managed to gain back the United States' trust in MI6, but perhaps his greatest achievement was helping to persuade the government to stay out of the Vietnam War. ""If Britain had been dragged into that, if [Harold] Wilson had decided to go along with the Americans, that could have been the deaths of many, many young people and he avoided that,"" said Mr Dorrill. Oldfield was the first secret service chief to be allowed to appear in the press, which made him something of a reluctant celebrity in the Cold War era. While preparing to play George Smiley in the BBC adaptation of John Le Carre's Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, actor Alec Guinness said he wanted to meet a ""real spy"". Alec Guinness studied Oldfield's mannerisms for the part of George Smiley Although Smiley was created some years before he ever met Mr Oldfield, Le Carre did introduce the pair in a London pub. ""Maurice and Alec Guinness got there before him and they were chatting away when John Le Carre arrived,"" said Mr Pearce. According to Mr Dorrill, Guinness ""observed Maurice very carefully: What he was drinking, how he talked and sat and how he walked down the road."" Le Carre himself said Guinness asked why Mr Oldfield had wiped the rim of his glass during their meeting: ""Do you think he's looking for the dregs of poison?"" he asked. ""Well if he was, he's dead,"" Le Carre replied. Mr Oldfield wrote to the actor after seeing the series, telling him: ""I still don't recognise myself."" But many others did.

How an Afghan teenager invented a superhero,"Mohammad Sayed was abandoned by his family in Afghanistan after his house was bombed and he was left paralysed. Now he has become a US citizen, and designed a comic book superhero - Wheelchair Man - based on his own life story. I used to play with my father's AK47, rocket launchers and used mortar shells. We didn't have toys and every household had them. They made me feel powerful and I used to brag that I was not scared of the bombs raining down on us. But eventually one of those bombs fell on me. I lived in the Panjshir valley with my mom, my dad, my two brothers, my sister and my grandmother. My father was a commander with the Afghan National Army (ANA) in charge of 300 soldiers. My mother died when I was between five and six years old, I don't know the exact year, but I think it was around 2002. Eleven days later I was seriously injured. It was so traumatic that I don't really like to go into the details. My father took me to a hospital that day and never came back for me, so I had to take care of myself. For the first couple of weeks all I could do was cry. But people in Afghanistan are very resilient - you face challenges, but you have to get up and move on, and that's what I did. The hospital was run by Italians and it had about 500 employees. After six months my medical needs had all been seen to - I have a spinal cord injury and I can't walk now, I'm in a wheelchair - but since I didn't have anywhere else to go they gave me a bed in the corner of a ward where I lived with the other patients. That was my home. I had to pay for my food and clothes, and take care of myself, so I started a little business repairing the cell phones of the employees - the cleaners, cooks and guards at the hospital. Cell phones had just come to Afghanistan and a lot of people there are illiterate - because of the war they never went to school. They couldn't even read in Farsi and the phones were in English. So they would have simple problems with their phones, I would fix them and they would give me a $2 or $3 tip (Â£2.40), which was a lot of money. Then I figured out a way to make cell phones hold their charge for a day or two longer, and started making money that way. I would also teach the foreigners in the hospital Farsi. We'd bond over time and when they left Afghanistan they would often give me a good amount of money, perhaps $20 (Â£16), which was a lot of money in those days. Dr William, the American doctor through whom I met my mom, left me $600 (Â£480), and there was another doctor who left me 600 euros (Â£507). I was a hustler and I was hitting the jackpot. The head of the hospital had a safe where the money was kept. Whenever I needed it I would go to him and he would give me what I needed, but my businesses were doing well so I never used most of that money. When I came to the US I actually brought $600 (Â£480) of savings with me. Well, I lived in the hospital for seven years, and I went to school and had my little businesses repairing cell phones, but unfortunately in 2007 the hospital abruptly shut down. It became like a ghost town and I was the only living soul in it. I had to figure out a way of taking care of myself again. One day I was sitting in the hospital and one of the guards came to me and said there was a blue-eyed woman looking for me. I thought that was pretty strange, I'd never met a blue-eyed woman. So I came down and there she was, Maria Pia Sanchez. She was a nurse, a friend of Dr William, and very nice. Whenever she came to Afghanistan for work she would come to visit me and eventually she said she would like to give me a home in the US. In 2009, at the age of 12, I came to the US to receive medical treatment to straighten my spine. I had more than 12 operations, I lost so much blood, it wasn't good. I tell people that I have died three times and come back to life - one was when I had my accident, one was when my father left me, and the third time was when I had this surgery. But now I'm doing very well, my back is straight and thankfully I don't have pain any more. The doctors said that if I had stayed in Afghanistan my life expectancy would have been 18. Now I'm 20, so I'm definitely making progress. But it was scary coming to the US, it was like going to a new planet. Going to school with girls was very challenging because in Afghanistan my teacher and classmates had all been male. I now had a female teacher and my principal was female. Eight of my classmates were girls and they would come to school in shorts - that's kind of considered being naked in Afghanistan. So it was hard to get used to, it was a culture shock. And my teachers would get so mad when they talked to me because I would look down - that's very respectful in Afghanistan. They'd say, ""Look me in the eye when I talk to you!"" There were a lot of cultural misunderstandings. It was emotionally hard for me too, because I was feeling that I wasn't as smart as I'd been in Afghanistan. I was the top of my class there, but now I was new and although I could speak and write English my grammar and spelling were bad. I would feel really depressed that I was not good compared to all my classmates. But eventually I did learn and did very well. I'm very creative and always try to solve problems, so when I heard about this school called NuVu - a STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) school founded by MIT students - I really wanted to go there. I went to meet the head of the school and I said, ""This is exactly where I want to be, I want to come here!"" But then I learned that you had to actually pay. I told them, ""I don't have money, I really want to come here, but I don't have money."" I think I was the first student that they gave a scholarship to. I went there in 2014 for about two years and learned a lot about engineering. Listen to Mohammad Sayedspeaking to Outlook on the BBC World Service Get the Outlook podcastfor more extraordinary real-life stories I would look all over the internet to buy stuff for my wheelchair. A lot of companies make products for wheelchair users but they're not in wheelchairs themselves, so they over engineer them and then sell them for such a high price that most people can't afford them. So I started designing my own invention that would allow me to have a cup-holder, a tripod to hold my camera, a canopy to keep the sun and rain off, and all of these different attachments that I wanted for my wheelchair - I called it the Key 2 Freedom. It's 3D printable, magnetised, customisable and everything is controlled by the user. This is important because most companies make products that attach to the back of a wheelchair and which can't be controlled by the user. Somehow the White House heard about it and I was invited to the 2015 White House Science Fair and presented to President Obama. I got a lot of publicity. It turns out that not many similar products exist, so I decided I wanted to actually start a company that developed these products and take them to market. Several of my inventions are now patent pending. During that period my mom took me to Boston Comic Con where they have superheroes and all these different comic characters - Spider Man, Iron Man - but no superheroes that represent the wheelchair community. I thought: ""This is the greatest country, how is it possible that they have no wheelchair superhero?"" This video can not be played Listen: The moment I decided to create a wheelchair superhero Well, I wasn't going to wait for Marvel to do it. I want to celebrate the powers and abilities that wheelchair users have, so I started to create a superhero calledWheelchair Man,externalbased on my own real-life story. I write the stories and then I have an artist, Arielle Epstein, who is very talented, draw the images. Wheelchair Man is a teenager, he's an immigrant and he's a Muslim. He's against hatred and he wants to end violence and make this world a better place. One of his main superpowers is that he can make criminals see the consequence of a crime before they have even committed it. My plan is to develop a comic book series to inspire people with disabilities. There will be four other original superheroes - Wheelchair Woman, Wheelchair Girl, Wheelchair Boy and Captain Afghanistan - and all of them will be based on the real lives of wheelchair users from developing countries. Our dream is to also eventually turn all of the stories into video games and movies. I want to motivate people in wheelchairs, especially kids, to not give up on their dreams. Whatever they want to do they'll do it 10 times better than if they had their legs because the pain and struggle that we go through makes us stronger. That's my message, that's Wheelchair Man's message, and that's the message behind all the superheroes that we will create. When I came to the US my father started reaching out to me and I talked to him. He had remarried twice. Unfortunately one of my brothers, Wakil, who had followed in my father's footsteps and joined the ANA, was blown up by the Taliban two years ago. He bled to death on his way to the hospital. My father left the army after that happened. My other brother, Big, and my sister, Zara, are still with my father. I really want to go back there to meet Zara. She was very young and had just learned how to walk when I was hospitalised. Now she's about 15 years old. Every time I try to talk to her on the phone she starts crying and then I start crying. I've asked my father why he left me. I said to him: ""You left me when I needed you the most."" But he was realistic. He said: ""If I had taken you home, you wouldn't be alive today. We didn't have the resources to take care of you, you wouldn't have been able to go to school and this opportunity to come to the US would never have happened."" I think he was right.

Reality Check: Are taxes going up to 1986 levels?,"The claim:Taxes could rise to their highest level as a proportion of national income since 1986-87 by 2019-20. Reality Check verdict:The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts suggest taxes could actually reach that level as soon as 2017-18. That may not happen if changes are made in this week's Budget and it is only a forecast, so unexpected events could prevent it happening. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said in itsGreen Budget,externalthat tax is rising as a share of national income and by 2019-20 is due to reach its highest level since 1986-87. It is important to stress that it is not saying taxes on all individuals or households are going up. The measure it is using is the government's total tax receipts (and the OBR's forecasts of those receipts) as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP), which is the total amount of goods and services produced by the economy. We will examine which taxes have been rising later, but it is true that the total take is expected to rise in the next few years to levels unseen since the mid-1980s. It is in the next financial year, 2017-18, that the OBR expects the big jump in receipts to 36.9% of GDP, which take it above the peaks of 2011-12. Indeed it appears to be that year and not 2019-20 that first takes receipts to 1986-87 levels. But it does not mean that everybody is paying more tax. There have been gradual falls in revenue from income tax, for example, as the amount people have to be earning to pay it has been increasing. The government saidin the Autumn Statement,externalthat the increases in the basic rate threshold in the last parliament had meant four million of the lowest-paid people were not paying it at all. In addition to the taxes included on this chart are fuel duty, which has fallen gradually as successive governments have frozen it, and VAT, which got a boost when the government raised it from 17.5% to 20% at the start of 2011, but has been pretty constant since. The category of tax that has been rising strikingly and is mainly responsible for the increase next year is ""other"". That includes the new dividend tax regime, the increased insurance premium tax and a higher rate of stamp duty land tax for second homes. But all of the forecasts for the coming years are from the OBR and are based on how things stood at the time of the Autumn Statement. All this could change in Wednesday's Budget.

Vauxhall's uncertain road ahead begins,"Carlos Tavares, the man who will determine the future of Vauxhall workers, downplayed the threat to more than 4,000 Vauxhall workers - but he chose his words very carefully. The head of PSA insisted that the new combined company would have an opportunity to set new internal benchmarks for performance. They will allow plants to be compared and improve. Production commitments expire in 2021 for Ellesmere Port and 2025 for Luton. After that it will be every plant for itself in a battle for jobs. The combined company will have 24 factories and everyone at the Geneva motor show agrees that is a few too many. Several senior executives who asked not to be named had the same message. Consolidation is good because it's the best way to take out overcapacity. That has to happen and that means plants will close and jobs will go. In this inevitable fight for survival, the UK starts at a disadvantage according to most executives here. Uncertainty over Brexit and the terms of trade with Europe is one handicap. The fall in sterling is another. Although labour costs have gone down, the price of the 75% of parts for a Vauxhall Astra that come from Europe has gone up. Having said that, Mr Tavares said that in the event of a ""hard"" Brexit, it may be more - not less - important to have manufacturing in the UK. 'Cautious optimism' on Vauxhall deal Why is Vauxhall being sold to Peugeot's owner? The fine print behind the GM deal Andy Palmer, the chief executive of Aston Martin agreed. He told the BBC that for a company like PSA - if there is a tariff wall - having some production on the other side of it could make sense as a measure of insurance against high tariffs and volatile currency moves. For that to work, though, more of the supply chain would need to move to the UK and that takes government help. Over to you, Mr Hammond... When it comes to car manufacturing, governments rarely sit on the sidelines. Car industry jobs seem to have a particular political resonance around the world. As well as Ellesmere Port and Luton competing with more than 20 other plants in Europe, the UK government will be up against some stiff competition from European politicians. The UK government scored an early success by persuading Nissan to increase investment in Sunderland after promising support for skills and training. There was a particular focus on electric cars and battery technology - themes that are red hot in the industry presentations here. What worked with Nissan may be popular with PSA, which lags some of their rivals in electric and self-driving cars. Extra motivation - if any were needed - for the chancellor to play those cards in Wednesday's Budget. I expect he will.

Why young people are less likely to smoke,"All age groups in the UK are smoking less - but the largest decrease is among 18- to 24-year-olds, according to the Office of National Statistics. Why is that? The latest figures, for 2015, suggest one in every five (20.7%) 18- to 24-year-olds is a smoker. In 2010, this figure was one in every four (25.8%). Today, about 70% of 16- to 24-year-olds have never started smoking cigarettes in the first place, the data suggests - up from 46% in 1974, when records began. And even among the age group most likely to smoke, 24- to 35-year-olds, about 60% - up from 35% in 1974 - have never picked up the habit. Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) says: ""We know that young people who try smoking are highly likely to grow up to become smokers, so the high numbers of young people reporting that they have never even tried smoking is good news."" Model Kylie Jenner was called a bad role modelafter she was pictured smoking on Instagram, perhaps an indicator it is no longer seen as cool. The new data suggests 23.3% of 16- to 24-year-olds quit smoking in 2015, compared with 21.4% in 2010 and 13.4% in 1974. Ash says this has been ""achieved through a combination of effective legislation, policy and support for adults to quit over many decades - much of which has had a big impact on youth uptake as well as quitting"". Policy director Hazel Cheeseman says: ""Creating an environment in which fewer young people try smoking and more smokers quit will protect the health of future generations and avoid hundreds and thousands of premature deaths. ""However, the achievements made to date are at risk. ""The government must urgently publish a new tobacco control plan for England and ensure this is properly funded."" In 2015, three out of every 100 16- to 24-year-olds used electronic cigarettes, up from one in every 100 in 2014, the new data suggests. And, in total, 2.3 million people in the UK are using them - half in order to stop smoking. But some are concerned vaping could prove a gateway to smoking for teenagers. Andcritics saythe fruit flavours of some e-cigarettes could make them more appealing to children. In December 2016, theUS Surgeon General saidthe use of e-cigarettes by children was ""a major public health concern"". But Ash says the latest figures ""confirm that most users are smokers or ex-smokers"". ""The figures also highlight that most users are seeking to improve their health, with the most common reason for use being as an aid to quit smoking,"" it says. ""Where smokers make a complete switch, they can expect to significantly reduce their exposure to harmful chemicals which cause cancer and other smoking-related illnesses."" Paul Hunt, managing director of e-cigarette manufacturerV2Cigs.co.uk,external, said: ""E-cigarettes are supporting thousands of people in quitting smoking every day. ""Information from the NHS states that people who use e-cigarettes to quit smoking can expect similar or better results than when using other nicotine replacement therapies."" ""Of those people who combined NHS stop smoking support with e-cigarettes, two out of three were successful in quitting."" ""As they eliminate chemicals found in regular cigarettes, such as tar, and allow people control over the amount of nicotine they're consuming, e-cigarettes are a great tool in overcoming smoking addiction.""

Ex-football coach faces abuse charges,"Former football coach Barry Bennell has been charged with eight more counts of historical child sexual abuse. The 63-year-old ex-youth coach at Crewe Alexandra faces allegations relating to two boys between 1980 and 1987. The Crown Prosecution Service said the charges followed an investigation by Cheshire Police. Mr Bennell, who also had links to Manchester City and Stoke City, will appear at South Cheshire Magistrates' Court on 13 March. He is accused of two counts of indecent assault on a boy aged under 14, indecent assault on a boy aged under 16, and five other offences. Mr Bennell previously appeared in court in January charged with eight separate offences of sexual assault against a boy aged under 16, between 1981 and 1986.

The Swedish Trump fans who secretly record journalists,"It's a website that describes itself as a citizens' initiative set up to ask the questions the mainstream media won't. Its critics say it's a ""far-right trolling factory"" whose sole purpose is to harass and intimidate. ""Granskning Sverige"" roughly translates as ""Examining Sweden"". The site encourages volunteers to call journalists with a list of questions about their news coverage. ""I would say that the basic theme is xenophobic, they don't like immigrants,"" says Mathias Stahle, an investigative journalist for the Eskilstuna-Kuriren newspaper. ""They would like to read more positive things about Donald Trump, they would like to see positive stories about modern Russia and they want to have positive views of neo-Nazis."" Unbeknownst to the journalists being called, the conversations are recorded, edited and posted online on the website as well as the YouTube page of Erik Johansson, the administrator of the website. One example of such a conversation was with Eva Burman - a colleague of Mathias Stahle's and Eskilstuna-Kuriren's editor-in-chief. The caller introduced himself as ""Janne"", and asked her why a story about an attack on a security guard didn't mention that a foreigner was allegedly behind the assault. ""The truth has to get out there,"" the caller says, according to anextract of the conversation,externalpublished on the newspaper website. ""Janne"" blames Moroccan street children for the attack, although police are certain it was a local gang of youths. As the caller continues to make his case, Burman gets frustrated until she eventually snaps: ""That is called racism."" The conversation - which lasted more than 20 minutes - was edited down to three minutes, and published on YouTube with the headline ""Editor in chief calls citizen racist"". Conversations with journalists are secretly recorded and published online by Granskning Sverige After hearing of Swedish journalists targeted by the callers, Stahle went undercover. He created a fake social media profile and signed up to several right-wing forums. He then contacted Granskning Sverige to offer his services as volunteer to call and record conversations with journalists. He tells Trending that the offer was accepted almost immediately and he was told he could make money out of it - around $100 for every edited call that got over 3,000 hits online. He says he was told that he needed to keep his identity secret and that any phone calls were to be edited to make them sound dramatic before being uploaded. Hear this story in fullon the BBC World Service, ordownload our podcast BBC Trending approached Granskning Sverige administrators and received a reply from Erik Johansson who directed us towards a recording of an interview he had done with Stahle. In the interview, Johansson - which is an alias - insisted that what he does is no different from the secret recording techniques used by traditional journalists when a direct approach for an interview has failed. One obvious difference though is that traditional journalistic ethics - like those practised by the BBC - usually require that the person who's been recorded is given a chance to reply before anything is published. Johansson says that he's doing nothing wrong and that he's simply trying to persuade the media and others to present a more balanced picture of modern Sweden. Mathias Stahle, though, isn't convinced. ""I find what they do appalling,"" he says, ""because they so obviously have a political agenda of their own which they want to communicate to the rest of the world by making these fake interviews."" And it's not just journalists who are being cold-called by the website. Martin Kragh, head of the Russia and Eurasia Programme at the Swedish Institute of International Affairs published a report in January alleging that Russia was involved in a misinformation campaign aimed at influencing Sweden's relationship with Nato. The paper was well received amongst other academics and tallies with the views of many western security experts but there was also a furious backlash from people claiming he was the one spreading disinformation. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external ""For the last six weeks I've been harassed and threatened,"" Martin Kragh says. ""There has been a cyber attack and also a spread of disinformation. If you Google my name you find a lot of terrible things they've written about me."" In the days after the report came out Martin says he was bombarded by calls. ""This is a person who calls, he won't reveal his name, he will call you repeatedly using secret phone numbers and then he edits the phone calls himself in a way that you have no control over."" Martin says. ""He will also call colleagues of yours, to ask questions to get personal information. ""This is in no way normal journalistic behaviour."" In his interview with Mathias, Erik Johansson denies that his website aims to intimidate people. He says that he believes he is performing an important service by providing an alternative view to that put forward by ""mainstream media"". But he can no longer do so from behind a cloak of anonymity.

Vauxhall's fight for survival begins,"Carlos Tavares, the man who will determine the future of Vauxhall workers, downplayed the threat to more than 4,000 Vauxhall workers - but he chose his words very carefully. The head of PSA insisted that the new combined company would have an opportunity to set new internal benchmarks for performance. They will allow plants to be compared and improve. Production commitments expire in 2021 for Ellesmere Port and 2025 for Luton. After that it will be every plant for itself in a battle for jobs. The combined company will have 24 factories and everyone at the Geneva motor show agrees that is a few too many. Several senior executives who asked not to be named had the same message. Consolidation is good because it's the best way to take out overcapacity. That has to happen and that means plants will close and jobs will go. In this inevitable fight for survival, the UK starts at a disadvantage according to most executives here. Uncertainty over Brexit and the terms of trade with Europe is one handicap. The fall in sterling is another. Although labour costs have gone down, the price of the 75% of parts for a Vauxhall Astra that come from Europe has gone up. Having said that, Mr Tavares said that in the event of a ""hard"" Brexit, it may be more - not less - important to have manufacturing in the UK. 'Cautious optimism' on Vauxhall deal Why is Vauxhall being sold to Peugeot's owner? The fine print behind the GM deal Andy Palmer, the chief executive of Aston Martin agreed. He told the BBC that for a company like PSA - if there is a tariff wall - having some production on the other side of it could make sense as a measure of insurance against high tariffs and volatile currency moves. For that to work, though, more of the supply chain would need to move to the UK and that takes government help. Over to you, Mr Hammond... When it comes to car manufacturing, governments rarely sit on the sidelines. Car industry jobs seem to have a particular political resonance around the world. As well as Ellesmere Port and Luton competing with more than 20 other plants in Europe, the UK government will be up against some stiff competition from European politicians. The UK government scored an early success by persuading Nissan to increase investment in Sunderland after promising support for skills and training. There was a particular focus on electric cars and battery technology - themes that are red hot in the industry presentations here. What worked with Nissan may be popular with PSA, which lags some of their rivals in electric and self-driving cars. Extra motivation - if any were needed - for the chancellor to play those cards in Wednesday's Budget. I expect he will.
