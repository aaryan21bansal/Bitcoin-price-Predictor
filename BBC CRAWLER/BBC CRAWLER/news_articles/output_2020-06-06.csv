Thousands turn out for UK anti-racism protests,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in UK cities on Saturday - in London, missiles were thrown and a police horse bolted Thousands of people have joined anti-racism demonstrations across the UK. The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US, were held in cities including London,Manchester,Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. In London, protesters knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter"". The majority of the day's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Police horses were used to regain control, but one horse galloped ahead and its rider fell to the ground after hitting her head on a traffic light. Her injuries are not life-threatening, the Metropolitan Police said. Fourteen people were arrested and 14 officers were injured after a smaller group became ""angry and intent on violence"", the force added. A police officer being tended to after she fell off her horse The Metropolitan Police said 14 arrests were made in London But demonstrations were largely peaceful In a tweet,external, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the protesters ""I stand with you and I share your anger and your pain"" and said the small minority of people who became violent ""let down this important cause"". The protests went ahead despite officials advising against mass gatherings due to coronavirus. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the social distancing advice was ""for the safety of all of us"", while Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the protests were ""unlawful"". Are you allowed to protest during lockdown? Thousands attend George Floyd protests in Manchester Why the US protests resonate in the UK Thousands of people gathered in the capital, the majority donning face coverings and many with gloves. Some held signs made reference to coronavirus, including one which read: ""There is a virus greater than Covid-19 and it's called racism"". Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland,police said they had issued ""a significant number"" of finesgiven the dangers of crowds in the pandemic and organisers would now be reported to the Public Prosecution Service with a view to prosecution. Protests began in the US after a video emerged of Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, being arrested by four officers on 25 May in Minneapolis. Videos showed Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, dying after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The footage - seen all around the world - showed himgasping that he could not breathe. An officer has been charged with murder while three of his colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting the killing. In Cardiff, protesters held up placards saying ""my life matters"" and ""I can't breathe"" Boxer Anthony Joshua joined protesters in Watford, Hertfordshire At a protest in his hometown of Watford, Britain's world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua told the crowds: ""We can no longer sit back and remain silent on this senseless, unlawful killing and sly racism on another human being."" In central London, protesters dropped to one knee and raised their fists in the air outside the US embassy amid chants of ""silence is violence"" and ""colour is not a crime"". Sarah Law, 27, said: ""I don't want my future children to experience what I have. It's time for us all to unite together regardless of our race and stand up for what is right."" O'Neall Rawle, a 27-year-old teacher from Leicester, said he was protesting because he was ""exhausted of being treated as a second class citizen"" and ""to hopefully spark some change"". Meanwhile, in Glasgow,anti-racism campaigners renamed streets that have links to the slave trade, replacing street signs with the names of enslaved Africans, black activists and victims of police brutality. Demonstrations are scheduled in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen on Sunday. Protesters in London marched towards the US embassy in Vauxhall Campaigners in Leicester knelt with their fists in the air People left flowers and placards at a mural of George Floyd in Manchester In Manchesterabout 15,000 protesters gathered at Piccadilly Gardensin the city centre, clapping in unison and holding placards bearing the initials BLM. Elsewhere, several hundred people marched in Newcastle, while many more took part in an online protest organised in the north-east of England. More protests took place across Europe on Saturday and huge rallies are taking place inmajor cities across the US. 'When one is hurt, we're all hurt' How black Britons reacted to George Floyd's death What does white privilege mean? How many black people die in police custody? Coronavirus regulations for England don't specifically mention protests but do restrict ""public gatherings"" to no more than six people - that would make large protests illegal. Police officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices (starting at Â£100) to people who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence. Whether they do this in practice is another matter and policing large protests during the coronavirus pandemic presents a challenge. Dame Cressida has said officers will ""seek to uphold the law"" but will have to make a ""case-by-case"" decision on what to do. She told the London Assembly on 3 June that if they had tried to enforce a mass dispersal at last weekend's protests, ""we would probably have ended up with very serious disorder"".

Thousands protest against racism in US capital,"This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Huge peaceful rallies have taken place across the US against racism and police brutality on the 12th day of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. Tens of thousands of people marched in Washington DC, in the city's largest protest so far. Security forces blocked any approach to the White House. Crowds also demonstrated in New York, Chicago, LA and San Francisco. Meanwhile, people paid their respects to Mr Floyd in North Carolina, where he was born, before a memorial service. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Video showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Officer Derek Chauvin has been dismissed and charged with murder. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. In pictures: Protests in US and around the world Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Large anti-racism protests also took place in a number of other countries. In the UK,Parliament Square in central London was filled with peopledespite calls by the government to avoid mass gatherings for fear of spreading the coronavirus. In Australia, there were major protests in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany and Spain. The largest appeared to be in Washington DC, where protesters - many of them carrying placards saying ""Black Lives Matter"" - gathered peacefully near the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and outside Lafayette Park, next to the White House, at the newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza. Mayor Muriel Bowser welcomed people, saying the crowds had sent a message to President Donald Trump. On Monday, federal law enforcement officers fired tear gas to clear a protest in the area ahead of a visit to a church by the president. Demonstrators in Washington DC said they would not stop pushing for change ""If he can take over Washington DC, he can come for any state, and none of us will be safe,"" she said. ""Our soldiers should not be treated that way, they should not be asked to move on American citizens."" Ms Bowser has requested the withdrawal of all federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops from the city, saying their presence is ""unnecessary"". One 35-year-old protester, Eric Wood, told the BBC: ""I'm here because I really couldn't afford not to be here. Racism has long been a part of the US."" Crystal Ballinger, 46, said she felt hopeful about the movement this time. ""I feel something different about this protest...  I'm hopeful that the message of solidarity and equality is getting out."" In San Francisco, demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge Many of the city curfews imposed after initial unrest have now been lifted. With restrictions eased, arrests have plummeted. However, late on Saturday police in Portland, Oregon, declared an ""unlawful assembly and civil disturbance"" after projectiles were thrown at officers near the Justice Center. Fifty arrests had been made by the early hours. Seattle police also said projectiles had been thrown and several officers were hurt by ""improvised explosives"". Earlier in New York, crowds crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, while in San Francisco demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge. In Chicago, about 30,000 people rallied in Union Park, and a Hollywood intersection was blocked by protesters in Los Angeles. And in Richmond, Virginia, a statue of a Confederate general was pulled down from its pedestal. There were also protests in Atlanta and Philadelphia, where crowds chanted, ""We need justice, we need love"". In Chicago, some protesters waved US flags turned upside down Meanwhile, the top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer resigned after publishing a headline that equated property damage to the deaths of black people, which prompted public condemnation from many of the newspaper's staff. Stan Wischnowski apologised for what he described as a ""horribly wrong"" decision to use the headline ""Buildings Matter Too"" on an article about civil unrest in the US. In Buffalo,two policemen were charged with second-degree assaultafter they were filmed pushing a 75-year old protester to the ground, seriously injuring him. In his overnight tweets, President Trump thanked the police, Secret Service and National Guard for doing a ""fantastic job"" and said that the Washington crowd was ""much smaller than anticipated. By Helier Cheung, BBC News, Washington DC The crowd was diverse - with people of different ethnicities, and families with children - and there was an upbeat, if determined, mood. Music was being played and food, water and hand sanitiser handed out, as protesters chanted ""George Floyd"", ""Breonna Taylor"" - who was shot by police in March - and ""No justice, no peace"". The protest's movements appeared quite spontaneous. At one point, demonstrators did an impromptu march, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue before looping back towards the White House. At another, the entire street of demonstrators dropped on one knee at the same time, in a mark of solidarity. Sisters Sarina Lecroy, 20, and Grace, 16, said they were protesting for the first time, and that they believed the extent of the public outrage and the nationwide nature of these protests could lead to police reforms. ""We're just getting started this time, but it [the movement] does feel much more collective than in the past,"" said Sarina. Many placards also reflected the growing debate about how white people should help the cause. One placard held by a demonstrator read: ""I may never understand, but I will stand with you."" Sarina and Grace Lecroy were among the crowd at Lafayette Park, near the White House On social media and on the streets, those in support of the movement have called on elected officials to address longstanding systemic racism and inequalities, from police brutality to mass incarceration to healthcare. Black Americans are jailed at five times the rate of white Americans and sentenced for drug offences six times more, often despite equal rates of drug use, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality Black mothers die in childbirth at over twice the rate of white mothers, according to national health data. Decades of government-sanctioned segregation have also seen inequalities across school systems, housing and other public resources. A 2019 Pew Research Center study found more than eight in 10 black adults say the legacy of slavery still affects black Americans' position today. Half say it is unlikely America will ever see true racial equality. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? Hundreds of people paid their respects to Mr Floyd in Raeford, North Carolina, laying flowers at a public viewing of his body in a church near where he was born. In North Carolina, George Floyd's family held a public viewing and a memorial service A private memorial service was then held for members of his family. Governor Roy Cooper ordered that flags be flown at half-mast from sunrise to sunset on Saturday in Mr Floyd's honour. Mr Floyd's funeral is due to take place on Tuesday in Houston, where he lived before moving to Minneapolis. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

William reveals he is secret helpline volunteerThe second in line to the throne has been secretly answering text messages from people needing help.,"This video can not be played Prince William revealed he was answering messages during a video call with volunteers in May The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he has been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. He has been volunteering at Shout 85258, which offers support via text message to people in personal crisis. Prince William said he had been answering messages after being trained by the mental health charity. Last month he told fellow volunteers in a video call: ""I'm going to share a little secret with you guys, but I'm actually on the platform volunteering."" Those texting the round-the-clock service would not know they are talking to a member of the Royal Family - like Shout's 2,000 volunteers, William would use a pseudonym on the platform. Kensington Palace announced the prince's involvement to mark Volunteers Week, which ends on Sunday. A new photograph of the duke with Prince George and Princess Charlotte volunteering on the Sandringham Estate, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, has also been released. The Queen has praised the work of volunteers in a special message, saying: ""As Volunteers' Week draws to a close, it is inspiring to reflect on the many thousands of people, who through their acts of generosity and kindness, have achieved so much for the greater good. ""I have been following with interest how men and women from around the world, including my own family, have been helping and recognising the vital role of the volunteer. ""I send my best wishes to all those who give themselves so freely and selflessly in the service of others."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Cambridges and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex helped to launch Shout 85258 last year - investing Â£3m in the service via their Royal Foundation. In a little over a year since then, more than 300,000 text conversations have been had on the service. Around 65% of those texting are aged under 25, the charity said, with many messengers seeking mental health support. By BBC journalist and Shout volunteer Tony Smith Training as a crisis volunteer at Shout puts William in the frontline of services for young people in distress - and it's a tough role. CVs, as they're known, undertake special training to support those in crisis. On the Shout platform they'll encounter, and be tasked with helping, those in very real distress. Some texters are experiencing depression or panic attacks, others are self-harming. A large proportion say they feel suicidal. The job of the CV is to lead that texter to a cool, calm place where they may begin to establish solutions. Sometimes they'll just need to build resilience, with support from friends or family. In others, they'll be guided toward charities or NHS mental health support. It's not unusual for a texter to be about to take his or her own life. This can lead to what Shout call an 'Active Rescue' - the CV will continue gently talking to the texter while the emergency services are called in by a supervisor. Whether it be talking someone down from a bridge, or persuading them to put away that bottle of pills, these conversations can be gruelling and rewarding in equal measure. The fact that the second in line to the throne is now routinely helping people in such desperate situations is hugely significant - it gives Prince William a unique perspective on what young people in crisis may be going through. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester have been calling people who are self-isolating or vulnerable, as part of the Royal Voluntary Service's NHS Volunteer Responders scheme. The Countess of Wessex has also been privately volunteering to support efforts in local communities, including once a week with Mealforce and Helpforce, helping to provide daily meals for NHS workers across London. More than 750,000 peoplesigned up to be part of the scheme's ""volunteer army"" after it launched in April, but some laterexpressed frustration at not having been used. William fears NHS staff's struggle with 'hero' tag Kate launches virus portraits photography project Royal Family thanks world's nurses in video calls Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge thanked others who had signed up to help the scheme, calling them ""the backbone of our country"". She and Prince William marked Volunteers Week by holding video calls with those helping charities in England and Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and volunteers at Conscious Youth during a video call Among them were those working at Conscious Youth, which helps young people from mainly black and other ethnic minority backgrounds in West Yorkshire. During the call, Prince William joked about home-schooling his six-year-old son Prince George, saying: ""I struggle with Year 2 maths."" The royal couple also spoke to a group of neighbours in mid-Wales who have been offering help with shopping, cooking and deliveries during lockdown. The prince told the 120 volunteers they had offered ""a lifeline"" to people in their community.

Large crowds were also expected in the US capital Washington DC.Follow our coverage here. Also on Saturday: Millions of people have been turning to the Johns Hopkins University dashboard to check the latest coronavirus figures. So how do they put their figures together?French newspaper Le Monde, which has been looking into it,,externalreports the figures are collected automatically from various sources: official agencies, media, local communities, etc. Depending on the country, JHU collects data at the level of provinces (as in China), counties (in the United States) or cities (in Australia or Canada). On some days, the site records more than one billion visits, Le Monde reports. ""It was a shock,"" Lauren Gardner, associate professor at JHU's department of civil engineering, is quoted as saying. ""We realised that people needed objective information during this period and that it was important to make it public."" The figures sometimes vary from that given by other official sources, but ""the trend is the same"", say JHU officials. They also recognise the difficulty of comparing figures and establishing a ranking when countries do not collect data in the same way. (And by the way, Johns is indeed spelt with an ""s"" asit is a family surname,external.) The oil exporters' group, Opec, has reportedly agreed to extend record cuts in production for a further month. A deal reached in April between Opec members and other oil producers, including Russia, was due to expire at the end of June. The aim of the cuts was to keep oil prices high, despite lower demand due to coronavirus lockdowns. The UAE's energy minister, Suhail al-Mazrouei, wrote on Twitter that the ""Opec +"" countries had agreed unanimously to extend the current reduction until the end of July. Allow Twitter content?

Current trading laws limit stores over a certain size to opening for a maximum of six hours. Paddy Lillis, Usdaw general secretary, said he appreciated ""the desire to help the retail sector"" but stressed there was ""no economic case"" for changing current laws. ""Opening for longer will increase overheads, but not necessarily take any more cash through the tills,"" he said, in a statement. ""The fact is, that customers will not have more to spend just because the shops are open for longer."" Mr Lillis urged the government to reject the deregulation of trading hours and instead support the retail industry via tax breaks and helping local councils to redevelop city centres.

The letter was signed by 1,288 professionals in the field.

Dutch mink farms have begun a government-ordered cull after 10 farms were found to have animals infected with coronavirus, says the countryâs Food & Wares Authority. There are concerns infected mink, who are bred at the farms for their fur, could transmit the illness to humans. âAll mink breeding farms where there is an infection will be cleared, and farms where there are no infections wonât be,â said spokeswoman Frederique Hermie. The government ordered the cull of 10,000 mink on Wednesday after determining that affected farms could act as a long-term reservoir of disease. Churchgoers should wear face coverings and may have to book places at Mass when churches reopen, Scotland's Catholic Bishops have said. The Bishop's Conference of Scotland has sent the country's 600 priests guidance about the resumption of public worship. In line with the Scottish government's ""route map"" for easing lockdown, the guidance stresses that Mass can resume only once the country enters phase three. Priests have been encouraged to start preparations to allow churches to safely reopen with social distancing. The guidance recommends that services should be held on both Saturdays and Sundays to allow more people to attend, but stresses that churches should only open if there are enough trained volunteers and PPE available. Further guidance includes requiring all churchgoers and clergy to wear face coverings and use hand sanitiser when entering and leaving. In terms of the service itself, communion wafers should be placed in a person's hand, rather than their mouth, hymns may be omitted and ""sermons should be brief"".  People flocked to the terraces of Paris's restaurants, cafes and bistros earlier in the week There was a welcome return to familiar haunts for many Parisians on Saturday as they enjoyed their first weekend sitting among the many cafes and restaurants of the French capital.

The Grand Slam tournament is scheduled to start on 31 August in New York. Djokovic, the men's world number one, said he had discussed the  event's future with organisers. ""The rules they told us that we would have to respect to be there, to play at all, they are extreme,"" said the Serb. ""We would not have access to Manhattan, we would have to sleep in hotels at the airport, to be tested twice or three times per week.

So how do they put their figures together?French newspaper Le Monde, which has been looking into it,,externalreports the figures are collected automatically from various sources: official agencies, media, local communities, etc. Depending on the country, JHU collects data at the level of provinces (as in China), counties (in the United States) or cities (in Australia or Canada). On some days, the site records more than one billion visits, Le Monde reports. ""It was a shock,"" Lauren Gardner, associate professor at JHU's department of civil engineering, is quoted as saying. ""We realised that people needed objective information during this period and that it was important to make it public."" The figures sometimes vary from that given by other official sources, but ""the trend is the same"", say JHU officials. They also recognise the difficulty of comparing figures and establishing a ranking when countries do not collect data in the same way.

The UAE's energy minister, Suhail al-Mazrouei, wrote on Twitter that the ""Opec +"" countries had agreed unanimously to extend the current reduction until the end of July. Allow Twitter content?

""The fact is, that customers will not have more to spend just because the shops are open for longer.""

The letter was signed by 1,288 professionals in the field.

William reveals he is secret helpline volunteerThe second in line to the throne has been secretly answering text messages from people needing help.UK,"This video can not be played Prince William revealed he was answering messages during a video call with volunteers in May The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he has been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. He has been volunteering at Shout 85258, which offers support via text message to people in personal crisis. Prince William said he had been answering messages after being trained by the mental health charity. Last month he told fellow volunteers in a video call: ""I'm going to share a little secret with you guys, but I'm actually on the platform volunteering."" Those texting the round-the-clock service would not know they are talking to a member of the Royal Family - like Shout's 2,000 volunteers, William would use a pseudonym on the platform. Kensington Palace announced the prince's involvement to mark Volunteers Week, which ends on Sunday. A new photograph of the duke with Prince George and Princess Charlotte volunteering on the Sandringham Estate, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, has also been released. The Queen has praised the work of volunteers in a special message, saying: ""As Volunteers' Week draws to a close, it is inspiring to reflect on the many thousands of people, who through their acts of generosity and kindness, have achieved so much for the greater good. ""I have been following with interest how men and women from around the world, including my own family, have been helping and recognising the vital role of the volunteer. ""I send my best wishes to all those who give themselves so freely and selflessly in the service of others."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some texters are experiencing depression or panic attacks, others are self-harming. A large proportion say they feel suicidal. The job of the CV is to lead that texter to a cool, calm place where they may begin to establish solutions. Sometimes they'll just need to build resilience, with support from friends or family. In others, they'll be guided toward charities or NHS mental health support. It's not unusual for a texter to be about to take his or her own life. This can lead to what Shout call an 'Active Rescue' - the CV will continue gently talking to the texter while the emergency services are called in by a supervisor. Whether it be talking someone down from a bridge, or persuading them to put away that bottle of pills, these conversations can be gruelling and rewarding in equal measure. The fact that the second in line to the throne is now routinely helping people in such desperate situations is hugely significant - it gives Prince William a unique perspective on what young people in crisis may be going through. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester have been calling people who are self-isolating or vulnerable, as part of the Royal Voluntary Service's NHS Volunteer Responders scheme. The Countess of Wessex has also been privately volunteering to support efforts in local communities, including once a week with Mealforce and Helpforce, helping to provide daily meals for NHS workers across London. More than 750,000 peoplesigned up to be part of the scheme's ""volunteer army"" after it launched in April, but some laterexpressed frustration at not having been used. William fears NHS staff's struggle with 'hero' tag Kate launches virus portraits photography project Royal Family thanks world's nurses in video calls Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge thanked others who had signed up to help the scheme, calling them ""the backbone of our country"". She and Prince William marked Volunteers Week by holding video calls with those helping charities in England and Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and volunteers at Conscious Youth during a video call Among them were those working at Conscious Youth, which helps young people from mainly black and other ethnic minority backgrounds in West Yorkshire. During the call, Prince William joked about home-schooling his six-year-old son Prince George, saying: ""I struggle with Year 2 maths."" The royal couple also spoke to a group of neighbours in mid-Wales who have been offering help with shopping, cooking and deliveries during lockdown. The prince told the 120 volunteers they had offered ""a lifeline"" to people in their community.

3 minutes ago,"This video can not be played ""Keep pushing"": Washington DC protesters on keeping the momentum going Huge peaceful rallies have taken place across the US against racism and police brutality on the 12th day of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. Tens of thousands of people marched in Washington DC, in the city's largest protest so far. Security forces blocked any approach to the White House. Crowds also demonstrated in New York, Chicago, LA and San Francisco. Meanwhile, people paid their respects to Mr Floyd in North Carolina, where he was born, before a memorial service. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Video showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Officer Derek Chauvin has been dismissed and charged with murder. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. In pictures: Protests in US and around the world Why I decided not to watch Floyd's video Timeline: From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology Large anti-racism protests also took place in a number of other countries. In the UK,Parliament Square in central London was filled with peopledespite calls by the government to avoid mass gatherings for fear of spreading the coronavirus. In Australia, there were major protests in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany and Spain. The largest appeared to be in Washington DC, where protesters - many of them carrying placards saying ""Black Lives Matter"" - gathered peacefully near the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and outside Lafayette Park, next to the White House, at the newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza. Mayor Muriel Bowser welcomed people, saying the crowds had sent a message to President Donald Trump. On Monday, federal law enforcement officers fired tear gas to clear a protest in the area ahead of a visit to a church by the president. Demonstrators in Washington DC said they would not stop pushing for change ""If he can take over Washington DC, he can come for any state, and none of us will be safe,"" she said. ""Our soldiers should not be treated that way, they should not be asked to move on American citizens."" Ms Bowser has requested the withdrawal of all federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops from the city, saying their presence is ""unnecessary"". One 35-year-old protester, Eric Wood, told the BBC: ""I'm here because I really couldn't afford not to be here. Racism has long been a part of the US."" Crystal Ballinger, 46, said she felt hopeful about the movement this time. ""I feel something different about this protest...  I'm hopeful that the message of solidarity and equality is getting out."" In San Francisco, demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge Many of the city curfews imposed after initial unrest have now been lifted. With restrictions eased, arrests have plummeted. However, late on Saturday police in Portland, Oregon, declared an ""unlawful assembly and civil disturbance"" after projectiles were thrown at officers near the Justice Center. Fifty arrests had been made by the early hours. Seattle police also said projectiles had been thrown and several officers were hurt by ""improvised explosives"". Earlier in New York, crowds crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, while in San Francisco demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge. In Chicago, about 30,000 people rallied in Union Park, and a Hollywood intersection was blocked by protesters in Los Angeles. And in Richmond, Virginia, a statue of a Confederate general was pulled down from its pedestal. There were also protests in Atlanta and Philadelphia, where crowds chanted, ""We need justice, we need love"". In Chicago, some protesters waved US flags turned upside down Meanwhile, the top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer resigned after publishing a headline that equated property damage to the deaths of black people, which prompted public condemnation from many of the newspaper's staff. Stan Wischnowski apologised for what he described as a ""horribly wrong"" decision to use the headline ""Buildings Matter Too"" on an article about civil unrest in the US. In Buffalo,two policemen were charged with second-degree assaultafter they were filmed pushing a 75-year old protester to the ground, seriously injuring him. In his overnight tweets, President Trump thanked the police, Secret Service and National Guard for doing a ""fantastic job"" and said that the Washington crowd was ""much smaller than anticipated. By Helier Cheung, BBC News, Washington DC The crowd was diverse - with people of different ethnicities, and families with children - and there was an upbeat, if determined, mood. Music was being played and food, water and hand sanitiser handed out, as protesters chanted ""George Floyd"", ""Breonna Taylor"" - who was shot by police in March - and ""No justice, no peace"". The protest's movements appeared quite spontaneous. At one point, demonstrators did an impromptu march, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue before looping back towards the White House. At another, the entire street of demonstrators dropped on one knee at the same time, in a mark of solidarity. Sisters Sarina Lecroy, 20, and Grace, 16, said they were protesting for the first time, and that they believed the extent of the public outrage and the nationwide nature of these protests could lead to police reforms. ""We're just getting started this time, but it [the movement] does feel much more collective than in the past,"" said Sarina. Many placards also reflected the growing debate about how white people should help the cause. One placard held by a demonstrator read: ""I may never understand, but I will stand with you."" Sarina and Grace Lecroy were among the crowd at Lafayette Park, near the White House On social media and on the streets, those in support of the movement have called on elected officials to address longstanding systemic racism and inequalities, from police brutality to mass incarceration to healthcare. Black Americans are jailed at five times the rate of white Americans and sentenced for drug offences six times more, often despite equal rates of drug use, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). This video can not be played The US's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality Black mothers die in childbirth at over twice the rate of white mothers, according to national health data. Decades of government-sanctioned segregation have also seen inequalities across school systems, housing and other public resources. A 2019 Pew Research Center study found more than eight in 10 black adults say the legacy of slavery still affects black Americans' position today. Half say it is unlikely America will ever see true racial equality.

'We were wrong': NFL to allow players' protest,"Colin Kaepernick (centre) and two other players kneel during the national anthem in 2016 The National Football League has said players should be allowed to protest during the national anthem as rallies against racial discrimination continue. ""We were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. The NFL had previously banned players from dropping to one knee, a practice started by Colin Kaepernick in 2016. Meanwhile, a large protest is expected in Washington DC on Saturday. The demonstration is the latest in a series against police brutality and racism that have been held across the US following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man in handcuffs, died after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer has been charged with murder while three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. On Friday, Minneapolis officials said police would be banned from using neck restraints and California pledged to follow suit. From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology - timeline of a U-turn 'Pandemic of racism' led to Floyd's death, memorial told DC mayor names plaza 'Black Lives Matter' Biden: Trump 'despicable' for invoking Floyd In a video,Mr Goodell denounced racism in the US,externalin comments that came shortly aftera number of players urged the NFL to take a stronger stance on racism and police brutality in the country. This video can not be played ""I remember George Floyd as me"" ""We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.

There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!"" He criticised New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees fordropping his opposition to NFL kneeling protests. Breesresponded on Saturday,externalby saying: ""We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial & prison reform."" VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? The practice of kneeling during the customary pre-game playing of the national anthem was started by black player Colin Kaepernick in 2016 in protest against racial injustice. A number of other players soon joined Kaepernick, who was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers at the time. He became a free agent after the 2016 season and remains unsigned. Kaepernickfiled a grievance against NFL ownersin October 2017, believing they were conspiring not to hire him because of his kneeling protests. The two sidesresolved the grievancein February under a confidentiality agreement. On Friday, the Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed to ban police neck restraints and chokeholds. The new policy, which will be enforceable in court, requires any officer regardless of rank to verbally and physically intervene if they witness a colleague using such unauthorised force. Meanwhile, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said he would move to end state police training in the use of the ""carotid restraint"". San Diego police banned the technique this week. Officials in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles have all previously taken steps to ban or limit the use of chokeholds by members of their police departments. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Denver has ordered police to stop the use of tear gas, plastic bullets and other non-lethal force on peaceful protesters. The order came after four protesters filed a lawsuit against aggressive police action.

"Want to sell a home? Make the garden look niceProperty buyers and renters are on the search for outdoor space after lockdown, research suggests.","Sellers are being told to show off gardens of any size Landlords and owners putting their homes on the market are being told to show off gardens in marketing photos as house-hunters search for space. Pictures of the kitchen had previously been considered key to attracting the attention of browsers. Lockdown has changed the priorities of buyers and renters, many of whom have been working from home, research by property portal Rightmove suggests. Flats are the big losers, as indoor and outdoor space becomes a bigger draw. Rightmove said that a studio flat was the most sought-after property type among renters in January, but by May - after the coronavirus lockdown - it had dropped out of the top five. A two-bedroom house is now the biggest attraction. Flats have also dropped out of the top five wanted list among buyers, calculated from the number of enquiries per property of each type. Many people would usually have been priced out of larger homes with big gardens, but indications suggest they are willing to accept a longer commute in order to cast the net wider for an affordable property. The property market was effectively shut down for weeks owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Since the easing of restrictions in England in mid-May, property portals and estate agents have reported a surge in interest. Some believethe rebound will be short-livedowing to inevitable economic pain which will follow the outbreak. At present, interest in property is high in some areas. Lockdown break-ups, job losses and urgent relocations are thought to have led toa surge in the rental sector. This is dependent on the area. Coastal towns, and some urban areas have seen significantly higher rental demand, topped by a 51% increase compared with last year in Wolverhampton, Rightmove data shows. However, London and the commuter belt of south-east England have seen demand fall, with the biggest drop of nearly 14% compared with last year seen in Croydon. Property sales plunged during lockdown, but at the same time renters and buyers appear to have reassessed what they want in a home. Estate agent Savills, which deals with high-end property, has noted higher interest in countryside living. Now the Rightmove research for the BBC, based on the website's data and a survey of 4,000 potential movers, has suggested 49% of renters and 39% of buyers have changed what they are looking for as a response to living in lockdown. Among buyers, four and six bedroom houses have become more sought-after. Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months House prices see largest monthly fall for 11 years, says Nationwide As half of those asked wanted to work from home with only occasional trips to work, a third of movers wanted a better domestic workspace. Good internet and a spare room are now higher up on wish-lists, but commuting times and transport links are less important, the survey found. The most-viewed property on Rightmove during lockdown has no problem with space The good Spring weather seems to have made one of the biggest impacts on intentions. ""Both buyers and renters are craving a home with its own outside space rather than a flat,"" said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's housing market analyst. Searches by buyers for homes with gardens on Rightmove were up 42% in May compared with the same month a year ago, and increased by 84% over the same period among renters. ""Usually home-movers tell us the kitchen photographs are the most important when they're looking at a property advert, but now agents should consider giving greater prominence to pictures of gardens and outdoor spaces to attract the attention of prospective renters and buyers,"" Mr Shipside said. He said sellers should consider painting the fence and clearing out the shed to make a property more attractive and landlords should ensure a communal garden has been included in any rental listing. The demand for outdoor space has been seen before, but could fizzle out as sellers with gardens raise their asking prices accordingly.

Wear masks in public - WHO,"The WHO had previously said there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"". Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public. The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks. However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"". The new rules for face coverings in England explained The mystery of asymptomatic 'silent spreaders' Tracking the global outbreak The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them. Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year,according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University,external. The organisation saidits new guidance,externalhad been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"". Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says. However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission. At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection. ""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said. This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment. Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission. It points to recent research that people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch the virus but never show symptoms at all,as I reported last weekend. So where distancing is not possible, such as on public transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, it is suggested that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection. Over 60s with underlying health conditions should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves better protection. DEATHS:Remembering 100 NHS and healthcare workers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic VACCINE:Stalled programmes 'putting children's lives at risk' In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the WHO unless it ceased to be a ""partisan political organisation"". The leader, who had initially dismissed the virus as a ""little flu"", has been critical of the lockdown policies recommended by the agency to tackle the spread of the disease. Last week,US President Donald Trump said he would end ties with the WHO, saying it had failed to hold China - where the outbreak begun - to account over coronavirus. In the UK, the government announced on Friday that hospital visitors and outpatients would be required to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff would have to wear medical masks, even if they were not in a clinical setting.

Thousands at Manchester protests,"This video can not be played A large group of people gathered at an anti-racism rally in Manchester Thousands of people have gathered for a rally in Manchester over the death of George Floyd, despite warnings not to assemble due to concerns that coronavirus is spreading again. Campaigners attended the protest in Piccadilly Gardens, while another one is planned for Sunday. Mayor Andy Burnham said the demonstration posed a ""high risk"". Anti-racism rallies are being held worldwide afterMr Floyd's death in US police custody on 25 May. Andy Burnham has urged people to show support ""in different ways"" Scientists have raised concernsthe R number - the average number of people who can catch a virus from an infected person - is creeping up again nationwide. Mr Burnham said: ""While I understand people's wish go to protest against what's been happening in the USA and send that message of solidarity, that can be done in different ways. ""It is not at all ideal... to be gathering in these circumstances when we still face a very high risk."" Some demonstrators wore face masks Mr Floyd's death hassparked protests against police brutality and racismin the US and Europe, including oneheld in Manchester last Sunday. The unarmed black man who was put in handcuffs in the street died while a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder while three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. A Black Lives Matter protest is also planned for St Peter's Square on Sunday. ""I would normally want to go and show my support but I won't be doing that for precisely this reason, so I would ask people to think about that and show their support in another way,"" said Mr Burnham. Health Secretary Matt Hancock also issued a warning against the protests, which are being held in several British cities. Current government rules restrict public gatherings to no more than six people in England. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said: ""We stand alongside all those who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life - justice and accountability should follow. ""We know people want their voices heard and the right to peaceful protest is a key part of democracy, which UK police uphold. ""Our officers will monitor the situation to maintain the safety of all involved. A top priority for us will be striking the balance and ensuring any response is both proportionate and fair."" Dr Sarah Jarvis told BBC Breakfast that demonstrators should stay distant from one another. ""Coronavirus is no respecter of the good cause for which you are going out,"" she said. ""If you are protesting, please be sensible. I know you feel strongly about it, but please socially distance - but actually if you can't socially distance even outside, please wear a face covering.""

Can you protest during lockdown?,"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with thisrave in the West Midlandslast month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at Â£100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Hundreds of people joined a protest in Cardiff Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. This video can not be played Raheem Sterling: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we're fighting"" England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying:""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets.

In London, protesters knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter"". The majority of the day's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street.

'We were wrong': NFL to allow players' protestThe National Football League previously banned its players from dropping to one knee before games.US & Canada,"Colin Kaepernick (centre) and two other players kneel during the national anthem in 2016 The National Football League has said players should be allowed to protest during the national anthem as rallies against racial discrimination continue. ""We were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. The NFL had previously banned players from dropping to one knee, a practice started by Colin Kaepernick in 2016. Meanwhile, a large protest is expected in Washington DC on Saturday. The demonstration is the latest in a series against police brutality and racism that have been held across the US following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man in handcuffs, died after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer has been charged with murder while three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. On Friday, Minneapolis officials said police would be banned from using neck restraints and California pledged to follow suit. From Kaepernick kneeling to NFL apology - timeline of a U-turn 'Pandemic of racism' led to Floyd's death, memorial told DC mayor names plaza 'Black Lives Matter' Biden: Trump 'despicable' for invoking Floyd In a video,Mr Goodell denounced racism in the US,externalin comments that came shortly aftera number of players urged the NFL to take a stronger stance on racism and police brutality in the country. This video can not be played ""I remember George Floyd as me"" ""We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter. Protests around the country are emblematic of the centuries of silence, inequality and oppression of black players, coaches, fans and staff,"" he said. ""I will be reaching out to players who have raised their voices and others on how we can improve."" President Donald Trump has stridently opposed kneeling during the national anthem, and on Fridayagain voiced his opposition to such protests,external, saying on Twitter: ""We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!"" He criticised New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees fordropping his opposition to NFL kneeling protests. Breesresponded on Saturday,externalby saying: ""We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial & prison reform."" VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? The practice of kneeling during the customary pre-game playing of the national anthem was started by black player Colin Kaepernick in 2016 in protest against racial injustice. A number of other players soon joined Kaepernick, who was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers at the time. He became a free agent after the 2016 season and remains unsigned. Kaepernickfiled a grievance against NFL ownersin October 2017, believing they were conspiring not to hire him because of his kneeling protests. The two sidesresolved the grievancein February under a confidentiality agreement. On Friday, the Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed to ban police neck restraints and chokeholds. The new policy, which will be enforceable in court, requires any officer regardless of rank to verbally and physically intervene if they witness a colleague using such unauthorised force. Meanwhile, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said he would move to end state police training in the use of the ""carotid restraint"". San Diego police banned the technique this week. Officials in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles have all previously taken steps to ban or limit the use of chokeholds by members of their police departments. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Denver has ordered police to stop the use of tear gas, plastic bullets and other non-lethal force on peaceful protesters. The order came after four protesters filed a lawsuit against aggressive police action. This video can not be played Trump: 'Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing thatâs happening' In a separate development,President Trump was condemned by his Democratic challenger Joe Biden for invoking Floyd's namein a speech to mark a surprise US jobs rebound. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

NHS trusts 'not consulted' over face mask changes,"NHS trusts were not consulted before the government announced changes to the use of face coverings and visitor policy in English hospitals, the chief executive of NHS Providers has said. Chris Hopson said trust leaders felt ""completely in the dark"" about the ""significant and complex"" changes. From 15 June, hospital visitors and outpatients must wear face coverings and staff must use surgical masks. The Department of Health says masks can be provided by the hospital if needed. A spokeswoman said that, while the public were ""strongly urged"" to wear a face covering while inside hospitals, no-one would be denied care. Separately, NHS England has lifted the national suspension on hospital visiting withnew guidance for NHS trusts.,external The guidance, which states visiting will be subject to the discretion of individual trusts and other NHS bodies, advises measures to support visiting, such as: Although only one close family member or important contact can be at a patient's bedside, if social distancing can be maintained, a second additional visitor could be permitted in certain circumstances Visitors should be told in advance what to expect when they see the patient and be advised about social distancing, wearing protective kit and hand washing Visitors must wear masks or face coverings at all times People with coronavirus symptoms should not visit Where a face-to-face visit is not practical, then a virtual visit should be supported and arranged The Department of Health said trusts had all of next week to implement the changes and that it had made NHS England aware of the announcement before it was made public. But Mr Hopson said theannouncement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Fridaywas ""rushed out"" with ""absolutely no notice or consultation"" of NHS trust leaders. UK passes 40,000 coronavirus deaths 'Unscrupulous' firms targeting key workers Is R number balanced on knife edge? He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's the latest in a long line of announcements that have had a major impact on the way the NHS operates, in which frontline organisations feel they've been left completely in the dark, and they're then expected to make significant and complex operational changes either immediately or with very little notice."" He said trust leaders were worried there was not enough strategy or planning and that it felt like ""last minute decisions are being made on the hoof that seem overly influenced by politics and that need to fill the space of the Downing Street press conferences"". The announcement had left many unanswered questions, such as when it was appropriate for staff to wear face masks, the numbers of masks needed and how they would be distributed, he added. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Mr Hopson called for a ""proper, sensible forward plan and forward strategy of what we are trying to do, where trusts are given the time and space they need to do complex and difficult things"". Meanwhile, 40,465 people have now died with the virus, an increase of 204,according to the latest government figures.,external Afurther 10 people have died of coronavirus in Wales, while there were six deaths registered in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. Earlier, NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said trusts were also nervous about the imminent lifting of some patient visiting restrictions. She said they needed time to ""put in place processes and guidance to ensure that patients can receive visitors safely and while adhering to social distancing and infection control measures"". Mr Hopson's criticism was echoed by the British Medical Association (BMA), which warned there was ""little detail"" on how the policy would be implemented, where the masks would come from or how outpatients and visitors would be given them. Consultants committee chairman Dr Rob Harwood said: ""Given the lack of PPE supplies throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, it is absolutely crucial that the government ensures there are enough supplies of face masks for staff, and adequate provision of face coverings for outpatients and the public by the 15 June."" I MAY DESTROY YOU:The next must-see show in lockdown TRAIN WRIGHT:Mark Wright's lockdown workout It comes as the UK's death toll passed 40,000 on Friday according to government figures. The UK is only the second country - after the US with 108,000 deaths - to pass the milestone. Also at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock appealed to people not to attend large demonstrations with more than six people, saying he was ""appalled"" by the killing of George Floyd in the US but ""coronavirus remains a real threat"". Thousands ignored his plea to take part in the protests across the UK, with the majority of those at the London gathering wearing face coverings. The World Health Organization (WHO)has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn by the general public in situations where social distancing is difficult, eg on public transport, in shops - particularly for over 60s and those with underlying health conditions In other developments: In north-west England many schools willdelay reopening until 22 June over fears that the spread of the virus is increasing Some older people in care homes are being asked to paymore than Â£100 a week extra in fees to cover the costs of coronavirus The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he has beenanonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown The government should halve the two-metre social distancing rule if businesses in the hospitality industry are to survive when they finally reopen, trade organisations have warned In the first British classic horse race since sport returned,Kameko beat favourite Pinatubo to win the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket.

Crowds gather as George Floyd protests begin,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters gathered in UK cities on Saturday - in London, missiles were thrown and a police horse bolted Thousands of people have joined anti-racism demonstrations across the UK. The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US, were held in cities including London,Manchester,Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. In London, protesters knelt for a minute's silence before chanting ""no justice, no peace"" and ""black lives matter"". The majority of the day's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Police horses were used to regain control, but one horse galloped ahead and its rider fell to the ground after hitting her head on a traffic light. Her injuries are not life-threatening, the Metropolitan Police said. Fourteen people were arrested and 14 officers were injured after a smaller group became ""angry and intent on violence"", the force added. A police officer being tended to after she fell off her horse The Metropolitan Police said 14 arrests were made in London But demonstrations were largely peaceful In a tweet,external, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the protesters ""I stand with you and I share your anger and your pain"" and said the small minority of people who became violent ""let down this important cause"". The protests went ahead despite officials advising against mass gatherings due to coronavirus. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the social distancing advice was ""for the safety of all of us"", while Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the protests were ""unlawful"". Are you allowed to protest during lockdown? Thousands attend George Floyd protests in Manchester Why the US protests resonate in the UK Thousands of people gathered in the capital, the majority donning face coverings and many with gloves. Some held signs made reference to coronavirus, including one which read: ""There is a virus greater than Covid-19 and it's called racism"". Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland,police said they had issued ""a significant number"" of finesgiven the dangers of crowds in the pandemic and organisers would now be reported to the Public Prosecution Service with a view to prosecution. Protests began in the US after a video emerged of Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, being arrested by four officers on 25 May in Minneapolis. Videos showed Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, dying after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The footage - seen all around the world - showed himgasping that he could not breathe. An officer has been charged with murder while three of his colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting the killing. In Cardiff, protesters held up placards saying ""my life matters"" and ""I can't breathe"" Boxer Anthony Joshua joined protesters in Watford, Hertfordshire At a protest in his hometown of Watford, Britain's world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua told the crowds: ""We can no longer sit back and remain silent on this senseless, unlawful killing and sly racism on another human being."" In central London, protesters dropped to one knee and raised their fists in the air outside the US embassy amid chants of ""silence is violence"" and ""colour is not a crime"". Sarah Law, 27, said: ""I don't want my future children to experience what I have. It's time for us all to unite together regardless of our race and stand up for what is right."" O'Neall Rawle, a 27-year-old teacher from Leicester, said he was protesting because he was ""exhausted of being treated as a second class citizen"" and ""to hopefully spark some change"". Meanwhile, in Glasgow,anti-racism campaigners renamed streets that have links to the slave trade, replacing street signs with the names of enslaved Africans, black activists and victims of police brutality. Demonstrations are scheduled in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen on Sunday. Protesters in London marched towards the US embassy in Vauxhall Campaigners in Leicester knelt with their fists in the air People left flowers and placards at a mural of George Floyd in Manchester In Manchesterabout 15,000 protesters gathered at Piccadilly Gardensin the city centre, clapping in unison and holding placards bearing the initials BLM. Elsewhere, several hundred people marched in Newcastle, while many more took part in an online protest organised in the north-east of England. More protests took place across Europe on Saturday and huge rallies are taking place inmajor cities across the US. 'When one is hurt, we're all hurt' How black Britons reacted to George Floyd's death What does white privilege mean? How many black people die in police custody? Coronavirus regulations for England don't specifically mention protests but do restrict ""public gatherings"" to no more than six people - that would make large protests illegal. Police officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices (starting at Â£100) to people who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence. Whether they do this in practice is another matter and policing large protests during the coronavirus pandemic presents a challenge. Dame Cressida has said officers will ""seek to uphold the law"" but will have to make a ""case-by-case"" decision on what to do.

"Want to sell a home? Make the garden look niceProperty buyers and renters are on the search for outdoor space after lockdown, research suggests.Business","Sellers are being told to show off gardens of any size Landlords and owners putting their homes on the market are being told to show off gardens in marketing photos as house-hunters search for space. Pictures of the kitchen had previously been considered key to attracting the attention of browsers. Lockdown has changed the priorities of buyers and renters, many of whom have been working from home, research by property portal Rightmove suggests. Flats are the big losers, as indoor and outdoor space becomes a bigger draw. Rightmove said that a studio flat was the most sought-after property type among renters in January, but by May - after the coronavirus lockdown - it had dropped out of the top five. A two-bedroom house is now the biggest attraction. Flats have also dropped out of the top five wanted list among buyers, calculated from the number of enquiries per property of each type. Many people would usually have been priced out of larger homes with big gardens, but indications suggest they are willing to accept a longer commute in order to cast the net wider for an affordable property. The property market was effectively shut down for weeks owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Since the easing of restrictions in England in mid-May, property portals and estate agents have reported a surge in interest. Some believethe rebound will be short-livedowing to inevitable economic pain which will follow the outbreak. At present, interest in property is high in some areas. Lockdown break-ups, job losses and urgent relocations are thought to have led toa surge in the rental sector. This is dependent on the area. Coastal towns, and some urban areas have seen significantly higher rental demand, topped by a 51% increase compared with last year in Wolverhampton, Rightmove data shows. However, London and the commuter belt of south-east England have seen demand fall, with the biggest drop of nearly 14% compared with last year seen in Croydon. Property sales plunged during lockdown, but at the same time renters and buyers appear to have reassessed what they want in a home. Estate agent Savills, which deals with high-end property, has noted higher interest in countryside living. Now the Rightmove research for the BBC, based on the website's data and a survey of 4,000 potential movers, has suggested 49% of renters and 39% of buyers have changed what they are looking for as a response to living in lockdown. Among buyers, four and six bedroom houses have become more sought-after. Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months House prices see largest monthly fall for 11 years, says Nationwide As half of those asked wanted to work from home with only occasional trips to work, a third of movers wanted a better domestic workspace. Good internet and a spare room are now higher up on wish-lists, but commuting times and transport links are less important, the survey found. The most-viewed property on Rightmove during lockdown has no problem with space The good Spring weather seems to have made one of the biggest impacts on intentions. ""Both buyers and renters are craving a home with its own outside space rather than a flat,"" said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's housing market analyst. Searches by buyers for homes with gardens on Rightmove were up 42% in May compared with the same month a year ago, and increased by 84% over the same period among renters. ""Usually home-movers tell us the kitchen photographs are the most important when they're looking at a property advert, but now agents should consider giving greater prominence to pictures of gardens and outdoor spaces to attract the attention of prospective renters and buyers,"" Mr Shipside said. He said sellers should consider painting the fence and clearing out the shed to make a property more attractive and landlords should ensure a communal garden has been included in any rental listing. The demand for outdoor space has been seen before, but could fizzle out as sellers with gardens raise their asking prices accordingly.

Are you allowed to protest during lockdown?,"This video can not be played Protesters in Bristol pull down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with thisrave in the West Midlandslast month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at Â£100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Hundreds of people joined a protest in Cardiff Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. This video can not be played Raheem Sterling: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we're fighting"" England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying:""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets.

Memorial 'brought to veterans' for D-Day,"World War II veterans whose D-Day anniversary trip to the new British Normandy Memorial was cancelled are being brought new footage of the site to mark the day. More than 70 veterans, many in their mid-90s, were meant to make the trip for the 76th anniversary on Saturday. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Normandy Memorial Trust is showing them the latest construction work instead. The memorial was meant to be officially opened on 4 September. That ceremony will now take place in spring or early summer 2021 instead. Lord Peter Ricketts, chairman of trustees at the Normandy Memorial Trust, said: ""We at the trust know how much the veterans and their families were looking forward to visiting the site around the time of the D-Day anniversary to see the memorial taking shape. ""We share their frustration that the unprecedented circumstances of the pandemic have made that impossible. But the good news is that we are pressing on with real determination to complete the construction, despite all the obstacles. ""I pay tribute to the dedication of everyone involved in this."" An artist's view of how the memorial will look The new content showing the construction work is being released on the trust's website on Saturday. ""You will get a sense from these new pictures of how moving and impressive the memorial will be once it is finished in the autumn,"" added Lord Ricketts. In the footage, people can watch letter carvers inscribing the words of Winston Churchill's speech, including the famous words ""we shall fight on the beaches"". The stone columns of the memorial are engraved with the names of 22,442 men and women under British command who lost their lives in the D-Day landings and the Battle of Normandy. There was a two-month pause in construction of the memorial due to the pandemic, but it has now restarted. Work has included the planting of hundreds of young trees, as well as 12 semi-mature oak trees at the memorial entrance. The French memorial - recognising the sacrifice of Normandy's civilian population - has had its foundations installed and the first stone laid. As the UK government is not providing funding for the maintenance of the memorial. the trust is also launching a support programme. The Normandy Memorial Guardian programme will see supporters recruited to look after the site in the years ahead.

'Extend furlough scheme to save adventure firms',"The pandemic has been catastrophic for Bike Park Wales, its director says The furlough scheme must be extended beyond October to stop adventure tourism businesses ""disappearing off the map"" in Wales, a Conservative MP has said. Former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb called for the UK government to provide ""extra support"" for the sector. More than9% of the workforce,externalin Wales is now employed in tourism. The Treasury said it had extended the scheme until October and would continue to ""support businesses"". A million employers have used the UK government's Job Retention Scheme to furlough their workers, paying 80% of their wages up to Â£2,500 per month. The Treasury extended the schemeuntil October, and have asked employers to start contributing to furloughed workers' wages from August. But adventure firms in Wales have called for more support, saying their businesses will struggle to make a profit so long as social distancing is in place. The billions being spent on coronavirus in Wales Wales 'more exposed' to unprecedented jobs crisis Tourism businesses in Wales fear for the future Martin Astley, the director of Bike Park Wales in Merthyr Tydfil, said the coronavirus lockdown had been ""catastrophic"" for the company. ""It's hit us at a very bad time as well - a lot of outdoor providers in Wales had a really hard winter, the weather was horrendous, Storm Dennis caused tens of thousands of damage on our site, we were still in midst of fixing that when lockdown came,"" he said. Mr Astley said part of his operation saw customers taken to the top of a mountain in minibuses, which was ""very difficult"" to run with social distancing in place. ""Our businesses are completely un-financially viable under social distancing. We can't even come close to breaking even let alone turn a profit."" Mr Astley said the furlough scheme needed to become ""more focused"" to help businesses like his avoid redundancies. ""What concerns me is I'm fairly confident the furlough scheme will end before social distancing measures are no longer required, which puts us in a very difficult position - best case 50% down on our revenue and that only really leads in one direction unfortunately."" Jet Moore runs kayaking trips in west Wales, including on the River Teifi Jet Moore runs an adventure tourism business called Adventure Beyond in west Wales. It would usually be taking groups out kayaking or coasteering at this time of year. He said the recent hot weather should have meant a ""bumper season"" for the industry - but that income has been lost. ""For the adventure tourism sector, it's like three winters in a row. ""We've had the winter, we've now got the summer with no work which is like a winter, and we're going straight back into a winter by the time it maybe gets going again."" He believes bespoke financial support packages are needed to help businesses survive through the winter, after the Job Retention Scheme ends. ""It's really hard but if they want the tourism industry to survive there's going to have to be something through the winter - but also allow people to continue working while getting that support. ""Because our winter time would be spent prepping for the season and we'd usually pay for that with our summer money."" Stephen Crabb, the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP, said such businesses in his constituency would face redundancies without more support. ""All are saying to me, realistically with social distancing in place, it becomes very difficult to run a viable operation with need for instructors.

"NHS trusts 'not consulted' over face mask changesHospital bosses in England felt ""in the dark"" after ministers said staff would have to wear surgical masks.UK","NHS trusts were not consulted before the government announced changes to the use of face coverings and visitor policy in English hospitals, the chief executive of NHS Providers has said. Chris Hopson said trust leaders felt ""completely in the dark"" about the ""significant and complex"" changes. From 15 June, hospital visitors and outpatients must wear face coverings and staff must use surgical masks. The Department of Health says masks can be provided by the hospital if needed. A spokeswoman said that, while the public were ""strongly urged"" to wear a face covering while inside hospitals, no-one would be denied care. Separately, NHS England has lifted the national suspension on hospital visiting withnew guidance for NHS trusts.,external The guidance, which states visiting will be subject to the discretion of individual trusts and other NHS bodies, advises measures to support visiting, such as: Although only one close family member or important contact can be at a patient's bedside, if social distancing can be maintained, a second additional visitor could be permitted in certain circumstances Visitors should be told in advance what to expect when they see the patient and be advised about social distancing, wearing protective kit and hand washing Visitors must wear masks or face coverings at all times People with coronavirus symptoms should not visit Where a face-to-face visit is not practical, then a virtual visit should be supported and arranged The Department of Health said trusts had all of next week to implement the changes and that it had made NHS England aware of the announcement before it was made public. But Mr Hopson said theannouncement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Fridaywas ""rushed out"" with ""absolutely no notice or consultation"" of NHS trust leaders. UK passes 40,000 coronavirus deaths 'Unscrupulous' firms targeting key workers Is R number balanced on knife edge? He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's the latest in a long line of announcements that have had a major impact on the way the NHS operates, in which frontline organisations feel they've been left completely in the dark, and they're then expected to make significant and complex operational changes either immediately or with very little notice."" He said trust leaders were worried there was not enough strategy or planning and that it felt like ""last minute decisions are being made on the hoof that seem overly influenced by politics and that need to fill the space of the Downing Street press conferences"". The announcement had left many unanswered questions, such as when it was appropriate for staff to wear face masks, the numbers of masks needed and how they would be distributed, he added. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Mr Hopson called for a ""proper, sensible forward plan and forward strategy of what we are trying to do, where trusts are given the time and space they need to do complex and difficult things"". Meanwhile, 40,465 people have now died with the virus, an increase of 204,according to the latest government figures.,external Afurther 10 people have died of coronavirus in Wales, while there were six deaths registered in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. Earlier, NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said trusts were also nervous about the imminent lifting of some patient visiting restrictions. She said they needed time to ""put in place processes and guidance to ensure that patients can receive visitors safely and while adhering to social distancing and infection control measures"". Mr Hopson's criticism was echoed by the British Medical Association (BMA), which warned there was ""little detail"" on how the policy would be implemented, where the masks would come from or how outpatients and visitors would be given them. Consultants committee chairman Dr Rob Harwood said: ""Given the lack of PPE supplies throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, it is absolutely crucial that the government ensures there are enough supplies of face masks for staff, and adequate provision of face coverings for outpatients and the public by the 15 June."" I MAY DESTROY YOU:The next must-see show in lockdown TRAIN WRIGHT:Mark Wright's lockdown workout It comes as the UK's death toll passed 40,000 on Friday according to government figures. The UK is only the second country - after the US with 108,000 deaths - to pass the milestone. Also at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock appealed to people not to attend large demonstrations with more than six people, saying he was ""appalled"" by the killing of George Floyd in the US but ""coronavirus remains a real threat"". Thousands ignored his plea to take part in the protests across the UK, with the majority of those at the London gathering wearing face coverings.

Chelsea manager Emma Hayes is confident women's footballwill come back ""bigger, stronger and better""following the coronavirus outbreak. The Women's Super League season was halted in March and ended on 25 May, with the Blues awarded the WSL title on a points-per-game ratio on Friday. Hayes said ending the season early was the ""right decision"", with player welfare a key factor. ""Just because it didn't resume doesn't mean we're under threat or at risk. I trust in the people running the league and believe we'll come back bigger, stronger and better,"" Hayes, 43, said.

About 15,000 people havegathered for a rally in Manchesterover the death of George Floyd, despite warnings not to assemble due to concerns that coronavirus is spreading again. Campaigners attended the protest in Piccadilly Gardens, while another one is planned for Sunday. Mayor Andy Burnham said the demonstration posed a ""high risk"" while scientists have raised concerns the R number - the average number of people who can catch a virus from an infected person - is creeping up again nationwide. Mr Burnham said: ""While I understand people's wish go to protest against what's been happening in the USA and send that message of solidarity, that can be done in different ways. ""It is not at all ideal... to be gathering in these circumstances when we still face a very high risk."" Darts player Nathan Aspinallmade a trophy out of a dinner plateto celebrate winning the PDC Home Tour title. The Englishman, 28,  wrote his name on a plate and held it aloft before diving in his hot tub. ""It's permanent marker so it's going in the bin after this, but there's my little trophy for the night,"" he said. The tournament, which featured more than 100 PDC tour card holders filmed at home on their mobile phones, wasset up after events were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. We reported earlier thatthe World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masksand coverings, saying they should be worn in public to help stop the spread of coronavirus. But if you wear your face covering incorrectly, you could actually be putting yourself more at risk. Here, the BBC's Laura Foster and Tobias Chapple explain why.

There have been more than 280,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and some 40,000 people have lost their lives, government figures show. You canfind out how the pandemic has affected your areaand how it compares with the national average Solidarity protests about the death of George Floyd in the US are continuing to take place across England, despite the Health Secretary Matt Hancock and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to attend. Soare such demonstrations actually legalgiven the coronavirus lockdown? Our home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani looks at what the lockdown laws say about protests, the penalties you could face for taking part and where it leaves the police. As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus,scientists have another target in their sites- the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. The k number is key to understanding why that happens, measuring the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people. About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert. My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make.Alex Wright, from Leicester, takes us through a week in his lifeduring the coronavirus pandemic. The 29-year-old is a venue manager of a gaming arcade and earns Â£25,000 a year. However, he has been placed on furlough since March. His partner Rebekah is an NHS nurse and has recently started maternity leave following the birth of their twin daughters, Eden and Indie, last week. They also have two sons, Rory, five and Casper, four. See how he and his family fared financially during a week that included a picnic and DIY tasks. Crowds have begun to gatheras protests over the death of George Floyd get under way. Protesters have been told to avoid mass gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said protests were ""unlawful"" under current restrictions and Home Secretary Priti Patel said not attending was ""for the safety of all of us"". Demonstrators have congregated in London's Parliament Square and gatherings are planned across the UK. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has warned that mass gatherings were ""high risk"" amid fears that coronavirus might be spreading again. We have created ""a perfect storm"" fordiseases from wildlife to spill over into humansand spread quickly around the world, scientists warn. Human encroachment on the natural world speeds up that process, say global health experts who study how and where new diseases emerge. Scientists at the University of Liverpool have now developed a pattern-recognition system to predict which wildlife diseases pose most risk to humans, part of a global effort to develop ways to prepare better for future outbreaks. ""In the last 20 years, we've had six significant threats - Sars, Mers, Ebola, avian influenza and swine flu,"" Prof Matthew Baylis from the University of Liverpool told BBC News. ""We dodged five bullets but the sixth got us. ""And this is not the last pandemic we are going to face, so we need to be looking more closely at wildlife disease.""

This video can not be played For children across England going back to school, this is the first week of their ""new normal"". Year 6 children have recorded video diaries so we can see through their eyes how this return to school life feels. People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here'sour guide to different types and step-by-step instructionson how to make them. Fergus WalshMedical correspondent My experience of testing positive for coronavirus antibodies clearly struck a nerve. Two weeks ago I wrote that I'd had no recent symptoms but dismissed a bout of pneumonia in January because it was weeks before the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the UK. Many of you responded with your own experiences of having Covid-like symptoms - some as far back as November - and urged me to investigate further. Butis it possible to prove when coronavirus first struck in the UK,and does it matter? This video can not be played Healthcare workers have asked people to ""think twice"" to stay safe and help the NHS, as coronavirus lockdown restrictions are eased across the UK. They star in a new work by Cambridgeshire poet Jude Simpson, who is look at how a post-lockdown UK, where social distancing becomes the new normal, might look. ""[Clap for carers] had been such a brilliant way for people to express their gratitude,"" said Ms Simpson. ""But at the same time some health workers were starting to think, 'it's all very well for you to applaud me on a Thursday night, but are you social distancing on a Friday morning?'"" Many schools in north-west Englandwill delay reopening until at least 22 Juneover concerns the coronavirus infection rate is on the rise. Schools in Blackburn said they would not reopen on Monday, as the government has urged, while Tameside Council ""strongly"" advised schools not to do so. Wirral Council has also urged schools to ""pause"" reopening plans while Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""there is a challenge"" in the region. Some scientists say the R number is creeping up across the country and may have surpassed one - the point at which the epidemic takes off again - in the region. Ronnie O'Sullivan says he has""struggled"" in the ""bubble"" surrounding snooker's Championship League tournament,which is being played behind closed doors and in a closed environment. Snooker was the first sport to return to live action on free-to-air TV, following government guidance, which paved the way for competition to make a comeback from Monday. The non-ranking event is taking place without fans at the Marshall Arena in Milton Keynes. It has an on-site hotel, where players must isolate in their rooms when they are not competing. ""If every tournament was to be like this then I am not sure I would be able to do it,"" said O'Sullivan, 44. The mayor of Bristol says those taking part in Black Lives Matter protests this weekend should think about the possible health consequences of large rallies and demonstrations. Marvin Rees says he agrees with the aims of the campaign but says there were other ways to protest - and suggested people follow the lead of the American footballer Colin Kaepernick who in 2016 started the practice of dropping to one knee during the national anthem to protest against racism. ""Covid is with us. We don't have a vaccine. And it's not the demonstration I have a problem with, it's any form of demonstration that requires a mass gathering,"" he told the BBC. ""Because my fear is a second wave will lead to a disproportionate loss of black and brown lives and any consequence of a further lockdown we know is also disproportionately impacting black and brown people - the lost jobs, the lost wages, the lost businesses, which, again, will have a health consequence.""

"'Extend furlough scheme to save adventure firms'Businesses offering outdoor activities may ""disappear off the map"" without more support, an MP says.Wales","The pandemic has been catastrophic for Bike Park Wales, its director says The furlough scheme must be extended beyond October to stop adventure tourism businesses ""disappearing off the map"" in Wales, a Conservative MP has said. Former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb called for the UK government to provide ""extra support"" for the sector. More than9% of the workforce,externalin Wales is now employed in tourism. The Treasury said it had extended the scheme until October and would continue to ""support businesses"". A million employers have used the UK government's Job Retention Scheme to furlough their workers, paying 80% of their wages up to Â£2,500 per month. The Treasury extended the schemeuntil October, and have asked employers to start contributing to furloughed workers' wages from August. But adventure firms in Wales have called for more support, saying their businesses will struggle to make a profit so long as social distancing is in place. The billions being spent on coronavirus in Wales Wales 'more exposed' to unprecedented jobs crisis Tourism businesses in Wales fear for the future Martin Astley, the director of Bike Park Wales in Merthyr Tydfil, said the coronavirus lockdown had been ""catastrophic"" for the company. ""It's hit us at a very bad time as well - a lot of outdoor providers in Wales had a really hard winter, the weather was horrendous, Storm Dennis caused tens of thousands of damage on our site, we were still in midst of fixing that when lockdown came,"" he said. Mr Astley said part of his operation saw customers taken to the top of a mountain in minibuses, which was ""very difficult"" to run with social distancing in place. ""Our businesses are completely un-financially viable under social distancing. We can't even come close to breaking even let alone turn a profit."" Mr Astley said the furlough scheme needed to become ""more focused"" to help businesses like his avoid redundancies. ""What concerns me is I'm fairly confident the furlough scheme will end before social distancing measures are no longer required, which puts us in a very difficult position - best case 50% down on our revenue and that only really leads in one direction unfortunately."" Jet Moore runs kayaking trips in west Wales, including on the River Teifi Jet Moore runs an adventure tourism business called Adventure Beyond in west Wales. It would usually be taking groups out kayaking or coasteering at this time of year. He said the recent hot weather should have meant a ""bumper season"" for the industry - but that income has been lost. ""For the adventure tourism sector, it's like three winters in a row. ""We've had the winter, we've now got the summer with no work which is like a winter, and we're going straight back into a winter by the time it maybe gets going again."" He believes bespoke financial support packages are needed to help businesses survive through the winter, after the Job Retention Scheme ends. ""It's really hard but if they want the tourism industry to survive there's going to have to be something through the winter - but also allow people to continue working while getting that support. ""Because our winter time would be spent prepping for the season and we'd usually pay for that with our summer money."" Stephen Crabb, the Preseli Pembrokeshire MP, said such businesses in his constituency would face redundancies without more support. ""All are saying to me, realistically with social distancing in place, it becomes very difficult to run a viable operation with need for instructors.

'Unscrupulous' firms targeting key workers,"""Unscrupulous"" firms are promising NHS workers big savings through tax dodging schemes that could leave them out of pocket. The firms, which operate at the fringes of the law, target key workers drafted in to help with the coronavirus crisis, a BBC Money Box investigation found. Social media adverts push workers toward some umbrella companies that take a hefty cut of their salaries. In return, these companies hide a portion of their pay from the taxman. But Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has said signing up with these firms, which it described as ""unscrupulous"", could leave key workers facing large, unexpected tax bills. One advert on Twitter says: ""If you've been drafted in to reinforce the NHS response to the #coronavirus pandemic, we want to assist you."" When operating legitimately, working through an umbrella company can make it easier to take on jobs for multiple employers at once. The worker has their salary paid to the umbrella company, which then pays tax, National Insurance and other deductions on their behalf. After taking a fee, the umbrella company will then pay the worker what is left. But one company told Money Box that it was possible to save thousands of pounds a year legally by hiding a large chunk of a worker's salary from the taxman. Posing as a healthcare worker on a salary of Â£145 a day, our reporter was told by Dark Blue Professional, a UK-registered umbrella company, that they could take home 78% of their salary, which is more than they would have made through a standard umbrella company. Kay from Dark Blue Professional explained how the scheme works: ""You receive one payment which is a PAYE [pay as you earn] salary payment, that's taxed and you receive a payslip - and the residual balance is then paid as an investment payment."" ""You receive your second amount into your accountâ¦and because it's done that way there is no tax liability on the second proportion,"" she told us. As a result, a healthcare worker earning Â£725 per week would be able to pocket Â£60 more than if they used a standard umbrella company. 'I may lose it all, but there's no help for me' Gambling loophole 'must be shut down' But what Kay did not say is that Dark Blue Professional would take Â£80 a week in fees, four times the industry standard, and that the government would be cheated out of up to half the tax that it should have received. Kay insisted the scheme is tax compliant. But similar types of scheme have been challenged by HMRC in the past, which has left thousands of workers withcrippling tax bills. Some even faced losing their homes, leaving their finances in tatters. Responding to the findings of Money Box investigation, Judith Freedman - professor of taxation law and policy at Oxford University - said: ""There's a strong likelihood that HMRC will challenge them [the schemes] successfully. ""Not only could the individual taxpayers be left with a big tax bill and a lot of hassle, but they have already paid relatively large fees to the promoters, so they are much worse off than they would have been doing things in a straightforward way,"" she said. ""It is distressing that people are trying to sell these schemes withâ¦minimal explanation of the risks. Everything possible needs to be done to stop the firms doing this before ordinary taxpayers get caught up in it."" Money Box also spoke to a broker from Contracting Scout, which actively targets key workers with adverts on Twitter and LinkedIn. ""Tim"", from Contracting Scout, offered to sign us up with an umbrella company also offering 78% take home pay. He explained that the umbrella companies he works with ""are taking advantage of a few tax loopholes"" and admitted that ""the government doesn't like it"". ""They [the government] do try and legislate against it, but legislation is extremely slow, so once the new legislation moves in there's a hundred different umbrellas that pop up next week with a different type of payment structure which doesn't get captivated by the law. ""So the goal posts are always moving and the providers are always trying to cater to that,"" he said. Neither of the two companies responded to the findings of our investigation. An HMRC spokesperson told Money Box ""it is shocking that unscrupulous promoters of tax avoidance schemes are targeting returning NHS workers during this difficult time. HMRC published [advice] on 30 March warning returning workers about this very issue. ""Our advice has always been to steer well clear of such schemes, and to report them to us in confidence for investigation"".

'We've spent lockdown living in a Roman fort',"The family have become custodians of the Roman fort while it is shut to the public A family spending lockdown living in a Roman Fort have described it as a ""surreal experience"". As the UK went into lockdown Sonya and Colin Galloway, who both work for the trust that runs Vindolanda Fort, left their home in Hexham to live there. The couple thought they and their sons Oliver, 15, and Luke, 13, would only be there for three or four weeks. But they have remained for 11 weeks, sweeping bathhouses and protecting artefacts from wind and badger damage. Luke Galloway collected two buckets full of coins from a dried up well during lockdown life that has been like a ""permanent history lesson"" Usually this would be the busiest time of the year at the fort near Hadrian's Wall, with hundreds of visitors and would-be archaeologists booked in to take part in digs. But, like tourist attractions across the UK, it has been closed because of the coronavirus crisis and communications manager Mrs Galloway said the site would have lost an estimate Â£600,000 in income by the end of July. Most of the site's 40 staff have been furloughed and she and her husband, deputy CEO at the Vindolanda Trust, took the decision to decamp the family as well as pet labradoodle Eric and cat Bramble to live in accommodation on site where volunteer diggers would usually stay. They arrived soon after lockdown began in March, fearing a travel ban would leave the site empty. The family has been able to appreciate super moons and sunsets with the fort as a backdrop Sonya Galloway hopes her lockdown photos will inspire visitors to come when the fort begins a phased reopening on 15 June Mrs Galloway said: ""We've been working 24/7 and there are worse places to be. ""We've been making sure the buildings are secure, repairing any minor damage caused by the weather or animals and inside checking our artefacts, maintaining the right humidity. ""My two boys have been locked in a permanent history lesson and it's been unforgettable for them. ""My youngest Luke has helped to sweep the pre-Hadrianic bathhouse, collect coins from a dried up well on the site and he was most impressed to get two buckets full of coins - only worth about Â£20 though. ""One highlight has been seeing a deer give birth to twins in the ground on a hot bank Holiday Monday - ordinarily animals wouldn't come that close but with no visitors she felt safe. ""Luckily for her the Roman Army with their love of hunting have long since left"". The family has been able to enjoy a deer up-close having her fawns at the fort Eric the labradoodle has been acting as Roman fort guard dog The Vindolanda Trust had to apply for emergency funding and successfully obtained grants from the Arts Council England and Northumberland County Council. Mrs Galloway said it has also had to take out a Â£300,000 bank loan to bridge some of the immediate funding gap and the financial costs of the pandemic would be felt for years. The trust has launched a survival appeal and has raised just over a fifth of its Â£100,000 target. The family has been running the Vindolanda online shop sending orders out all over the world. They have also created ahome learning section of the website,externalto support parents with Roman-themed activities. Trust deputy CEO Colin Galloway created a home learning section on the site tested out by sons Luke and Oliver ""Personally for me it's been great,"" Mrs Galloway said. ""I love photography so have captured some wonderful images during lockdown, at all times of the day and night. ""I hope that those images inspire people to make a visit to the site once life returns to normal. ""Our downtime has been quite magical, from super moons to super sunsets and sunshine. ""We are, however, ready now to move back home and will be doing so in the next couple of weeks.

Iran blocking sites access - UN nuclear watchdog,"Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei says the country has suspended its nuclear commitments in response to the reinstated US sanctions The UN nuclear watchdog has expressed serious concern at Iran's continuing failure to allow access to sites the agency wants to visit. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that for more than four months Iran has been blocking inspections of two suspect locations. It is believed the activity there took place long before Iran agreed to curb its nuclear ambitions in a 2015 deal. The IAEA says Iran's enriched uranium stockpile now exceeds the agreed limit. The findings, laid out in two unreleased reports, are expected to be discussed by the agency in mid-June. It comes amid rising tensions between Iran and the US, which pulled out of the 2015 international agreement. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Profile: IAEA, the nuclear watchdog Iran has always denied that it has ever sought to develop a nuclear weapon, insisting that its programmes have been peaceful. In a new report, the Vienna-based IAEA notes ""with serious concern"" that it has been barred entry to two locations in Iran. According to AFP news agency, the nuclear watchdog believes one of the sites ""may have been used for the processing and conversion of uranium ore"" in 2003. It also said a third site with a possible presence of undeclared uranium underwent ""extensive sanitisation and levelling in 2003 and 2004"". The IAEA did not publicly name the three sites. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? A separate report says that Iran held 1,571.6kg (3,464.7lb) of low-enriched uranium as of 20 May - well above the agreed 300kg limit. The highest level of enrichment in the stockpile is 4.5%, breaching the agreement's 3.67% limit. It is still, however, below the level required to create fissile material for a nuclear weapon. A diplomatic source told AFP that Iran's rate of enrichment has not significantly changed since the IAEA's earlier report in March. The agency said it still has access to all nuclear sites needed to monitor Iran's current nuclear activity, despite difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic, and noted ""exceptional co-operation"" by Iranian authorities. The deal was signed in 2015 by Iran and China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the US. Under the deal, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activity in return for the lifting of sanctions. Although the agreement allowed Iran to accumulate small amounts of uranium for research, it banned the enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also, potentially, nuclear weapons. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and to allow international inspections. Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the nuclear deal The agreement was hailed as a landmark -but in May 2018, President Donald Trump abandoned the deal,which he criticised as flawed, and reinstated US sanctions. That same month, the US tightened its sanctions against Iran and said it would attempt to force all countries to stop buying Iranian oil and put pressure on Iran to negotiate a new nuclear accord. Since sanctions were tightened, Iran has been steadily breaking some of its commitments to pressure the remaining signatories to find a way to provide sanctions relief. In January 2020, European powers triggered a formal dispute mechanism over Iran's breached of the deal- a move that could spell its end.

Full school opening 'may cause virus second wave'Scientists are concerned the test-and-trace system is not effective enough to prevent this.Health,"Sending all children back to school - and freeing parents to go back to work - could trigger a second wave of coronavirus, warn researchers. UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine team said testing and tracing contacts of those with the virus might help prevent this. But the current test and trace system would need to be more effective. The study,externalis the first to assess the extent of contact tracing that will be needed to prevent a second wave. It used computer models to see how the virus might spread as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were freed from childcare and able return to work or other activities. The academics investigated the impact of the ""phased return"" strategy in England. They analysed what happens when Reception, Year 1 and Year Six go back at the start of June; followed by all primary school pupils in July; secondary pupils in Year 10 and 12 having some contact in July and all secondary schools going back in September. The study showed the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave without an effective test and trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as re-imposing lockdown. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? How test and trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for seven days and their household does so for 14 days They have to tell the NHS everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine The success of the scheme is dependent on how well the testing and the contact tracing goes. The model suggested a second wave would be prevented if: 51% of people were being tested and 40% of their contacts traced Or if 43% of people were being tested and 80% of their contacts traced Modelling is not a crystal ball and there is always uncertainty around any predictions. However, researchers are concerned England is not achieving those figures. About 1,700 people are testing positive every day in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, while figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there are 5,600 new infections a day in the community alone - and one Public Health England reportsuggests 17,000 infections per day,external. There is still no official data on the number of contacts being traced, buta report by the Times (paywall) suggests it is less than 40%,external. ""Our concern from the data at the moment is test-trace-isolate is not reaching the coverage we think is the minimum,"" Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. ""There is clearly a risk of a second pandemic waveâ¦ I'm worried. The R [rate of virus spread] is a bit below one [the point at which the number of new cases starts to take off again], but the incidence is high so it's precarious."" This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, said it would have been better to wait until test and trace was fully up and running before lifting lockdown. ""Cases are not coming down as much as we wanted. I would caution against reopening schools when we are doing a lot of other interventions and we don't know the impact of them. ""Everything depends on control of transmission, there is the threat of a second pandemic wave."" Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Warwick have also published modelling on the impact of reopening schools. It looked only at the impact of children mixing, not the society-wide effect of schools opening. It found that halving the size of classes or focusing on getting younger children into school was less likely to push the R number above 1, the point at which the number of new cases starts to take off again. Secondary schools were deemed more risky, as older children come into contact with more people. ""If we reopen all schools it could push R above 1 in some regions,"" Dr Ed Hill said. But he added: ""Decisions surrounding reopening of schools are a difficult trade-off between the epidemiological consequences and the needs of the children in terms of educational development.""
