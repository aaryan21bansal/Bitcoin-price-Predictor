Museum of the Year's Â£200k prize split five ways,"Clockwise from top left: Aberdeen Art Gallery, Gairloch Museum, South London Gallery, Science Museum, Towner Eastbourne Five museums and galleries have shared the coveted title of Museum of the Year title for 2020 - and the annual award's increased prize fund of Â£200,000. The judges decided to split the honour five ways this year rather than picking one winner as usual. The winners range from London's Science Museum to Gairloch Museum, in a former nuclear bunker in north-west Scotland. The others are Aberdeen Art Gallery, South London Gallery and Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Jenny Waldman, director of the Art Fund, which runs the prize, said the winners were all ""exceptional examples of museums offering inspiration, reflection and joy in the heart of communities"". Museums ""can help rebuild our communities and confidence as we emerge from the virus"", she said, adding: ""But they face financial peril."" More about Museum of the Year on BBC Arts In recent years, the Museum of the Year winner has received Â£100,000, with four other shortlisted institutions getting Â£10,000 each. This year, the five winners will pocket Â£40,000 each. The Art Fund said the shake-up was a response to the ""unprecedented challenges that all museums face this year"". It's not the only award to be split this year -the Turner Prizewas converted to Â£10,000 bursaries for 10 artists rather than choosing a single winner. Aberdeen Art Gallery Aberdeen Art Galleryreopened last yearafter a redevelopment that increased the number of works on display from 370 to 1,080, and attracted 100,000 people in its first 100 days. The judges said they were impressed by ""the beautifully executed restoration, and the commitment to involve the people of the city in the future of this rediscovered jewel on their doorstep"". The gallery's manager Christine Rew said: ""The award will help us make a difference to the lives of artists and audiences."" Gairloch Museum On the north-west coast of Scotland, Gairloch Museum made a Â£2.4m move into a Cold War anti-aircraft command centre last year, which, according to The Art Fund, ""transformed a village eyesore into an important visitor attraction"". Curator Karen Buchanan said she hoped the recognition would bring ""our small, independent museum to the national stage"". She added: ""With the prize money, we will be able to invest in our planned outdoor museum space and procure expertise and equipment to redesign our events and outreach programme for a sustainable, digital future."" The Science Museum The judges said they ""recognised the shift-change that had taken place in this well-known and much respected institution, not only in its spaces, but also in its relationship with its visitors and local communities"". They also praised an overhaul that saw the opening of new galleries dedicated to medicine and London's scientific story from 1550-1800. Museum director Sir Ian Blatchford said they would use the prize money ""to support local schoolchildren from communities that aren't able to currently visit the museum with special outreach sessions"". South London Gallery The Camberwell venue was praised for an expansion that saw it take over the neighbouring Peckham Road Fire Station, as well as an ""exciting programme of exhibitions and events, and a highly regarded free education programme"". The judges were impressed by the gallery's ""integrity, creativity and inspiring leadership"". Gallery director Margot Heller said: ""The financial insecurity brought by lockdown has forced us to find new ways to connect with local schools and families. The award will allow us to continue our existing programmes, as well offering us the chance to commission an exciting new work."" Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne The gallery was praised for the way it had ""redefined its purpose as a free and open community resource and launched a new vision to transform communities through art"" despitea funding cut. The judges said they also admired its ""genuine commitment to promoting under-represented artists"". Director Joe Hill said: ""In the current unprecedented circumstances, we are proud to have continued to deliver a wide-ranging programme."" How have museums been doing since they reopened?

"Covid increase like dashboard warnings, says PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson explains a three-tiered level of rules to fight the coronavirus pandemic in England. Boris Johnson has said the UK's increasing number of coronavirus cases is ""flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet"". The Liverpool region will be on a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of a new three-tier system. England's chief medical officer said he was not confident the measures ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said it was likely local authorities in ""very high"" alert areas would have to go further. But the prime minister ruled out the ""extreme route"" of a national lockdown ""right now"". Meanwhile, minutes from a meeting of the government's science advisors last monthrevealed they suggested a short national lockdown to curb virus cases. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Kuenssberg: Who's in charge? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Covid risk 'very serious and it is very real' Most areas of England will be on ""medium"" alert, with measures such as the rule of six, but areas with local restrictions on household mixing are automatically on ""high"" alert. A ""very high"" alert sees pubs and bars close if they do not serve ""substantial meals"", almost all household contacts banned and advice against travel. Mr Johnson said retail outlets, schools and universities would remain open in all areas of England. Prof Whitty told a Downing Street news conference that, without additional local rules, the basic restrictions in very high alert areas would fail to control Covid-19. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The base will not be sufficient - I think that's very clearly the professional view"" However, Mr Johnson said the rules would be enough if they are implemented ""very effectively"". ""We have to act now,"" he said. It came after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said growth in Covid caseswas a ""nationwide phenomenon""and that ""things are heating up"" in areas beyond northern England. And, asminutes from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage,external, show, recommendations made to ministers on 21 September included an immediate circuit breaker - or short lockdown - which was seen as the most effective way to suppress the virus. They also reveal that the scientific advisers believe NHS Test and Trace is having just a ""marginal impact"" on the epidemic and this ""will likely decline further"" unless the system grows to keep pace with new cases. The new system is split into three alert levels: medium, high and very high. Most areas in England are in themedium alert level- meaning current restrictions continue, including the 10pm hospitality curfew. Areas already under additional local restrictions are automatically in thehigh alert level- meaning bans on household mixing indoors are extended to include hospitality venues. Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak now come into this category, as well as Greater Manchester, parts of South Yorkshire, and north-east England. Around 4.4 million people will be in high alert areas. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million people - becomes the first area to enter thevery high alert level, with the closure of pubs and bars. Betting shops, gyms, leisure centres and casinos will also close in the region. Household mixing will be banned anywhere indoors, and in outdoor gardens and hospitality. The rule of six will continue to apply in outdoor public spaces like parks,according to government guidance,external. Extra restrictions imposed on Nottinghamshire Merseyside businesses fear 'ominous winter ahead' Restaurants can continue to trade in very high alert areas, while people will also be advised against travelling to and from these zones. Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, he said: ""This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human, and indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."" The PM said around Â£1bn of ""new financial support"" would be provided to local authorities in England with further financial support for local test and trace and local enforcement in very high alert areas. Mr Sunak also pointed towards thenew post-furlough job support scheme. A postcode search will launch on the government website in due course enabling residents to determine which rules apply to them, Mr Johnson said at the news conference. Liverpool City Region has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 in the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The question today is whether the restrictions announced by the prime minister can bring the country back from the brink."" Prof Calum Semple, an infectious disease expert and adviser to the government, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the new restrictions had come too late and a short national lockdown could be needed in weeks. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said new local measures are ""treating the 'symptom' not the cause"" of increasing infections and called for a national prevention plan. Some will say ministers should have gone further, while others argue they have already gone too far. But the problem with the restrictions that are being discussed is that no one really knows what impact they will have. Closing Covid-secure pubs, for example, could just drive people to gather more in homes, where the risk of transmission is even greater. The other factor, which is not grabbing the headlines at the moment but is just as important, is whether the test and trace system is up to the job. Test results are taking too long to return, contact tracers are failing to reach enough of the close contacts of infected individuals and even when they do most people do not follow the isolation guidelines to the letter. Infections, hospitalisations and deaths are certainly going to rise. By how much and for how long is the big unknown. Certainly with better treatments in place and the UK in a stronger position to protect care homes - four in 10 deaths were among their residents in the first wave - many believe the toll should not be as great as it was in the spring. Labour mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told the BBC ""we agree with the government having to impose tougher restrictions"" but he added that an argument for a stronger financial package for the city ""wasn't listened to"". Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the area's restrictions were ""comparable"" to the national lockdown in March - but without the same level of financial support. Some areas of northern England have had additional restrictions on household gatherings since the end of July. Sturgeon to draw up 'three-tier' lockdown system Second national lockdown considered for Wales Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said despite the capital being on the medium alert level, its status could ""change very quickly - potentially even this week"" and move into a higher level. The three-tier alert system applies only to England, with the devolved administrationsin Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandin charge of designing and implementing their own coronavirus restrictions. A further 13,972 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, with 50 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

Trump returns to campaign trail in FloridaPresident Trump is holding a campaign rally less than two weeks after testing positive for Covid-19.US Election 2020,"This video can not be played Trump rally: âIâll just give you a big, fat kissâ President Donald Trump has returned to the campaign trail less than two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus. He told thousands of supporters, many not wearing masks, that he could give them ""a big fat kiss"", at a rally in the battleground state of Florida. His rival, Joe Biden, speaking in Ohio, accused the president of ""reckless behaviour"" since his diagnosis. The two presidential candidates are scrambling to secure votes with three weeks until the 3 November election. Opinion polls suggests Mr Biden has a 10-point lead over Mr Trump nationally. However his lead in some key states is narrower - as is the case in Florida, where the Democrat is 3.7 percentage points ahead, according to an average of polls collated by Real Clear Politics. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why are infections rising again in US? President Trump's Florida speech fact-checked Battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio are crucial for gathering the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House, which is not determined by a simple count of votes nationwide. Mr Trump, 74, tested positive for Covid-19 some 12 days ago, and was admitted to hospital a day later. But on Sundayhis personal doctor said he was no longer a Covid transmission riskto others and disclosed on Monday that his most recent tests were negative over consecutive days, although he did not give the dates. Top US government scientist Anthony Fauci said holding big campaign rallies was ""asking for trouble"" as many states are battling an increase in coronavirus cases. At the scene - Nomia Iqbal, BBC News, Sanford, Florida The usual chants of ""Four more years!"" were heard as hundreds queued to enter the open-air space where the president made his appearance. People have been getting their temperature checked and were offered face masks. Those who covered up didn't think it was too soon for the president to be out and about. They said they admired him for it.  One man here told me he was originally from New York and had made Florida his home - just like ""his hero"" Donald Trump. The Trump campaign team is throwing everything at Florida - a loss here makes his return to the White House near impossible. This video can not be played Florida governor Ron DeSantis high-fives supporters at Trump rally Vice-President Mike Pence recently visited ""The Villages"", a famous retirement community, to court the elderly vote. But though the president and some of his supporters here seem relaxed about coronavirus, it has hit Florida hard, with more than 15,000 deaths. Joe Biden, who arrives in the state on Tuesday, is focusing on the administration's handling of the pandemic and plans to carry out a quieter but vigorous campaign in key suburban areas, which he hopes will help flip the state blue. In his first stump appearance following his Covid-19 diagnosis and recovery, a re-invigorated Mr Trump returned to his campaign's familiar themes and lines of attack against Mr Biden. He touted stock market growth, the establishment of the US Space Force and his successful confirmation of two conservative Supreme Court justices to the bench - with a third nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, before the Senate this week - as major achievements. In front of a crowd of several thousand he denounced plans to prolong Covid-related shutdowns supported by Democrats and sought to question Mr Biden's mental acuity. This video can not be played Did Joe Biden really say he was running for the Senate? Referring to his own recovery from Covid-19, he said at one point: ""They say I'm immune - I feel so powerful. I'll walk in there and kiss everyone. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, I'll give you a big, fat kiss."" Though reinfections of the virus remain rare scientists are still questioning how long any potential immunity to the virus lasts. Man gets Covid twice and second hit 'more severe' Few people in the crowd were seen wearing masks or adhering to public health guidelines to keep at least 6ft (2m) apart to reduce the risk of transmitting Covid-19. Speaking to CNN, Dr Fauci said it was not the time to be holding full campaign rallies as the country battles the pandemic. ""We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,"" he said. ""Now is even more so a worse time to do that, because when you look at what's going on in the United States, it's really very troublesome,"" he added, referring to increases in test positivity rates in a number of states. It was no surprise that Florida is the place where Mr Trump made his big rally return. He wants and needs to win Florida, a state he narrowly carried in 2016. It is also his adopted home. A lifelong New Yorker, he made himself a Florida resident in September last year. However, President Trump's support from seniors, which helped him win four years ago, appears to be dwindling, with his campaign trying to make up for the losses by courting African American and Hispanic voters. ""Every campaign changes from election to re-election,"" his campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters on Monday. This video can not be played Glenn and Matt are Trump's age, but have very different stories of Covid recovery to the president's US presidents are not elected directly. Instead, candidates compete to win a majority of votes in an electoral college - needing at least 270 out of the total of 538 up for grabs. Each state has a set number of electoral college votes which is equal to the number of representatives it sends to the US Congress. This means voters decide state-level contests. In all but two cases, the candidate who wins the state takes all the college votes for that state. This is why it is possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally but still fall short of the 270 needed in the electoral college and thus lose the election (as happened in 2016). Close races in crucial states like Florida mean Mr Trump may yet win re-election by capturing key electoral college-rich territories. Florida, with 29 votes in the electoral college, is one of the biggest states up for grabs, as only California and Texas have more. What is the US electoral college? A really simple guide to the US election Mr Trump is visiting a further three battleground states this week - Pennsylvania (with 20 electoral college votes), Iowa (six) and North Carolina (15). The Democrat is set to appear in Florida on Tuesday. Mr Biden, who made two appearances in the key state of Ohio on Monday, attacked the president's campaigning approach, saying that he ""comes to Sanford bringing nothing but reckless behaviour, divisive rhetoric and fear mongering"". Joe Biden held a drive-in campaign event in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday President Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points four years ago; however recent polls show this year's race to be tightening. Ohio has 18 electoral college votes. Mr Biden told car workers who had gathered in American-made vehicles in Toledo: ""215,000 dead because of Covid... Trump knew how dangerous the disease was but did nothing. Why didn't he warn us?"" Mr Biden touted his own record in the state, saying he and former President Barack Obama had played a key role in keeping the car industry afloat during the financial crisis and recession 10 years ago. The 77-year-old has taken a more cautious approach to campaigning, with his team announcing on Monday that he had tested negative for the virus again. Election officials in a number of key states are already seeing high levels of in-person early voting, with reports of hours-long queues in Georgia on Monday. The US Elections Project, a study run by Florida University professor Michael McDonald, puts the figure of early voters across the US as high as 10.5 million. A record number of people are also expected to vote by post due to the pandemic. Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues?

Harvester owner consulting on job cuts,"Mitchells & Butlers, the pubs and restaurants group, has begun redundancy consultations with a number of staff as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. M&B, whose chains include Harvester and All Bar One, has about 1,700 pubs and restaurants and 44,000 employees. It has not yet disclosed how many jobs are at risk. A spokesperson for the company described it as ""a difficult and regrettable decision"". M&B would ""seek to redeploy affected staff wherever possible"", the spokesperson added. ""Our industry is operating in exceptionally challenging and uncertain circumstances. ""While we have worked incredibly hard to make sites Covid-19 secure and keep staff and customers safe, we are facing significant difficulties from the recently introduced 10pm curfew for pubs, bars and restaurants, new enforced closures and tapering government support that doesn't go far enough."" M&B's spokesperson also called for further government support for the hospitality sector. ""With trading restrictions and uncertainty likely to continue for the foreseeable future, we strongly urge the government to step up the level of support it is offering to an industry which has been repeatedly singled out and taken the full brunt of restrictions."" Other well-known brands in the M&B stable include Toby Carvery and O'Neill's. The move comes after warnings by the hospitality industry that the new coronavirus restrictions will come asa huge blow to bars and restaurantsacross much of England. Bars and pubs in Liverpool have been instructed to close from Wednesday and will receive financial support.

Son recalls doorstep murder of his banker father,"This video can not be played Alistair Wilson murder: âMy only memory of my dad was when he was shotâ The son of bank worker Alistair Wilson, who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home in 2004, has appealed for help in catching his father's killer. Andrew Wilson was aged just four at the time of the murder in Nairn in the Highlands. He said the only memory he has left of his father is seeing him lying on the ground moments after being shot. It is the first time Mr Wilson has spoken publicly about the murder and how it has devastated his family. He said: ""I still cannot believe how someone could shoot my dad dead on our doorstep while my brother and I were upstairs. ""Photographs are all I have and no family should suffer the way we have all these years. ""I am appealing on behalf of my family to anyone who may have any information, no matter how big or small, toplease come forward,external. Someone out there could have the missing piece of information."" The doorstep murder of Alistair Wilson Alistair Wilson, 30, was shot at his home at about 19:00 on 28 November 2004. He later died in hospital. Mr Wilson's wife Veronica had answered the door to his killer - a stocky man wearing a baseball cap - who asked for Alistair Wilson. Mr Wilson spoke to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the word Paul written on it. He was then shot with a German-made handgun. A massive police inquiry was launched at the time, but no-one has been apprehended and detectives continue to investigate the case. A young Andrew Wilson with his father Alistair, mother Veronica and younger brother Andrew, now 20, recalled the moment he saw his father lying on the doorstep. He said: ""Someone came to our family home on a Sunday evening while my dad was reading my brother and me bedtime stories after our bath. ""The next thing I know I am looking at my dad lying in our doorway covered in blood."" Mr Wilson's family, along with detectives, are using the approaching 16th anniversary to make a renewed appeal for information in the hope of finally bringing someone to justice. Andrew says all he has left of his father are photographs Andrew Wilson and his brother at his father's graveside Andrew Wilson added: ""I was four years old when this happened and my dad was only 30. ""There would be no more bedtime stories, no more playing football or helping him in the garden. ""My dad and I missed out on so many things together, showing me how to tie a tie, driving lessons and taking me for my first pint. ""I am now a 20-year-old with little answers regarding my dad's death. For the last 16 years I have been left wondering why I didn't have a dad like all my friends. ""Nothing can bring my dad back, but knowing who did this and why could give us the closure we need. Any information could be crucial to our case."" This video can not be played Alistair Wilson's widow: 'A who and a why would let us move on' Det Insp Gary Winter, of the Major Investigation Team, has outlined the specific areas being focused on in the latest appeal. He said: ""The murderer was described in 2004 as a man aged 30-40 years old, stocky build and approximately 5ft 4in to 5ft 7in tall. ""Alistair's killer would now be approaching his 50s or 60s and has enjoyed a life denied to his victim and his family. ""The handgun used was a Haenel Suhl pocket pistol from the 1930s, which has distinctive H and S letters superimposed on the grip. ""We believe this weapon is likely to have been taken to the UK after World War Two as some form of souvenir, however the ammunition used in the murder is from the 1980s or 90s. ""Do you know of anyone who had a similar pocket pistol?  Do you know of anyone who mentioned having firearm souvenirs from the World War Two or from any family who were World War Two veterans?"" This is a murder which people, not just in the Highlands but across the world, are determined will be solved. All murders are shocking but this was so beyond the imagination that it has had people bewildered and frustrated for 16 years, including the police. Three years ago I interviewed Veronica Wilson, Alistair Wilson's husband. It was the first time she had been interviewed for a dozen years and it formed the spine of The Doorstep Murder podcast series. She revealed then that her older son, aged just four at the time, saw her father's body on the doorstep. It was hoped then that her pleas for new information would help find the killer. It generated many calls to both the BBC and Police Scotland but the murder remained unsolved. The fact that Alistair Wilson had been reading his young sons a bedtime story moments before he was shot so brutally has generated enormous sympathy and anger that his two boys have grown up without their father. So to hear from Andrew Wilson will reunite people with the details of the murder and, it's hoped, persuade someone with information to step forward after all these years. Listen toThe Doorstep Murder podcast on BBC Sounds. The doorstep murder shocked the residents of Nairn Police believe the murder weapon may have been brought to the UK after World War Two Det Insp Winter also highlighted the envelope given to Mr Wilson before the shooting - and the possibility that the murder was a case of mistaken identity. He said: ""The blue envelope handed to Alistair by the killer had the name Paul on it, which may or may not be relevant. Does this mean anything to you in the context of this investigation? ""Lastly, do you know any other person by the name Alistair Wilson, who may have been the intended target of violence or retribution to any extent?"" Mr Winter said the force remained committed to ensuring the person responsible for the murder was brought to justice.

Museum of the Year's Â£200k prize split five waysFive museums and galleries share the coveted title of Museum of the Year title for 2020.Entertainment & Arts,"Clockwise from top left: Aberdeen Art Gallery, Gairloch Museum, South London Gallery, Science Museum, Towner Eastbourne Five museums and galleries have shared the coveted title of Museum of the Year title for 2020 - and the annual award's increased prize fund of Â£200,000. The judges decided to split the honour five ways this year rather than picking one winner as usual. The winners range from London's Science Museum to Gairloch Museum, in a former nuclear bunker in north-west Scotland. The others are Aberdeen Art Gallery, South London Gallery and Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne, East Sussex. Jenny Waldman, director of the Art Fund, which runs the prize, said the winners were all ""exceptional examples of museums offering inspiration, reflection and joy in the heart of communities"". Museums ""can help rebuild our communities and confidence as we emerge from the virus"", she said, adding: ""But they face financial peril."" More about Museum of the Year on BBC Arts In recent years, the Museum of the Year winner has received Â£100,000, with four other shortlisted institutions getting Â£10,000 each. This year, the five winners will pocket Â£40,000 each. The Art Fund said the shake-up was a response to the ""unprecedented challenges that all museums face this year"". It's not the only award to be split this year -the Turner Prizewas converted to Â£10,000 bursaries for 10 artists rather than choosing a single winner. Aberdeen Art Gallery Aberdeen Art Galleryreopened last yearafter a redevelopment that increased the number of works on display from 370 to 1,080, and attracted 100,000 people in its first 100 days. The judges said they were impressed by ""the beautifully executed restoration, and the commitment to involve the people of the city in the future of this rediscovered jewel on their doorstep"". The gallery's manager Christine Rew said: ""The award will help us make a difference to the lives of artists and audiences."" Gairloch Museum On the north-west coast of Scotland, Gairloch Museum made a Â£2.4m move into a Cold War anti-aircraft command centre last year, which, according to The Art Fund, ""transformed a village eyesore into an important visitor attraction"". Curator Karen Buchanan said she hoped the recognition would bring ""our small, independent museum to the national stage"". She added: ""With the prize money, we will be able to invest in our planned outdoor museum space and procure expertise and equipment to redesign our events and outreach programme for a sustainable, digital future."" The Science Museum The judges said they ""recognised the shift-change that had taken place in this well-known and much respected institution, not only in its spaces, but also in its relationship with its visitors and local communities"". They also praised an overhaul that saw the opening of new galleries dedicated to medicine and London's scientific story from 1550-1800. Museum director Sir Ian Blatchford said they would use the prize money ""to support local schoolchildren from communities that aren't able to currently visit the museum with special outreach sessions"". South London Gallery The Camberwell venue was praised for an expansion that saw it take over the neighbouring Peckham Road Fire Station, as well as an ""exciting programme of exhibitions and events, and a highly regarded free education programme"". The judges were impressed by the gallery's ""integrity, creativity and inspiring leadership"". Gallery director Margot Heller said: ""The financial insecurity brought by lockdown has forced us to find new ways to connect with local schools and families. The award will allow us to continue our existing programmes, as well offering us the chance to commission an exciting new work."" Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne The gallery was praised for the way it had ""redefined its purpose as a free and open community resource and launched a new vision to transform communities through art"" despitea funding cut. The judges said they also admired its ""genuine commitment to promoting under-represented artists"". Director Joe Hill said: ""In the current unprecedented circumstances, we are proud to have continued to deliver a wide-ranging programme."" How have museums been doing since they reopened?

Trump returns to campaign trail in Florida,"This video can not be played Trump rally: âIâll just give you a big, fat kissâ President Donald Trump has returned to the campaign trail less than two weeks after testing positive for coronavirus. He told thousands of supporters, many not wearing masks, that he could give them ""a big fat kiss"", at a rally in the battleground state of Florida. His rival, Joe Biden, speaking in Ohio, accused the president of ""reckless behaviour"" since his diagnosis. The two presidential candidates are scrambling to secure votes with three weeks until the 3 November election. Opinion polls suggests Mr Biden has a 10-point lead over Mr Trump nationally. However his lead in some key states is narrower - as is the case in Florida, where the Democrat is 3.7 percentage points ahead, according to an average of polls collated by Real Clear Politics. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Why are infections rising again in US? President Trump's Florida speech fact-checked Battlegrounds like Florida and Ohio are crucial for gathering the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House, which is not determined by a simple count of votes nationwide. Mr Trump, 74, tested positive for Covid-19 some 12 days ago, and was admitted to hospital a day later. But on Sundayhis personal doctor said he was no longer a Covid transmission riskto others and disclosed on Monday that his most recent tests were negative over consecutive days, although he did not give the dates. Top US government scientist Anthony Fauci said holding big campaign rallies was ""asking for trouble"" as many states are battling an increase in coronavirus cases. At the scene - Nomia Iqbal, BBC News, Sanford, Florida The usual chants of ""Four more years!"" were heard as hundreds queued to enter the open-air space where the president made his appearance. People have been getting their temperature checked and were offered face masks. Those who covered up didn't think it was too soon for the president to be out and about. They said they admired him for it.  One man here told me he was originally from New York and had made Florida his home - just like ""his hero"" Donald Trump. The Trump campaign team is throwing everything at Florida - a loss here makes his return to the White House near impossible. This video can not be played Florida governor Ron DeSantis high-fives supporters at Trump rally Vice-President Mike Pence recently visited ""The Villages"", a famous retirement community, to court the elderly vote. But though the president and some of his supporters here seem relaxed about coronavirus, it has hit Florida hard, with more than 15,000 deaths. Joe Biden, who arrives in the state on Tuesday, is focusing on the administration's handling of the pandemic and plans to carry out a quieter but vigorous campaign in key suburban areas, which he hopes will help flip the state blue. In his first stump appearance following his Covid-19 diagnosis and recovery, a re-invigorated Mr Trump returned to his campaign's familiar themes and lines of attack against Mr Biden. He touted stock market growth, the establishment of the US Space Force and his successful confirmation of two conservative Supreme Court justices to the bench - with a third nominee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, before the Senate this week - as major achievements. In front of a crowd of several thousand he denounced plans to prolong Covid-related shutdowns supported by Democrats and sought to question Mr Biden's mental acuity. This video can not be played Did Joe Biden really say he was running for the Senate? Referring to his own recovery from Covid-19, he said at one point: ""They say I'm immune - I feel so powerful. I'll walk in there and kiss everyone. I'll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, I'll give you a big, fat kiss."" Though reinfections of the virus remain rare scientists are still questioning how long any potential immunity to the virus lasts. Man gets Covid twice and second hit 'more severe' Few people in the crowd were seen wearing masks or adhering to public health guidelines to keep at least 6ft (2m) apart to reduce the risk of transmitting Covid-19. Speaking to CNN, Dr Fauci said it was not the time to be holding full campaign rallies as the country battles the pandemic. ""We know that that is asking for trouble when you do that,"" he said. ""Now is even more so a worse time to do that, because when you look at what's going on in the United States, it's really very troublesome,"" he added, referring to increases in test positivity rates in a number of states. It was no surprise that Florida is the place where Mr Trump made his big rally return. He wants and needs to win Florida, a state he narrowly carried in 2016. It is also his adopted home. A lifelong New Yorker, he made himself a Florida resident in September last year. However, President Trump's support from seniors, which helped him win four years ago, appears to be dwindling, with his campaign trying to make up for the losses by courting African American and Hispanic voters. ""Every campaign changes from election to re-election,"" his campaign manager Bill Stepien told reporters on Monday. This video can not be played Glenn and Matt are Trump's age, but have very different stories of Covid recovery to the president's US presidents are not elected directly. Instead, candidates compete to win a majority of votes in an electoral college - needing at least 270 out of the total of 538 up for grabs. Each state has a set number of electoral college votes which is equal to the number of representatives it sends to the US Congress. This means voters decide state-level contests. In all but two cases, the candidate who wins the state takes all the college votes for that state. This is why it is possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally but still fall short of the 270 needed in the electoral college and thus lose the election (as happened in 2016). Close races in crucial states like Florida mean Mr Trump may yet win re-election by capturing key electoral college-rich territories. Florida, with 29 votes in the electoral college, is one of the biggest states up for grabs, as only California and Texas have more. What is the US electoral college? A really simple guide to the US election Mr Trump is visiting a further three battleground states this week - Pennsylvania (with 20 electoral college votes), Iowa (six) and North Carolina (15). The Democrat is set to appear in Florida on Tuesday. Mr Biden, who made two appearances in the key state of Ohio on Monday, attacked the president's campaigning approach, saying that he ""comes to Sanford bringing nothing but reckless behaviour, divisive rhetoric and fear mongering"". Joe Biden held a drive-in campaign event in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday President Trump won Ohio by eight percentage points four years ago; however recent polls show this year's race to be tightening. Ohio has 18 electoral college votes. Mr Biden told car workers who had gathered in American-made vehicles in Toledo: ""215,000 dead because of Covid... Trump knew how dangerous the disease was but did nothing. Why didn't he warn us?"" Mr Biden touted his own record in the state, saying he and former President Barack Obama had played a key role in keeping the car industry afloat during the financial crisis and recession 10 years ago. The 77-year-old has taken a more cautious approach to campaigning, with his team announcing on Monday that he had tested negative for the virus again. Election officials in a number of key states are already seeing high levels of in-person early voting, with reports of hours-long queues in Georgia on Monday. The US Elections Project, a study run by Florida University professor Michael McDonald, puts the figure of early voters across the US as high as 10.5 million. A record number of people are also expected to vote by post due to the pandemic. Why we might not get a result on election night Where does Donald Trump stand on key issues?

Parliamentary tussle over food standards resumes,"MPs have rejected the latest attempt to require imported food to meet domestic legal standards from 1 January. They struck down a Lords amendment to the Agriculture Bill to force trade deals to meet UK animal welfare and food safety rules. Campaigners have warned the UK could be forced to accept lower standards to secure a future US trade deal. But Farming minister Victoria Prentis said the government was ""absolutely committed to high standards"". Existing laws would safeguard them, she told the House of Commons, adding that these were ""of more use than warm words"" in maintaining animal welfare, food standards and environmental protections. Soil at heart of farm grant revolution Farmers welcome advisory body on fair trade deals The week ahead in Parliament The bill - designed to prepare the farming industry for when the UK no longer has to follow EU laws and rules next year - returned to the Commons on Monday following amendments by the House of Lords. The government says EU rules banning imports of chlorine-washed chicken and other products will be automatically written into UK law once the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. But peers made a number of changes, including one which would give MPs a veto over sections in trade deals relating to food imports, which would be required to comply with ""relevant domestic standards"". They argued these changes were necessary to make it impossible for the US or other countries to export so-called chlorinated chicken or beef fattened with hormones. However, MPs voted by 332 votes to 279 - a majority 53 - to back government plans to reject the amendment. This video can not be played Jamie Oliver accuses the government of using ""back door"" secondary legislation to avoid scrutiny of post-Brexit food standards However, Conservative MPs Sir Roger Gale and George Freeman said they would vote for the amendment to remain in the bill, saying it was in line with their party's 2019 manifesto pledge to maintain welfare standards. Neil Parish, the Conservative chairman of the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, told the Commons that Brexit meant UK agriculture could move in a ""much more environmental direction"", including planting more trees and cutting the use of nitrates. The country should be a ""beacon"" of high animal welfare and countryside-protection standards, he added. But Conservative MP John Lamont supported the government, saying the amendments were ""not in the interests"" of food producers or standards and would be ""bad for trade"". Party colleague Anthony Mangnall said there had been a ""huge amount of fear-mongering"" over the importation of chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef, and that ""has to stop"". In the Commons, Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Tim Farron said the controversy over chlorinated chicken was not ""about the quality of food"" but the ""integrity of our farming industry"". For Labour, shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said this was a ""crucial moment for British agriculture"", adding that high standards could all be ""thrown away"". He urged the government to ""show some leadership"" and ""back British farmers"". The bill must include guarantees that UK farmers would not be ""undercut"" in post-Brexit trade deals, Mr Pollard said. However another potential rebellion by backbench Tory MPs was avoided by the government when the deputy speaker ruled out an amendment to strengthen the new Trade and Agriculture Commission.

Updates were brought to you by: Alice Evans, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, Joshua Cheetham, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Paul Seddon and Paulin Kola Join us again tomorrow. Hello and thank you for following our coverage today. Here are some of the biggest developments around the world: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Recent advice from Sage, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies,has just been published.,external It includesrecommendations made in a meeting on 21 Sept,external, which included asking ministers to consider immediately introducing:  The government has stopped way short of this - perhaps why Prof Chris Whitty was so keen to demonstrate his view that the basic three tiers of measures aren't enough on their own. It also shows how much the political atmosphere has changed. At the beginning of the pandemic, ministers were very keen to be seen to be following Sage advice. This paper makes clear how they are making different decisions now. Quite the timing too, publishing all this about an hour after a national press conference. Read more from Laura, here. West Ham's London Stadium West Ham areagainst radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester Unitedto reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The proposals, which include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup, have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer as part of a plans for a Covid rescue package for English Football League clubs. Under the controversial plans, nine clubs would be given ""special voting rights"" on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. West Ham would be one of those nine clubs but it is understood they were unaware of the proposals - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday. A club insider has told BBC Sport they are ""very much against"" it. Read more about the Project Big Picture planshere. Hello and thank you for joining our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We've spent a lot of time following today's announcements by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here are some of the most significant developments across the rest of Europe: Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford hasthreatened a travel ban on visitors from Covid hotspots in England coming to Walesif the prime minister does not impose his own. He said he was giving UK ministers ""one final opportunity"" before he makes changes in Welsh law. The UK government announced on Monday that it will advise against non-essential travel from Merseyside - which is facing the toughest coronavirus restrictions in England - but it stopped short of making it illegal, angering Welsh ministers. Mr Drakeford said he could close the border with England, but that is not his preferred option. Fiona TrottBBC News Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up. On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives. The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, itâs getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise. It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who donât have the virus and still need urgent treatment. Itâs not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England. These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Away from the PM's announcements today, the pandemic's impact on students continues. Englandâs universities minister says it is âsimply outrageousâ how
much students have been charged for food parcels when they are forced into
self-isolation. Michelle Donelan has tapped into the debate about the conditions
facing students who have found themselves spending their new term in
self-isolation, after Covid outbreaks on campus. Responding to a question in the House of Commons about isolating
students being charged Â£18 per day for food, she said âno university should
seek to profit from students self-isolatingâ - and she promised to write to
universities to âmake the point"". ""Students self-isolating in catered halls should receive free
food, whilst other students should receive food which is either free - like many
universities including Sheffield Hallam and Edge Hill are doing - or at a price
which can be afforded within a student's budget,â said Ms Donelan. The University of East Anglia had been charging about Â£18 per day
for food for self-isolating students - but after accusations of taking advantage
of students, this was lowered last week to about Â£12 per day. The minister also revealed that there were now about 9,000 students
with Covid - describing the figure as a âcumulative number of cases over the
last seven daysâ. The UCU lecturersâ union has questioned why students have been
brought back to campus when so many are either catching coronavirus, or being
put into social isolation by outbreaks in their accommodation blocks. Labour MP Richard Burgon accused the government of playing âRussian
roulette with the lives of students, staff and local communitiesâ. Here are the main developments from the prime minister's press conference this evening:  Here are the main developments from other parts of the UK: Helen Pidd from the Guardian asks the PM if he accepts that decisions made on the national lockdown were made to suit London and the rest of the South - and asks if that's why the North is seeing such a surge in cases. The PM says he doesn't accept this, and that the main difference between this ""bout"" of Covid-19 and the one in April is that it's much more localised this time around. Pitt also asks Prof Whitty about evidence that curbs on pubs and restaurants work. Prof Whitty says all the evidence points towards increased transmission of the virus in indoor settings, particularly those where people mix with other households, and without wearing masks. This situation crops up in hospitality as well as in other sectors, he says - ""and that is why the hospitality sector has been involved in restrictions"". England's chief medical officer says there are ""two poles"" of a response to this virus - a full lockdown to suppress the virus, and no lockdown at all. ""What we're trying to do... is find the right balance between the various things - all of which cause harm, all of which we would not want to do - but which can, collectively, if we do them all together, pull the numbers down,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The question from the Liverpool Echo points to a possible political problem for the Prime Minister. His big promise at the election was about spreading opportunity beyond London and the South East. The fact that the virus is currently disproportionately affecting areas of the north of England risks making it look like itâs being hit harder or treated differently. As Rishi Sunak pointed out, though, these are nationally-applicable measures that any area could expect to see if rates rise A journalist from the Liverpool Echo asks about financial support for sectors struggling because of the restrictions. He asks whether people in such industries are ""valued less now"" than when the government was running the full furlough wage support scheme. The chancellor says thejob support scheme(JSS), which replaces furlough from next month, is a UK-wide scheme which treats businesses in all areas the same. He adds, though, that the JSS is a package the government believes is ""sustainable and affordable for the long term"". Boris Johnson is asked whether people will be asked to adhere to restrictions for a ""year or so"" if a vaccine is not found. He is also asked whether there are ""inconsistencies"" in the new system in terms of which areas have ended up in which tier. The prime minister replies that some ""anomalies"" are ""inevitably going to happen"". He adds that medical progress is being made against the disease, but local and national restrictions are the ""best utensil"" the country has ""for now"". Chris Whitty says medical progress is impossible to predict exactly but he is ""extremely confident"" the country will go into ""next winter"" in a ""much better place"". Beth Rigby from Sky News reads the PM's opening remarks back to him - ""we must act now"", he said, against the ""flashboard warnings"" of increasing cases and hospital admissions. Rigby points out that since Liverpool is the only area facing any vastly more stringent measures, that the PM's ""rhetoric is ""outstripping the measures"". She suggests the reason for that might be that local leaders are reluctant to accept the government's plans for local restrictions. But Johnson says he wants to ""take local authorities with me"" because local knowledge, enforcement and contact tracing are ""immensely valuable"" in helping to tackle the spread of the virus. He has a stark message for any local leader who is not willing to agree with the three-tiered system. ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of national government to take the necessary action to protect the public,"" he says. Next up, ITV's Robert Peston asks whether more areas in the north of England would be in the ""very high"" areas without the interventions so far. Boris Johnson says the government is working ""particularly"" with badly affected areas in the north of England and ""stands ready"" to work with all local areas. Chris Whitty says the data showed the need to ""do more"" with the extra restrictions. He adds, though, that it is an ""illusion"" to think that the virus can be further suppressed ""without causing harm"" in areas such as the economy. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnsonâs reference to the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram shows the importance of local leaders in all of this. Some, like the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, are very unhappy about the tier the government has put them into. He said he was not expecting Birmingham and some surrounding areas to see the restrictions on mixing in pubs and restaurants which have been announced. It's time for questions from journalists, and the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks several - including about whether financial support is enough for people facing restrictions, and whether the restrictions themselves will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Exams in England delayed but still going aheadA-levels and GCSEs to go ahead next year - but head teachers are angry at the lack of a back-up plan.Family & Education,"Next summer's A-levels and GCSEs in England are going ahead - but with reduced content for some subjects and a start date pushed back by three weeks. Most exams will now start from 7 June, rather than mid-May, in an attempt to make up for lost teaching time. Head teachers accused ministers of an ""inadequate response"" to the scale of disruption facing pupils and teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said further back-up plans would be decided later for ""all scenarios"". The Department for Education says it expects vocational qualifications to also align with this changed timetable. There were warnings that running a full set of exams would be unfair to schools in the north of England, which have faced particular disruption from Covid outbreaks. Scotland cancels next year's National 5 exams Northern Ireland's exams to start later next summer Almost one in five schools sending home pupils Ministers propose delay to next summer's exams ""They are the ones most likely to have been impacted by school closures following year group bubbles of pupils having to be sent home,"" said Sarah Mulholland of the Northern Powerhouse lobbying group. Exam boards, represented by the Joint Council for Qualifications, said the ""trade off"" of a later start would be a more ""compressed"" exam timetable, with the same number of exams across a shorter number of days. But Mr Williamson said: ""Exams are the fairest way of judging a student's performance so they will go ahead, underpinned by contingency measures developed in partnership with the sector. ""Students have experienced considerable disruption and it's right we give them, and their teachers, the certainty that exams will go ahead and more time to prepare."" The promised ""contingency measures"" will address how exams will be further adapted in the face of local lockdowns and if exams cannot go ahead as planned. But head teachers were angry at the lack of a decision over what those contingency plans might be - and what information they should be gathering in case exams are cancelled again and grades have to be estimated. The delayed start date - proposed by ministers in June - was described by heads' union leader Geoff Barton as of ""marginal benefit"" compared with the amount of lost teaching time from the pandemic. He said it had ""taken an eternity"" for the government's response - which he warned still did not address how exams could be a level playing field for pupils who had faced different levels of disruption. Pupils due to take exams have already have lost months of teaching time - and many are still facing further disruption, with almost one in five secondary schools sending home pupils because of Covid cases. Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, said it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that there was still no decision on a ""fall-back"" plan if exams are further disrupted. She said the announcement was an ""appalling example of political ideology trumping practical reality"". But Glenys Stacey, interim head of Ofqual, said the announcement would ""optimise the time now available"" and provided certainty over what schools needed to teach. ""Of course, we will need contingency plans. We are discussing with government, exam boards and the sector, the detail of that - taking into account the risk of disruption at an individual, local and regional level,"" she said. Her predecessor had resigned after the chaos of trying to produce replacement grades, when exams had been cancelled. ""I am taking my A-levels next year and I don't feel confident at all about the delaying of exams and I feel it doesn't address the inequality in education that has occurred due to large numbers of students self-isolating,"" said Keira from London. And she says there needs to be a plan that will be fair ""in the event of exams not taking place"". Another A-level student, Stephen from Devon, backed the decision to press ahead with exams as fairest option. ""I would be very disappointed not to be given the opportunity to prove my ability to exam boards to achieve the grade I truly deserve, not one generated by an algorithm or even allocated by a teacher,"" he said. Hannah from Leicester said it would be unfair not to reduce how much will still need to be studies for A-levels. ""The loss of teaching time means we should be able to have less content for our final exam."" The modifications to exams will be those previously put forward by the Ofqual qualifications watchdog - which Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, had described as ""only tinkering at the edges"". These included removing field trips from geography and reducing the areas needed to be covered for English literature. Teachers' unions had suggested that questions should be structured differently next year - such as providing more options so that pupils would be able to answer a question on a topic they had studied, no matter how much of the course their school had managed to cover. Mr Williamson said results days for A-levels and GCSEs next year will be in the same week - 24 August for A-levels and 27 August for GCSEs. The universities minister has already said that universities could change their autumn term dates if they needed to accommodate school exams being pushed back. The announcement for England is aless radical approach than Scotland,where last week exams for National 5 qualifications were cancelled, replacing them with teacher assessments and course work, while still going ahead with Higher exams. Scotland's education secretary had said it was ""too big a risk"" to plan a full set of exams when there was so much uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic in the months ahead. In Northern Ireland, exams are going ahead but with reductions in course content and a delayed starting date - plus the promise of a contingency plan. Are you sitting GCSEs or A-levels next year?

"Brexit: Time for trade deal getting short, PM warns","Lord Frost and Michel Barnier are continuing to talk, ahead of Thursday's EU summit Boris Johnson has been clear with the EU that the time left to get a post-Brexit trade deal in place is in ""short supply"", Downing Street says. The prime minister has set a deadline of this Thursday, after which he has said the UK is ready to ""walk away"". No 10 said the time limit was still in place and the government was trying to ""bridge"" disagreements over fishing rights and state aid for businesses. Meanwhile, the UK's negotiating team is in Brussels for further talks. These come after Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for an intensification of discussions. The prime minister set his deadline to coincide with the start of an EU summit, at which leaders will discuss the state of the trade talks. Brexit: Trade negotiators meet, as deadline looms 'Put cards on table' over trade deal, says EU What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Both sides have spoken of progress in the last couple of weeks, but there are still major disagreements on two issues in particular. First, the EU wants the UK to follow its rules on state aid - financial assistance given by government to businesses - but the UK says it would undermine independence. Second, the UK wants full access to EU markets to sell its fish, but in return the EU is demanding full access for its fishing fleets to UK waters - which the UK does not want to provide. It has been reported that France isready to rule out a deal,externalif the UK does not back down over fishing rights. If no agreement is reached, the UK and EU would do business under World Trade Organisation rules from 1 January next year, which would mean tariffs on goods. Last week, Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin said ""movement"" was required before ""end-state negotiations"" could begin. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord Frost, said he would advise the prime minister on whether the UK's set conditions for a deal have been met following his talks with EU counterpart Michel Barnier in Brussels.

âInappropriateâ government job ad removed,"Downing Street has added its voice to criticism of a government-backed advert suggesting a ballet dancer should retrain in cyber security. A No 10 spokesperson said it was ""not appropriate"" and had been taken down. The ad, the latest in a long-running campaign to promote cyber security jobs, sparked a social media backlash. It had already been disowned by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who said the ""crass"" ad did not come from his department. Acclaimed choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne was among Twitter users criticising the advert, asking in a tweet: ""This has to be a joke? Right?"" The advert depicts a ballet dancer and reads: ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber (she just doesn't know it yet). Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" It is attributed to CyberFirst, a programme led by the National Cyber Security Centre to encourage young people to get into tech, and to HM Government. Critics on Twitter called the advert ""patronising"", saying it showed the government was not helping the arts through the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

""This was part of a campaign encouraging people from all walks of life to think about career in cyber-security, but this piece of content was not appropriate and has been removed,"" Downing Street said. Mr Dowden said in a tweet: ""I want to save jobs in the arts"", and underlined that Â£1.57bn was being invested in the industry.

The image, the latest in a series of promotions that started last year under a ""Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" campaign, has now been removed. Before its removal, it read: ""If your career plan's been altered this year, you're not alone. ""2020 has shaken up jobs - but most successful careers have a turning point. The government-backed Rethink. Reskill. Reboot. programme by CyberFirst could be yours."" By Alistair Coleman, BBC anti-disinformation team The reaction to this ""Rethink Reskill Reboot"" campaign was immediate on social media, and the ballet dancer picture was replaced by a picture of a baker almost immediately. In the context of the difficulties facing the arts during the Covid-19 pandemic, it's a sensitive subject. The use of a ballet dancer - seen through the narrow focus of social media - seems dreadfully timed and at least one government minister agrees. The Chancellor's comments during an ITV interview last week have caused confusion around jobs in the arts, but it seems he was talking about all job sectors, rather than the arts in particular. However, it's the persistent belief that he was referring to people in creative industries retraining into new careers that has caused anger. As for the courses themselves, QA have been running vocational courses under the CyberFirst name since 2017, in partnership with the government's NCSC, and sometimes alongside companies like BAE Systems - so these campaigns are not new. Last year, the NCSC used the CyberFirst brand in an event aimed at steering school pupils toward a career in cyber-security, and they have told Huffington Post that the current ""Reboot"" campaign has no connection with them. The image of ""Fatima"" comes from a photograph by Atlanta-based photographer Krys Alex published on Instagram in July 2017. The original picture shows dancers Desire'e Kelley and Tasha Williams from the Vibez in Motion Dance Studio in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Fatima"" is Atlanta-based dancer Desire'e Kelley, pictured here with Tasha Williams The coronavirus pandemic has forced industries to scale back their businesses and cut jobs, including many music venues and cultural organisations. Last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that all workers needed to adapt to the changing environment. He told ITV: ""Can things happen in exactly the way they did? No. But everyone is having to find ways to adapt and adjust to the new reality."" Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, the National Cyber Security Centre and GCHQ have all been contacted for comment.

Firms fear 'ominous winter',"This video can not be played Joe Anderson said a local furlough scheme is needed to compensate businesses forced to close Business owners in Merseyside say they are fearful for the future after the government unveiled a new three-tier lockdown system for England. The Liverpool City Region has become the first area to enter the ""very high"" alert levelunder the new system. It will mean the closure of pubs, bars, betting shops, gyms, leisure centres and casinos from Wednesday. Managers have spoken of their heartbreak, anger and confusion over the latest announcement of measures to tackle the spread of Covid-19. Merseyside reacts to three-tier plans Liverpool on ""highest tier"" of new alert system How many cases are there in your area? Gareth Morgan said the ""final nail in the coffin"" for pubs was limiting people to only their social bubbles Gareth Morgan, who runs independent pub Dead Crafty Beer Co in Liverpool city centre, said closing pubs was ""devastating"" and would ""really hurt, if not ruin"" the industry. ""So many little bars won't survive without more support,"" he said. The 41-year-old, who has five members of staff, said employees needed full compensation when pubs were forced to close. Mr Morgan added his trade was 58% down on last year's figures after halving capacity in the pub and having to close at 22:00 each night. In a bid to mitigate the effect of the new rules, the government will pay up to 67% of the wages of workers at firms told to shut. This will bepart of the Job Support Scheme,which replaces furlough at the start of November. But Mr Morgan said he believed the measures were insufficient for many workers in the hospitality industry. ""Paying workers 67% sounds good but, in reality, for staff to pay bills it is nowhere near enough,"" he said. Takings for Bodytorque, which is run by Ashley Hughes, are 50% down on last year Gym owner Ashley Hughes, from Huyton, Knowsley, said further restrictions were ""heartbreaking"" as so many people were ""already on the brink and living off their overdraft"". ""So many businesses are closing and people are losing their jobs and even their homes,"" he said. The 33-year-old said gyms had taken a ""massive hit"" in 2020, the worst of his nine years trading with his company, Bodytorque. ""I got a grant during lockdown but that just about covered the rent during the four months we were shut."" After reopening he found customers were reluctant to return as many were ""cutting back"" on spending. He said it was ""very worrying"" for gyms but also for people's wellbeing as ""many people use the gym to improve their mental health"". Keith Haggis said restrictions had been a nightmare for his business Keith Haggis, owner of Keith's Food & Wine Bar in Liverpool, said allowing restaurants to remain open with the current restrictions in place was ""disastrous"". He said he believed his business would have been better off closed as his staff would be compensated and he may have had access to grants. Staying open under current restrictions means his only option is to ""limp on and survive"". The further restrictions such as limited hours, capacity and restricting people to sit only with people from their households or social bubbles had been a ""nightmare"" and it had ""decimated turnover"", he added. Nick Thompson said the company would find a way to pay out any winning bets from closed shops safely The managing director of Merseyside-based bookmakers Dave Pluck has called on the government to review the tier-three lockdown ""sooner than the four weeks stated"". ""A large part of the Liverpool area is deprived and needs further help. It seems to me that it is being used as a test case by the government,"" said Nick Thompson. ""They know they have few votes in the area so maybe they don't mind if they lose those. I could not imagine this level of lockdown taking place in the south."" He has called on the government to provide financial support to businesses in need. ""I can see no science to support local lockdowns being an effective measure at present,"" he added. ""I am keen to help wherever possible, and will clearly follow any government guidelines, but I would ask that extra financial aid is available."" Despite the difficulties ahead, Mr Thompson added that ""as we did in the full lockdown, we will be back"". Julie O'Grady said she feels like the north has been ""hung out to dry"" Julie O'Grady, co-owner of Neptune Brewery, said the latest coronavirus measures for Merseyside had left many unanswered questions. Ms O'Grady, who runs the company with her husband Les, said: ""It's just so frustrating. Nothing seems to make sense. ""We fear for people's heath as well but give us the financial support so we can survive. ""As a brewery we have done everything we possibly can to ensure everyone's safety. ""There are signs up, we have used temperature thermometers when people come in, there is hand gel, we have been taking people's details. ""We have done everything we can and that's still not enough."" Jez Lamb said an ""ominous winter lies ahead"" Jez Lamb, who founded craft beer marketplace Beers@No.42 in Birkenhead, Wirral, almost 15 years ago, said: ""Striking the right balance is proving a nightmare. ""As things stand many more businesses will go to the wall and many more people will lose their jobs,"" he said. ""Tighter lockdown restrictions could see an economy that is already on life support start to flat-line. An ominous winter lies ahead."" Some pubs had already decided to shut in advance of the prime minister's announcement. The owners of Ye Cracke, the Pilgrim Pub and the Swan Inn in Liverpool city centre closed on Sunday. It said in a statement on its Facebook page: ""Due to the expected government announcements on Monday we have decided to close this Sunday at 10pm until further notice."" Some of the highest rates of new coronavirus infections have been recorded in the Liverpool City Region. In the week to 8 October there were nearly 670 positive tests per 100,000 people in Knowsley and almost 599 per 100,000 in Liverpool. Sefton, St Helens and Halton are all within the top 20 out of 315 areas of England. While Wirral had the lowest rate of the six boroughs that make up the city region, it still recorded 286 cases per 100,000. When deciding whether to impose local lockdowns, public health experts and the government will take account not just of the rate for each area but also its trend - how quickly cases may be rising or falling - as well as what local plans are in place, hospital admissions and deaths.

Farmer jailed for Tesco baby food blackmail plot,"Nigel Wright was caught on CCTV at Tesco in Lockerbie A farmer who laced baby food with metal shards in an attempt to blackmail Tesco has been jailed for 14 years. Nigel Wright, 45, of Osgodby, Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, contaminated jars of Heinz baby food and placed them on supermarket shelves. He then wrote to Tesco threatening that babies would be seriously or fatally injured unless he was paid Â£1.4m. Wright was found guilty in August of three counts of blackmail and two charges of contaminating goods. More stories from around Lincolnshire No babies were harmed but the metal was spotted by two mothers who were only moments away from feeding their children. Police said an urgent recall of baby food led to 42,000 jars being recovered. There was no evidence that further jars had been tampered with. The jury at the Old Bailey heard Wright demanded Tesco pay him his ransom in the online currency Bitcoin. Nigel Wright was sentenced to a total of 14 years in jail The sheep farmer was convicted of a further charge of blackmail for demanding Â£150,000 worth of Bitcoin from a driver with whom he had a road rage row. He was sentenced to 11 years for his plot against Tesco, and a further three years to run consecutively for the road rage blackmail. In that case, Wright sent a letter to the driver demanding Bitcoin and threatening to kill him and his wife and children if he did not comply. Judge Mr Justice Warby said: ""You were under no pressure from others, or from circumstances. ""It is not as if you had - for instance - a legitimate grievance against Tesco, nor can any other explanation easily be identified for engaging in this series of repulsive actions, apart from greed."" Hertfordshire Police, who led the investigation, said Wright claimed he had been forced to carry out the baby food plot by travellers who were threatening him, but had no evidence of this. Det Insp Lucy Thomson said: ""Wright is a dangerous offender who gave no thought to the babies he could have harmed during his callous pursuit of money.""

BTS in trouble in China over Korean War comments,"RM (2nd from right) is the band's leader South Korean K-pop group BTS is facing a backlash in China over comments a member made about the Korean War. In a speech, the band's leader, known as RM, mentioned South Korea's shared ""history of pain"" with the US over the 1950-53 conflict, in which the two countries fought together. But his remarks have angered Chinese social media users, as Beijing backed the North in the war. The controversy also appears to have affected commercial deals. Adverts featuring BTS from companies including Samsung, sports brand Fila and car manufacturer Hyundai disappeared from a number of Chinese websites or social media platforms, although it is unclear who removed them. K-pop has a large following in China and BTS - one of the most successful groups - are no different, with at least five million fans on China's popular social media platform Weibo. BTS members to become multi-millionaires 'No words, just tears' as BTS tops Billboard RM's comments came as BTS received an award celebrating relations between the US and South Korea. ""We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women,"" he said. But his words were met with an angry response by some social media users in China, who noted the losses their country also suffered in the war. ""They [BTS] should not make any money from China,"" one user commented on Weibo, reported Reuters news agency. ""If you want to make money from Chinese fans you have to consider Chinese feelings."" According to the Global Times, a state-run newspaper with a nationalistic perspective, ""Chinese netizens said the band's totally one-sided attitude to the Korean War hurts their feelings and negates history"", adding that the comments were designed to ""play up"" to US audiences. Around 200,000 South Korean soldiers and 36,000 American soldiers died during the Korean War, as well as millions of civilians. Chinese state media say 180,000 soldiers from China also lost their lives. It was difficult to gauge the scale of the backlash to RM's comments among BTS's Chinese fan base. Some were calling on each other to stay low-key and quiet on Weibo posts. And a number of people on Twitter defended the group, noting that RM's speech did not mention China directly. The seven-member BTS is popular around the world and have broken a number of records. Earlier this year, their single Dynamite became the most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours, with 101.1 million views in a day. The controversy comes days before Big Hit Entertainment, the agency that manages BTS, is set to go public in Seoul in an initial public offering expected to value the company at up to $4bn (Â£3bn).

How do pandemics end," We are in the grip of a pandemic like none other in living memory. While people are pinning their hopes on a vaccine to wipe it out, the fact is most of the infections faced by our ancestors are still with us. Scroll down ↓ to find out how some of those pandemics came to an end, giving us clues as to how our future may unfold. This is Jasmine. Just like us, her ancestors survived a number of pandemics.  Take a journey back in time to see what diseases they faced. Back in the Dark Ages, about 60 generations ago, Jasmine's relatives lived through a series of outbreaks of the bubonic plague. The disease, caused by bacteria transmitted by fleas on rats and via respiratory droplets from infected people, was devastating. It killed hundreds of millions of people over a period of 2,000 years. The Black Death of 1346-1353 is considered the deadliest outbreak of all. It is believed the disease, which causes swollen and infected lymph nodes, called buboes, was finally brought under control by strict quarantining and improved sanitation, among other things. But none of this could have happened without an understanding of how transmission occurred, says Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London. This is something that still applies today. ""Once you have the knowledge, and you share the knowledge, then you are able to take measures to push transmission much lower,"" he says. Yet cases of the plague still occur - for example, in Inner Mongolia in July this year - and, in theory, Jasmine could still catch it. Numbers are low though, and the disease can now be successfully treated with antibiotics. Hundreds of years later, Jasmine's ancestors faced the spectre of smallpox. The disease, caused by the virus variola minor, is one of the deadliest known to humans. It caused fluid-filled pustules to develop all over the body and at its height, about three out of every 10 people with the disease died. It could be spread via droplets from an infected person's nose or mouth or via their sores. Like the plague, smallpox killed hundreds of millions of people - 300 million in the 20th Century alone. But, thanks to a vaccine developed in 1796 by British doctor Edward Jenner and the efforts of the scientific community, the disease has been completely erased - although it took nearly two centuries to do so. Smallpox remains the only human disease to have been eradicated this way. Prof Riley regards this feat as one of the greatest achievements of mankind - rivalling the Moon landings. ""It could be seen as the greatest return on a public investment ever,"" he says, referencing the annual savings the world has enjoyed thanks to the absence of the disease. Because of this achievement of science, we, and Jasmine, are no longer at risk. Then, just eight generations ago, Jasmine's great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great grandparents faced the threat of cholera. The disease, caused by contaminated food or drinking water, has killed millions of people in seven pandemics, according to the World Health Organization. But while improved hygiene and sanitation in the West has removed the threat of the disease, it remains endemic - or common -  in many low-income countries and kills between 100,000 and 140,000 people every year, according to the WHO. ""You plumb your way out of cholera,"" says Prof Riley. ""If the plumbing goes wrong, it can spread very quickly."" Because of this, depending on where Jasmine calls home, she could still be at risk of catching it and dying, despite the availability of a vaccine and the disease's easy treatment. Jasmine's family would also have lived through a number of flu pandemics. The biggest recorded was in the early 20th century, around the time of her great-great grandparents. The 1918 Influenza pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Spanish flu, was the most severe outbreak in recent history, killing 50-100 million people worldwide. Much like with the new coronavirus today, isolation and quarantine slowed transmission. After two waves between 1918 and 1920, that particular H1N1 strain of flu faded away to become a more benign version that still circulates every year. But other flu pandemics followed. The Hong Kong flu of 1968 killed one million people and also still circulates as a seasonal flu. As does Swine Flu - a version of the H1N1 virus - which infected about 21% of the world's population in 2009. Flu continues to pose ""a pandemic threat"", says Prof Riley, and Jasmine, and us, remain at risk of experiencing another pandemic caused by such viruses. We are also at risk of catching seasonal flu, which continues to kill hundreds of thousands every year. Then, about four decades ago, Jasmine's parents lived through the spread of HIV/Aids - regarded by some as a pandemic but described as a ""global epidemic"" by the WHO. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) - transmitted through bodily fluids - has claimed more than 32 million lives across the globe so far. HIV could be regarded as an ""worst case scenario virus"", says Prof Riley, because of the length of time it takes to develop symptoms and its high fatality rate. It spreads fast because people don't necessarily know they have it. However, advances in diagnostic techniques and global public health campaigns - which have changed sexual behaviour and increased the availability of safe injections for drug users - have helped slow the growth in infections. Despite this, an estimated 690,000 people died from Aids in 2019, according to WHO figures. Although there is no cure for HIV, if Jasmine lived in a country with good healthcare and access to antiretroviral drugs, she could now lead a long and healthy life. However, if she lived in a low-income country and did not have such provision, she may well still be at risk. Two and three decades later - during Jasmine's own lifetime - came the threat of Sars and Mers. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) - the first deadly epidemic caused by a coronavirus - killed more than 800 between 2002 and 2003, according to the WHO. But by late July 2003, no new cases were being reported, and the WHO declared the global outbreak to be over. A little later came Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers), also a coronavirus, which has killed 912 people. Most cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula. While the risk of contracting the virus, known as Mers-CoV, in the UK, for example, is regarded as very low, it remains higher in the Middle East - with humans usually infected by camels. As such, while Jasmine could still catch Mers, the risk is low in most countries. Now, in Jasmine's and our lifetimes, we are facing the spectre of the new Sars coronavirus, which triggers the respiratory disease Covid-19. Sars-Cov-2, as it is known, is an evolved version of the 2003 Sars virus and is regarded by disease specialists as unique, thanks to its range of symptoms - from none to deadly - and high levels of transmission by people without symptoms or before they develop them. ""Because of that, many populations have not been able to control it,"" says Prof Riley. More than a million people have died with the virus so far - but the overall toll is likely to become much higher. While the hunt for a vaccine and effective treatments continues, the risk remains real for the vast majority of the global population. Jasmine, like us, is still at risk. So the coronavirus now circulating in our communities is just the latest in a long line of pandemics caused by emerging pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. Increased knowledge about transmission, public health campaigns, new treatments and vaccines have all played their part in bringing previous crises to an end. The end-game for the current pandemic is also likely to come from a combination of similar measures. Although a ""safe, highly-effective"" vaccine could bring about its conclusion, says Prof Riley, finding one is ""by no means a given"". Instead, we may have to get better at living with it while developing a level of resistance to the disease. ""Definitely by five years, hopefully much sooner, we'll either have a really good vaccine that is being used throughout the world or we'll have muddled on long enough that we've accumulated enough immunity and learned how to live with small resurgent outbreaks,"" he says. And as the eradication of smallpox proved, when the world's scientific community comes together, great things are possible. Although the new coronavirus is a much trickier challenge, because of its high levels of asymptomatic transmission, Prof Riley is optimistic the ""incredible"" global quest for a solution will win through. ""The world has never had a shared project like this before,"" he says. ""Hopefully it becomes a shared success at some point."" However, it may serve us well to remember that most of the pathogens that rampaged through societies in pandemics in the past are still around. While the crises ended, the viruses and bacteria - and their resulting infections - remain.

LiveLivePM does not want national lockdown 'right now'5 minutes ago,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells a news conference he is taking a ""balanced approach"" to managing the virus But he says he does not favour another national lockdown ""right now"" because it would harm the economy Boris Johnson tells the Commons there will be a new three-level alert system for England - medium, high and very high Liverpool will be on the highest level of alert, the PM says. He adds he does not want a new national lockdown More people are in hospital with Covid than before lockdown in March, says NHS medical director Stephen Powis Top UK scientific advisers have said NHS Nightingale hospitals are on stand-by in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate Most A-level and GCSE exams in England will be delayed by three weeks in 2021 In China, Qingdao's population of nine million will be tested for Covid-19 over five days after 12 cases There are more than 37 million confirmed cases globally with more than 1.07 million deaths Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our live coverage today. Updates were brought to you by: Alice Evans, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, Joshua Cheetham, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Paul Seddon and Paulin Kola Join us again tomorrow. Hello and thank you for following our coverage today. Here are some of the biggest developments around the world: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Recent advice from Sage, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies,has just been published.,external It includesrecommendations made in a meeting on 21 Sept,external, which included asking ministers to consider immediately introducing:  The government has stopped way short of this - perhaps why Prof Chris Whitty was so keen to demonstrate his view that the basic three tiers of measures aren't enough on their own. It also shows how much the political atmosphere has changed. At the beginning of the pandemic, ministers were very keen to be seen to be following Sage advice. This paper makes clear how they are making different decisions now. Quite the timing too, publishing all this about an hour after a national press conference. Read more from Laura, here. West Ham's London Stadium West Ham areagainst radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester Unitedto reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The proposals, which include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup, have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer as part of a plans for a Covid rescue package for English Football League clubs. Under the controversial plans, nine clubs would be given ""special voting rights"" on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. West Ham would be one of those nine clubs but it is understood they were unaware of the proposals - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday. A club insider has told BBC Sport they are ""very much against"" it. Read more about the Project Big Picture planshere. Hello and thank you for joining our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We've spent a lot of time following today's announcements by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here are some of the most significant developments across the rest of Europe: Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford hasthreatened a travel ban on visitors from Covid hotspots in England coming to Walesif the prime minister does not impose his own. He said he was giving UK ministers ""one final opportunity"" before he makes changes in Welsh law. The UK government announced on Monday that it will advise against non-essential travel from Merseyside - which is facing the toughest coronavirus restrictions in England - but it stopped short of making it illegal, angering Welsh ministers. Mr Drakeford said he could close the border with England, but that is not his preferred option. Fiona TrottBBC News Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up. On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives. The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, itâs getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise. It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who donât have the virus and still need urgent treatment. Itâs not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England. These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Away from the PM's announcements today, the pandemic's impact on students continues. Englandâs universities minister says it is âsimply outrageousâ how
much students have been charged for food parcels when they are forced into
self-isolation. Michelle Donelan has tapped into the debate about the conditions
facing students who have found themselves spending their new term in
self-isolation, after Covid outbreaks on campus. Responding to a question in the House of Commons about isolating
students being charged Â£18 per day for food, she said âno university should
seek to profit from students self-isolatingâ - and she promised to write to
universities to âmake the point"". ""Students self-isolating in catered halls should receive free
food, whilst other students should receive food which is either free - like many
universities including Sheffield Hallam and Edge Hill are doing - or at a price
which can be afforded within a student's budget,â said Ms Donelan. The University of East Anglia had been charging about Â£18 per day
for food for self-isolating students - but after accusations of taking advantage
of students, this was lowered last week to about Â£12 per day. The minister also revealed that there were now about 9,000 students
with Covid - describing the figure as a âcumulative number of cases over the
last seven daysâ. The UCU lecturersâ union has questioned why students have been
brought back to campus when so many are either catching coronavirus, or being
put into social isolation by outbreaks in their accommodation blocks. Labour MP Richard Burgon accused the government of playing âRussian
roulette with the lives of students, staff and local communitiesâ. Here are the main developments from the prime minister's press conference this evening:  Here are the main developments from other parts of the UK: Helen Pidd from the Guardian asks the PM if he accepts that decisions made on the national lockdown were made to suit London and the rest of the South - and asks if that's why the North is seeing such a surge in cases. The PM says he doesn't accept this, and that the main difference between this ""bout"" of Covid-19 and the one in April is that it's much more localised this time around. Pitt also asks Prof Whitty about evidence that curbs on pubs and restaurants work. Prof Whitty says all the evidence points towards increased transmission of the virus in indoor settings, particularly those where people mix with other households, and without wearing masks. This situation crops up in hospitality as well as in other sectors, he says - ""and that is why the hospitality sector has been involved in restrictions"". England's chief medical officer says there are ""two poles"" of a response to this virus - a full lockdown to suppress the virus, and no lockdown at all. ""What we're trying to do... is find the right balance between the various things - all of which cause harm, all of which we would not want to do - but which can, collectively, if we do them all together, pull the numbers down,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The question from the Liverpool Echo points to a possible political problem for the Prime Minister. His big promise at the election was about spreading opportunity beyond London and the South East. The fact that the virus is currently disproportionately affecting areas of the north of England risks making it look like itâs being hit harder or treated differently. As Rishi Sunak pointed out, though, these are nationally-applicable measures that any area could expect to see if rates rise A journalist from the Liverpool Echo asks about financial support for sectors struggling because of the restrictions. He asks whether people in such industries are ""valued less now"" than when the government was running the full furlough wage support scheme. The chancellor says thejob support scheme(JSS), which replaces furlough from next month, is a UK-wide scheme which treats businesses in all areas the same. He adds, though, that the JSS is a package the government believes is ""sustainable and affordable for the long term"". Boris Johnson is asked whether people will be asked to adhere to restrictions for a ""year or so"" if a vaccine is not found. He is also asked whether there are ""inconsistencies"" in the new system in terms of which areas have ended up in which tier. The prime minister replies that some ""anomalies"" are ""inevitably going to happen"". He adds that medical progress is being made against the disease, but local and national restrictions are the ""best utensil"" the country has ""for now"". Chris Whitty says medical progress is impossible to predict exactly but he is ""extremely confident"" the country will go into ""next winter"" in a ""much better place"". Beth Rigby from Sky News reads the PM's opening remarks back to him - ""we must act now"", he said, against the ""flashboard warnings"" of increasing cases and hospital admissions. Rigby points out that since Liverpool is the only area facing any vastly more stringent measures, that the PM's ""rhetoric is ""outstripping the measures"". She suggests the reason for that might be that local leaders are reluctant to accept the government's plans for local restrictions. But Johnson says he wants to ""take local authorities with me"" because local knowledge, enforcement and contact tracing are ""immensely valuable"" in helping to tackle the spread of the virus. He has a stark message for any local leader who is not willing to agree with the three-tiered system. ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of national government to take the necessary action to protect the public,"" he says. Next up, ITV's Robert Peston asks whether more areas in the north of England would be in the ""very high"" areas without the interventions so far. Boris Johnson says the government is working ""particularly"" with badly affected areas in the north of England and ""stands ready"" to work with all local areas. Chris Whitty says the data showed the need to ""do more"" with the extra restrictions. He adds, though, that it is an ""illusion"" to think that the virus can be further suppressed ""without causing harm"" in areas such as the economy. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnsonâs reference to the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram shows the importance of local leaders in all of this. Some, like the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, are very unhappy about the tier the government has put them into. He said he was not expecting Birmingham and some surrounding areas to see the restrictions on mixing in pubs and restaurants which have been announced. It's time for questions from journalists, and the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks several - including about whether financial support is enough for people facing restrictions, and whether the restrictions themselves will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Liverpool at 'very high' level in Covid tier systemThe city's pubs and betting shops will close on Wednesday as part of a three-tier system in England.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson explains a three-tiered level of rules to fight the coronavirus pandemic in England. Boris Johnson has said the UK's increasing number of coronavirus cases is ""flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet"". The Liverpool region will be on a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of a new three-tier system. England's chief medical officer said he was not confident the measures ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said it was likely local authorities in ""very high"" alert areas would have to go further. But the prime minister ruled out the ""extreme route"" of a national lockdown ""right now"". Meanwhile, minutes from a meeting of the government's science advisors last monthrevealed they suggested a short national lockdown to curb virus cases. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Kuenssberg: Who's in charge? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Covid risk 'very serious and it is very real' Most areas of England will be on ""medium"" alert, with measures such as the rule of six, but areas with local restrictions on household mixing are automatically on ""high"" alert. A ""very high"" alert sees pubs and bars close if they do not serve ""substantial meals"", almost all household contacts banned and advice against travel. Mr Johnson said retail outlets, schools and universities would remain open in all areas of England. Prof Whitty told a Downing Street news conference that, without additional local rules, the basic restrictions in very high alert areas would fail to control Covid-19. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The base will not be sufficient - I think that's very clearly the professional view"" However, Mr Johnson said the rules would be enough if they are implemented ""very effectively"". ""We have to act now,"" he said. It came after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said growth in Covid caseswas a ""nationwide phenomenon""and that ""things are heating up"" in areas beyond northern England. And, asminutes from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage,external, show, recommendations made to ministers on 21 September included an immediate circuit breaker - or short lockdown - which was seen as the most effective way to suppress the virus. They also reveal that the scientific advisers believe NHS Test and Trace is having just a ""marginal impact"" on the epidemic and this ""will likely decline further"" unless the system grows to keep pace with new cases. The new system is split into three alert levels: medium, high and very high. Most areas in England are in themedium alert level- meaning current restrictions continue, including the 10pm hospitality curfew. Areas already under additional local restrictions are automatically in thehigh alert level- meaning bans on household mixing indoors are extended to include hospitality venues. Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak now come into this category, as well as Greater Manchester, parts of South Yorkshire, and north-east England. Around 4.4 million people will be in high alert areas. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million people - becomes the first area to enter thevery high alert level, with the closure of pubs and bars. Betting shops, gyms, leisure centres and casinos will also close in the region. Household mixing will be banned anywhere indoors, and in outdoor gardens and hospitality. The rule of six will continue to apply in outdoor public spaces like parks,according to government guidance,external. Extra restrictions imposed on Nottinghamshire Merseyside businesses fear 'ominous winter ahead' Restaurants can continue to trade in very high alert areas, while people will also be advised against travelling to and from these zones. Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, he said: ""This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human, and indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."" The PM said around Â£1bn of ""new financial support"" would be provided to local authorities in England with further financial support for local test and trace and local enforcement in very high alert areas. Mr Sunak also pointed towards thenew post-furlough job support scheme. A postcode search will launch on the government website in due course enabling residents to determine which rules apply to them, Mr Johnson said at the news conference. Liverpool City Region has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 in the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The question today is whether the restrictions announced by the prime minister can bring the country back from the brink."" Prof Calum Semple, an infectious disease expert and adviser to the government, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the new restrictions had come too late and a short national lockdown could be needed in weeks. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said new local measures are ""treating the 'symptom' not the cause"" of increasing infections and called for a national prevention plan. Some will say ministers should have gone further, while others argue they have already gone too far. But the problem with the restrictions that are being discussed is that no one really knows what impact they will have. Closing Covid-secure pubs, for example, could just drive people to gather more in homes, where the risk of transmission is even greater. The other factor, which is not grabbing the headlines at the moment but is just as important, is whether the test and trace system is up to the job. Test results are taking too long to return, contact tracers are failing to reach enough of the close contacts of infected individuals and even when they do most people do not follow the isolation guidelines to the letter. Infections, hospitalisations and deaths are certainly going to rise. By how much and for how long is the big unknown. Certainly with better treatments in place and the UK in a stronger position to protect care homes - four in 10 deaths were among their residents in the first wave - many believe the toll should not be as great as it was in the spring. Labour mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told the BBC ""we agree with the government having to impose tougher restrictions"" but he added that an argument for a stronger financial package for the city ""wasn't listened to"". Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the area's restrictions were ""comparable"" to the national lockdown in March - but without the same level of financial support. Some areas of northern England have had additional restrictions on household gatherings since the end of July. Sturgeon to draw up 'three-tier' lockdown system Second national lockdown considered for Wales Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said despite the capital being on the medium alert level, its status could ""change very quickly - potentially even this week"" and move into a higher level. The three-tier alert system applies only to England, with the devolved administrationsin Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandin charge of designing and implementing their own coronavirus restrictions. A further 13,972 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, with 50 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

Liverpool at 'very high' level in Covid tier systemThe city's pubs and betting shops will close on Wednesday as part of a three-tier system in England.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson explains a three-tiered level of rules to fight the coronavirus pandemic in England. Boris Johnson has said the UK's increasing number of coronavirus cases is ""flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet"". The Liverpool region will be on a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of a new three-tier system. England's chief medical officer said he was not confident the measures ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said it was likely local authorities in ""very high"" alert areas would have to go further. But the prime minister ruled out the ""extreme route"" of a national lockdown ""right now"". Meanwhile, minutes from a meeting of the government's science advisors last monthrevealed they suggested a short national lockdown to curb virus cases. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Kuenssberg: Who's in charge? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Covid risk 'very serious and it is very real' Most areas of England will be on ""medium"" alert, with measures such as the rule of six, but areas with local restrictions on household mixing are automatically on ""high"" alert. A ""very high"" alert sees pubs and bars close if they do not serve ""substantial meals"", almost all household contacts banned and advice against travel. Mr Johnson said retail outlets, schools and universities would remain open in all areas of England. Prof Whitty told a Downing Street news conference that, without additional local rules, the basic restrictions in very high alert areas would fail to control Covid-19. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The base will not be sufficient - I think that's very clearly the professional view"" However, Mr Johnson said the rules would be enough if they are implemented ""very effectively"". ""We have to act now,"" he said. It came after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said growth in Covid caseswas a ""nationwide phenomenon""and that ""things are heating up"" in areas beyond northern England. And, asminutes from the government's scientific advisory group, Sage,external, show, recommendations made to ministers on 21 September included an immediate circuit breaker - or short lockdown - which was seen as the most effective way to suppress the virus. They also reveal that the scientific advisers believe NHS Test and Trace is having just a ""marginal impact"" on the epidemic and this ""will likely decline further"" unless the system grows to keep pace with new cases. The new system is split into three alert levels: medium, high and very high. Most areas in England are in themedium alert level- meaning current restrictions continue, including the 10pm hospitality curfew. Areas already under additional local restrictions are automatically in thehigh alert level- meaning bans on household mixing indoors are extended to include hospitality venues. Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak now come into this category, as well as Greater Manchester, parts of South Yorkshire, and north-east England. Around 4.4 million people will be in high alert areas. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million people - becomes the first area to enter thevery high alert level, with the closure of pubs and bars. Betting shops, gyms, leisure centres and casinos will also close in the region. Household mixing will be banned anywhere indoors, and in outdoor gardens and hospitality. The rule of six will continue to apply in outdoor public spaces like parks,according to government guidance,external. Extra restrictions imposed on Nottinghamshire Merseyside businesses fear 'ominous winter ahead' Restaurants can continue to trade in very high alert areas, while people will also be advised against travelling to and from these zones. Speaking earlier in the House of Commons, he said: ""This is not how we want to live our lives but this is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic trauma of a full lockdown and the massive human, and indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."" The PM said around Â£1bn of ""new financial support"" would be provided to local authorities in England with further financial support for local test and trace and local enforcement in very high alert areas. Mr Sunak also pointed towards thenew post-furlough job support scheme. A postcode search will launch on the government website in due course enabling residents to determine which rules apply to them, Mr Johnson said at the news conference. Liverpool City Region has one of the highest rates of Covid-19 in the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""The question today is whether the restrictions announced by the prime minister can bring the country back from the brink."" Prof Calum Semple, an infectious disease expert and adviser to the government, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme the new restrictions had come too late and a short national lockdown could be needed in weeks. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, said new local measures are ""treating the 'symptom' not the cause"" of increasing infections and called for a national prevention plan. Some will say ministers should have gone further, while others argue they have already gone too far. But the problem with the restrictions that are being discussed is that no one really knows what impact they will have. Closing Covid-secure pubs, for example, could just drive people to gather more in homes, where the risk of transmission is even greater. The other factor, which is not grabbing the headlines at the moment but is just as important, is whether the test and trace system is up to the job. Test results are taking too long to return, contact tracers are failing to reach enough of the close contacts of infected individuals and even when they do most people do not follow the isolation guidelines to the letter. Infections, hospitalisations and deaths are certainly going to rise. By how much and for how long is the big unknown. Certainly with better treatments in place and the UK in a stronger position to protect care homes - four in 10 deaths were among their residents in the first wave - many believe the toll should not be as great as it was in the spring. Labour mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson told the BBC ""we agree with the government having to impose tougher restrictions"" but he added that an argument for a stronger financial package for the city ""wasn't listened to"". Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram said the area's restrictions were ""comparable"" to the national lockdown in March - but without the same level of financial support. Some areas of northern England have had additional restrictions on household gatherings since the end of July. Sturgeon to draw up 'three-tier' lockdown system Second national lockdown considered for Wales Meanwhile, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said despite the capital being on the medium alert level, its status could ""change very quickly - potentially even this week"" and move into a higher level. The three-tier alert system applies only to England, with the devolved administrationsin Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandin charge of designing and implementing their own coronavirus restrictions. A further 13,972 confirmed coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, with 50 more deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed?

West Ham's London Stadium West Ham areagainst radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester Unitedto reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The proposals, which include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup, have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer as part of a plans for a Covid rescue package for English Football League clubs. Under the controversial plans, nine clubs would be given ""special voting rights"" on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. West Ham would be one of those nine clubs but it is understood they were unaware of the proposals - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday.

We've spent a lot of time following today's announcements by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here are some of the most significant developments across the rest of Europe: Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford hasthreatened a travel ban on visitors from Covid hotspots in England coming to Walesif the prime minister does not impose his own. He said he was giving UK ministers ""one final opportunity"" before he makes changes in Welsh law. The UK government announced on Monday that it will advise against non-essential travel from Merseyside - which is facing the toughest coronavirus restrictions in England - but it stopped short of making it illegal, angering Welsh ministers. Mr Drakeford said he could close the border with England, but that is not his preferred option. Fiona TrottBBC News Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up. On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives. The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, itâs getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise. It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who donât have the virus and still need urgent treatment. Itâs not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England. These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Away from the PM's announcements today, the pandemic's impact on students continues. Englandâs universities minister says it is âsimply outrageousâ how
much students have been charged for food parcels when they are forced into
self-isolation. Michelle Donelan has tapped into the debate about the conditions
facing students who have found themselves spending their new term in
self-isolation, after Covid outbreaks on campus. Responding to a question in the House of Commons about isolating
students being charged Â£18 per day for food, she said âno university should
seek to profit from students self-isolatingâ - and she promised to write to
universities to âmake the point"". ""Students self-isolating in catered halls should receive free
food, whilst other students should receive food which is either free - like many
universities including Sheffield Hallam and Edge Hill are doing - or at a price
which can be afforded within a student's budget,â said Ms Donelan. The University of East Anglia had been charging about Â£18 per day
for food for self-isolating students - but after accusations of taking advantage
of students, this was lowered last week to about Â£12 per day. The minister also revealed that there were now about 9,000 students
with Covid - describing the figure as a âcumulative number of cases over the
last seven daysâ. The UCU lecturersâ union has questioned why students have been
brought back to campus when so many are either catching coronavirus, or being
put into social isolation by outbreaks in their accommodation blocks. Labour MP Richard Burgon accused the government of playing âRussian
roulette with the lives of students, staff and local communitiesâ. Here are the main developments from the prime minister's press conference this evening:  Here are the main developments from other parts of the UK: Helen Pidd from the Guardian asks the PM if he accepts that decisions made on the national lockdown were made to suit London and the rest of the South - and asks if that's why the North is seeing such a surge in cases. The PM says he doesn't accept this, and that the main difference between this ""bout"" of Covid-19 and the one in April is that it's much more localised this time around. Pitt also asks Prof Whitty about evidence that curbs on pubs and restaurants work. Prof Whitty says all the evidence points towards increased transmission of the virus in indoor settings, particularly those where people mix with other households, and without wearing masks. This situation crops up in hospitality as well as in other sectors, he says - ""and that is why the hospitality sector has been involved in restrictions"". England's chief medical officer says there are ""two poles"" of a response to this virus - a full lockdown to suppress the virus, and no lockdown at all. ""What we're trying to do... is find the right balance between the various things - all of which cause harm, all of which we would not want to do - but which can, collectively, if we do them all together, pull the numbers down,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The question from the Liverpool Echo points to a possible political problem for the Prime Minister. His big promise at the election was about spreading opportunity beyond London and the South East. The fact that the virus is currently disproportionately affecting areas of the north of England risks making it look like itâs being hit harder or treated differently. As Rishi Sunak pointed out, though, these are nationally-applicable measures that any area could expect to see if rates rise A journalist from the Liverpool Echo asks about financial support for sectors struggling because of the restrictions. He asks whether people in such industries are ""valued less now"" than when the government was running the full furlough wage support scheme. The chancellor says thejob support scheme(JSS), which replaces furlough from next month, is a UK-wide scheme which treats businesses in all areas the same. He adds, though, that the JSS is a package the government believes is ""sustainable and affordable for the long term"". Boris Johnson is asked whether people will be asked to adhere to restrictions for a ""year or so"" if a vaccine is not found. He is also asked whether there are ""inconsistencies"" in the new system in terms of which areas have ended up in which tier. The prime minister replies that some ""anomalies"" are ""inevitably going to happen"". He adds that medical progress is being made against the disease, but local and national restrictions are the ""best utensil"" the country has ""for now"". Chris Whitty says medical progress is impossible to predict exactly but he is ""extremely confident"" the country will go into ""next winter"" in a ""much better place"". Beth Rigby from Sky News reads the PM's opening remarks back to him - ""we must act now"", he said, against the ""flashboard warnings"" of increasing cases and hospital admissions. Rigby points out that since Liverpool is the only area facing any vastly more stringent measures, that the PM's ""rhetoric is ""outstripping the measures"". She suggests the reason for that might be that local leaders are reluctant to accept the government's plans for local restrictions. But Johnson says he wants to ""take local authorities with me"" because local knowledge, enforcement and contact tracing are ""immensely valuable"" in helping to tackle the spread of the virus. He has a stark message for any local leader who is not willing to agree with the three-tiered system. ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of national government to take the necessary action to protect the public,"" he says. Next up, ITV's Robert Peston asks whether more areas in the north of England would be in the ""very high"" areas without the interventions so far. Boris Johnson says the government is working ""particularly"" with badly affected areas in the north of England and ""stands ready"" to work with all local areas. Chris Whitty says the data showed the need to ""do more"" with the extra restrictions. He adds, though, that it is an ""illusion"" to think that the virus can be further suppressed ""without causing harm"" in areas such as the economy. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnsonâs reference to the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram shows the importance of local leaders in all of this. Some, like the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, are very unhappy about the tier the government has put them into. He said he was not expecting Birmingham and some surrounding areas to see the restrictions on mixing in pubs and restaurants which have been announced. It's time for questions from journalists, and the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks several - including about whether financial support is enough for people facing restrictions, and whether the restrictions themselves will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Job Support Scheme explained,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened.

LiveLiveJohnson details three-tier Covid rules for England5 minutes ago,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells a news conference he is taking a ""balanced approach"" to managing the virus But he says he does not favour another national lockdown ""right now"" because it would harm the economy Boris Johnson tells the Commons there will be a new three-level alert system for England - medium, high and very high Liverpool will be on the highest level of alert, the PM says. He adds he does not want a new national lockdown More people are in hospital with Covid than before lockdown in March, says NHS medical director Stephen Powis Top UK scientific advisers have said NHS Nightingale hospitals are on stand-by in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate Most A-level and GCSE exams in England will be delayed by three weeks in 2021 In China, Qingdao's population of nine million will be tested for Covid-19 over five days after 12 cases There are more than 37 million confirmed cases globally with more than 1.07 million deaths Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our live coverage today. Updates were brought to you by: Alice Evans, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, Joshua Cheetham, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Paul Seddon and Paulin Kola Join us again tomorrow. Hello and thank you for following our coverage today. Here are some of the biggest developments around the world: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Recent advice from Sage, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies,has just been published.,external It includesrecommendations made in a meeting on 21 Sept,external, which included asking ministers to consider immediately introducing:  The government has stopped way short of this - perhaps why Prof Chris Whitty was so keen to demonstrate his view that the basic three tiers of measures aren't enough on their own. It also shows how much the political atmosphere has changed. At the beginning of the pandemic, ministers were very keen to be seen to be following Sage advice. This paper makes clear how they are making different decisions now. Quite the timing too, publishing all this about an hour after a national press conference. Read more from Laura, here. West Ham's London Stadium West Ham areagainst radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester Unitedto reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The proposals, which include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup, have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer as part of a plans for a Covid rescue package for English Football League clubs. Under the controversial plans, nine clubs would be given ""special voting rights"" on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. West Ham would be one of those nine clubs but it is understood they were unaware of the proposals - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday. A club insider has told BBC Sport they are ""very much against"" it. Read more about the Project Big Picture planshere. Hello and thank you for joining our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We've spent a lot of time following today's announcements by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here are some of the most significant developments across the rest of Europe: Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford hasthreatened a travel ban on visitors from Covid hotspots in England coming to Walesif the prime minister does not impose his own. He said he was giving UK ministers ""one final opportunity"" before he makes changes in Welsh law. The UK government announced on Monday that it will advise against non-essential travel from Merseyside - which is facing the toughest coronavirus restrictions in England - but it stopped short of making it illegal, angering Welsh ministers. Mr Drakeford said he could close the border with England, but that is not his preferred option. Fiona TrottBBC News Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up. On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives. The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, itâs getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise. It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who donât have the virus and still need urgent treatment. Itâs not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England. These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Away from the PM's announcements today, the pandemic's impact on students continues. Englandâs universities minister says it is âsimply outrageousâ how
much students have been charged for food parcels when they are forced into
self-isolation. Michelle Donelan has tapped into the debate about the conditions
facing students who have found themselves spending their new term in
self-isolation, after Covid outbreaks on campus. Responding to a question in the House of Commons about isolating
students being charged Â£18 per day for food, she said âno university should
seek to profit from students self-isolatingâ - and she promised to write to
universities to âmake the point"". ""Students self-isolating in catered halls should receive free
food, whilst other students should receive food which is either free - like many
universities including Sheffield Hallam and Edge Hill are doing - or at a price
which can be afforded within a student's budget,â said Ms Donelan. The University of East Anglia had been charging about Â£18 per day
for food for self-isolating students - but after accusations of taking advantage
of students, this was lowered last week to about Â£12 per day. The minister also revealed that there were now about 9,000 students
with Covid - describing the figure as a âcumulative number of cases over the
last seven daysâ. The UCU lecturersâ union has questioned why students have been
brought back to campus when so many are either catching coronavirus, or being
put into social isolation by outbreaks in their accommodation blocks. Labour MP Richard Burgon accused the government of playing âRussian
roulette with the lives of students, staff and local communitiesâ. Here are the main developments from the prime minister's press conference this evening:  Here are the main developments from other parts of the UK: Helen Pidd from the Guardian asks the PM if he accepts that decisions made on the national lockdown were made to suit London and the rest of the South - and asks if that's why the North is seeing such a surge in cases. The PM says he doesn't accept this, and that the main difference between this ""bout"" of Covid-19 and the one in April is that it's much more localised this time around. Pitt also asks Prof Whitty about evidence that curbs on pubs and restaurants work. Prof Whitty says all the evidence points towards increased transmission of the virus in indoor settings, particularly those where people mix with other households, and without wearing masks. This situation crops up in hospitality as well as in other sectors, he says - ""and that is why the hospitality sector has been involved in restrictions"". England's chief medical officer says there are ""two poles"" of a response to this virus - a full lockdown to suppress the virus, and no lockdown at all. ""What we're trying to do... is find the right balance between the various things - all of which cause harm, all of which we would not want to do - but which can, collectively, if we do them all together, pull the numbers down,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The question from the Liverpool Echo points to a possible political problem for the Prime Minister. His big promise at the election was about spreading opportunity beyond London and the South East. The fact that the virus is currently disproportionately affecting areas of the north of England risks making it look like itâs being hit harder or treated differently. As Rishi Sunak pointed out, though, these are nationally-applicable measures that any area could expect to see if rates rise A journalist from the Liverpool Echo asks about financial support for sectors struggling because of the restrictions. He asks whether people in such industries are ""valued less now"" than when the government was running the full furlough wage support scheme. The chancellor says thejob support scheme(JSS), which replaces furlough from next month, is a UK-wide scheme which treats businesses in all areas the same. He adds, though, that the JSS is a package the government believes is ""sustainable and affordable for the long term"". Boris Johnson is asked whether people will be asked to adhere to restrictions for a ""year or so"" if a vaccine is not found. He is also asked whether there are ""inconsistencies"" in the new system in terms of which areas have ended up in which tier. The prime minister replies that some ""anomalies"" are ""inevitably going to happen"". He adds that medical progress is being made against the disease, but local and national restrictions are the ""best utensil"" the country has ""for now"". Chris Whitty says medical progress is impossible to predict exactly but he is ""extremely confident"" the country will go into ""next winter"" in a ""much better place"". Beth Rigby from Sky News reads the PM's opening remarks back to him - ""we must act now"", he said, against the ""flashboard warnings"" of increasing cases and hospital admissions. Rigby points out that since Liverpool is the only area facing any vastly more stringent measures, that the PM's ""rhetoric is ""outstripping the measures"". She suggests the reason for that might be that local leaders are reluctant to accept the government's plans for local restrictions. But Johnson says he wants to ""take local authorities with me"" because local knowledge, enforcement and contact tracing are ""immensely valuable"" in helping to tackle the spread of the virus. He has a stark message for any local leader who is not willing to agree with the three-tiered system. ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of national government to take the necessary action to protect the public,"" he says. Next up, ITV's Robert Peston asks whether more areas in the north of England would be in the ""very high"" areas without the interventions so far. Boris Johnson says the government is working ""particularly"" with badly affected areas in the north of England and ""stands ready"" to work with all local areas. Chris Whitty says the data showed the need to ""do more"" with the extra restrictions. He adds, though, that it is an ""illusion"" to think that the virus can be further suppressed ""without causing harm"" in areas such as the economy. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnsonâs reference to the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram shows the importance of local leaders in all of this. Some, like the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, are very unhappy about the tier the government has put them into. He said he was not expecting Birmingham and some surrounding areas to see the restrictions on mixing in pubs and restaurants which have been announced. It's time for questions from journalists, and the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks several - including about whether financial support is enough for people facing restrictions, and whether the restrictions themselves will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Liverpool at 'very high' level in Covid tier systemThe city's pubs and betting shops will close on Wednesday as part of a three-tier system in England,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson explains a three-tiered level of rules to fight the coronavirus pandemic in England. Boris Johnson has said the UK's increasing number of coronavirus cases is ""flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet"". The Liverpool region will be on a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of a new three-tier system. England's chief medical officer said he was not confident the measures ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said it was likely local authorities in ""very high"" alert areas would have to go further. But the prime minister ruled out the ""extreme route"" of a national lockdown ""right now"". Meanwhile, minutes from a meeting of the government's science advisors last monthrevealed they suggested a short national lockdown to curb virus cases. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Kuenssberg: Who's in charge? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Covid risk 'very serious and it is very real' Most areas of England will be on ""medium"" alert, with measures such as the rule of six, but areas with local restrictions on household mixing are automatically on ""high"" alert. A ""very high"" alert sees pubs and bars close if they do not serve ""substantial meals"", almost all household contacts banned and advice against travel. Mr Johnson said retail outlets, schools and universities would remain open in all areas of England. Prof Whitty told a Downing Street news conference that, without additional local rules, the basic restrictions in very high alert areas would fail to control Covid-19. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The base will not be sufficient - I think that's very clearly the professional view"" However, Mr Johnson said the rules would be enough if they are implemented ""very effectively"". ""We have to act now,"" he said.

The new system is split into three alert levels: medium, high and very high. Most areas in England are in themedium alert level- meaning current restrictions continue, including the 10pm hospitality curfew.

Nottinghamshire, East and West Cheshire and a small area of High Peak now come into this category, as well as Greater Manchester, parts of South Yorkshire, and north-east England. Around 4.4 million people will be in high alert areas. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million people - becomes the first area to enter thevery high alert level, with the closure of pubs and bars.

Liverpool at 'very high' level in Covid tier systemThe city's pubs and betting shops will close on Wednesday as part of a three-tier system in EnglandUK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson explains a three-tiered level of rules to fight the coronavirus pandemic in England. Boris Johnson has said the UK's increasing number of coronavirus cases is ""flashing at us like dashboard warnings in a passenger jet"". The Liverpool region will be on a ""very high"" Covid alert level from Wednesday, the highest of a new three-tier system. England's chief medical officer said he was not confident the measures ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus. Prof Chris Whitty said it was likely local authorities in ""very high"" alert areas would have to go further. But the prime minister ruled out the ""extreme route"" of a national lockdown ""right now"". Meanwhile, minutes from a meeting of the government's science advisors last monthrevealed they suggested a short national lockdown to curb virus cases. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Kuenssberg: Who's in charge? How will the three-tier lockdown system work? Covid risk 'very serious and it is very real' Most areas of England will be on ""medium"" alert, with measures such as the rule of six, but areas with local restrictions on household mixing are automatically on ""high"" alert. A ""very high"" alert sees pubs and bars close if they do not serve ""substantial meals"", almost all household contacts banned and advice against travel. Mr Johnson said retail outlets, schools and universities would remain open in all areas of England. Prof Whitty told a Downing Street news conference that, without additional local rules, the basic restrictions in very high alert areas would fail to control Covid-19. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""The base will not be sufficient - I think that's very clearly the professional view"" However, Mr Johnson said the rules would be enough if they are implemented ""very effectively"". ""We have to act now,"" he said.

Exams in England delayed but still going ahead,"Next summer's A-levels and GCSEs in England are going ahead - but with reduced content for some subjects and a start date pushed back by three weeks. Most exams will now start from 7 June, rather than mid-May, in an attempt to make up for lost teaching time. Head teachers accused ministers of an ""inadequate response"" to the scale of disruption facing pupils and teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said further back-up plans would be decided later for ""all scenarios"". The Department for Education says it expects vocational qualifications to also align with this changed timetable. There were warnings that running a full set of exams would be unfair to schools in the north of England, which have faced particular disruption from Covid outbreaks. Scotland cancels next year's National 5 exams Northern Ireland's exams to start later next summer Almost one in five schools sending home pupils Ministers propose delay to next summer's exams ""They are the ones most likely to have been impacted by school closures following year group bubbles of pupils having to be sent home,"" said Sarah Mulholland of the Northern Powerhouse lobbying group. Exam boards, represented by the Joint Council for Qualifications, said the ""trade off"" of a later start would be a more ""compressed"" exam timetable, with the same number of exams across a shorter number of days. But Mr Williamson said: ""Exams are the fairest way of judging a student's performance so they will go ahead, underpinned by contingency measures developed in partnership with the sector. ""Students have experienced considerable disruption and it's right we give them, and their teachers, the certainty that exams will go ahead and more time to prepare."" The promised ""contingency measures"" will address how exams will be further adapted in the face of local lockdowns and if exams cannot go ahead as planned. But head teachers were angry at the lack of a decision over what those contingency plans might be - and what information they should be gathering in case exams are cancelled again and grades have to be estimated. The delayed start date - proposed by ministers in June - was described by heads' union leader Geoff Barton as of ""marginal benefit"" compared with the amount of lost teaching time from the pandemic. He said it had ""taken an eternity"" for the government's response - which he warned still did not address how exams could be a level playing field for pupils who had faced different levels of disruption. Pupils due to take exams have already have lost months of teaching time - and many are still facing further disruption, with almost one in five secondary schools sending home pupils because of Covid cases. Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, said it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that there was still no decision on a ""fall-back"" plan if exams are further disrupted. She said the announcement was an ""appalling example of political ideology trumping practical reality"". But Glenys Stacey, interim head of Ofqual, said the announcement would ""optimise the time now available"" and provided certainty over what schools needed to teach. ""Of course, we will need contingency plans. We are discussing with government, exam boards and the sector, the detail of that - taking into account the risk of disruption at an individual, local and regional level,"" she said. Her predecessor had resigned after the chaos of trying to produce replacement grades, when exams had been cancelled. ""I am taking my A-levels next year and I don't feel confident at all about the delaying of exams and I feel it doesn't address the inequality in education that has occurred due to large numbers of students self-isolating,"" said Keira from London. And she says there needs to be a plan that will be fair ""in the event of exams not taking place"". Another A-level student, Stephen from Devon, backed the decision to press ahead with exams as fairest option. ""I would be very disappointed not to be given the opportunity to prove my ability to exam boards to achieve the grade I truly deserve, not one generated by an algorithm or even allocated by a teacher,"" he said. Hannah from Leicester said it would be unfair not to reduce how much will still need to be studies for A-levels. ""The loss of teaching time means we should be able to have less content for our final exam."" The modifications to exams will be those previously put forward by the Ofqual qualifications watchdog - which Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, had described as ""only tinkering at the edges"". These included removing field trips from geography and reducing the areas needed to be covered for English literature. Teachers' unions had suggested that questions should be structured differently next year - such as providing more options so that pupils would be able to answer a question on a topic they had studied, no matter how much of the course their school had managed to cover. Mr Williamson said results days for A-levels and GCSEs next year will be in the same week - 24 August for A-levels and 27 August for GCSEs. The universities minister has already said that universities could change their autumn term dates if they needed to accommodate school exams being pushed back. The announcement for England is aless radical approach than Scotland,where last week exams for National 5 qualifications were cancelled, replacing them with teacher assessments and course work, while still going ahead with Higher exams. Scotland's education secretary had said it was ""too big a risk"" to plan a full set of exams when there was so much uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic in the months ahead. In Northern Ireland, exams are going ahead but with reductions in course content and a delayed starting date - plus the promise of a contingency plan. Are you sitting GCSEs or A-levels next year?

Downing Street joins criticism of âcrassâ job ad,"Downing Street has added its voice to criticism of a government-backed advert suggesting a ballet dancer should retrain in cyber security. A No 10 spokesperson said it was ""not appropriate"" and had been taken down. The ad, the latest in a long-running campaign to promote cyber security jobs, sparked a social media backlash. It had already been disowned by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who said the ""crass"" ad did not come from his department. Acclaimed choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne was among Twitter users criticising the advert, asking in a tweet: ""This has to be a joke? Right?"" The advert depicts a ballet dancer and reads: ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber (she just doesn't know it yet). Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" It is attributed to CyberFirst, a programme led by the National Cyber Security Centre to encourage young people to get into tech, and to HM Government. Critics on Twitter called the advert ""patronising"", saying it showed the government was not helping the arts through the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

""This was part of a campaign encouraging people from all walks of life to think about career in cyber-security, but this piece of content was not appropriate and has been removed,"" Downing Street said. Mr Dowden said in a tweet: ""I want to save jobs in the arts"", and underlined that Â£1.57bn was being invested in the industry.

The use of a ballet dancer - seen through the narrow focus of social media - seems dreadfully timed and at least one government minister agrees.

As for the courses themselves, QA have been running vocational courses under the CyberFirst name since 2017, in partnership with the government's NCSC, and sometimes alongside companies like BAE Systems - so these campaigns are not new.

West Ham 'against Big Picture plans',"Fans have been absent from Premier League matches, including at West Ham's London Stadium, since March West Ham are against radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester United to reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The Project Big Picture proposals have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and United co-chairman Joel Glazer. Everton, Southampton and West Ham would be granted special status in the plans, along with the so-called 'big six'. However, a Hammers insider has told BBC Sport they are ""very much against"" it. Reforms in 'best interest of clubs' - Parry Plans could have 'damaging impact' - Premier League It is understood the club were unaware of the proposals, even though they were named in them - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday. The source said they were of the view Liverpool and United were the instigators but that they had been told talks have been going on since January and what has emerged is the 17th version of the proposal. The plans also include special status for Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday the plans would ""undermine the trust in football's governance"". ""In terms of support for clubs we have been given assurances by the Premier League and English Football League that they have no intention to let any EFL club go bust due to covid and we know they have the means to prevent that from happening within existing mechanisms. ""We strongly urge the Premier League and EFL to continue to work constructively to come up with a package of support for the whole football family."" The Premier League cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with the Championship, League One and League Two each retaining 24 teams. The bottom two teams in the Premier League relegated automatically with the 16th-placed team joining the Championship play-offs. The League Cup and Community Shield abolished. Parachute payments scrapped. A Â£250m rescue fund made immediately available to the EFL & 25% of all future TV deals Â£100m paid to the FA to make up for lost revenue. Nine clubs given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. The Hammers feel the obvious negatives - the loss of two home games - will hit their finances, while at the same time creating space for more European games and lucrative pre-season friendlies, which would disproportionately benefit the 'big six'. The plans include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup. In return, the EFL would get 25% of all future TV deals, which would be negotiated jointly, plus the Â£250m bail-out many clubs have been demanding since May. This is the fourth season in a row where the 'big six' have all qualified for European football. In the past 10 seasons, one of them has missed out on only four occasions. Over the past decade, West Ham have had two European campaigns, both of which ended during the qualifying rounds. Southampton and Everton have also qualified for Europe twice in the same period. ""The big six are using Covid for a power grab,"" said the West Ham source. ""If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves."" It is not known what will happen if the plan - which has drawn criticism from supporters' groups, the government and the Premier League executive - is rejected. The Premier League said ""individual proposals"" in the plan ""could have a damaging impact on the whole game"", and that it would continue its own work on a ""resolution to the requirement for Covid-19 rescue funding"" for the EFL. However, one theory - which EFL chairman Rick Parry refused to dismiss when questioned specifically about it twice on Sunday - is that the six clubs have been told they could play within the Football League if their Premier League status was threatened. One source with detailed knowledge of running clubs at both Premier League and EFL level says the plan has merit but the fear of how the 'big six' might rewrite the rule book - potentially including halting relegation or blocking new owners whose investment may threaten their own status - was likely to be regarded as too big a price for many to accept. Chairman of League Two club Forest Green Rovers, Dale Vince, said he was ""positive"" and ""excited"" about a ""very well-rounded and fair packet of changes"". ""I think it will really put a line under the EFL in terms of financial stability, and in terms of creating a level playing field as well,"" he told BBC Sport. ""The ending of parachute payments goes hand in hand with that. It distorts competition in the Championship in particular, but that does flow down the EFL as well."" Asked whether the proposal would put too much power in the hands of the 'big six', Vince says the Premier League should adopt a simple majority voting system, where 10 votes would succeed in an 18-team league. He added: ""I don't think there is anything wrong with the timing of this, there is probably everything right with it because something needs to be done right now."" Derby County's chief executive Stephen Pearce told BBC Sport that he does not see the proposals as a ""power grab"" by the bigger Premier League clubs. ""This actually about how we protect the pyramid as far as I can see,"" Pearce said. ""Looking at it long term, we need financial stability throughout the whole pyramid. We need the controls in place to sort out player wage inflation and everything we talked about previously. ""I think it makes a case that clubs will be able to focus more on making themselves financially sustainable and putting more into the infrastructure of the clubs, into coaching, the grassroots, the academies. ""I think, in the longer term, it will make the competition better and people will see it as a more attractive sporting product that is more competitive.""

Bank of England questions banks on negative rates,"The Bank of England has written to UK banks asking them how ready they are if interest rates were cut to zero or turned negative. The UK would be following countries such as Japan and Switzerland if it cut borrowing costs to such a low figure. ""We are requesting specific information about your firm's current readiness,"" the bank's deputy governor, Sam Woods, said in the letter to banks. The Bank of England cut rates to the current historic low of 0.1% in March. Mr Woods said he wanted to know if the banks would face technological challenges if rates should turn negative. ""We are also seeking to understand whether there may be potential for short-term solutions or workarounds, as well as permanent systems changes,"" he said. The past few years have been marked by outages and other problems with the computer systems of various British banks. Last year, MPs condemned the level of IT failures at banks, warning that financial levies on firms and more regulation may be needed. Could you have to pay your bank to save money? Bank of England policymaker defends negative rates While the Bank of England may set its base rate below zero, it is unlikely most consumers will immediately enter the topsy-turvy world of being paid to borrow money. Those on fixed-rate mortgages will see no difference, while variable-rate mortgage terms often state that borrowers will never pay less than zero. Savers with deep pockets such as the wealthy and the banks themselves, may be charged to deposit their money. Banks depositing cash overnight at the European Central Bank currently pay 0.5% to do so. In November, Swiss bank UBS began charging up to 0.75% for cash deposits from wealthy clients. For some years the Bank of England and financial regulators have been pretty sceptical about the use of negative interest rates. Rewarding borrowers and punishing savers would certainly be a difficult communications task. But the reason for scepticism repeatedly communicated to me was the structure of the UK financial system. Building societies, in particular, are reliant on the difference between the interest rates they pay and they receive - the net interest margin. It is tough enough at the current record low rates of interest. To be clear, should the move materialise, typical savers and borrowers should not be immediately affected by this new world - although a Danish bank did launch a negative interest rate mortgage last year. The move would mainly affect the plumbing of the financial system, basically institutional bank accounts at the Bank of England. The point would be to penalise hoarding of cash, and provide incentives to spend and invest. The evidence from other countries that have dabbled in these rates is mixed. Today's move is designed to get financial institutions ready internally, especially in terms of computer systems, to cope with either a zero rate or a negative one. It removes a barrier against the option of this radical policy, though far from guarantees it. The Bank of England is demonstrating that it has not run out of weapons, as the recovery slows and profound uncertainties of the pandemic and post-Brexit trade with the EU loom large. The banks have until 12 November to respond to the central bank's request. Investors are betting on a rate cut below zero in May, the Reuters news agency has reported. While a cut in rates would squeeze the profit margins of lenders, the central banks did not ask about the risks of this, sticking to questions about its practicality. The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate in the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High Street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. Read more about how negative interest rates work here. What are negative interest rates?

Culture secretary disowns 'crass' jobs advert,"Downing Street has added its voice to criticism of a government-backed advert suggesting a ballet dancer should retrain in cyber security. A No 10 spokesperson said it was ""not appropriate"" and had been taken down. The ad, the latest in a long-running campaign to promote cyber security jobs, sparked a social media backlash. It had already been disowned by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who said the ""crass"" ad did not come from his department. Acclaimed choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne was among Twitter users criticising the advert, asking in a tweet: ""This has to be a joke? Right?"" The advert depicts a ballet dancer and reads: ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber (she just doesn't know it yet). Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" It is attributed to CyberFirst, a programme led by the National Cyber Security Centre to encourage young people to get into tech, and to HM Government. Critics on Twitter called the advert ""patronising"", saying it showed the government was not helping the arts through the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

US auction theorists win Nobel Economics Prize,"Game theorists Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson have won the 2020 Nobel Economics Prize for their work on auction theory. The Stanford University game theorists have helped in developing formats for the sale of aircraft landing slots, radio spectrums, and emissions trading. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their work ""benefitted sellers, buyers and taxpayers"" worldwide. Game theory uses mathematics to study decision-making, conflict, and strategy in social situations. ""This year's laureates in economic sciences started out with fundamental theory and later used their results in practical applications, which have spread globally. Their discoveries are of great benefit to society,"" said Peter Fredriksson, chair of the prize committee. Prof Wilson developed a theory for auctions where the value of the object on the block is uncertain beforehand but ends up being the same for everyone - for example, the value of radio frequencies, or the volume of a mineral in a particular area. He also developed a theory as to why rational bidders tend to place maximum bids that are below what they estimate the actual value of the object to be: they are worried about the so-called ""winner's curse"" - overpaying to win the auction. Prof Milgrom put together a theory which takes into account not only auctions where the object turns out to have the same value for all the bidders, but also for auctions where the object is valued differently by different bidders. He demonstrated that the seller should get a higher revenue when bidders learn more about each other's estimated values during bidding. Most of us don't buy art or livestock. Nor do we buy our fresh fish or fruit and veg at auction. Rather more of us might occasionally buy or sell some modestly valued furniture or ornaments that way, and perhaps more still make use of online auction sites. But the committee at the Swedish Central Bank which awards the prize says that auctions affect all of us at every level. The wholesale electricity market, radio frequencies for telecommunications, emissions allowances and much more are allocated using auctions in at least some countries. For a private seller the ideal auction is one that gets the highest price. For a public sector agency, getting revenue does matter but there can be other considerations, for example seeking to have radio frequencies allocated in a way that gives the most benefit to society as a whole. Auctions are often complicated by uncertainty - how much will you get out of an oilfield, or how much will people use a mobile phone service. The work of Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson, and many others, explores these issues with a view to designing auctions to get the best results. However, the award was criticised by one charity which said that economics was out of touch with global problems, including the impact of coronavirus. The Rethinking Economics charity, which pushes for a broader application of economics, said it was ""disappointing"" that the prize had gone to ""two white men from the global north working on auction theory"". Catriona Watson, co-director of Rethinking Economics said: ""The discipline of economics is depressingly out of touch. ""The Nobel Prize as a marker of excellence in the field needs to become reflective of our global community and address the most pressing issues of our time like the climate crisis, the pandemic or structural racial injustice -  otherwise it risks becoming increasingly irrelevant."" The prize has been won in the past by economists including Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman, and last yearwas won by poverty-fighting couple Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. But Ms Watson said that this year the award was ""back to business as usual"". The prize, worth 10m Swedish crowns (Â£887,000), is not one of the original five Nobel awards created in the 1895 will of industrialist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, but was established by Sweden's central bank and first awarded in 1969.

BA boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis',"British Airways has announced it is replacing its chief executive Alex Cruz as the airline navigates ""the worst crisis"" facing its industry. Mr Cruz, who has been with BA since 2016, will be immediately replaced by Aer Lingus boss Sean Doyle. Mr Cruz will stay on as non-executive chairman for a transition period before Mr Doyle also takes on the role. BA has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with unions over redundancies and pay cuts. It is cutting about 10,000 staff, drawing criticism from staff and MPs who claim the airline has been following a ""fire and rehire"" policy. Luis Gallego, chief executive of IAG, which owns BA, said: ""We're navigating the worst crisis faced in our industry and I'm confident these internal promotions will ensure IAG is well placed to emerge in a strong position."" The shake-up is one of the first major movesby Mr Gallego who took over as IAG's chief executive last month, replacing long-standing boss Willie Walsh. ""This is a sign that the new chief executive of IAG, Luis Gallego, is flexing his muscles and trying to demonstrate he'll make the changes necessary to lead a sustained recovery for the airline group,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. New data from Heathrow showed the challenges being faced by the travel industry from the coronavirus pandemic. Just 1.2 million passengers travelled through the airport in September, down 82% compared with the same month last year. He's done the dirty work - now a fresh pair of hands is needed. Alex Cruz's most recent task at BA was to push through thousands of job cuts as well as changes to pay and conditions, which will see many remaining staff earning a lot less in future. Those cuts may have been necessary due to the Covid crisis, but the way BA went about it - effectively threatening to fire employees who refused to sign new contracts - provoked deep resentment and bitterness among the workforce. And he was hardly popular to begin with. He arrived at BA with a brief to cut costs and boost profitability, to enable the airline to compete with budget carriers. He succeeded, but at a price. Customer satisfaction fell sharply, leading to accusations that the BA brand was being sacrificed for short-term shareholder value. There were strikes over what was described as ""poverty pay"" by cabin crew. And repeated IT failures proved deeply embarrassing for the company. Now the man who appointed him, former IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, has retired. The new IAG boss, Luis Gallego, appears keen to make his mark and rebuild bridges with staff. Mr Cruz was very much part of the old regime. It should come as no surprise that he now has to step aside. Mr Doyle is returning to BA after just two years in charge at Aer Lingus, which is also owned by IAG. Prior to that, he had worked at BA since 1998. But Ms Streeter said: ""Sean Doyle will have his work cut out to make immediate progress given that British Airways is facing the toughest challenge in its history as demand for international travel has plummeted and quarantine restrictions continue to constrain bookings."" No need to fire and rehire staff, says BA boss British Airways owner to cut more flights Mr Cruz's tenure as BA's boss has been eventful. In September last year, the airline's pilots staged their first ever strike which led to 2,325 flights being cancelled and cost BA â¬137m (Â£124m). It has also suffered a number of costly IT problems, including an incident in 2017 that left 75,000 flyers stranded and cost the airline Â£80m. Last year, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced it intended to fine BA a record Â£183m after a breach of its security system, exposing hundreds of thousands of customer details. The ICO and BA are still in discussions regarding the fine. IAG declined to comment on whether Mr Cruz would receive any compensation when he leaves BA once the transition period is completed. It also declined to say how long the transition period would last. No need to fire and rehire staff, says BA boss British Airways owner to cut more flights 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Who joined Demi as a big winner at the Golden Globes?

England's three-tier lockdown plan to be unveiledThe Liverpool City Region is expected to face the tightest Covid restrictions under the new system.UK,"Crowds gathered in Liverpool on Monday to watch filming for a new Batman film in the city Boris Johnson is due to announce a new ""three-tier"" Covid system for England. The PM will address Parliament at 15:30 BST, setting out different rules for regions classified as being on ""medium"", ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million - is expected to face the tightest restrictions with pubs and gyms closed, and further rules on households mixing indoors. Newcastle council's leader has said the North East could avoid tighter rules. Mr Johnson will address MPs before holding a Downing Street news conference. Other areas awaiting news of further restrictions include Greater Manchester, Nottingham and Leeds. Liverpool recorded 600Â cases per 100,000 people inthe week ending 6 October. The average for England was 74. The Liverpool City Region includes the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, as well as Liverpool. Local MPs were told during a call with Health Secretary Matt Hancock all bars, pubs, gyms and betting shops will be closed while restaurants will remain open for the moment.

Live updates: PM to address MPs on new three-tier system Concern mounts at Covid shutdown 'ripple effect' Legal restrictions will also be placed on indoor household mixing and there will be guidance on travel restrictions. The new curbs are to be reviewed after a month. Mr Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee ""to determine the final interventions"" on Wednesday morning. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said experts told Cobra even tier three restrictions would be unlikely to bring the UK's R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus - below 1. The PM will announce changes in Parliament, before speaking at a Downing Street news conference at 19:00. He is expected to be joined at No 10 by Chancellor Rishi Sunak and England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty.

He confirmed Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogatewere being prepared to take patients. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said infection rates had never dropped as low in the northern England as in the South but warned ""things are heating up"" across the country. Tougher measures were introducedin Scotland on Friday, including the closure of pubs and restaurants across the central belt, while the Welsh government has said the next few days could determineif ""national measures"" are implemented. Under the new system for England, tier three is expected to involve the tightest restrictions. We know the broad outline of what the government is going to announce today. Ministers have been working on a tier system for local restrictions in England for weeks - and today they'll confirm how it will work and the basic principles. The Liverpool region is set to be the first put into the ""very high"" top tier - which will mean significant restrictions on hospitality within days. But there are still details of a support package being worked out. The metro mayor in Liverpool Steve Rotheram is adamant there needs to be more support for workers and businesses that will be told to close. He doesn't think the chancellor's current plans go far enough - and I'm told conversations on economic support are likely to continue into this afternoon. There have been questions about definitions - when is a pub a pub, which could be told to close, rather than restaurant which might not? It's worth highlighting that if other areas are added to the highest tier in the next few weeks, restrictions may look different. Sources say there is room for flexibility based on local factors. Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said he wanted ""some surety from national government that if we hit some milestones we can come out of tier three very quickly"". He said the government had been clear the Liverpool City Region would be placed in the highest category, with ""no ifs, no buts"", and he added it had already been agreed there would be more local control over the tracing of close contacts and enforcement of restrictions. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the government was ""not panicking"" but taking ""reasonable and proportionate measures"", adding that ""we know there are challenges around hospitality"". Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and advisor to the government, said: ""Most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households and then after that, it's in the retail and hospitality sector. ""So, the major issue here is to focus on the cities and areas with the largest outbreaks and sadly my home city of Liverpool is being hammered at the moment. These restrictions are necessary."" The problem with introducing the sort of restrictions that are being suggested to control the spread of the virus is that no-one is really sure whether they will really work. Firstly, while the government's advisers can track patterns in where infected individuals have been prior to being diagnosed, they cannot prove that they were actually infected in those places. Secondly, there will be unintended consequences. Close pubs and you may make the situation worse by driving people to mix more in private homes which are less ""Covid-secure"". It is a point that has been made in recent days by Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese as well as others as ministers weigh up their options. Then there is the economic, social and emotional toll of closing down parts of a community. These are decisions that will divide opinion and, what is more, it will be nigh on impossible to judge exactly what impact they will have had on the virus. Oldham West and Royton MP Jim McMahon said Greater Manchester would be placed in tier two - ""with household restrictions on meeting indoors in any setting, but not outdoors"" - and pubs that serve food staying open. It came after Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser,started legal proceedingsto challenge any restrictions on hospitality and entertainment venues in the North of England.

England's three-tier lockdown plan to be unveiled,"Crowds gathered in Liverpool on Monday to watch filming for a new Batman film in the city Boris Johnson is due to announce a new ""three-tier"" Covid system for England. The PM will address Parliament at 15:30 BST, setting out different rules for regions classified as being on ""medium"", ""high"" or ""very high"" alert.

Culture secretary disowns 'crass' dancer advert,"Downing Street has added its voice to criticism of a government-backed advert suggesting a ballet dancer should retrain in cyber security. A No 10 spokesperson said it was ""not appropriate"" and had been taken down. The ad, the latest in a long-running campaign to promote cyber security jobs, sparked a social media backlash. It had already been disowned by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who said the ""crass"" ad did not come from his department. Acclaimed choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne was among Twitter users criticising the advert, asking in a tweet: ""This has to be a joke? Right?"" The advert depicts a ballet dancer and reads: ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber (she just doesn't know it yet). Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" It is attributed to CyberFirst, a programme led by the National Cyber Security Centre to encourage young people to get into tech, and to HM Government. Critics on Twitter called the advert ""patronising"", saying it showed the government was not helping the arts through the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

""This was part of a campaign encouraging people from all walks of life to think about career in cyber-security, but this piece of content was not appropriate and has been removed,"" Downing Street said. Mr Dowden said in a tweet: ""I want to save jobs in the arts"", and underlined that Â£1.57bn was being invested in the industry.

The image, the latest in a series of promotions that started last year under a ""Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" campaign, has now been removed. Before its removal, it read: ""If your career plan's been altered this year, you're not alone. ""2020 has shaken up jobs - but most successful careers have a turning point. The government-backed Rethink. Reskill. Reboot. programme by CyberFirst could be yours."" By Alistair Coleman, BBC anti-disinformation team The reaction to this ""Rethink Reskill Reboot"" campaign was immediate on social media, and the ballet dancer picture was replaced by a picture of a baker almost immediately. In the context of the difficulties facing the arts during the Covid-19 pandemic, it's a sensitive subject. The use of a ballet dancer - seen through the narrow focus of social media - seems dreadfully timed and at least one government minister agrees. The Chancellor's comments during an ITV interview last week have caused confusion around jobs in the arts, but it seems he was talking about all job sectors, rather than the arts in particular. However, it's the persistent belief that he was referring to people in creative industries retraining into new careers that has caused anger. As for the courses themselves, QA have been running vocational courses under the CyberFirst name since 2017, in partnership with the government's NCSC, and sometimes alongside companies like BAE Systems - so these campaigns are not new. Last year, the NCSC used the CyberFirst brand in an event aimed at steering school pupils toward a career in cyber-security, and they have told Huffington Post that the current ""Reboot"" campaign has no connection with them. The image of ""Fatima"" comes from a photograph by Atlanta-based photographer Krys Alex published on Instagram in July 2017. The original picture shows dancers Desire'e Kelley and Tasha Williams from the Vibez in Motion Dance Studio in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Fatima"" is Atlanta-based dancer Desire'e Kelley, pictured here with Tasha Williams The coronavirus pandemic has forced industries to scale back their businesses and cut jobs, including many music venues and cultural organisations. Last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that all workers needed to adapt to the changing environment. He told ITV: ""Can things happen in exactly the way they did? No. But everyone is having to find ways to adapt and adjust to the new reality."" Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, the National Cyber Security Centre and GCHQ have all been contacted for comment.

Exams go ahead in England next year with later start,"Next summer's A-levels and GCSEs in England are going ahead - but with reduced content for some subjects and a start date pushed back by three weeks. Most exams will now start from 7 June, rather than mid-May, in an attempt to make up for lost teaching time. Head teachers accused ministers of an ""inadequate response"" to the scale of disruption facing pupils and teachers. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said further back-up plans would be decided later for ""all scenarios"". The Department for Education says it expects vocational qualifications to also align with this changed timetable. There were warnings that running a full set of exams would be unfair to schools in the north of England, which have faced particular disruption from Covid outbreaks. Scotland cancels next year's National 5 exams Northern Ireland's exams to start later next summer Almost one in five schools sending home pupils Ministers propose delay to next summer's exams ""They are the ones most likely to have been impacted by school closures following year group bubbles of pupils having to be sent home,"" said Sarah Mulholland of the Northern Powerhouse lobbying group. Exam boards, represented by the Joint Council for Qualifications, said the ""trade off"" of a later start would be a more ""compressed"" exam timetable, with the same number of exams across a shorter number of days. But Mr Williamson said: ""Exams are the fairest way of judging a student's performance so they will go ahead, underpinned by contingency measures developed in partnership with the sector. ""Students have experienced considerable disruption and it's right we give them, and their teachers, the certainty that exams will go ahead and more time to prepare."" The promised ""contingency measures"" will address how exams will be further adapted in the face of local lockdowns and if exams cannot go ahead as planned. But head teachers were angry at the lack of a decision over what those contingency plans might be - and what information they should be gathering in case exams are cancelled again and grades have to be estimated. The delayed start date - proposed by ministers in June - was described by heads' union leader Geoff Barton as of ""marginal benefit"" compared with the amount of lost teaching time from the pandemic. He said it had ""taken an eternity"" for the government's response - which he warned still did not address how exams could be a level playing field for pupils who had faced different levels of disruption. Pupils due to take exams have already have lost months of teaching time - and many are still facing further disruption, with almost one in five secondary schools sending home pupils because of Covid cases. Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, said it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that there was still no decision on a ""fall-back"" plan if exams are further disrupted. She said the announcement was an ""appalling example of political ideology trumping practical reality"". But Glenys Stacey, interim head of Ofqual, said the announcement would ""optimise the time now available"" and provided certainty over what schools needed to teach. ""Of course, we will need contingency plans. We are discussing with government, exam boards and the sector, the detail of that - taking into account the risk of disruption at an individual, local and regional level,"" she said. Her predecessor had resigned after the chaos of trying to produce replacement grades, when exams had been cancelled. ""I am taking my A-levels next year and I don't feel confident at all about the delaying of exams and I feel it doesn't address the inequality in education that has occurred due to large numbers of students self-isolating,"" said Keira from London. And she says there needs to be a plan that will be fair ""in the event of exams not taking place"". Another A-level student, Stephen from Devon, backed the decision to press ahead with exams as fairest option. ""I would be very disappointed not to be given the opportunity to prove my ability to exam boards to achieve the grade I truly deserve, not one generated by an algorithm or even allocated by a teacher,"" he said. Hannah from Leicester said it would be unfair not to reduce how much will still need to be studies for A-levels. ""The loss of teaching time means we should be able to have less content for our final exam."" The modifications to exams will be those previously put forward by the Ofqual qualifications watchdog - which Mr Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, had described as ""only tinkering at the edges"". These included removing field trips from geography and reducing the areas needed to be covered for English literature. Teachers' unions had suggested that questions should be structured differently next year - such as providing more options so that pupils would be able to answer a question on a topic they had studied, no matter how much of the course their school had managed to cover. Mr Williamson said results days for A-levels and GCSEs next year will be in the same week - 24 August for A-levels and 27 August for GCSEs. The universities minister has already said that universities could change their autumn term dates if they needed to accommodate school exams being pushed back. The announcement for England is aless radical approach than Scotland,where last week exams for National 5 qualifications were cancelled, replacing them with teacher assessments and course work, while still going ahead with Higher exams. Scotland's education secretary had said it was ""too big a risk"" to plan a full set of exams when there was so much uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic in the months ahead. In Northern Ireland, exams are going ahead but with reductions in course content and a delayed starting date - plus the promise of a contingency plan. Are you sitting GCSEs or A-levels next year?

Do-not-resuscitate order: care home use reviewedConcern that care homes have blanket orders in place covering a number of residents.Health,"The use of do-not-attempt-resuscitate (DNAR) orders is to be reviewed after a number were wrongly applied in care homes at the start of the pandemic. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) will investigate concerns that some care homes still have blanket orders in place covering groups of residents. It became clear that blanket use was in place in some care homes in the early weeks of the pandemic. But it was widely condemned by the CQC and medical bodies. Covid: Care homes policies violated human rights, says Amnesty Families not told about 'do not resuscitate' orders âI donât want to be resuscitated at allâ The decision about whether or not to attempt resuscitation if a very sick person falls dangerously ill is supposed to be discussed with the individual, or family members if they are too sick. Doctors can make a decision on the spot without consultation in exceptional circumstances. However, the decisions are always supposed to be made on an individual case-by-case basis. The health minister Lord Bethell has asked the CQC to investigate the latest claims. He told the House of Lords that blanket use of DNARs was ""unacceptable"". Dr Rosie Benneyworth, CQC chief inspector of primary medical services and integrated care, said: ""Health and social care providers have faced extraordinary pressures this year. Both staff, and people using services and their loved ones, have at times raised concerns with us about care. ""It is vital that we take this opportunity to learn from what has happened - challenging poor care and sharing the ways that providers have put people's needs at the heart of their care so that others can learn from them."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Dr Benneyworth said it was unacceptable for DNARs to be applied to groups of people of any description. ""These decisions must continue to be made on an individual basis according to need. Through this review we will look to identify and share best practice in this complex area, as well as identifying where decisions may not have been patient-centred, and ensuring mistakes are not repeated."" NHS England said it had already made clear that orders should only ever be made on an individual basis. The charity Pohwer said it had found blanket DNARs put in place across Norfolk, West Midlands, London, Oxfordshire, Sussex, Surrey and Buckinghamshire, potentially affecting more than 700 people.

Do-not-resuscitate order: care home use reviewedConcern that care homes have blanket orders in place covering a number of residents.,"The use of do-not-attempt-resuscitate (DNAR) orders is to be reviewed after a number were wrongly applied in care homes at the start of the pandemic. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) will investigate concerns that some care homes still have blanket orders in place covering groups of residents. It became clear that blanket use was in place in some care homes in the early weeks of the pandemic. But it was widely condemned by the CQC and medical bodies. Covid: Care homes policies violated human rights, says Amnesty Families not told about 'do not resuscitate' orders âI donât want to be resuscitated at allâ The decision about whether or not to attempt resuscitation if a very sick person falls dangerously ill is supposed to be discussed with the individual, or family members if they are too sick. Doctors can make a decision on the spot without consultation in exceptional circumstances. However, the decisions are always supposed to be made on an individual case-by-case basis. The health minister Lord Bethell has asked the CQC to investigate the latest claims. He told the House of Lords that blanket use of DNARs was ""unacceptable"". Dr Rosie Benneyworth, CQC chief inspector of primary medical services and integrated care, said: ""Health and social care providers have faced extraordinary pressures this year. Both staff, and people using services and their loved ones, have at times raised concerns with us about care. ""It is vital that we take this opportunity to learn from what has happened - challenging poor care and sharing the ways that providers have put people's needs at the heart of their care so that others can learn from them."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Dr Benneyworth said it was unacceptable for DNARs to be applied to groups of people of any description. ""These decisions must continue to be made on an individual basis according to need. Through this review we will look to identify and share best practice in this complex area, as well as identifying where decisions may not have been patient-centred, and ensuring mistakes are not repeated."" NHS England said it had already made clear that orders should only ever be made on an individual basis. The charity Pohwer said it had found blanket DNARs put in place across Norfolk, West Midlands, London, Oxfordshire, Sussex, Surrey and Buckinghamshire, potentially affecting more than 700 people. In a statement, the charity said: ""There are probably many more cases where the homes did not necessarily admit to the blanket DNAR order, or where they did not feel comfortable speaking with an external organisation. So 704 is the minimum number of individuals that would have otherwise been affected.""

"BA boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis'Alex Cruz leaves British Airways after four years with the airline, replaced by Aer Lingus' Sean Doyle.Business","British Airways has announced it is replacing its chief executive Alex Cruz as the airline navigates ""the worst crisis"" facing its industry. Mr Cruz, who has been with BA since 2016, will be immediately replaced by Aer Lingus boss Sean Doyle. Mr Cruz will stay on as non-executive chairman for a transition period before Mr Doyle also takes on the role. BA has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with unions over redundancies and pay cuts. It is cutting about 10,000 staff, drawing criticism from staff and MPs who claim the airline has been following a ""fire and rehire"" policy. Luis Gallego, chief executive of IAG, which owns BA, said: ""We're navigating the worst crisis faced in our industry and I'm confident these internal promotions will ensure IAG is well placed to emerge in a strong position."" The shake-up is one of the first major movesby Mr Gallego who took over as IAG's chief executive last month, replacing long-standing boss Willie Walsh. ""This is a sign that the new chief executive of IAG, Luis Gallego, is flexing his muscles and trying to demonstrate he'll make the changes necessary to lead a sustained recovery for the airline group,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. New data from Heathrow showed the challenges being faced by the travel industry from the coronavirus pandemic. Just 1.2 million passengers travelled through the airport in September, down 82% compared with the same month last year. He's done the dirty work - now a fresh pair of hands is needed. Alex Cruz's most recent task at BA was to push through thousands of job cuts as well as changes to pay and conditions, which will see many remaining staff earning a lot less in future. Those cuts may have been necessary due to the Covid crisis, but the way BA went about it - effectively threatening to fire employees who refused to sign new contracts - provoked deep resentment and bitterness among the workforce. And he was hardly popular to begin with. He arrived at BA with a brief to cut costs and boost profitability, to enable the airline to compete with budget carriers. He succeeded, but at a price. Customer satisfaction fell sharply, leading to accusations that the BA brand was being sacrificed for short-term shareholder value. There were strikes over what was described as ""poverty pay"" by cabin crew. And repeated IT failures proved deeply embarrassing for the company. Now the man who appointed him, former IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, has retired. The new IAG boss, Luis Gallego, appears keen to make his mark and rebuild bridges with staff. Mr Cruz was very much part of the old regime. It should come as no surprise that he now has to step aside. Mr Doyle is returning to BA after just two years in charge at Aer Lingus, which is also owned by IAG. Prior to that, he had worked at BA since 1998. But Ms Streeter said: ""Sean Doyle will have his work cut out to make immediate progress given that British Airways is facing the toughest challenge in its history as demand for international travel has plummeted and quarantine restrictions continue to constrain bookings."" No need to fire and rehire staff, says BA boss British Airways owner to cut more flights Mr Cruz's tenure as BA's boss has been eventful. In September last year, the airline's pilots staged their first ever strike which led to 2,325 flights being cancelled and cost BA â¬137m (Â£124m). It has also suffered a number of costly IT problems, including an incident in 2017 that left 75,000 flyers stranded and cost the airline Â£80m. Last year, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced it intended to fine BA a record Â£183m after a breach of its security system, exposing hundreds of thousands of customer details. The ICO and BA are still in discussions regarding the fine. IAG declined to comment on whether Mr Cruz would receive any compensation when he leaves BA once the transition period is completed. It also declined to say how long the transition period would last. No need to fire and rehire staff, says BA boss British Airways owner to cut more flights 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Who joined Demi as a big winner at the Golden Globes?

Hospitality firms in legal threat over lockdownsIndustry leaders will challenge new local restrictions that could force pubs and other venues to close.,"The UK hospitality industry has said it will take legal action to stop new local lockdown rules that could force pub, clubs and other venues to close. Trade body the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said there was no evidence that hospitality venues contributed to the spread of Covid-19. It comes as the government prepares to unveilnew restrictions for England. NTIA boss Michael Kill said the hospitality industry had been left with ""no other option"". ""These new measures will have a catastrophic impact on late night businesses, and are exacerbated further by an insufficient financial support package presented by the chancellor in an attempt to sustain businesses through this period,"" he said. ""This next round of restrictions are hugely disproportionate and unjust, with no scientific rationale or correlation to Public Health England transmission rates, when compared to other key environments."" Two-thirds pay at firms told to shut over Covid Whitbread to cut 6,000 jobs as hotel demand slumps The Liverpool City Region is expected to face the tightest restrictions under a new ""three tier"" system, which will classify regions as being at a ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" level of alert. In the most infectious areas, pubs, bars and other hospitality and leisure businesses are likely to be forced to close, as has happened in parts of Scotland. The chancellor has promised to pay two-thirds of workers' wages if employers have to shut. But some fear this will not be enough and there could still be an impact on jobs, said Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of business lobby group the CBI. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the government needed to ""show its workings"" ""It is particularly hard for hospitality who worked so hard to get their premises Covid-safe, but also the supply chains that depend on them,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""I think they do want to see a much more evidence-based approach - the government needs to show its workings."" Leaders in northern England, which has been hard hit by the new surge in coronavirus cases, are supporting NTIA's call for a judicial review. So too are the British Beer and Pub Association and two of the country's biggest pub operators, JW Lees and Joseph Holt, alongside 10 other organisations. Sacha Lord, Manchester's Night Time Economy Adviser, said: ""Once again the government wants to shut down pubs and bars, but this cannot keep happening and we need to understand why the hospitality industry is being isolated like this - where is the scientific evidence to suggest closing venues suppresses transmission?"" Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said many workers faced hardship if their employer was forced to close. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The government is treating hospitality industry workers as second-class citizens. Many of them are already on the minimum wage and there is no justification for a furlough scheme that pays two-thirds of their wages when workers in other industries were given four-fifths,"" he said. However, Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said imposing restrictions is the right course. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households and then after that, it's in the retail and hospitality sector. ""So, the major issue here is to focus on the cities and areas with the largest outbreaks and sadly my home city of Liverpool is being hammered at the moment. These restrictions are necessary."" The government is already facing a legal challenge over its decision to impose a 10pm curfew on English pubs. Jeremy Joseph, boss of the G-A-Y club group, said the curfew was detrimental to hospitality businesses and ""makes absolutely no sense"". ""It does the opposite of protecting people by pushing them onto the street at the same time. They are going from being safe inside venues with staggered closing times to unsafe on overcrowded streets and overloaded public transport.""

"Culture secretary disowns 'crass' dancer advertOliver Dowden says an advert suggesting that a ballerina retrain to work in ""cyber"" did not come from him.Business","Downing Street has added its voice to criticism of a government-backed advert suggesting a ballet dancer should retrain in cyber security. A No 10 spokesperson said it was ""not appropriate"" and had been taken down. The ad, the latest in a long-running campaign to promote cyber security jobs, sparked a social media backlash. It had already been disowned by Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who said the ""crass"" ad did not come from his department. Acclaimed choreographer Sir Matthew Bourne was among Twitter users criticising the advert, asking in a tweet: ""This has to be a joke? Right?"" The advert depicts a ballet dancer and reads: ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber (she just doesn't know it yet). Rethink. Reskill. Reboot."" It is attributed to CyberFirst, a programme led by the National Cyber Security Centre to encourage young people to get into tech, and to HM Government. Critics on Twitter called the advert ""patronising"", saying it showed the government was not helping the arts through the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

Before its removal, it read: ""If your career plan's been altered this year, you're not alone. ""2020 has shaken up jobs - but most successful careers have a turning point. The government-backed Rethink. Reskill. Reboot. programme by CyberFirst could be yours."" By Alistair Coleman, BBC anti-disinformation team The reaction to this ""Rethink Reskill Reboot"" campaign was immediate on social media, and the ballet dancer picture was replaced by a picture of a baker almost immediately. In the context of the difficulties facing the arts during the Covid-19 pandemic, it's a sensitive subject. The use of a ballet dancer - seen through the narrow focus of social media - seems dreadfully timed and at least one government minister agrees. The Chancellor's comments during an ITV interview last week have caused confusion around jobs in the arts, but it seems he was talking about all job sectors, rather than the arts in particular. However, it's the persistent belief that he was referring to people in creative industries retraining into new careers that has caused anger. As for the courses themselves, QA have been running vocational courses under the CyberFirst name since 2017, in partnership with the government's NCSC, and sometimes alongside companies like BAE Systems - so these campaigns are not new. Last year, the NCSC used the CyberFirst brand in an event aimed at steering school pupils toward a career in cyber-security, and they have told Huffington Post that the current ""Reboot"" campaign has no connection with them. The image of ""Fatima"" comes from a photograph by Atlanta-based photographer Krys Alex published on Instagram in July 2017. The original picture shows dancers Desire'e Kelley and Tasha Williams from the Vibez in Motion Dance Studio in Atlanta, Georgia. ""Fatima"" is Atlanta-based dancer Desire'e Kelley, pictured here with Tasha Williams The coronavirus pandemic has forced industries to scale back their businesses and cut jobs, including many music venues and cultural organisations. Last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that all workers needed to adapt to the changing environment. He told ITV: ""Can things happen in exactly the way they did? No. But everyone is having to find ways to adapt and adjust to the new reality.""

"Proposal to cut Premier League to 18 teamsRadical proposals could have a ""damaging impact"" on the game, says the Premier League.","Liverpool won the Premier League for the first time last season Radical proposals for the reform of English football could have a ""damaging impact"" on the game, says the Premier League. Under the proposals, led by Liverpool and Manchester United, the English top flight would be cut to 18 teams. The plans would see thePremier League hand over the Â£250m bailoutrequired by the Football League to stave off a financial disaster among its 72 clubs. The Premier League would also hand over 25% of its annual income to the EFL. EFL chief Parry: 'Reforms will benefit game as a whole' The proposals, dubbed Project Big Picture, would see: The Premier League cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with the Championship, League One and League Two each retaining 24 teams. The bottom two teams in the Premier League relegated automatically with the 16th-placed team joining the Championship play-offs. The League Cup and Community Shield abolished. Parachute payments scrapped. A Â£250m rescue fund made immediately available to the EFL Â£100m paid to the FA to make up for lost revenue. Nine clubs given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. But the plans have been criticised by the Premier League, the government and supporters' groups. ""English football is the world's most watched, and has a vibrant, dynamic and competitive league structure that drives interest around the globe,"" a Premier League statement said. ""To maintain this position, it is important that we all work together. Both the Premier League and the FA support a wide-ranging discussion on the future of the game, including its competition structures, calendar and overall financing particularly in light of the effects of Covid-19. ""Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute."" Under the proposals, the EFL Cup in its present form would be abolished and the Community Shield scrapped. In addition, the top flight's 14-club majority voting system would change. The Premier League statement added: ""In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan published today could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support. ""The Premier League has been working in good faith with its clubs and the EFL to seek a resolution to the requirement for Covid-19 rescue funding. This work will continue."" The Department for Culture, Media and Sport condemned what it called a ""backroom deal"". ""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game,"" a DCMS spokesperson said. ""Sustainability, integrity and fair competition are absolutely paramount and anything that may undermine them is deeply troubling. Fans must be front of all our minds, and this shows why our fan led review of football governance will be so critical."" BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is a hugely divisive and potentially seismic proposal, threatening the biggest shake-up of the English game in a generation. Angered by the way the story broke without their blessing, the Premier League has already given it short shrift, viewing this as a regrettable power-grab. In fact one well-placed Premier League source has described it as a ""takeover attempt, rather than a rescue package"". Many will see this as an anti-competitive plot to concentrate power in the hands of the biggest clubs, opening the door to them controlling broadcast contracts, financial rules and even takeovers bids in a way top-flight bosses have always been desperate to avoid - a step towards a European Super League, and a means of freeing up space in the calendar to play more lucrative pre-season friendlies. For years the bigger clubs have wanted more money and more sway. This is the most dramatic manifestation of that to date. But will it get off the ground? There will be huge doubts given 14 clubs would need to approve a plan that would mean fewer Premier League places. But the involvement of the two biggest clubs in the country means this surprising development has to be taken seriously. At a time when the EFL is facing an unprecedented financial crisis however, it is easy to see why they would support a plan that would hand them the Â£250m they need to cover the loss of match-day revenue this season. And many in football will welcome the idea of a more redistributive financial model, with 25% of Premier League income shared at a time when the gulf between the divisions has been identified as a major problem. Indeed, if the threat of this plan helps break the impasse between the Premier League and the government over a rescue package for the EFL, and a more redistributive financial 'reset', perhaps it can emerge as a positive development. The English Football League confirmed it had been in talks over 'Project Big Picture' and that its chairman Rick Parry was in favour of the plans,first reported in the Daily Telegraph.,external ""The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the Covid-19 crisis,"" he said in a statement. ""Discussion and planning around 'Project Big Picture' has been ongoing for quite some time, unrelated to the current pandemic but now has an urgency that simply cannot be denied. ""The revenues flowing from the investment and work of our top clubs has been largely limited to the top division creating a sort of lottery, while Championship clubs struggle to behave prudently and Leagues One and Two are financially stretched despite enormous revenues English football generates. ""This plan devised by our top clubs and the English Football League puts an end to all of that."" Parry says, in 2018-19, Championship clubs received Â£146m in EFL distributions and Premier League solidarity payments, compared with Â£1.56bn received by the bottom 14 Premier League clubs. He added parachute payments made to eight recently relegated clubs totalled Â£246m and represented one-third of the total Championship turnover. Parry said it created ""a major distortion that impacts the league annually"". ""The gap between the Premier League and the English Football League has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League,"" he said. Manchester United are among the clubs driving the change It is understood Liverpool's owners, the Fenway Sports Group, came forward with the initial plan, which has been worked on by United co-chairman Joel Glazer. It is anticipated it will receive the backing of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur - the other members of England's 'big six'. The idea is to address longstanding EFL concerns about the huge gap in funding between its divisions and the Premier League by handing over 25% of the annual income, although the current parachute payment system would be scrapped. There would be a Â£250m up-front payment to address the existing crisis created by the coronavirus pandemic, seen by some as a bid to garner support for the proposals. In addition, the Football Association would receive what is being described as a Â£100m ""gift"". The Football Supporters' Association said it noted ""with grave concern"" the proposals, adding they had ""far-reaching consequences for the whole of domestic football"". ""Once again it appears that big decisions in football are apparently being stitched up behind our backs by billionaire club owners who continue to treat football as their personal fiefdom,"" it said in a statement. ""Football is far more than a business to be carved up; it is part of our communities and our heritage, and football fans are its lifeblood. As football's most important stakeholders, it is crucial that fans are consulted and involved in the game's decision-making. ""We have welcomed the government's commitment to a 'fan-led review of the governance of football'; we would argue that today's revelations have made that process even more relevant and urgent."" The organisation said it remained ""open-minded to any suggestions for the improvement of the governance and organisation of the game"". It added: ""We would however emphasise that in our discussions so far, very few of our members have ever expressed the view that what football really needs is a greater concentration of power in the hands of the big six billionaire-owned clubs."" No date has been set for the proposed new-style league to be in operation but sources have suggested 2022-23 is not out of the question. In order to get down from 20 to 18, it is anticipated four clubs would be relegated directly, with two promoted from the Championship. In addition, there would be play-offs involving the team to finish 16th in the Premier League and those in third, fourth and fifth in the second tier. It is also planned that, as well as the 'big six', ever-present league member Everton, West Ham United and Southampton - ninth and 11th respectively in the list of clubs who have featured in the most Premier League seasons - would be granted special status. If six of those nine clubs vote in favour of a proposal, it would be enough to get it passed. There is no mention of Aston Villa and Newcastle United, both of whom have featured in more Premier League campaigns than Manchester City.

Son appeals for help in catching father's killerAndrew Wilson was just four when he saw his father lying on the ground moments after being shot.Highlands & Islands,"This video can not be played Alistair Wilson murder: âMy only memory of my dad was when he was shotâ The son of bank worker Alistair Wilson, who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home in 2004, has appealed for help in catching his father's killer. Andrew Wilson was aged just four at the time of the murder in Nairn in the Highlands. He said the only memory he has left of his father is seeing him lying on the ground moments after being shot. It is the first time Mr Wilson has spoken publicly about the murder and how it has devastated his family. He said: ""I still cannot believe how someone could shoot my dad dead on our doorstep while my brother and I were upstairs. ""Photographs are all I have and no family should suffer the way we have all these years. ""I am appealing on behalf of my family to anyone who may have any information, no matter how big or small, toplease come forward,external. Someone out there could have the missing piece of information."" The doorstep murder of Alistair Wilson Alistair Wilson, 30, was shot at his home at about 19:00 on 28 November 2004. He later died in hospital. Mr Wilson's wife Veronica had answered the door to his killer - a stocky man wearing a baseball cap - who asked for Alistair Wilson. Mr Wilson spoke to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the word Paul written on it. He was then shot with a German-made handgun. A massive police inquiry was launched at the time, but no-one has been apprehended and detectives continue to investigate the case. A young Andrew Wilson with his father Alistair, mother Veronica and younger brother Andrew, now 20, recalled the moment he saw his father lying on the doorstep. He said: ""Someone came to our family home on a Sunday evening while my dad was reading my brother and me bedtime stories after our bath. ""The next thing I know I am looking at my dad lying in our doorway covered in blood."" Mr Wilson's family, along with detectives, are using the approaching 16th anniversary to make a renewed appeal for information in the hope of finally bringing someone to justice. Andrew says all he has left of his father are photographs Andrew Wilson and his brother at his father's graveside Andrew Wilson added: ""I was four years old when this happened and my dad was only 30. ""There would be no more bedtime stories, no more playing football or helping him in the garden. ""My dad and I missed out on so many things together, showing me how to tie a tie, driving lessons and taking me for my first pint. ""I am now a 20-year-old with little answers regarding my dad's death. For the last 16 years I have been left wondering why I didn't have a dad like all my friends. ""Nothing can bring my dad back, but knowing who did this and why could give us the closure we need. Any information could be crucial to our case."" This video can not be played Alistair Wilson's widow: 'A who and a why would let us move on' Det Insp Gary Winter, of the Major Investigation Team, has outlined the specific areas being focused on in the latest appeal. He said: ""The murderer was described in 2004 as a man aged 30-40 years old, stocky build and approximately 5ft 4in to 5ft 7in tall. ""Alistair's killer would now be approaching his 50s or 60s and has enjoyed a life denied to his victim and his family. ""The handgun used was a Haenel Suhl pocket pistol from the 1930s, which has distinctive H and S letters superimposed on the grip. ""We believe this weapon is likely to have been taken to the UK after World War Two as some form of souvenir, however the ammunition used in the murder is from the 1980s or 90s. ""Do you know of anyone who had a similar pocket pistol?  Do you know of anyone who mentioned having firearm souvenirs from the World War Two or from any family who were World War Two veterans?"" This is a murder which people, not just in the Highlands but across the world, are determined will be solved. All murders are shocking but this was so beyond the imagination that it has had people bewildered and frustrated for 16 years, including the police. Three years ago I interviewed Veronica Wilson, Alistair Wilson's husband. It was the first time she had been interviewed for a dozen years and it formed the spine of The Doorstep Murder podcast series. She revealed then that her older son, aged just four at the time, saw her father's body on the doorstep. It was hoped then that her pleas for new information would help find the killer. It generated many calls to both the BBC and Police Scotland but the murder remained unsolved. The fact that Alistair Wilson had been reading his young sons a bedtime story moments before he was shot so brutally has generated enormous sympathy and anger that his two boys have grown up without their father. So to hear from Andrew Wilson will reunite people with the details of the murder and, it's hoped, persuade someone with information to step forward after all these years. Listen toThe Doorstep Murder podcast on BBC Sounds. The doorstep murder shocked the residents of Nairn Police believe the murder weapon may have been brought to the UK after World War Two Det Insp Winter also highlighted the envelope given to Mr Wilson before the shooting - and the possibility that the murder was a case of mistaken identity. He said: ""The blue envelope handed to Alistair by the killer had the name Paul on it, which may or may not be relevant. Does this mean anything to you in the context of this investigation? ""Lastly, do you know any other person by the name Alistair Wilson, who may have been the intended target of violence or retribution to any extent?"" Mr Winter said the force remained committed to ensuring the person responsible for the murder was brought to justice. He added: ""Someone out there knows what happened to Alistair and I hope this appeal serves as a vital reminder that it is never too late to come forward with information. Do not assume that the police already know the information you possess.""

LiveLiveUK government scientists to give update on virus spread6 minutes ago,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells a news conference he is taking a ""balanced approach"" to managing the virus But he says he does not favour another national lockdown ""right now"" because it would harm the economy Boris Johnson tells the Commons there will be a new three-level alert system for England - medium, high and very high Liverpool will be on the highest level of alert, the PM says. He adds he does not want a new national lockdown More people are in hospital with Covid than before lockdown in March, says NHS medical director Stephen Powis Top UK scientific advisers have said NHS Nightingale hospitals are on stand-by in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate Most A-level and GCSE exams in England will be delayed by three weeks in 2021 In China, Qingdao's population of nine million will be tested for Covid-19 over five days after 12 cases There are more than 37 million confirmed cases globally with more than 1.07 million deaths Edited by Claire Heald Thanks for following our live coverage today. Updates were brought to you by: Alice Evans, Claire Heald, Ella Wills, Francesca Gillett, George Wright, Joshua Cheetham, Kate Whannel, Katie Wright, Paul Seddon and Paulin Kola Join us again tomorrow. Hello and thank you for following our coverage today. Here are some of the biggest developments around the world: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Recent advice from Sage, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies,has just been published.,external It includesrecommendations made in a meeting on 21 Sept,external, which included asking ministers to consider immediately introducing:  The government has stopped way short of this - perhaps why Prof Chris Whitty was so keen to demonstrate his view that the basic three tiers of measures aren't enough on their own. It also shows how much the political atmosphere has changed. At the beginning of the pandemic, ministers were very keen to be seen to be following Sage advice. This paper makes clear how they are making different decisions now. Quite the timing too, publishing all this about an hour after a national press conference. Read more from Laura, here. West Ham's London Stadium West Ham areagainst radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester Unitedto reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The proposals, which include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup, have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer as part of a plans for a Covid rescue package for English Football League clubs. Under the controversial plans, nine clubs would be given ""special voting rights"" on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. West Ham would be one of those nine clubs but it is understood they were unaware of the proposals - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday. A club insider has told BBC Sport they are ""very much against"" it. Read more about the Project Big Picture planshere. Hello and thank you for joining our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We've spent a lot of time following today's announcements by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here are some of the most significant developments across the rest of Europe: Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford hasthreatened a travel ban on visitors from Covid hotspots in England coming to Walesif the prime minister does not impose his own. He said he was giving UK ministers ""one final opportunity"" before he makes changes in Welsh law. The UK government announced on Monday that it will advise against non-essential travel from Merseyside - which is facing the toughest coronavirus restrictions in England - but it stopped short of making it illegal, angering Welsh ministers. Mr Drakeford said he could close the border with England, but that is not his preferred option. Fiona TrottBBC News Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up. On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives. The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, itâs getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise. It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who donât have the virus and still need urgent treatment. Itâs not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England. These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Away from the PM's announcements today, the pandemic's impact on students continues. Englandâs universities minister says it is âsimply outrageousâ how
much students have been charged for food parcels when they are forced into
self-isolation. Michelle Donelan has tapped into the debate about the conditions
facing students who have found themselves spending their new term in
self-isolation, after Covid outbreaks on campus. Responding to a question in the House of Commons about isolating
students being charged Â£18 per day for food, she said âno university should
seek to profit from students self-isolatingâ - and she promised to write to
universities to âmake the point"". ""Students self-isolating in catered halls should receive free
food, whilst other students should receive food which is either free - like many
universities including Sheffield Hallam and Edge Hill are doing - or at a price
which can be afforded within a student's budget,â said Ms Donelan. The University of East Anglia had been charging about Â£18 per day
for food for self-isolating students - but after accusations of taking advantage
of students, this was lowered last week to about Â£12 per day. The minister also revealed that there were now about 9,000 students
with Covid - describing the figure as a âcumulative number of cases over the
last seven daysâ. The UCU lecturersâ union has questioned why students have been
brought back to campus when so many are either catching coronavirus, or being
put into social isolation by outbreaks in their accommodation blocks. Labour MP Richard Burgon accused the government of playing âRussian
roulette with the lives of students, staff and local communitiesâ. Here are the main developments from the prime minister's press conference this evening:  Here are the main developments from other parts of the UK: Helen Pidd from the Guardian asks the PM if he accepts that decisions made on the national lockdown were made to suit London and the rest of the South - and asks if that's why the North is seeing such a surge in cases. The PM says he doesn't accept this, and that the main difference between this ""bout"" of Covid-19 and the one in April is that it's much more localised this time around. Pitt also asks Prof Whitty about evidence that curbs on pubs and restaurants work. Prof Whitty says all the evidence points towards increased transmission of the virus in indoor settings, particularly those where people mix with other households, and without wearing masks. This situation crops up in hospitality as well as in other sectors, he says - ""and that is why the hospitality sector has been involved in restrictions"". England's chief medical officer says there are ""two poles"" of a response to this virus - a full lockdown to suppress the virus, and no lockdown at all. ""What we're trying to do... is find the right balance between the various things - all of which cause harm, all of which we would not want to do - but which can, collectively, if we do them all together, pull the numbers down,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The question from the Liverpool Echo points to a possible political problem for the Prime Minister. His big promise at the election was about spreading opportunity beyond London and the South East. The fact that the virus is currently disproportionately affecting areas of the north of England risks making it look like itâs being hit harder or treated differently. As Rishi Sunak pointed out, though, these are nationally-applicable measures that any area could expect to see if rates rise A journalist from the Liverpool Echo asks about financial support for sectors struggling because of the restrictions. He asks whether people in such industries are ""valued less now"" than when the government was running the full furlough wage support scheme. The chancellor says thejob support scheme(JSS), which replaces furlough from next month, is a UK-wide scheme which treats businesses in all areas the same. He adds, though, that the JSS is a package the government believes is ""sustainable and affordable for the long term"". Boris Johnson is asked whether people will be asked to adhere to restrictions for a ""year or so"" if a vaccine is not found. He is also asked whether there are ""inconsistencies"" in the new system in terms of which areas have ended up in which tier. The prime minister replies that some ""anomalies"" are ""inevitably going to happen"". He adds that medical progress is being made against the disease, but local and national restrictions are the ""best utensil"" the country has ""for now"". Chris Whitty says medical progress is impossible to predict exactly but he is ""extremely confident"" the country will go into ""next winter"" in a ""much better place"". Beth Rigby from Sky News reads the PM's opening remarks back to him - ""we must act now"", he said, against the ""flashboard warnings"" of increasing cases and hospital admissions. Rigby points out that since Liverpool is the only area facing any vastly more stringent measures, that the PM's ""rhetoric is ""outstripping the measures"". She suggests the reason for that might be that local leaders are reluctant to accept the government's plans for local restrictions. But Johnson says he wants to ""take local authorities with me"" because local knowledge, enforcement and contact tracing are ""immensely valuable"" in helping to tackle the spread of the virus. He has a stark message for any local leader who is not willing to agree with the three-tiered system. ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of national government to take the necessary action to protect the public,"" he says. Next up, ITV's Robert Peston asks whether more areas in the north of England would be in the ""very high"" areas without the interventions so far. Boris Johnson says the government is working ""particularly"" with badly affected areas in the north of England and ""stands ready"" to work with all local areas. Chris Whitty says the data showed the need to ""do more"" with the extra restrictions. He adds, though, that it is an ""illusion"" to think that the virus can be further suppressed ""without causing harm"" in areas such as the economy. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnsonâs reference to the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram shows the importance of local leaders in all of this. Some, like the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, are very unhappy about the tier the government has put them into. He said he was not expecting Birmingham and some surrounding areas to see the restrictions on mixing in pubs and restaurants which have been announced. It's time for questions from journalists, and the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks several - including about whether financial support is enough for people facing restrictions, and whether the restrictions themselves will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
England's three-tier lockdown plan to be unveiledThe Liverpool City Region is expected to face the tightest Covid restrictions under the new system.,"Crowds gathered in Liverpool on Monday to watch filming for a new Batman film in the city Boris Johnson is due to announce a new ""three-tier"" Covid system for England. The PM will address Parliament at 15:30 BST, setting out different rules for regions classified as being on ""medium"", ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. The Liverpool City Region - home to 1.5 million - is expected to face the tightest restrictions with pubs and gyms closed, and further rules on households mixing indoors. Newcastle council's leader has said the North East could avoid tighter rules. Mr Johnson will address MPs before holding a Downing Street news conference. Other areas awaiting news of further restrictions include Greater Manchester, Nottingham and Leeds. Liverpool recorded 600Â cases per 100,000 people inthe week ending 6 October. The average for England was 74. The Liverpool City Region includes the local authority districts of Halton, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral, as well as Liverpool. Local MPs were told during a call with Health Secretary Matt Hancock all bars, pubs, gyms and betting shops will be closed while restaurants will remain open for the moment. What are the Covid restrictions where I live? Live updates: PM to address MPs on new three-tier system Concern mounts at Covid shutdown 'ripple effect' Legal restrictions will also be placed on indoor household mixing and there will be guidance on travel restrictions. The new curbs are to be reviewed after a month. Mr Johnson chaired a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee ""to determine the final interventions"" on Wednesday morning. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said experts told Cobra even tier three restrictions would be unlikely to bring the UK's R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus - below 1. The PM will announce changes in Parliament, before speaking at a Downing Street news conference at 19:00. He is expected to be joined at No 10 by Chancellor Rishi Sunak and England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. This video can not be played Videos on social media showed Saturday night street scenes in some cities, including an impromptu game of cricket During a data briefing earlier, NHS England medical director Stephen Powis saidmore people were now in hospital with Covid than before restrictions were introduced in March. He confirmed Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogatewere being prepared to take patients. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, deputy chief medical officer for England, said infection rates had never dropped as low in the northern England as in the South but warned ""things are heating up"" across the country. Tougher measures were introducedin Scotland on Friday, including the closure of pubs and restaurants across the central belt, while the Welsh government has said the next few days could determineif ""national measures"" are implemented. Under the new system for England, tier three is expected to involve the tightest restrictions. We know the broad outline of what the government is going to announce today. Ministers have been working on a tier system for local restrictions in England for weeks - and today they'll confirm how it will work and the basic principles. The Liverpool region is set to be the first put into the ""very high"" top tier - which will mean significant restrictions on hospitality within days. But there are still details of a support package being worked out. The metro mayor in Liverpool Steve Rotheram is adamant there needs to be more support for workers and businesses that will be told to close. He doesn't think the chancellor's current plans go far enough - and I'm told conversations on economic support are likely to continue into this afternoon. There have been questions about definitions - when is a pub a pub, which could be told to close, rather than restaurant which might not? It's worth highlighting that if other areas are added to the highest tier in the next few weeks, restrictions may look different. Sources say there is room for flexibility based on local factors. Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said he wanted ""some surety from national government that if we hit some milestones we can come out of tier three very quickly"". He said the government had been clear the Liverpool City Region would be placed in the highest category, with ""no ifs, no buts"", and he added it had already been agreed there would be more local control over the tracing of close contacts and enforcement of restrictions. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the government was ""not panicking"" but taking ""reasonable and proportionate measures"", adding that ""we know there are challenges around hospitality"". Calum Semple, professor of outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool and advisor to the government, said: ""Most of the outbreaks are happening within and between households and then after that, it's in the retail and hospitality sector. ""So, the major issue here is to focus on the cities and areas with the largest outbreaks and sadly my home city of Liverpool is being hammered at the moment. These restrictions are necessary."" The problem with introducing the sort of restrictions that are being suggested to control the spread of the virus is that no-one is really sure whether they will really work. Firstly, while the government's advisers can track patterns in where infected individuals have been prior to being diagnosed, they cannot prove that they were actually infected in those places. Secondly, there will be unintended consequences. Close pubs and you may make the situation worse by driving people to mix more in private homes which are less ""Covid-secure"". It is a point that has been made in recent days by Manchester City Council leader Sir Richard Leese as well as others as ministers weigh up their options. Then there is the economic, social and emotional toll of closing down parts of a community. These are decisions that will divide opinion and, what is more, it will be nigh on impossible to judge exactly what impact they will have had on the virus. Oldham West and Royton MP Jim McMahon said Greater Manchester would be placed in tier two - ""with household restrictions on meeting indoors in any setting, but not outdoors"" - and pubs that serve food staying open. It came after Sacha Lord, Greater Manchester's night-time economy adviser,started legal proceedingsto challenge any restrictions on hospitality and entertainment venues in the North of England. SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? People in17 parts of Wales now face local lockdown rules- and cannot leave these areas without a good reason, such as going to work. Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething said he was disappointed that the prime minister was not issuing guidance on whether people should travel out of highly infected areas. Ministers andhealth officials in Northern Ireland spent Sunday discussingwhat to do about the rapidly increasing rates of the virus. One MP said he believed lockdowns would be examined by the Northern Ireland Executive on Monday. On Sunday, 12,872 people in the UK were reported to have tested positive for coronavirus - some 2,294 fewer than on Saturday. There were a further 65 deaths - down from 81 on Saturday.

Hospitality firms in legal threat over lockdowns,"The UK hospitality industry has said it will take legal action to stop new local lockdown rules that could force pub, clubs and other venues to close. Trade body the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) said there was no evidence that hospitality venues contributed to the spread of Covid-19. It comes as the government prepares to unveilnew restrictions for England. NTIA boss Michael Kill said the hospitality industry had been left with ""no other option"". ""These new measures will have a catastrophic impact on late night businesses, and are exacerbated further by an insufficient financial support package presented by the chancellor in an attempt to sustain businesses through this period,"" he said. ""This next round of restrictions are hugely disproportionate and unjust, with no scientific rationale or correlation to Public Health England transmission rates, when compared to other key environments."" Two-thirds pay at firms told to shut over Covid Whitbread to cut 6,000 jobs as hotel demand slumps The Liverpool City Region is expected to face the tightest restrictions under a new ""three tier"" system, which will classify regions as being at a ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" level of alert. In the most infectious areas, pubs, bars and other hospitality and leisure businesses are likely to be forced to close, as has happened in parts of Scotland. The chancellor has promised to pay two-thirds of workers' wages if employers have to shut. But some fear this will not be enough and there could still be an impact on jobs, said Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of business lobby group the CBI. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the government needed to ""show its workings"" ""It is particularly hard for hospitality who worked so hard to get their premises Covid-safe, but also the supply chains that depend on them,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""I think they do want to see a much more evidence-based approach - the government needs to show its workings."" Leaders in northern England, which has been hard hit by the new surge in coronavirus cases, are supporting NTIA's call for a judicial review. So too are the British Beer and Pub Association and two of the country's biggest pub operators, JW Lees and Joseph Holt, alongside 10 other organisations. Sacha Lord, Manchester's Night Time Economy Adviser, said: ""Once again the government wants to shut down pubs and bars, but this cannot keep happening and we need to understand why the hospitality industry is being isolated like this - where is the scientific evidence to suggest closing venues suppresses transmission?""

Do-not-resuscitate order: blanket use reviewed,"The use of do-not-attempt-resuscitate (DNAR) orders is to be reviewed after a number were wrongly applied in care homes at the start of the pandemic. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) will investigate concerns that some care homes still have blanket orders in place covering groups of residents. It became clear that blanket use was in place in some care homes in the early weeks of the pandemic. But it was widely condemned by the CQC and medical bodies. Covid: Care homes policies violated human rights, says Amnesty Families not told about 'do not resuscitate' orders âI donât want to be resuscitated at allâ The decision about whether or not to attempt resuscitation if a very sick person falls dangerously ill is supposed to be discussed with the individual, or family members if they are too sick. Doctors can make a decision on the spot without consultation in exceptional circumstances. However, the decisions are always supposed to be made on an individual case-by-case basis. The health minister Lord Bethell has asked the CQC to investigate the latest claims. He told the House of Lords that blanket use of DNARs was ""unacceptable"". Dr Rosie Benneyworth, CQC chief inspector of primary medical services and integrated care, said: ""Health and social care providers have faced extraordinary pressures this year. Both staff, and people using services and their loved ones, have at times raised concerns with us about care. ""It is vital that we take this opportunity to learn from what has happened - challenging poor care and sharing the ways that providers have put people's needs at the heart of their care so that others can learn from them."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Dr Benneyworth said it was unacceptable for DNARs to be applied to groups of people of any description. ""These decisions must continue to be made on an individual basis according to need. Through this review we will look to identify and share best practice in this complex area, as well as identifying where decisions may not have been patient-centred, and ensuring mistakes are not repeated."" NHS England said it had already made clear that orders should only ever be made on an individual basis. The charity Pohwer said it had found blanket DNARs put in place across Norfolk, West Midlands, London, Oxfordshire, Sussex, Surrey and Buckinghamshire, potentially affecting more than 700 people. In a statement, the charity said: ""There are probably many more cases where the homes did not necessarily admit to the blanket DNAR order, or where they did not feel comfortable speaking with an external organisation. So 704 is the minimum number of individuals that would have otherwise been affected."" Last week Amnesty International said sending thousands of older untested patients into care homes in England at the start of the coronavirus lockdown was a violation of their human rights. More than 18,000 people living in care homes died with Covid-19, and Amnesty says the public inquiry promised by the government must begin immediately, including a thorough review of the use of DNAR forms.

Son recalls Nairn banker 'unexplained' shooting,"This video can not be played Alistair Wilson murder: âMy only memory of my dad was when he was shotâ The son of bank worker Alistair Wilson, who was shot dead on the doorstep of his home in 2004, has appealed for help in catching his father's killer. Andrew Wilson was aged just four at the time of the murder in Nairn in the Highlands. He said the only memory he has left of his father is seeing him lying on the ground moments after being shot. It is the first time Mr Wilson has spoken publicly about the murder and how it has devastated his family. He said: ""I still cannot believe how someone could shoot my dad dead on our doorstep while my brother and I were upstairs. ""Photographs are all I have and no family should suffer the way we have all these years. ""I am appealing on behalf of my family to anyone who may have any information, no matter how big or small, toplease come forward,external. Someone out there could have the missing piece of information."" The doorstep murder of Alistair Wilson Alistair Wilson, 30, was shot at his home at about 19:00 on 28 November 2004. He later died in hospital. Mr Wilson's wife Veronica had answered the door to his killer - a stocky man wearing a baseball cap - who asked for Alistair Wilson. Mr Wilson spoke to the man and was handed an empty blue envelope with the word Paul written on it. He was then shot with a German-made handgun. A massive police inquiry was launched at the time, but no-one has been apprehended and detectives continue to investigate the case. A young Andrew Wilson with his father Alistair, mother Veronica and younger brother Andrew, now 20, recalled the moment he saw his father lying on the doorstep. He said: ""Someone came to our family home on a Sunday evening while my dad was reading my brother and me bedtime stories after our bath. ""The next thing I know I am looking at my dad lying in our doorway covered in blood."" Mr Wilson's family, along with detectives, are using the approaching 16th anniversary to make a renewed appeal for information in the hope of finally bringing someone to justice. Andrew says all he has left of his father are photographs Andrew Wilson and his brother at his father's graveside Andrew Wilson added: ""I was four years old when this happened and my dad was only 30. ""There would be no more bedtime stories, no more playing football or helping him in the garden. ""My dad and I missed out on so many things together, showing me how to tie a tie, driving lessons and taking me for my first pint. ""I am now a 20-year-old with little answers regarding my dad's death. For the last 16 years I have been left wondering why I didn't have a dad like all my friends. ""Nothing can bring my dad back, but knowing who did this and why could give us the closure we need. Any information could be crucial to our case."" This video can not be played Alistair Wilson's widow: 'A who and a why would let us move on' Det Insp Gary Winter, of the Major Investigation Team, has outlined the specific areas being focused on in the latest appeal. He said: ""The murderer was described in 2004 as a man aged 30-40 years old, stocky build and approximately 5ft 4in to 5ft 7in tall. ""Alistair's killer would now be approaching his 50s or 60s and has enjoyed a life denied to his victim and his family. ""The handgun used was a Haenel Suhl pocket pistol from the 1930s, which has distinctive H and S letters superimposed on the grip. ""We believe this weapon is likely to have been taken to the UK after World War Two as some form of souvenir, however the ammunition used in the murder is from the 1980s or 90s. ""Do you know of anyone who had a similar pocket pistol?  Do you know of anyone who mentioned having firearm souvenirs from the World War Two or from any family who were World War Two veterans?"" This is a murder which people, not just in the Highlands but across the world, are determined will be solved. All murders are shocking but this was so beyond the imagination that it has had people bewildered and frustrated for 16 years, including the police. Three years ago I interviewed Veronica Wilson, Alistair Wilson's husband. It was the first time she had been interviewed for a dozen years and it formed the spine of The Doorstep Murder podcast series. She revealed then that her older son, aged just four at the time, saw her father's body on the doorstep. It was hoped then that her pleas for new information would help find the killer. It generated many calls to both the BBC and Police Scotland but the murder remained unsolved. The fact that Alistair Wilson had been reading his young sons a bedtime story moments before he was shot so brutally has generated enormous sympathy and anger that his two boys have grown up without their father. So to hear from Andrew Wilson will reunite people with the details of the murder and, it's hoped, persuade someone with information to step forward after all these years. Listen toThe Doorstep Murder podcast on BBC Sounds. The doorstep murder shocked the residents of Nairn Police believe the murder weapon may have been brought to the UK after World War Two Det Insp Winter also highlighted the envelope given to Mr Wilson before the shooting - and the possibility that the murder was a case of mistaken identity. He said: ""The blue envelope handed to Alistair by the killer had the name Paul on it, which may or may not be relevant. Does this mean anything to you in the context of this investigation? ""Lastly, do you know any other person by the name Alistair Wilson, who may have been the intended target of violence or retribution to any extent?"" Mr Winter said the force remained committed to ensuring the person responsible for the murder was brought to justice. He added: ""Someone out there knows what happened to Alistair and I hope this appeal serves as a vital reminder that it is never too late to come forward with information. Do not assume that the police already know the information you possess.""

It was the first time she had been interviewed for a dozen years and it formed the spine of The Doorstep Murder podcast series. She revealed then that her older son, aged just four at the time, saw her father's body on the doorstep. It was hoped then that her pleas for new information would help find the killer. It generated many calls to both the BBC and Police Scotland but the murder remained unsolved. The fact that Alistair Wilson had been reading his young sons a bedtime story moments before he was shot so brutally has generated enormous sympathy and anger that his two boys have grown up without their father. So to hear from Andrew Wilson will reunite people with the details of the murder and, it's hoped, persuade someone with information to step forward after all these years. Listen toThe Doorstep Murder podcast on BBC Sounds. The doorstep murder shocked the residents of Nairn Police believe the murder weapon may have been brought to the UK after World War Two Det Insp Winter also highlighted the envelope given to Mr Wilson before the shooting - and the possibility that the murder was a case of mistaken identity. He said: ""The blue envelope handed to Alistair by the killer had the name Paul on it, which may or may not be relevant. Does this mean anything to you in the context of this investigation? ""Lastly, do you know any other person by the name Alistair Wilson, who may have been the intended target of violence or retribution to any extent?"" Mr Winter said the force remained committed to ensuring the person responsible for the murder was brought to justice. He added: ""Someone out there knows what happened to Alistair and I hope this appeal serves as a vital reminder that it is never too late to come forward with information. Do not assume that the police already know the information you possess.""

Hello and thank you for following our coverage today. Here are some of the biggest developments around the world: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Recent advice from Sage, the government's scientific advisory group for emergencies,has just been published.,external It includesrecommendations made in a meeting on 21 Sept,external, which included asking ministers to consider immediately introducing:  The government has stopped way short of this - perhaps why Prof Chris Whitty was so keen to demonstrate his view that the basic three tiers of measures aren't enough on their own. It also shows how much the political atmosphere has changed. At the beginning of the pandemic, ministers were very keen to be seen to be following Sage advice. This paper makes clear how they are making different decisions now. Quite the timing too, publishing all this about an hour after a national press conference. Read more from Laura, here. West Ham's London Stadium West Ham areagainst radical plans by Liverpool and Manchester Unitedto reform the English football pyramid, according to a club source. The proposals, which include reducing the Premier League to 18 clubs and scrapping the EFL Cup, have been put together by Liverpool owner John Henry and Manchester United co-chairman Joel Glazer as part of a plans for a Covid rescue package for English Football League clubs. Under the controversial plans, nine clubs would be given ""special voting rights"" on certain issues, based on their extended runs in the Premier League. West Ham would be one of those nine clubs but it is understood they were unaware of the proposals - and were shocked when they emerged into the public domain on Sunday. A club insider has told BBC Sport they are ""very much against"" it. Read more about the Project Big Picture planshere. Hello and thank you for joining our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We've spent a lot of time following today's announcements by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Here are some of the most significant developments across the rest of Europe: Wales First Minister Mark Drakeford hasthreatened a travel ban on visitors from Covid hotspots in England coming to Walesif the prime minister does not impose his own. He said he was giving UK ministers ""one final opportunity"" before he makes changes in Welsh law. The UK government announced on Monday that it will advise against non-essential travel from Merseyside - which is facing the toughest coronavirus restrictions in England - but it stopped short of making it illegal, angering Welsh ministers. Mr Drakeford said he could close the border with England, but that is not his preferred option. Fiona TrottBBC News Much of the focus has been on restrictions changing today in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. Within the health service, preparation for treating patients in a second wave is stepping up. On an industrial estate in Sunderland, this building could soon be saving lives. The Nightingale Hospital has 460 beds and until now has never been used. Along with the sites in Harrogate and Manchester, itâs getting ready for the next phase of the pandemic as patient numbers continue to rise. It will be up to local clinicians to decide whether the Nightingale beds are used for coronavirus patients, or for those who donât have the virus and still need urgent treatment. Itâs not surprising that these buildings are now on standby. Figures suggest that out of the ten hardest hit local authorities in the UK, six are in the north of England. These Nightingale hospitals are getting ready to take some of that pressure. Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Away from the PM's announcements today, the pandemic's impact on students continues. Englandâs universities minister says it is âsimply outrageousâ how
much students have been charged for food parcels when they are forced into
self-isolation. Michelle Donelan has tapped into the debate about the conditions
facing students who have found themselves spending their new term in
self-isolation, after Covid outbreaks on campus. Responding to a question in the House of Commons about isolating
students being charged Â£18 per day for food, she said âno university should
seek to profit from students self-isolatingâ - and she promised to write to
universities to âmake the point"". ""Students self-isolating in catered halls should receive free
food, whilst other students should receive food which is either free - like many
universities including Sheffield Hallam and Edge Hill are doing - or at a price
which can be afforded within a student's budget,â said Ms Donelan. The University of East Anglia had been charging about Â£18 per day
for food for self-isolating students - but after accusations of taking advantage
of students, this was lowered last week to about Â£12 per day. The minister also revealed that there were now about 9,000 students
with Covid - describing the figure as a âcumulative number of cases over the
last seven daysâ. The UCU lecturersâ union has questioned why students have been
brought back to campus when so many are either catching coronavirus, or being
put into social isolation by outbreaks in their accommodation blocks. Labour MP Richard Burgon accused the government of playing âRussian
roulette with the lives of students, staff and local communitiesâ. Here are the main developments from the prime minister's press conference this evening:  Here are the main developments from other parts of the UK: Helen Pidd from the Guardian asks the PM if he accepts that decisions made on the national lockdown were made to suit London and the rest of the South - and asks if that's why the North is seeing such a surge in cases. The PM says he doesn't accept this, and that the main difference between this ""bout"" of Covid-19 and the one in April is that it's much more localised this time around. Pitt also asks Prof Whitty about evidence that curbs on pubs and restaurants work. Prof Whitty says all the evidence points towards increased transmission of the virus in indoor settings, particularly those where people mix with other households, and without wearing masks. This situation crops up in hospitality as well as in other sectors, he says - ""and that is why the hospitality sector has been involved in restrictions"". England's chief medical officer says there are ""two poles"" of a response to this virus - a full lockdown to suppress the virus, and no lockdown at all. ""What we're trying to do... is find the right balance between the various things - all of which cause harm, all of which we would not want to do - but which can, collectively, if we do them all together, pull the numbers down,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The question from the Liverpool Echo points to a possible political problem for the Prime Minister. His big promise at the election was about spreading opportunity beyond London and the South East. The fact that the virus is currently disproportionately affecting areas of the north of England risks making it look like itâs being hit harder or treated differently. As Rishi Sunak pointed out, though, these are nationally-applicable measures that any area could expect to see if rates rise A journalist from the Liverpool Echo asks about financial support for sectors struggling because of the restrictions. He asks whether people in such industries are ""valued less now"" than when the government was running the full furlough wage support scheme. The chancellor says thejob support scheme(JSS), which replaces furlough from next month, is a UK-wide scheme which treats businesses in all areas the same. He adds, though, that the JSS is a package the government believes is ""sustainable and affordable for the long term"". Boris Johnson is asked whether people will be asked to adhere to restrictions for a ""year or so"" if a vaccine is not found. He is also asked whether there are ""inconsistencies"" in the new system in terms of which areas have ended up in which tier. The prime minister replies that some ""anomalies"" are ""inevitably going to happen"". He adds that medical progress is being made against the disease, but local and national restrictions are the ""best utensil"" the country has ""for now"". Chris Whitty says medical progress is impossible to predict exactly but he is ""extremely confident"" the country will go into ""next winter"" in a ""much better place"". Beth Rigby from Sky News reads the PM's opening remarks back to him - ""we must act now"", he said, against the ""flashboard warnings"" of increasing cases and hospital admissions. Rigby points out that since Liverpool is the only area facing any vastly more stringent measures, that the PM's ""rhetoric is ""outstripping the measures"". She suggests the reason for that might be that local leaders are reluctant to accept the government's plans for local restrictions. But Johnson says he wants to ""take local authorities with me"" because local knowledge, enforcement and contact tracing are ""immensely valuable"" in helping to tackle the spread of the virus. He has a stark message for any local leader who is not willing to agree with the three-tiered system. ""If we can't get agreement, then clearly it is the duty of national government to take the necessary action to protect the public,"" he says. Next up, ITV's Robert Peston asks whether more areas in the north of England would be in the ""very high"" areas without the interventions so far. Boris Johnson says the government is working ""particularly"" with badly affected areas in the north of England and ""stands ready"" to work with all local areas. Chris Whitty says the data showed the need to ""do more"" with the extra restrictions. He adds, though, that it is an ""illusion"" to think that the virus can be further suppressed ""without causing harm"" in areas such as the economy. Helen CattPolitical correspondent Boris Johnsonâs reference to the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram shows the importance of local leaders in all of this. Some, like the Conservative Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, are very unhappy about the tier the government has put them into. He said he was not expecting Birmingham and some surrounding areas to see the restrictions on mixing in pubs and restaurants which have been announced. It's time for questions from journalists, and the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg asks several - including about whether financial support is enough for people facing restrictions, and whether the restrictions themselves will be enough to curb the spread of the virus. Prof Whitty says he is ""not confident"" that tier three proposals for the ""very high"" alert areas with the highest rates of transmission ""would be enough to get on top of"" the virus in those areas. That is why there's ""a lot of flexibility"" for local authorities to add more restrictions on top of the ""base"" of tier three rules, he says. He adds that it's widely agreed by experts that ""the base will not be sufficient"" to tackle the worst rates of infection. The PM adds that he believes the R number will come down under the new three-tiered system, ""if properly implemented and enforced"". He adds that a return to a national lockdown would be ""extreme"" and would do ""a lot of immediate harm"" such as to children who would miss out on school. As for those calling for no restrictions at all, Johnson says: ""I can't support that approach I'm afraid Laura. We have to do a balanced approach."" In a separate question from Kuenssberg, Sunak says his Job Support Scheme, covering two-thirds of wages is ""very much in line with our peers"" - citing Germany's scheme as an example. A member of the public asks what restrictions are likely to be in place over Christmas. Boris Johnson says he hopes the situation will be ""as close as possible"" to normal. But he adds this will depend on the level of success in tackling the virus, and following the guidance will be required to see ""anything like"" a normal festive period. Helen from Derby is the first member of the public to ask a question. What support is there for industries such as the events sector, that have been shut down since March, she says? Sunak says a business rates reduction programme has helped those people, as well as cash grants, so far. But he accepts there are some sectors that cannot trade at all. ""The Job Support Scheme allows companies that are open but not trading... to bring employees back. That wage subsidy will help,"" he says. As for nightclubs or other venues that have been told to close, Sunak says they will benefit from the ""JSS"" - which expands beyond the furlough scheme, he says. ""We are all keen to try and find away to get our economy going and get your businesses back to life,"" he tells Helen. Continuing, Chris Whitty says there are ""very variable"" rates of infection in different age groups. He says the ""first rapid rise"" is among younger people, but with the same pattern ""seen at a much lower rate"" among older age groups. Hospital admissions are rising in each age group, but ""in particular"" among the older age groups, people over 65, 70 and 85. He says a rise in cases will lead ""inexorably"" to more hospitalisations. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Belarus police break up protest with water cannonPolice are accused of using brutal tactics at another Sunday rally against President Lukashenko.,"Protests have convulsed Belarus every weekend since the disputed presidential election in August Belarusian riot police have used water cannon and stun grenades to break up the latest mass protests against President Alexander Lukashenko. Protests have swept the eastern European country since Mr Lukashenko claimed victory in an August election widely viewed as rigged. Dozens of protesters were detained during the latest rallies on Sunday. In the capital Minsk, police blasted protesters with coloured water to mark them out for arrest. Critics of Mr Lukashenko said Sunday saw police use some of the most brutal tactics against protesters since the immediate aftermath of August's disputed presidential election. Many opposition activists have been beaten up by police and thousands have been arrested during months of unrest. They are demanding the release of all political prisoners and a free and fair re-run of the election. Europe's longest-serving ruler under fire What's happening in Belarus? EU rejects Belarus leader's inauguration The EU, the UK and the US have refused to recognise Mr Lukashenko's new term. Mr Lukashenko denies fixing the poll and has received support from Russia, his country's closest ally. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya emerged as the main opposition leader after standing against Mr Lukashenko in August's election, arguing she would have won had it not been rigged. Ms Tikhanovskaya was forced to go into exile in Lithuania after receiving threats following the disputed vote. She has repeatedly appealed to the international community to put pressure on Mr Lukashenko so that a democratic transition can be launched by negotiation. Opposition protesters clashed with masked riot police in Minsk at the latest rally on Sunday Opposition hopes of a peaceful resolution were raised on Saturday after Mr Lukashenko held an unexpected meeting with political opponents in the jail where they are currently detained. State media reported that the president called the meeting to discuss constitutional reform with his imprisoned opponents. In now-familiar scenes, thousands of pro-opposition protesters gathered in Minsk and other major cities for the ninth successive Sunday of demonstrations against Mr Lukashenko. Wearing coats and carrying umbrellas on a rainy afternoon, protesters called for the resignation of 66-year-old Mr Lukashenko, Belarus's leader since 1994. Footage shows the security forces, dressed in black and armed with batons, rounding up peaceful protestors congregating in Minsk city centre and taking them to waiting vehicles.Â Several thousand people were reported to have attended Sunday's march in Minsk Police used stun grenades and water cannon against demonstrators in Minsk, a spokeswoman for Belarus's interior ministry told AFP news agency. They sprayed plain and coloured water at demonstrators, covering them in what appeared to be orange dye. Some defiant protesters remained unmoved, using their umbrellas to shield themselves from the blast. Police deployed water-cannon trucks in Minsk, spraying protesters with brightly coloured dye A local news website described police using tear gas on crowds and said police were herding people into courtyards.Â In videos posted online, police can be seen beating protesters with batons and snatching their white-and-red flags - a symbol of nationalist opposition to Mr Lukashenko. Some protesters fought back and pelted police with bottles and other objects. This video can not be played Mass arrests as crowds chant 'go away' to Belarus president The Viasna rights group, which monitors detentions at political protests, said at least 140 people had been detained in Minsk and other cities. Journalists covering the demonstrations were among those detained, including those from Russia's Tass agency and the state Belarusian news agency BELTA. Jonah Fisher, BBC Ukraine correspondent Sunday's demonstrations in Belarus's capital Minsk now follow a familiar course. Tens of thousands of people march through the streets demanding President Lukashenko step down. Then, he responds by sending his security forces to arrest as many of them as possible. What makes this weekend different, however, is that on Saturday President Lukashenko held a long meeting with a group of political prisoners in jail. It's the first indication - after more than two months of protests - that he just might be willing to negotiate with the opposition. The president's press office said participants had agreed to keep the four-and-a-half-hour conversation ""secret"". However, a photo posted by the press service shows Mr Lukashenko sitting at a table with 11 political figures, all of whom look pale and unsmiling. Among them is Viktor Babaryko, a banker who was initially seen as Mr Lukashenko's strongest rival in the election, but was barred from running and jailed in July. Liliya Vlasova, a lawyer and member of the opposition's Coordination Council, is also in the photo, as is Vitali Shkliarov, a Belarusian-American strategist who worked on US Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign. A photo of the meeting was shared by Mr Lukashenko's office A short video clip shared by the press service also shows Mr Lukashenko saying to the group: ""I am trying to convince not only your supporters but the whole of society that we need to look at things more broadly."" Apparently referring to the ongoing protests, he added: ""You can't rewrite the constitution on the streets."" Opposition figures suggested meeting was a sign of Mr Lukashenko's weakness, perhaps signalling a newfound eagerness to compromise with the protest movement. But in a social media post, Ms Tikhanovskaya said ""you can't have dialogue in a prison cell"".
