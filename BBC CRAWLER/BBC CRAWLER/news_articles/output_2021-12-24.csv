Glimmer of Christmas hope on Omicron - Harries,"Official findings that Omicron may be less likely to result in serious illness than Delta offer a ""glimmer of Christmas hope"", the head of the UK Health Security Agency has said. But Jenny Harries told the BBC it was too early to retract her statement that the variant was the most serious threat the UK had faced during the pandemic. The UKHSA's findings are ""preliminary"", she said, and data around Omicron's impact on the elderly is still needed. UK Covid cases have reached a new high. Arecord of 122,186 new infections were reported,externalon Friday - while the Office for National Statistics estimates 1.74 million people in the UK had coronavirus on 19 December, up by more than 368,000 on the figure three days earlier. This equates to 2.7% of the population or one in 35 people. In London, that figure is one in 20. Meanwhile, the latest figures show 1,171 people with Covid or suspected Covid were admitted to hospital on Monday - the highest number since 19 February. Responding toUKHSA analysisthat those cases with Omicron - now the UK's dominant strain - are less likely to need hospital care, Dr Harries told Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is a glimmer of Christmas hope... but it definitely isn't yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat. ""What we have got now is a really fine balance between something that looks like a lower risk of hospitalisation - which is great news - but equally a highly transmissible variant and one that we know evades some of our immune defences, so it is a very balanced position."" Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means How many people can get together at Christmas? Covid boosters paused over Christmas in Wales The UKHSA estimates that someone with Omicron is between 31% and 45% less likely to attend A&E and 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted to hospital than an individual with the Delta variant. However, Dr Harries warned there was much that is still unknown about Omicron. ""We don't yet know what the average length of stay for an individual is in a hospital,"" she said. ""We're not seeing very significant rises in intensive care utilisation or in the use of ventilation beds. Now that may be because a lot of the people who've been infected to date are actually younger people and we will see that coming through."" But if the severity of the disease is actually ""significantly lower than Delta"" then some of the impact on the NHS may be less severe, she added. Office for National Statistics chief Sir Ian Diamond said there were ""indications"" the Omicron variant was encouraging people to adopt ""safer"" behaviour but it was ""far too early to suggest that we will see anything other than a continued rise"" in cases. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme all areas of the UK, except for south-west England, were seeing increases - although in Scotland infections had ""gone up just a little bit"". This variant is very contagious - it spreads faster than others and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated Vaccines and boosters are still essential - they do a great job at protecting against severe disease that could put you in hospital It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Even if Omicron is milder, because it is more contagious a large number of people will catch it and some will still become very ill, which puts pressure on the NHS Read more The UKHSA analysis, along with the data gathered around Omicron on a daily basis, will influence the UK government's decision regarding whether or not further restrictions are needed in England. At present, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stuck to his Plan B measures - face masks, Covid passes and working from home guidance - and saysno new measures will be announced before Christmas. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland haveall announced further measures to come in from Sunday. Asked whether ministers had enough data to make a call on new measures, Dr Harries said the government would consider more than just hospital admissions and cases. ""For example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick,"" she said. ""That's having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates."" She added that ministers were being kept updated on a daily basis and that would continue throughout the Christmas period. ""I don't think we do know yet that this is going to be a significantly less serious disease for the population - the older population - that we are normally most concerned about in relation to serious disease and death."" Dr Harries' comments come amid the ongoing push for UK government to offer every adult a booster vaccine dose by the end of the month. People in England will be able to get a jab on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as part of efforts to target the Omicron variant, the NHS has said. Vaccinations will also take place on Christmas Eve, with about 200,000 first, second or booster appointments still bookable over the festive period. It has been a record-breaking week for booster and third jabs in the UK, with more than 968,665 administered on Wednesday, the highest number to date. Prof Clare Bryant - a professor of immunology at the University of Cambridge - told the Today programme that additional booster shots in the form of a fourth dose would be needed at some point, but exactly when was not yet clear. ""We are looking at fourth shots,"" she said. ""I suspect it's a question of when those will need to be introduced because of course a waning in immunity means that you may catch the virus a little bit more easily - but don't forget you're still very well protected against severe disease and that's absolutely critical."" In Austria, the government's National Vaccination Board has already recommended that fourth jabs be given to people working in ""high-risk areas"", such as healthcare, six months after the third dose. Officials will also be working to fix supply chain delays with home tests over the festive period. The UKHSA said it was sending a record number of rapid lateral flow tests to people's homes every day but acknowledged there was an issue with deliveries to some pharmacies. Ministers have also been encouraging people to use the tests before they socialise or go to work, with the prime minister on Tuesday saying tests should be taken before they visit elderly or vulnerable relatives at Christmas. The UKHSA said pharmacies were continuing to receive lateral flow tests and any delays in deliveries were a ""supply chain issue and not a stock issue"".

LadBaby score historic fourth Christmas number one,"Roxanne and Mark Hoyle, aka LadBaby, with their four Official Charts Company number one trophies YouTube stars and charity campaigners LadBaby have claimed the UK's Christmas number one single for a record-breaking fourth year in a row. Sausage Rolls For Everyone, the duo's collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Sir Elton John, hit the top spot on Friday. LadBaby have now surpassed the Beatles and the Spice Girls as the act with the most consecutive Christmas number ones. Mark and Roxanne Hoyle's annual sausage roll-themed singles raise funds for the Trussell Trust food bank charity. ""It means so much to us, and thank you so much for all the support, positivity and love that has been given to us over the last few weeksâ¦ Over the last four years!"" they said.

The Nottinghamshire couple first topped the chart in 2018 with We Built This City, a cover of Starship's 1985 hit; followed by I Love Sausage Rolls, their take on The Arrows / Joan Jett's I Love Rock 'n' Roll; and last year by Don't Stop Me Eatin', a cheeky version of Journey's beloved power ballad. This year's effort was also a cover - but of a slightly different nature. The couple hooked up with Sheeran and Sir Elton to rework their new Christmas tune, Merry Christmas, which was only released three weeks ago. The pop superstars even appeared in the video, while Sheeran teamed up with the Hoyles to help distribute meal parcels at the Waveney Foodbank in Suffolk earlier this week. This video can not be played LadBaby and Ed Sheeran helped out at a food bank earlier this week With that combination of smart PR and public goodwill, the LadBaby song has duly replaced Sheeran and Sir Elton's original at number one just in time for Christmas. In the process, they have become the first act to score four Christmas number ones in a row, and have tied with the Beatles as the act with the most Christmas number ones overall. The Fab Four topped the festive chart between 1963-65 and again in 1967, while the Spice Girls achieved three in a row between 1996-98. Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, said: ""To have matched The Beatles and Spice Girls [with three in a row] was a fantastic feat last year, but to top them both, while raising money and awareness for food bank providers The Trussell Trust, is remarkable."" Guinness World Records congratulated LadBaby on the record for the most consecutive Christmas number ones, andshared a picture of the certificate on Twitter.,external The song has also given Sheeran his second Christmas number one after the BeyoncÃ© duet Perfect, which was the last festive chart-topper before LadBaby started their reign four years ago. And Sir Elton has earned his first Christmas number one. Surprisingly, he was not part of the Band Aid single Do They Know It's Christmas? in 1984. Sheeran and Sir Elton's Merry Christmas fell one place to number two in the Christmas countdown, marking only the second time in chart history that a cover version has replaced the original at number one. The last time it happened was in 2004, when Eamon's I Don't Want You Back was supplanted by Frankee's answer song FURB. Merry Christmas is followed by Wham's Last Christmas at three and Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You at four. An expletive-laden protest song against Boris Johnson has also made the top five. The highest-charting non-Christmas/charity song is ABCDEFU by 17-year-old TikTokker Gayle Davis in sixth place - suggesting it will have a clear path to number one next week, after people stop streaming their festive favourites. The Pogues' Fairytale Of New York and Shakin' Stevens Merry Christmas Everyone were among the other classics in this week's top 10. In the albums chart, Adele's 30 remains at the top for a fifth consecutive week. She is now tied with US pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo for the longest-running number one of the year.

Shoppers avoid city centres on Christmas Eve,"The number of Christmas Eve shoppers in city centre High Streets is down on last Friday, as more people chose to stay local or visit retail parks. Early data from Springboard showed central London shopper numbers fell 30.3% as the capital's high Omicron cases deterred visitors. City centres outside London saw a 10% fall in visits from last Friday. But overall footfall increased by nearly 14%, with a strong showing in market towns and retail parks. That figure was still 21% lower than on Christmas Eve 2019, before the pandemic started. The closely-watched Springboard data, which covers up to noon and will be updated later, suggests city centre retailers' hopes of a late shopping surge on the day before Christmas will be dashed. ""The increased activity in retail parks today will in part be due to trips for food and grocery products as the majority of retail parks have a food store,"" Springboard said, as it revealed retail park footfall was up by 23.6% compared to last week. ""However, since the start of Covid, retail parks has consistently been more resilient in retaining shoppers as they are large open spaces, with large stores which make shoppers feel safer and less nervous."" At shopping centres, footfall rose by 19.6%, Springboard said. Market towns saw a 14.3% rise and coastal towns a 26.3% increase. Although there are fewer Covid restrictions in place than last year, and footfall in central London is so far 42% higher than a year earlier, Springboard said it seemed that many shoppers were clearly staying at home to avoid the outbreak. ""This has been the trend over the last few weeks, with shoppers self-censoring and staying local rather than making trips to larger destinations where they feel at more risk of catching Covid,"" Springboard said. The company said that city centres have seen a slow fall in shopper numbers since Britain first expressed concern about the new variant on 25 November.

Ambulance crew changes spark union safety fears,"Unions have branded plans to change working patterns for Scottish Ambulance Service workers a ""safety concern"". A new contingency plan would see more ambulances staffed by only one trained medic and a driver, while workers' breaks would also be cut. The Scottish Ambulance Service said the changes would only happen in the event of ""extreme pressures and potential staff absence in the coming weeks"". But unions said the proposals should be a concern for staff and the public. Under the plansfirst reported by The Courier,external, some ambulances would be operated by a single clinician and a driver, including military drivers. Some ambulances would also be staffed by trainee ambulance workers paired with a military driver, meaning they would not be able to respond to the most serious cases or drive to hospitals under ""blue light"" conditions. 'Lives being lost' due to Scottish ambulance waiting times What is being done to ease the ambulance 'crisis'? Soldiers arrive in Scotland to drive ambulances Staff would also be asked to take one rest break rather than two if demand on the service was extremely high, according to a memo issued by the Scottish Ambulance Service. Kieran Whitford, a paramedic working in Aberdeen, wrote on Twitter that he was ""broken"" and said the changes meant staff had been ""made to feel like we are worth nothing"". Allow Twitter content?

GMB Scotland organiser Karen Leonard said: ""Management's proposals will do more harm than good and GMB members will not support them. ""They will split and exacerbate already insufficient levels of skilled staff and unsustainable working time demands, and frankly pose serious questions for the health and safety of both staff and patients. ""After working in a state of fear for nearly two years, staff are angry and exhausted and it's time ministers and management worked with them rather than against them."" The Army has been deployed to support the ambulance service across Scotland since September The proposed working pattern changes come as an extra 90 military personnel are being drafted in to support under-pressure health boards. The personnel will help NHS Ayrshire and Arran, NHS Grampian and NHS Lanarkshire from January. They will join 221 members of the armed forces who have been supporting the vaccine programme across Scotland. A further 96 military personnel are driving ambulances in support of the Scottish Ambulance Service. A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: ""As this staff bulletin makes clear, robust plans must be in place to protect essential services to the public if we experience extreme pressures and potential staff absence in the coming weeks, due to the threat posed by the Omicron variant. ""The additional measures are for these times of extremis only and we've been engaging closely with trade unions in considering these options. Hopefully these measures will not be needed."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The ambulance service has been clear that staff will only be asked to work differently when circumstances are considered extreme, due to staff absence or a significant increase in demand. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has been the biggest shock the NHS has suffered in its 73-year existence and has heaped pressure on our ambulance service and wider NHS.""

The cook spending Christmas on Boaty McBoatface,"Steve Carpenter will spend his Christmas cooking aboard the A Welsh chef will enjoy the ultimate white Christmas - on Boaty McBoatface's maiden voyage to Antarctica. Steve Carpenter, 49, from Caerphilly, is a cook steward on the exploration ship,officially named RRS Sir David Attenborough. He will serve Christmas dinner in the winter wonderland setting, but penguins, seals and polar bears are staying off the menu. Steve said it would be ""traditional"" and served on Christmas Eve. The Â£200m ship, part of the UK government's polar infrastructure investment programme, is due to return in May or June. An online pollhad suggested the ship be named Boaty McBoatface- but one of its robotic submarines has been given this moniker instead. The RRS Sir David Attenborough is on its maiden voyage to Antarctica Making sure everyone gets a proper Christmas dinner is a big priority for the galley crew, as they celebrate the festive period on the other side of the world. Being 8,500 miles from home has meant most of the dinner has been prepared in advance. 'Boaty McBoatface' ship named after Sir David Attenborough Christmas dinner: What's your family's twist on turkey and trimmings? ""We've got 10kg of Christmas pud for the crew to consume, 5kg of Christmas cake baked by our baker on board and iced and decorated and through the Christmas period we'll go through 500 mince pies,"" said Steve. He added that because of the lack of availability of fresh fruit and vegetables on the voyage, they will use frozen sprouts - cooking about 300 for the meal, along with 20kg of roast potatoes and 34kg of stuffing for the 49 people on board. ""It's another working day for us in the galley, but hopefully we'll be able to sit down at the end of the meal and enjoy it with everyone,"" he said. The ship isn't named ""Boaty McBoatface"", but some of its robotic subs do carry the moniker The RRS Sir David Attenborough is travelling from Rothera research station on Adelaide Island to Signey Island, where they are due to arrive on Christmas Day and where more scientists will disembark. Working at sea for the past 25 years, Steve's had his fair share of far-flung Decembers, several times enjoying a curry Christmas dinner in the Middle East, during his time in the Royal Auxiliary Fleet. Unlike if he stayed at home, Steve is guaranteed to see snow this Christmas But this year, he will have a guaranteed white Christmas in a place he says, ""doesn't compare to anywhere else"". ""This is my first trip down south. It's such an amazing opportunity to get down here. It's an absolutely mind-blowing place."" Minister for the polar regions, Amanda Milling, said: ""This magnificent ship is something everyone across the United Kingdom can take immense pride in.

Caller pranks Biden at White House Christmas event,"A caller has pranked US President Joe Biden by dropping an anti-Biden taunt into their chat during a White House Christmas event. Mr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden were hosting the festive call for families when a father told the president: ""Let's go, Brandon."" Apparently unaware of the gibe, Mr Biden said he agreed. The term, which has become a rallying cry for many conservatives, is code for a profane insult directed at Mr Biden. The first couple were speaking virtually with children for a White House custom, tracking the journey of Santa's sleigh via the North American Aerospace Defence Command. During Friday's event in the South Court Auditorium of the executive mansion, the Bidens spoke with a family from Oregon: Griffin, 11, Hunter, three, Piper, four, Penelope, two, and their father, Jared. ""I assume you're dad,"" the Democratic president said. ""Hi. Yes sir,"" replied Jared. ""OK, Dad, what do you want for Christmas?"" asked Mr Biden. ""Maybe a quiet night,"" he replied laughing. It all began at the end of a televised Nascar stock car race in Talladega, Alabama, on 2 October. NBC reporter Kelli Stavast was interviewing the winner, driver Brandon Brown, when members of the crowd in the grandstand behind them began chanting an obscenity directed at the president. It was clearly picked up on the broadcast's audio. Whether by mistake or as an attempt to deflect from the swearing on live television, Ms Stavast told Mr Brown the crowd was cheering him on with chants of ""Let's go, Brandon."" A meme was born. How 'Let's go Brandon' became an anti-Biden jeer The president said: ""You know, Dad, we have a Hunter, too. We have a son named Hunter and a grandson named Hunter."" ""I didn't know you had a grandson named Hunter, that's cool,"" said Jared. The president asked how old was Griffin. ""I'm 11,"" Griffin said. He said he wanted a piano. Jared interjected: ""I was going to say he has to cut some trees down to get a piano!"" Hunter wanted a Nintendo Switch, Piper wanted a Barbie. The chuckling president reminded the children to be in bed by nine o'clock otherwise Santa might not show up. The first lady said: ""Have a merry Christmas, have a wonderful Christmas."" Mr Biden told Jared: ""I hope you have a wonderful Christmas."" The father replied: ""Yeah, I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas as well. Merry Christmas and let's go, Brandon."" The president replied: ""Let's go, Brandon. I agree."" There was silence. Mr Biden added: ""Hey, by the way, are you in Oregon? Where's your home? I think we lost him."" According to a recent Gallup poll, only 5% of voters who identify as Republican currently approve of the president's performance. That same poll shows Mr Biden's overall approval rating has dipped to 43%.

'Christmas kindness means we can stay in the house',"Nine-year-old Dayjanta wanted to help his mum, Christine, with the household bills All week, Dayjanta Samuels has been ""wild and excited"", says his mother Christine Borton, ""counting down the days to Christmas"". The family have been overwhelmed by the reaction of the public to the story of theirfinancial struggles, with dozens and dozens of people contacting them to offer money, gifts and advice. ""This last week has been happy because people have said I'm a sweet boy and a good child,"" says  Dayjanta, whose worries about the family bills and his wish to help pay for them struck a chord with many others. ""I feel better because they made me forget about everything bad that's been happening,"" says the nine-year-old with a broad grin, ""and they made me think about fun stuff"". He feels less worried, he says, with the donations meaning, ""We can get to stay in the house"". Christine agrees, but realises it will take a while for her son to overcome his concerns about the household bills. ""A lady gave me a voucher to buy him some sneakers and he was like, 'I can keep some of it for the bills'. I just want him to be less worried about stuff that isn't to do with him."" We first met the family last month at their home in Tipton in the west Midlands, when looking at the impact on low-income households of what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis. The Sandwell area in which they live has employment levels similar to the British average, but lower levels of pay, mainly due to the type of work people do. Since then, inflation has risen further, to 5.1%, its highest rate in a decade. Since we first met, Christine has lost her job as a full-time carer for a man with learning disabilities. She says her employer told her they didn't have enough clients. But she describes the last week as ""absolutely wonderful"". ""I've been crying and praying, thanking God,"" says the 47-year-old, who also lives with her 18-year-old daughter Shashouna. ""Never in my life have people reached out to me like this."" She pulls out one letter and starts reading it through tears:  ""You've got no money but you have two beautiful children that absolutely love you, and one day will understand all you have done for them. So in truth you are a rich lady."" ""When you receive words like those,"" says Christine, ""it gives you motivation, to say, 'I can do this'. It's very powerful. Those letters and postcards, I will keep them."" Delivery drivers have been regular and welcome visitors to the family home over the past few days. Dayjanta, an avid footballer, has been most excited about the Arsenal pyjamas and duvet cover he's been sent. Some other presents sit wrapped under a small Christmas tree that was also gifted. ""This Christmas is going to be way, way different,"" says Christine. ""I appreciate this so much. I don't know how to say thank you properly. I genuinely appreciate these people - the messages, the phone calls, the good encouraging words. It's made me a strong person."" Some of the people who have been in touch said the family could shop around to reduce their broadband and mobile phone costs, while others said Christine should seek advice to ensure she's claiming all the benefits she's entitled to. Christine's first task for 2022, she says, is to find a new job. The kindness of strangers has the family already looking forward to the new year with renewed optimism. ""I'm hoping that I don't have to go back to struggling to make ends meet. I hope my future, my children's future, is better for the rest of my life.""

Dozens killed in Bangladesh ferry blaze,"Rescue teams at the scene after a passenger ferry caught fire near the southern town of Jhalakathi, Bangladesh At least 39 people were killed and about 100 others injured after a packed ferry caught fire in southern Bangladesh, local officials say. The blaze on the three-decked vessel started mid-river near the town of Jhalakathi as it sailed from the capital Dhaka to the town of Barguna. Some of the victims drowned after jumping into the water. The number of casualties in Friday's disaster is likely to increase as many of the passengers have severe burns. As many as 500 people were reportedly on board the vessel, the MV Avijan-10. The fire is believed to have started in the engine room and quickly spread as the ferry travelled along the Sugandha river at around 03:00 local time (21:00 GMT Thursday), fire services official Kamal Hossain Bhuiyan told local media. The blaze reportedly continued for hours. The ship's owner, Hum Jalala Sheikh, has denied it was caused by a mechanical fault.He told local news outlet UNB,externalthere had been an explosion on the ferry's second floor, and the subsequent fire had spread to the engine room. One passenger who survived, an elderly grandmother, told AFP news agency most people had been sleeping when the fire broke out. ""We were sleeping on a mat on the ground floor deck,"" she said. ""My nine-year-old grandson, Nayeem, was with me, he jumped into the river. I don't know what happened to him."" Another woman, who was travelling with her father, sister and six-month-old nephew, said the young child had gone missing. ""When the fire broke out, I gave the baby to a man. He was trying to save the baby. But now we can't find them,"" she said. A man who was on board the ferry said the vessel appeared to have issues with its engine before the blaze and later became filled with smoke. ""The ferry's windows had curtains, and these curtains trapped the smoke,"" he said. By Akbar Hossain, BBC News, Dhaka It is common to see ferries capsize in Bangladesh. Passengers are loaded on to poorly maintained boats, with poorly trained crews, often way above the vessel's rated capacity. Hundreds have drowned in the country's rivers in the past 10 years. But the fire that engulfed this ferry adds a new layer of horror to the story. The fire is thought to have started in the engine room, spreading rapidly, and sprinklers or other safety measures may have had little effect. This and other tragedies stem from a failure of enforcement. Operators are rarely punished and so defective ferries continue to carry hundreds of passengers every day. Nearly 30% of Bangladesh's 170 million people commute through river routes. But they are mostly poor Bangladeshis, and the government has not made it a priority to tackle lax safety standards. Ferry disasters are so common that there is little international outcry to pressure them, and it is widely believed that the ferry owners are politically powerful. The result is hundreds of poorer Bangladeshis risking their lives just to make it to work. A special committee has been set up to investigate the incident, according to reports. Barguna is about 250km (155 miles) south of Dhaka. Ferry accidents are not uncommon in Bangladesh, with incidents blamed on overcrowding, and poor maintenance and safety standards in the country's many shipyards. Vessels often sink in bad weather. In June 2020, dozens of people were killed when a boat carrying about 50 people capsized near Dhaka. Were you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

Strike action affects Christmas Eve train journeys,"CrossCountry said trains would not run between a number of locations in England and Scotland Passengers are struggling with festive travel arrangements as industrial action has seen rail routes reduced. Train operator CrossCountry said many services have been cancelled on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve due to disruption from strikes. Trade union RMT saidmembers voted for actionas they felt the firm was trying to undermine the role of train guards. One passenger said she had been left ""cold, stranded and scrambling to find my way to see my family for Christmas"". RMT members are taking part in strike action on Christmas Eve CrossCountry warned passengers many of its routes would be affected on Christmas Eve, with no trains running on the following services: Aberdeen and Edinburgh Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Derby and Nottingham Leicester and Stansted Airport (a bus replacement runs between Leicester and Peterborough) Cheltenham Spa and Cardiff Central Newton Abbot and Paignton Plymouth and Penzance Reduced services are running between Edinburgh and Plymouth, Manchester Piccadilly and Bournemouth, and Birmingham New Street and Leicester.

Selfridges sold for Â£4bn to Thai-Austrian alliance,"British luxury department store chain Selfridges is being sold to a Thai retailer and an Austrian property firm. The deal for the majority of Selfridges Group is worth around Â£4bn ($5.4bn), the BBC understands. Founded in 1908 by US retail magnate Harry Gordon Selfridge, the company is best known for its flagship department store on London's Oxford Street. The Canadian wing of the billionaire Weston family bought Selfridges for nearly Â£600m in 2003. ""It is a privilege to be acquiring Selfridges Group, including the flagship Oxford Street store, which has been at the centre of London's most famous shopping street for over 100 years,"" Central Group's chief executive Tos Chirathivat said in a statement. It was revealed earlier this month that Central Group was close to agreeing a deal to take over Selfridges. Selfridges set for Â£4bn sale to Thai retail giant Ikea buys landmark Topshop building in London Selfridges Group employs around 10,000 people and owns 25 stores worldwide, including in major cities in England, Ireland, the Netherlands and Canada. Signa and Central will take over 18 of the 25 stores. Selfridges Group's seven Holt Renfrew department stores in Canada were not part of the deal and will remain in the ownership of the Weston family. Selfridges' new owners said they plan to build on the existing brand to develop luxury online stores as well as improving its physical sites. ""Together we will work with the world's leading architects to sensitively reimagine the stores in each location, transforming these iconic destinations into sustainable, energy-efficient, modern spaces, whilst staying true to their architectural and cultural heritage,"" Signa's chairman Dieter Berninghaus said. Selfridges is known for its bright yellow cardboard bags and its flagship store on London's Oxford Street is a magnet for shoppers and tourists alike. Home to luxury brands, a visit is just as much about the experience and beautiful displays as what it is selling. It even inspired a TV series about the American founder Harry Selfridge, who decided to build the ""biggest and finest"" department store in the world in 1908. Now that ""big, fine brand"" and its buildings have brought its owners, the Weston family, a Â£4bn Christmas present. Chief Executive of rival Fenwick, John Edgar, a former chief financial officer at the Selfridges Group, described it as a ""great price for a fantastic business"" Analysts say that despite the well-publicised woes of retail through the pandemic, this sale shows that the Selfridges brand is unique. And it also underlines just how popular UK property still remains with international investors. The Weston family - which also owns Fortnum & Mason and has majority control of Primark owner ABF - launched the sales process in June, a few months after the death of W Galen Weston, who oversaw the move to take the department store. Alannah Weston, chair of Selfridges Group and daughter of Galen Weston, said the move is testament to her ""father's vision for an iconic group of beautiful, truly experiential, department stores"". ""Creative thinking has been at the heart of everything we did together for nearly twenty years and sustainability is deeply embedded in the business,"" she added. Central, which is owned by the billionaire Chirathivat family, is involved in wide range of businesses including real estate, retail, hospitality and restaurants. The Bangkok-based firm opened its first department store in 1956 and has grown to become Thailand's biggest owner of shopping malls. It also has an e-commerce joint venture with China's JD.com and a stake in south east Asian ride-hailing and delivery giant Grab. Selfridges' Oxford Street store once had 100 departments, including a library and shooting range. Vienna-based Signa Group was founded by entrepreneur RenÃ© Benko in 2000 and has become Austria's largest privately owned real estate company. The two firms already jointly own major department stores across Europe. The Central-Signa 50/50 bid reportedly beat rival offers from the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns Harrods, and Lane Crawford, a Hong Kong-based department store chain. Before the impact of the pandemic, Selfridges had doubled its profits and reported sales growth of more than 80% since being taken over by the Westons. The family has received more than Â£580m in dividends from the business over the past decade, but also injected investment into improving the store's experience, with new concepts including an indoor skate park at its London store.

Cities start to attract property buyers again,"Prospective property buyers have returned to cities, with flats the most highly in demand during the autumn, according to property portal Rightmove. The UK housing market was relatively immune to the economic effects of Covid, with demand and price rises remaining high throughout the crisis. This was driven by the race for space, with buyers attracted by larger, coastal or rural properties. But as workers returned to offices, interest in apartments revived. However, this is not a return to the pre-pandemic property market. Rightmove says there has been a long-term shift with buyers willing to pay more for space and privacy. That means the gap in asking prices between detached and semi-detached homes has been stretched. In October, the typical asking price for a detached house was 76% higher than a semi-detached, compared with 70% in March 2020. Prospective buyers have also widened their searches by an average of 50 sq km, perhaps willing to move slightly further away from transport links and High Streets as they spend more time working and entertaining themselves at home. ""The pandemic redefined the role of the home and placed new emphasis on its importance, and people looked for more room in order to work, exercise, and often teach under one roof,"" said Tim Bannister, who works in property data at Rightmove. ""While we know from our data that people really care about people and their local community, the pandemic also made us more conscious of our personal space."" This area on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales saw a surge in prices There was a surge in buyers in 2020, as people reassessed where and how they wanted to live. Government support through stamp duty holidays, as well as historically low mortgage rates, also encouraged many people to move, or bring forward future plans to relocate. The biggest demand, and subsequent rise in prices, were for houses in outer city or countryside locations. There were concerns in some areas that locals were being priced out of the market as a result. The epicentre of Britain's house price boom Young and low paid 'priced out' of tourist areas At the same time, many flat owners were struggling to sell as a result ofthe cladding crisis, following the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower. City centres had become less attractive places to live for those who were not going into an office, or - during the height of the pandemic - were unable to socialise or enjoy the entertainment attractions of urban centres. This multi-million pound London apartment was one of the most-viewed online As workplaces and venues reopened - before the onset of the Omicron variant - there was a shift in buyer preferences, according to Rightmove. The slowest rise in prices over the last year was for flats, and demand was much lower than for houses, especially those with gardens. By the autumn, flats had moved to the top of the list among prospective buyers to become the most in-demand type of property. Mr Bannister said demand to live in London and other major cities had been restored faster than anticipated, as employers encouraged people to return to their desks, at least through a hybrid working model. The market may still be affected by the pandemic and its impact on jobs and the wider economy. The analysis is also based on averages, but local housing markets, demand and property prices can be affected by a host of factors ranging from the success of local schools to roads and new development.

NHS 24 warns of call delays over high demand,"Self-isolation due to Covid-19 has left NHS 24 centres missing ""key staff"" NHS 24 is urging people to treat common illness at home as it faces its busiest period over the festive season. Helpline bosses have warned that it will take longer to answer calls as the service faces staffing pressures and increased demand caused by Covid. It expects 170,000 calls over Christmas and New year - including two four-day weekends with GP surgeries closed. The public have been advised to use theNHS Inform website,externalto check symptoms before phoning NHS 24. Janice Houston, NHS 24 associate director of operations and nursing, said the spread of Omicron had left the service ""missing key staff"" with people required to self-isolate. Scotland 'too cautious' on self-isolation Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains ""This year is exceptional and particularly busy,"" she said. ""We plan within an inch of our life for our busiest period, so I would just ask the public to be patient with us. ""We need to re-plan depending on who can't come to work from self-isolating. It might take a bit longer to answer the phone, but you will always get good care."" Janice Houston urged people to check symptoms on NHS Inform before phoning NHS 24 Around 25% of recent calls to the helpline were Omicron-related, Ms Houston added. She said people were ""still very worried"" about the pandemic and these calls were often about providing reassurance. ""If people need to phone us, of course they should, she added. ""But look at NHS Inform and stock up on over-the-counter medication. ""We're asking the public to prepare the way NHS does - have a plan, go to the website first and self-care yourself."" NHS 24 has been under increased demand since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the first month of lockdown in 2020the number of 111 phonecalls jumped by 30%. The service took on additional staff and nurses, doctors and dentists were redeployed from other parts of the NHS to assist. Hundreds of people will be working in NHS 24 call centres over the Christmas period. Of the 170,000 calls predicted - 95,000 are expected to come over the Christmas and New Year weekends. NHS 24 medical director Dr Laura Ryan said: ""At a time when many people will be taking a break, our teams will be gearing up for an exceptionally busy period. ""The past 18 months during the pandemic, our people have worked exceptionally hard ""Every available seat in our centres will be occupied over the busiest days. It will take longer to answer calls, but we can assure people that if they need our help, our people will be working flat out. ""Even if it takes longer, we will always answer calls.""

'Christmas kindness has made me a strong person',"Nine-year-old Dayjanta wanted to help his mum, Christine, with the household bills All week, Dayjanta Samuels has been ""wild and excited"", says his mother Christine Borton, ""counting down the days to Christmas"". The family have been overwhelmed by the reaction of the public to the story of theirfinancial struggles, with dozens and dozens of people contacting them to offer money, gifts and advice. ""This last week has been happy because people have said I'm a sweet boy and a good child,"" says  Dayjanta, whose worries about the family bills and his wish to help pay for them struck a chord with many others. ""I feel better because they made me forget about everything bad that's been happening,"" says the nine-year-old with a broad grin, ""and they made me think about fun stuff"". He feels less worried, he says, with the donations meaning, ""We can get to stay in the house"". Christine agrees, but realises it will take a while for her son to overcome his concerns about the household bills. ""A lady gave me a voucher to buy him some sneakers and he was like, 'I can keep some of it for the bills'. I just want him to be less worried about stuff that isn't to do with him."" We first met the family last month at their home in Tipton in the west Midlands, when looking at the impact on low-income households of what has become known as the cost-of-living crisis. The Sandwell area in which they live has employment levels similar to the British average, but lower levels of pay, mainly due to the type of work people do. Since then, inflation has risen further, to 5.1%, its highest rate in a decade. Since we first met, Christine has lost her job as a full-time carer for a man with learning disabilities. She says her employer told her they didn't have enough clients. But she describes the last week as ""absolutely wonderful"". ""I've been crying and praying, thanking God,"" says the 47-year-old, who also lives with her 18-year-old daughter Shashouna. ""Never in my life have people reached out to me like this."" She pulls out one letter and starts reading it through tears:  ""You've got no money but you have two beautiful children that absolutely love you, and one day will understand all you have done for them. So in truth you are a rich lady."" ""When you receive words like those,"" says Christine, ""it gives you motivation, to say, 'I can do this'. It's very powerful. Those letters and postcards, I will keep them."" Delivery drivers have been regular and welcome visitors to the family home over the past few days. Dayjanta, an avid footballer, has been most excited about the Arsenal pyjamas and duvet cover he's been sent. Some other presents sit wrapped under a small Christmas tree that was also gifted. ""This Christmas is going to be way, way different,"" says Christine. ""I appreciate this so much. I don't know how to say thank you properly. I genuinely appreciate these people - the messages, the phone calls, the good encouraging words. It's made me a strong person."" Some of the people who have been in touch said the family could shop around to reduce their broadband and mobile phone costs, while others said Christine should seek advice to ensure she's claiming all the benefits she's entitled to. Christine's first task for 2022, she says, is to find a new job. The kindness of strangers has the family already looking forward to the new year with renewed optimism. ""I'm hoping that I don't have to go back to struggling to make ends meet. I hope my future, my children's future, is better for the rest of my life.""

Booster rollout to continue on Christmas Day,"Official findings that Omicron may be less likely to result in serious illness than Delta offer a ""glimmer of Christmas hope"", the head of the UK Health Security Agency has said. But Jenny Harries told the BBC it was too early to retract her statement that the variant was the most serious threat the UK had faced during the pandemic. The UKHSA's findings are ""preliminary"", she said, and data around Omicron's impact on the elderly is still needed. UK Covid cases have reached a new high. Arecord of 122,186 new infections were reported,externalon Friday - while the Office for National Statistics estimates 1.74 million people in the UK had coronavirus on 19 December, up by more than 368,000 on the figure three days earlier. This equates to 2.7% of the population or one in 35 people. In London, that figure is one in 20. Meanwhile, the latest figures show 1,171 people with Covid or suspected Covid were admitted to hospital on Monday - the highest number since 19 February. Responding toUKHSA analysisthat those cases with Omicron - now the UK's dominant strain - are less likely to need hospital care, Dr Harries told Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is a glimmer of Christmas hope... but it definitely isn't yet at the point where we could downgrade that serious threat. ""What we have got now is a really fine balance between something that looks like a lower risk of hospitalisation - which is great news - but equally a highly transmissible variant and one that we know evades some of our immune defences, so it is a very balanced position."" Omicron: Good news, bad news and what it all means How many people can get together at Christmas? Covid boosters paused over Christmas in Wales The UKHSA estimates that someone with Omicron is between 31% and 45% less likely to attend A&E and 50% to 70% less likely to be admitted to hospital than an individual with the Delta variant. However, Dr Harries warned there was much that is still unknown about Omicron. ""We don't yet know what the average length of stay for an individual is in a hospital,"" she said. ""We're not seeing very significant rises in intensive care utilisation or in the use of ventilation beds. Now that may be because a lot of the people who've been infected to date are actually younger people and we will see that coming through."" But if the severity of the disease is actually ""significantly lower than Delta"" then some of the impact on the NHS may be less severe, she added. Office for National Statistics chief Sir Ian Diamond said there were ""indications"" the Omicron variant was encouraging people to adopt ""safer"" behaviour but it was ""far too early to suggest that we will see anything other than a continued rise"" in cases. He told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme all areas of the UK, except for south-west England, were seeing increases - although in Scotland infections had ""gone up just a little bit"". This variant is very contagious - it spreads faster than others and can infect people even if they are fully vaccinated Vaccines and boosters are still essential - they do a great job at protecting against severe disease that could put you in hospital It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Even if Omicron is milder, because it is more contagious a large number of people will catch it and some will still become very ill, which puts pressure on the NHS Read more The UKHSA analysis, along with the data gathered around Omicron on a daily basis, will influence the UK government's decision regarding whether or not further restrictions are needed in England. At present, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has stuck to his Plan B measures - face masks, Covid passes and working from home guidance - and saysno new measures will be announced before Christmas. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland haveall announced further measures to come in from Sunday. Asked whether ministers had enough data to make a call on new measures, Dr Harries said the government would consider more than just hospital admissions and cases. ""For example, we have very high rates of individuals off sick,"" she said. ""That's having an impact on the workforce. So these are not simply about hospitalisation rates."" She added that ministers were being kept updated on a daily basis and that would continue throughout the Christmas period. ""I don't think we do know yet that this is going to be a significantly less serious disease for the population - the older population - that we are normally most concerned about in relation to serious disease and death."" Dr Harries' comments come amid the ongoing push for UK government to offer every adult a booster vaccine dose by the end of the month. People in England will be able to get a jab on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as part of efforts to target the Omicron variant, the NHS has said. Vaccinations will also take place on Christmas Eve, with about 200,000 first, second or booster appointments still bookable over the festive period. It has been a record-breaking week for booster and third jabs in the UK, with more than 968,665 administered on Wednesday, the highest number to date. Prof Clare Bryant - a professor of immunology at the University of Cambridge - told the Today programme that additional booster shots in the form of a fourth dose would be needed at some point, but exactly when was not yet clear. ""We are looking at fourth shots,"" she said. ""I suspect it's a question of when those will need to be introduced because of course a waning in immunity means that you may catch the virus a little bit more easily - but don't forget you're still very well protected against severe disease and that's absolutely critical."" In Austria, the government's National Vaccination Board has already recommended that fourth jabs be given to people working in ""high-risk areas"", such as healthcare, six months after the third dose. Officials will also be working to fix supply chain delays with home tests over the festive period. The UKHSA said it was sending a record number of rapid lateral flow tests to people's homes every day but acknowledged there was an issue with deliveries to some pharmacies. Ministers have also been encouraging people to use the tests before they socialise or go to work, with the prime minister on Tuesday saying tests should be taken before they visit elderly or vulnerable relatives at Christmas. The UKHSA said pharmacies were continuing to receive lateral flow tests and any delays in deliveries were a ""supply chain issue and not a stock issue"".

NHS 24 warns of call delays over high demandThe helpline faces Covid staffing pressures and urges people to treat common illnesses at home.Scotland,"Self-isolation due to Covid-19 has left NHS 24 centres missing ""key staff"" NHS 24 is urging people to treat common illness at home as it faces its busiest period over the festive season. Helpline bosses have warned that it will take longer to answer calls as the service faces staffing pressures and increased demand caused by Covid. It expects 170,000 calls over Christmas and New year - including two four-day weekends with GP surgeries closed. The public have been advised to use theNHS Inform website,externalto check symptoms before phoning NHS 24. Janice Houston, NHS 24 associate director of operations and nursing, said the spread of Omicron had left the service ""missing key staff"" with people required to self-isolate. Scotland 'too cautious' on self-isolation Omicron wave appears milder, but concern remains ""This year is exceptional and particularly busy,"" she said. ""We plan within an inch of our life for our busiest period, so I would just ask the public to be patient with us. ""We need to re-plan depending on who can't come to work from self-isolating. It might take a bit longer to answer the phone, but you will always get good care."" Janice Houston urged people to check symptoms on NHS Inform before phoning NHS 24 Around 25% of recent calls to the helpline were Omicron-related, Ms Houston added. She said people were ""still very worried"" about the pandemic and these calls were often about providing reassurance. ""If people need to phone us, of course they should, she added. ""But look at NHS Inform and stock up on over-the-counter medication. ""We're asking the public to prepare the way NHS does - have a plan, go to the website first and self-care yourself."" NHS 24 has been under increased demand since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the first month of lockdown in 2020the number of 111 phonecalls jumped by 30%. The service took on additional staff and nurses, doctors and dentists were redeployed from other parts of the NHS to assist. Hundreds of people will be working in NHS 24 call centres over the Christmas period. Of the 170,000 calls predicted - 95,000 are expected to come over the Christmas and New Year weekends. NHS 24 medical director Dr Laura Ryan said: ""At a time when many people will be taking a break, our teams will be gearing up for an exceptionally busy period. ""The past 18 months during the pandemic, our people have worked exceptionally hard ""Every available seat in our centres will be occupied over the busiest days. It will take longer to answer calls, but we can assure people that if they need our help, our people will be working flat out. ""Even if it takes longer, we will always answer calls.""
