Free solo climber falls to his death,"Brad Gobright fell around 300 metres to his death A world-renowned American free solo climber has died attempting to descend the side of a cliff face. Brad Gobright, 31, fell around 300m (1,000ft) to his death in El Potrero Chico in northern Mexico. His companion, fellow climber Aidan Jacobson, 26, fell a shorter distance and survived with injuries. Gobright was best known for free soloing, or climbing without any safety gear, but at the time the two were abseiling, a technique using ropes. Abseiling accidents are believed to be the most common cause of fatalities in the sport. The two men were simul-rappelling - a technique where two climbers descend opposite strands of an anchored rope, with their bodies acting as counterweights to each other - with an 80m rope, the Outside website reports. ""We started rapping,"" Mr Jacobson told the Outside website,,externalusing the North American term for abseiling. ""I was a bit above him. I was on the left. He was on the right. Then all of a sudden, I felt a pop, and we started dropping."" This video can not be played Brad Gobright and Jim Reynolds speed climbing El Capitan in 2017 While Mr Jacobson crashed through a bush, which cushioned his fall, before striking a ledge, Gobright fell to his death. ""It was basically a blur,"" Mr Jacobson added. ""He screamed. I screamed. I went through some vegetation, and then all I remember is seeing his blue Gramicci shirt bounce over the edge."" Born in California in 1988, Gobright first started climbing at the age of six. He reportedly dropped out of an Orange County community college in 2009 and worked odd jobs to fund his climbs around North America, before his talent began to attract sponsorship deals. ""I always worked for four months, climbed for eight, and started over,""he told Rock and Ice magazine for a 2017 profile,external. Tributes to Gobright, who once held the coveted speed record on the Nose of El Capitan in Yosemite, have come in from across the climbing world. Jim Reynolds, who set that speed record with Gobright, wrote on Instagram:""We will carry your spirit, dear friend."",external ""The climbing world lost a true light. Rest in peace,"" said Alex Honnold, focus of the Academy Award-winning documentary Free Solo. ""You will be dearly missed,""Free Solo director Jimmy Chin wrote on social media,external, calling Gobright ""a true climber's climber"". ""He had a magic about him on the rock, unlike anyone I've ever met,"" wrote Alice Hafer, one of Gobright's climbing partners. ""He was so supportive and encouraging, always pushing me harder and believing in me."" It is unclear exactly what happened that caused Gobright to fall. But a Reddit climbing forum discussed the dangers of rappelling in the wake of Gobright's death, posting statistics which suggestmore than a quarter of climbing accidents in North America happen during the descent,external. ""It feels like it's always rappelling... it's not over till you're on the ground folks,"" wrote one commenter. Another said climbers can ""let their guard down"" after a long and tiring day, or become distracted in the rush to get down before the sun sets. ""It takes all of 20 seconds to check yourself, check your partner, and knot your ropes."" El Capitan speed climbing record smashed.

SNP drop candidate over claims of anti-Semitism,"Neale Hanvey will still appear on the ballot paper, but the SNP has pulled support from his campaign The SNP has dropped its candidate for a key target seat after allegations of anti-Semitism were made against him. Neale Hanvey is contesting theKirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency, where Labour has a majority of 0.6%. However, the SNP has now withdrawn all support for the former councillor's candidacy, saying he had been suspended pending disciplinary action. Mr Hanvey said he did not, in any way, consider himself to be anti-Semitic and was ""genuinely and deeply sorry"". He had shared a post on Facebook in 2016 which included an image of billionaire George Soros as a puppet master controlling world leaders. In a tweet, he said he ""did not give any thought to Mr Soros' faith and did not consider the connotations of the image in that context. I fully accept that was wrong and I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused"". Mr Hanvey also apologised for another post in which he drew parallels between the treatment of Palestinians and the ""unconscionable treatment"" of Jews in World War Two. ""This was insensitive, upsetting and deeply offensive and is in direct contravention of the IHRA definition of antisemitism,"" he said. ""For that I give an unequivocal apology"".

He added that he fully supported the decision to suspend him and said Nicola Sturgeon was right to take a zero-tolerance approach. ""Although I do not in any way consider myself to be anti-Semitic, on reflection the language I used was, and this is clearly unacceptable,"" he said. He said he hoped his errors could be be used to further the understanding of anti-Semitic language and ""seek to make amends for these dreadful errors of judgement with the Jewish community"". Mr Hanvey's name will still appear on the ballot paper on 12 December, but the SNP has pulled support from his campaign and he would sit as an independent if elected. Business convener Kirsten Oswald said: ""Anti-Semitism has no place in Scotland, and no place in the SNP. All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and to take tough action. ""Neale Hanvey is no longer an SNP candidate, and his membership has been suspended pending disciplinary action. All support for his campaign has been withdrawn."" Mr Hanvey is the third candidate to have been dropped by Scottish parties inside two days.

Supergirl star was 'in an abusive relationship',"Melissa Benoist said she hoped sharing her story would 'help prevent more' from happening Supergirl star Melissa Benoist has spoken out about being in an abusive relationship - saying at one point she had to learn to lock herself in a room. In a video on Instagram, the actress says she ""never thought"" she'd be sharing a story like this. She then gives details of how the ""violence escalated"" and how she ""had to get out"". ""I hope telling my story might help prevent more stories like mine happening,"" she says. WARNING: This article contains details which some people may find upsetting Inthe video,external, which is captioned Life Isn't Always What It Seems, the actress never names the alleged perpetrator or suggests when the relationship took place or how long it lasted. Melissa says ""the abuse was not violent at first"" but was more manipulative. ""Work in general was a touchy subject,"" she says. ""He didn't want me ever kissing or even having flirtatious scenes with men..."" She says she turned down auditions and job offers because she ""didn't want to hurt him"" and now sees that behaviour as a ""red flag"" for what was to come. The actress has played Kara Danvers in the Supergirl series since 2015 The 31-year-old says the violence started with ""a smoothie being thrown in my face"" before escalating to the point where she was ""pinned down, slapped and repeatedly punched"". ""I learned to lock myself in rooms but quickly stopped because the door was inevitably broken down,"" she says. In the video, she says her ""most vivid memories"" are arguments ending when ""a wave of guilt would wash over him"" and he'd ""carry me to an empty bath"" before crying and giving what she calls ""the typical abuser's apology speech"". Melissa says she's ""can't describe"" the relief she felt when she finally confided in someone Melissa says she would ""just plain lie"" to her closest friends to cover up what was going on until one day one of them confronted her about it. ""Unbeknownst to me, many people in my life suspected and feared exactly what was happening. ""It was the first moment I spoke about the abuse to anyone and I can't describe the amount of relief I felt. ""She held me and she said, 'You know what you have to do now, don't you?'"" The actress says ""leaving was not a walk in the park"" but that the more people she ""let in"" the more she was ""bolstered"". She closes the video by addressing anyone who might be going through something similar. ""What I went through caused a tectonic shift in my outlook on life. I will be healing from this for the rest of my life. And that's OK. ""If you are enduring what I went through and you see this... at least you might begin to think of your freedom. ""You can and deserve to live a violence-free life."" Since the video was released, hundreds of people have responded to the post and the hashtag #IStandWithMelissa was trending on Twitter. One fan called the story ""absolutely heartbreaking"" saying the actress is ""so strong"" while another thanks her ""for being yet another voice to say it's OK to say no"". Other celebrities have also supported her. Riverdale actress Lini Reinhart said she was ""so moved by her bravery"" on Instagram' while writer Natasha Rothwell tweeted: ""Check on your strong friends. Check on your quiet friends... Check on each other."" Melissa's bravery ""will undoubtedly help and encourage others to do the same"", says Sandra Horley, chief executive of domestic abuse charity Refuge.

Prince Andrew accuser gives first UK interview,"A US woman who says she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York aged 17 has given her first UK television interview - on Monday's BBC Panorama. Virginia Giuffre, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, says both she and Prince Andrew ""know what happened"". The prince ""categorically"" denies having any sexual contact with her. Earlier the Met Police defended its decision not to probe a trafficking claim by Ms Giuffre against Epstein. The force said it stood by its conclusion that it was ""not the appropriate authority"" to investigate the American woman's claims. Ms Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts - alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Buckingham Palace has described the allegations as ""false and without any foundation"". In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlisearlier this month, the prince said the alleged incidents ""never happened"". In a special hour-long Panorama,to be aired on BBC One on 2 Decemberbut recorded before the Newsnight interview, Ms Giuffre says: ""It was a really scary time in my life. ""He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there's only one of us telling the truth."" Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, a US financierwho took his own lifein August awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The prince has faced a growing backlash following an the Newsnight interview about his friendship with the US financier. He has stepped back from royal dutiesbecause the Epstein scandal has become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. He later said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"". Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. In a statement, the prince said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. During his Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said he could not recall ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said that on the night she claims they first met he had gone to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. Ms Giuffre's latest comments form part of a longer investigation by Panorama into the Epstein scandal and the prince's links with the convicted child sex offender. During the programme, BBC reporter Darragh MacIntyre will also look at another of the prince's friends, Ghislaine Maxwell, investigating her alleged links to the Epstein scandal. Earlier on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police defended its decision not to investigate a claim of trafficking by Ms Giuffre. She says the force failed to check her allegation that she had been trafficked to London in 2001 by Epstein. Commander Alex Murray said that after taking legal advice, ""it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK"". The Met reviewed that decision after Epstein died in US custody earlier this year. Commander Murray said that ""our position remains unchanged"". Panorama: The Prince and the Epstein Scandal will air on Monday at 21:00 GMT, BBC One.

Labour candidate removed over anti-Semitism claims,"Labour said it had removed Safia Ali as its candidate over Facebook posts Labour has removed one of its general election candidates over allegations that she made anti-Semitic posts on Facebook. Safia Ali had been due to stand for the party in the Falkirk seat in next month's election. But Scottish Labour said it had taken ""immediate action"" to remove her as its candidate after the posts emerged. It also expressed its ""deep regret"" that she had been selected to stand for the party. Scottish Labour general secretary Michael Sharpe confirmed that the party had withdrawn its support from Ms Ali  - although her name will still appear on the ballot paper because she was removed after the close of nominations. But he said he would not go into specific details about her case. Latest from the election campaign trail Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Mr Sharpe added: ""I deeply regret the people of the Falkirk constituency will no longer have a Labour candidate to campaign and vote for on 12 December. ""There is no place for anti-Semitism, or any form of racism and bigotry, in our party. That is why Labour is taking robust action to root it out of our movement and wider society."" Mr Sharpe insisted that the party had ""significantly strengthened"" its procedures, with ""swift suspensions, new processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members"". BBC Scotland has been unable to contact Ms Ali for comment. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard denied that anti-Semitism is rife throughout his party and suggested that the Facebook posts at the centre of the allegations against Ms Ali had escaped the party's attention during a trawl of her online activity. On a visit to a community shop in Midlothian, Mr Leonard was asked five times by the BBC if he would like to apologise to the Jewish community. He said those who had made anti-Semitic comments should do so, and insisted that Scottish Labour was ""not complacent"" about anti-Jewish racism in the party and was keen to root it out. Scottish Labour came second to the SNP's John McNally at the 2017 election in Falkirk, trailing by 4,923 votes. Labour has been embroiled in allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, with the chief rabbi claiming earlier this week that the party is not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil on Tuesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was asked four times whether he would like to apologise to the British Jewish community -but declined to do so. However, Mr Corbyn has stressed that there is no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and said those guilty of anti-Jewish racism have been ""brought to book"". Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservativessuspended their Glasgow Centralcandidate, Flora Scarabello, on Wednesday after she was accused of using ""anti-Muslim language"". Last week, the Tories alsosuspended their candidate for Aberdeen North, Ryan Houghton, over allegations he had made anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic comments seven years previously.

"'We try our best as nurses, but it's not enough'","This video can not be played Nurse Georgina Day on the pressures she says she and her colleagues are under When Georgina Day became a nurse five years ago, she had dreams of becoming the next Florence Nightingale. But the reality has been very different. Georgina works as an A&E nurse in a London hospital. Every shift, her team of just over 20 starts four nurses short because there are posts it cannot fill. ""It can be worse - if people are sick or agency staff don't turn up. It makes providing good patient care difficult."" She says the demands are huge - her department sees more than 400 patients a day. But the shortages mean patients face delays or have to be given care, such as intravenous antibiotics, in corridors instead of in cubicles. Nurse numbers rise 'eclipsed by jump in patients' Can the NHS boost nurse numbers by 50,000? She says that can make patients angry, recounting the experience of one father shouting at her and saying she didn't care about his sick son. ""I care massively,"" she says. ""When patients are angry it makes me really sad. I want more for them. ""We try our absolute best, even when we are short. It makes you sad and frustrated you don't have the resources to make sure they have a good experience. I feel like more and more, you get patients complaining. ""It is a lot harder than I expected it to be. It is really tough, feeling you are not doing a brilliant job all the time. ""We need more support. We need more nurses. A lot of my colleagues are thinking of leaving nursing."" Georgina's experience is not unique. A survey by the Royal College of Nursing found six in 10 nurses felt they could not provide the level of care they wanted to. Currently, there are more than 43,000 nursing vacancies in England - one in eight posts. Despite efforts over recent years to tackle the issue, there has been no progress over the past 12 months. It has left the NHS with one of the lowest proportions of nurses in the developed world. A study in the British Medical Journal this week showed there were 9.3 nurses, on average, for every 1,000 people in rich nations. In the UK there are 7.8; in Germany, 12.9. RCN England director Patricia Marquis said: ""Nursing staff want to deliver the best for patients but have one arm tied behind their back. ""They deliver the vast majority of patient care and a shortage of them is one of the single biggest challenges facing services. ""Until this is solved, the public and patients are being short-changed and their care is genuinely compromised."" Anita Charlesworth, of the Health Foundation think-tank, said staffing had emerged as the ""make-or-break issue"" in the NHS as the election draws closer. All three main political parties in England - health is devolved, so Westminster MPs do not have control of policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have said they want to increase the number of nurses in the NHS. To encourage more into training, all three are promising to reintroduce maintenance grants - worth at least Â£5,000 a year - to help student nurses during their degrees. Labour has also promised to abolish tuition fees. The parties have also pledged to invest in career development - the Tories say there will be the equivalent of Â£1,000 of training and support available for each nurse over the next three years.

"Trump makes first Afghan trip for ThanksgivingIn an unannounced visit to American troops, the US president says the ""Taliban wants to make a deal"".","This video can not be played Donald Trump told US troops it was the first Thanksgiving that he didn't get any Turkey President Donald Trump made an unannounced visit to US troops in Afghanistan - his first time in the country - for the Thanksgiving holiday. During the brief appearance at Bagram Airfield, Mr Trump served turkey to soldiers, posed for photographs, and met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. In a speech to troops, Mr Trump said the US was in talks with the Taliban, which he said ""wants to make a deal"". Mr Trump also said the US was ""substantially"" reducing troop numbers. Some 13,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan 18 years after the US intervention to oust the Taliban following the 11 September 2001 attacks. Inside the prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban Who are the Taliban? Why is there a war in Afghanistan? The visit comes after a prisoner swap with the Taliban aimed at resuming peace negotiations. Earlier this month,the Taliban freed two Western academicswho had been held hostage since 2016 - American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks - in exchange for three imprisoned senior militants. ""We're meeting with them [Taliban] and we say it has to be a ceasefire and they didn't want to do a ceasefire and now they want to do a ceasefire,"" Mr Trump said at the base near the capital, Kabul. ""I believe it will probably work out that way."" It is not clear how substantive the talks have been. Afghan officials have long demanded a ceasefire but the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since they were ousted in 2001, have refused to hold direct talks with the government until a US deal is agreed. Taliban leaders confirmed that meetings with senior US officials were being held in Doha since last weekend but that formal talks had not yet resumed, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Trump also reaffirmed his plan to cut troop levels to about 8,600 but did not say how many personnel would leave or when. ""We're going to stay until such time as we have a deal or we have total victory, and they want to make a deal very badly."" Mr Trump arrived at 20:30 local time (16:00 GMT) on Thursday and left before midnight on a trip that was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons. The White House confirmed that there was an arrangement for the president's Twitter account to post messages during the trip to prevent suspicions arising about his long silence. Donald Trump said the Taliban ""wants to make a deal"" Upon his arrival, Mr Trump was greeted by US Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Mark Milley who, on Wednesday, said the chances of a successful outcome from peace talks were higher than before and could happen in the ""near term"". The president, who travelled with a number of aides, then served turkey to troops, sat down to eat Thanksgiving dinner with them before posing for photos. ""There is nowhere I'd rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here,"" Mr Trump said, ""with the toughest, strongest, best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth."" President Ghani thanked the US troops who have made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" in Afghanistan, saying: ""Afghan security forces are taking the lead now."" Reacting to the meeting on Twitter later, Mr Ghani did not mention Mr Trump's comments about talks with the Taliban and said: ""Both sides underscored that if the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire."" There was no immediate reaction from the Taliban, and many have previously raised questions over the group's willingness to engage in serious negotiations or whether it can be trusted. By Chris Buckler, North America correspondent Donald Trump is proud of the military might of his country but this trip overseas should not be interpreted as a sign of his interest in the region. The commander-in-chief has repeatedly stated that he wants his troops home and not bogged down in seemingly endless conflicts like the one in Afghanistan, which holds the unenviable title of America's longest war. Mr Trump's priorities lie inside the borders of the US - borders that he is keen to strengthen. But foreign policy is important to members of his Republican Party, as the ""America First"" president learned when he was heavily criticised for his apparent acquiescence to Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. Since then he has been able to claim a share of the success in the US special forces operation that led to the death of the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. And now there is the teasing possibility of a peace deal with the Taliban. Mr Trump talked up the potential of an agreement - but it is not clear how much has changed since he pronounced negotiations ""dead"" in September. While these are foreign policy issues it is worth recognising that for every president visits like this tend to play into domestic politics - last Christmas, President Trump flew to Iraq. Showing solidarity with soldiers abroad is important for support back home, particularly at holiday time when those troops are thousands of miles away from their families. Talks with the Taliban collapsed in September soon after President Trump invited senior Taliban leaders and President Ghani to meet at the US presidential retreat of Camp David, near Washington DC. But a Taliban attack in the Afghan capital two days earlier, which killed a US soldier and 11 others, prompted Mr Trump to pull out, saying the group ""probably don't have the power to negotiate"" if they were unable to agree to a ceasefire during talks. Mr Ghani said this month's prisoner exchange aimed to ""facilitate direct peace negotiations."" However, the Taliban have long refused to negotiate with Mr Ghani's administration, calling it a puppet of the US. A month of killing in Afghanistan Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan?

BBC complains to Tories over Facebook advert,"The BBC has complained to the Conservatives about a Facebook advert that uses edited footage of its news reporters and presenters. The BBC says the material has been taken out of context and its lawyers have asked the party to remove the ad. The 15-second video was first shown on Thursday afternoon and has so far been seen by more than 100,000 users. The Conservatives said the footage had ""not been edited in a manner that misleads or changes the reporting"". Three clips of BBC reporters or presenters - political editor Laura Kuenssberg, News at Ten presenter Huw Edwards and political correspondent Jonathan Blake - speaking in recent broadcasts are used to describe the situation in Parliament. ""Pointless delay to Brexit"" and ""another Brexit delay"" are among the lines of BBC News commentary used. The clips are edited into a montage of protest footage and video of lively debate in the House of Commons all set to dramatic music. In a statement, the BBC said: 'We're aware of Conservative Party Facebook adverts using edited BBC content. ""This is a completely unacceptable use of BBC content which distorts our output and which could damage perceptions of our impartiality."" The BBC's lawyers have written to party chairman James Cleverly asking the party to take down the advert. According to Facebook's Ad Library,external, the Conservative Party has spent up to Â£2,200 on the advert so far, which is being targeted at 35 to 54-year-olds in England. A spokesperson for the Conservative Party said: ""This video uses contemporary news footage to remind voters of the deadlock and delay of the last three years caused by a broken Parliament that did everything it could to block Brexit. ""Viewers can judge for themselves but it is clear the footage was not edited in a manner that misleads or changes the reporting."" The party was also criticised earlier this month when it posted a ""doctored"" video involving Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, in which he was made to look as if he met a question, posed by ITV's Piers Morgan, with silence when he had answered it straight away. Mr Cleverly said the video, since taken down, was meant to be ""light-hearted"". The party later posted an extended version of the interview. And the Conservatives faced a backlash forrebranding one of their Twitter accountslast week, describing it as a ""fact-checking"" account during a live TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn. Twitter said the party had misled the publicand would take ""decisive corrective action"" if a similar stunt was attempted again.

Boys admit threatening women who refused to kiss,"Melania Geymonat (right) and her date Chris needed hospital treatment Three teenage boys have admitted threatening two women who refused to kiss each other on a bus. Melania Geymonat, 28, and her date Christine Hannigan were pelted with coins on a Camden night bus on 30 May. The teenagers, aged 15, 16 and 17, had previously denied charges of harassment by using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. They admitted the public order offences ahead of a scheduled trial at Highbury Corner Youth Court. The 17-year-old will appear in court on Friday for a Newton hearing, to decide whether an aggravating factor of homophobia should be considered on sentencing. All three boys will be sentenced at the same court on 23 December. This video can not be played 'I was and still am angry at bus attack' Prosecutor Saira Khan said the teenagers each played different roles in the nine-minute incident. Ms Geymonat and Ms Hannigan were initially sitting alone on the top deck of the N31 bus when they were approached by the group of boys. The women were surrounded and sexual gestures were made by the teenagers. CCTV showed a fight breaking out on the bus, with both Ms Geymonat and Ms Hannigan being punched several times. The suspects also left with a phone and a bag. It was alleged the boys threw coins at the women, who were both taken to hospital for treatment to facial injuries. In addition to the public order offences, a 16-year-old boy also pleaded guilty to handling a stolen mobile phone while a 15-year-old boy admitted handling a stolen bank card. Judge Susan Williams said the abuse ""was quite clearly directed towards this couple because of who they are"". Transport for London's Mandy McGregor said after the hearing: ""This sickening incident was utterly unacceptable. Homophobic abuse is a hate crime and won't be tolerated on our network."" Police said charges were dropped against another 17-year-old boy. Speaking after the attack in May, Ms Hannigan told the BBC she was ""not scared to be visibly queer"". ""If anything, you should do it more,"" she added. Ms Geymonat, who is a qualified doctor but works for Ryanair as a flight attendant, said she agreed. Ms Hannigan said: ""I was and still am angry. It was scary, but this is not a novel situation.""

Warning of 'high risk' to water supply at hospital,"The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital campus was opened to patients in 2015 Warnings about the risk of water contamination at Scotland's largest hospital were issued just days after it opened, according to a leaked report. The 2015 inspection report into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) was passed to Labour MSP Anas Sarwar by whistleblowers. It ranked infection control measures as ""high risk"" in several areas. The hospital stayed open despite the warnings but has since had to close wards due to the risks from the water. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) insists the hospital campus has a ""safe and effective water supply"" and all inspection reports have been acted upon. In the Scottish Parliament, Mr Sarwar said that he had seen figures which suggest there were 50 cases of infections at the Royal Children's Hospital  - part of the Â£842m QEUH campus - between 2015 and 2018, and a further 15 unconfirmed cases so far this year. The mother of 10-year-old Milly Main has previously said she was ""100%"" certain contaminated water caused her daughter's fatal infection after treatment for leukaemia in August 2017. NHSGGC insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection, and those of other children, because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. Glasgow health board placed in 'special measures' Mother 'let down and lied to' by health officials Milly Main: Hospital infection spiked at time of child's death At First Minister's Questions, Mr Sarwar claimed staff raised concerns about infections in the weeks before Milly's death. He said that a month after her death ""an assessment of the water supply again found the water was not safe and that there was a high risk of infections"". Mr Sarwar added: ""At each of these stage the warnings were ignored and appropriate action was not taken."" Pressed on the warnings at first minister's questions, Nicola Sturgeon said she was determined to get the ""answers parents deserve"". Kimberly Darroch and 10-year-old Milly Main, who died in 2017 The documents seen by Mr Sarwar show NHS Estates commissioned three separate independent reports into the water supply at the QEUH. The first Legionella assessment, carried out by private contractor by DMA Water Treatment on 29 April 2015 - two days afterthe hospital welcomed its first patients- categorised the management of the bacteria as ""high risk"" because there was ""significant communication issues between the parties"" responsible for managing the risk. The report also warned; there was a risk of stagnating water in parts of the 14-storey building, increasing the risk of infection that cold and hot water supplies were not running at the right temperature and that five plant rooms in the hospital were deemed to be ""high risk"" Inspectors also found debris, including washers, in a water tank and recommended it was cleaned and disinfected. Further inspections by the same firm in September and October of 2017 found debris was still in the same water tank and said there had been ""no significant water system alterations"". A further report in January last year categorised Legionella management on site as being ""high risk"" and called for immediate corrective action. It states, ""the information gathered highlights significant gaps in the Legionella (and potentially other bacteria) control on site, both in terms of management processes and the implementation of recommended preventative maintenance tasks"". On Thursday, the Scottish government appointed Lord Brodie to chair a public inquiry into issues at the QEUH and the delayed Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in Edinburgh, which was stopped from opening due to ventilation issues causing infection concerns. The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital opened in 2015 and the campus includes the Royal Hospital for Children Quizzed on the inspection reports at first minster's questions, Ms Sturgeon said: ""The reason we have ordered the public inquiry is to make sure that in addition to all of the work that is being done, there is complete transparency, and if necessary complete accountability, around these issues. ""It is my job to make sure the Scottish government takes all appropriate action to get to the bottom of all these issues and that is what I and the health secretary are determined to do."" A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: ""The safety, wellbeing and confidence of our patients and our staff is, was and always will be our absolute priority. ""We fully acknowledge that there have been issues at this site and we have taken robust action to address these issues when we became aware of them. ""We led and asked for expert help to investigate and resolve these issues and reports about these incidents are available to the public."" The health board said all of the issues raised in the inspection reports were acted upon and said routine water sampling had been carried out from the time the hospital opened. Specific infection tests were also carried out at the request of infection control doctors when investigating possible infections.

Tory and Labour spending plans 'not credible' - IFS,"This video can not be played Parties react to IFS analysis of manifesto spending plans Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are offering ""credible"" spending plans ahead of the general election, an influential research group has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it was ""highly likely"" the Tories would end up spending more than their manifesto pledges. Labour, it warned, would be unable to deliver its spending increases as it has promised. Neither party was being ""honest"" with voters, IFS director Paul Johnson said. The Liberal Democrats' manifesto, he said, would involve lower levels of borrowing than under Labour or the Conservatives, but would still be seen as ""radical"" in ""most periods"". However, he added that, given the uncertainty around Brexit, it was difficult to determine what the exact effects of the three parties' offers would be. Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems have all published their manifestos, including spending and taxation plans, ahead of the 12 December general election. More on the IFS report: Our Reality Check team analyse spending pledges Labour is promising to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy, as well as give a 5% pay increase to public sector workers in its first year in government, if elected. The Lib Dems say stopping Brexit would deliver an extra Â£10bn a year for public services - they also want to increase all income tax rates by 1% to fund more NHS spending. The Conservatives have pledged to postpone a scheduled corporation tax cut - from 19% to 17% - to increase spending on public services. This video can not be played IFS: 'The choice could not be clearer' for voters Paul Johnson said that, under Tory plans, spending on public services apart from healthcare would still be 14% lower by 2023/24 than it was in 2010/11. Despite this, he said the Conservatives were continuing to ""pretend that tax rises will never be needed to secure decent public services"" - and said a pledge from the party not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT over the next five years was ""ill-advised"". ""It is highly likely that the Conservatives would end up spending more than their manifesto implies, and thus taxing or borrowing more,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said it was ""highly likely"" Labour would need to raise taxes beyond what it is promising to pay for its proposed Â£80bn a year in extra spending. He said it was ""clearly not the case"" the party's plans would see taxes rise for only the richest 5% of taxpayers. The IFS said Labour plans to scrap a tax break for married couples and change taxes on company dividends would affect people outside this earnings bracket. It also argued the party's planned rise in corporation tax would be passed on to workers in the form of lower wages, and to consumers in the form of higher prices. ""In reality, a change in the scale and the scope of the state that they propose would require more broad-based tax increases at some point,"" Mr Johnson added. It's a plague on all your houses - but for very different reasons. The main criticism of Labour is that its spending on investment is just so big, it wouldn't be able to deliver it. The IFS also says it is highly likely the party's tax rises would impact, directly or indirectly, on more than just the top 5% of earners. There's no respite for the Conservatives though - particularly on their pledge not to extend the transition period included in the PM's Brexit deal beyond 2020, even if a trade deal has not been agreed. The idea that the UK might have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms is seen by these economists as something which would be highly damaging to the economy. It says this could cause an increase in the deficit of the same order, potentially even higher, than would be caused by Labour's tax and spending plans. Paul Johnson also said a Labour manifesto pledge to abolish poverty for people in work over the next five years was ""not achievable"", and a plan to scrap theuniversal creditbenefits payment scheme would be ""expensive, disruptive and unnecessary"". He criticised the party's promise to pay compensation tomore than three million womenaffected by an accelerated rise in the state pension age. Mr Johnson said there may be scope for ""much more limited compensation"", but the group was ""relatively well off on average"". He also criticised the Tories for failing to ""come up with any kind of plan or any kind of money for social care"". Conservative manifesto - our analysis of key policies Labour manifesto -  our analysis of key policies Lib Dem manifesto -  our analysis of key policies Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party's manifesto was ""bold"", ""ambitious"", ""prepared for"" and had been fully costed. He said he was ""very confident"" it would improve the ""lifestyle and life chances"" of the poorest people in the UK. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said his party's manifesto had made ""very substantial commitments,"" but also insisted it was ""fully costed"". He added that Labour's spending plans followed an ""out-and-out socialist approach"" that would ""push up taxes massively"". Lib Dem deputy leader Sir Ed Davey said the IFS assessment ""shows that neither the Tories or Labour have a credible plan for the economy"". ""Both are failing to come clean with the electorate and ignoring the Brexit black hole their plans would leave in the public finances,"" he added.

It's so thoughtful and selfless, two things that are not easy to come by."" She plans to leave her own parcel somewhere nearer to Christmas Day. Katharine Deadman said the gift she found is ""great"" as she is the only one in her family who likes Christmas pudding Other presents found over the past two weeks in the parks and streets of the village, estimated population 3,500, include shortbread and chocolates.

Trump makes unannounced visit to AfghanistanIt is the US president's first trip to the war-torn country since he took office in 2017.Asia,"This video can not be played Donald Trump told US troops it was the first Thanksgiving that he didn't get any Turkey President Donald Trump made an unannounced visit to US troops in Afghanistan - his first time in the country - for the Thanksgiving holiday. During the brief appearance at Bagram Airfield, Mr Trump served turkey to soldiers, posed for photographs, and met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. In a speech to troops, Mr Trump said the US was in talks with the Taliban, which he said ""wants to make a deal"". Mr Trump also said the US was ""substantially"" reducing troop numbers. Some 13,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan 18 years after the US intervention to oust the Taliban following the 11 September 2001 attacks. Inside the prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban Who are the Taliban? Why is there a war in Afghanistan? The visit comes after a prisoner swap with the Taliban aimed at resuming peace negotiations. Earlier this month,the Taliban freed two Western academicswho had been held hostage since 2016 - American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks - in exchange for three imprisoned senior militants. ""We're meeting with them [Taliban] and we say it has to be a ceasefire and they didn't want to do a ceasefire and now they want to do a ceasefire,"" Mr Trump said at the base near the capital, Kabul. ""I believe it will probably work out that way."" It is not clear how substantive the talks have been. Afghan officials have long demanded a ceasefire but the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since they were ousted in 2001, have refused to hold direct talks with the government until a US deal is agreed. Taliban leaders confirmed that meetings with senior US officials were being held in Doha since last weekend but that formal talks had not yet resumed, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Trump also reaffirmed his plan to cut troop levels to about 8,600 but did not say how many personnel would leave or when. ""We're going to stay until such time as we have a deal or we have total victory, and they want to make a deal very badly."" Mr Trump arrived at 20:30 local time (16:00 GMT) on Thursday and left before midnight on a trip that was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons. The White House confirmed that there was an arrangement for the president's Twitter account to post messages during the trip to prevent suspicions arising about his long silence. Donald Trump said the Taliban ""wants to make a deal"" Upon his arrival, Mr Trump was greeted by US Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Mark Milley who, on Wednesday, said the chances of a successful outcome from peace talks were higher than before and could happen in the ""near term"". The president, who travelled with a number of aides, then served turkey to troops, sat down to eat Thanksgiving dinner with them before posing for photos. ""There is nowhere I'd rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here,"" Mr Trump said, ""with the toughest, strongest, best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth."" President Ghani thanked the US troops who have made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" in Afghanistan, saying: ""Afghan security forces are taking the lead now."" Reacting to the meeting on Twitter later, Mr Ghani did not mention Mr Trump's comments about talks with the Taliban and said: ""Both sides underscored that if the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire."" There was no immediate reaction from the Taliban, and many have previously raised questions over the group's willingness to engage in serious negotiations or whether it can be trusted. By Chris Buckler, North America correspondent Donald Trump is proud of the military might of his country but this trip overseas should not be interpreted as a sign of his interest in the region. The commander-in-chief has repeatedly stated that he wants his troops home and not bogged down in seemingly endless conflicts like the one in Afghanistan, which holds the unenviable title of America's longest war. Mr Trump's priorities lie inside the borders of the US - borders that he is keen to strengthen. But foreign policy is important to members of his Republican Party, as the ""America First"" president learned when he was heavily criticised for his apparent acquiescence to Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. Since then he has been able to claim a share of the success in the US special forces operation that led to the death of the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. And now there is the teasing possibility of a peace deal with the Taliban. Mr Trump talked up the potential of an agreement - but it is not clear how much has changed since he pronounced negotiations ""dead"" in September. While these are foreign policy issues it is worth recognising that for every president visits like this tend to play into domestic politics - last Christmas, President Trump flew to Iraq. Showing solidarity with soldiers abroad is important for support back home, particularly at holiday time when those troops are thousands of miles away from their families. Talks with the Taliban collapsed in September soon after President Trump invited senior Taliban leaders and President Ghani to meet at the US presidential retreat of Camp David, near Washington DC. But a Taliban attack in the Afghan capital two days earlier, which killed a US soldier and 11 others, prompted Mr Trump to pull out, saying the group ""probably don't have the power to negotiate"" if they were unable to agree to a ceasefire during talks. Mr Ghani said this month's prisoner exchange aimed to ""facilitate direct peace negotiations."" However, the Taliban have long refused to negotiate with Mr Ghani's administration, calling it a puppet of the US. A month of killing in Afghanistan Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan?

"SNP drop candidate over claims of anti-SemitismNeale Hanvey is contesting the Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency, where Labour has a majority of 0.6%.Election 2019","Neale Hanvey will still appear on the ballot paper, but the SNP has pulled support from his campaign The SNP has dropped its candidate for a key target seat after allegations of anti-Semitism were made against him. Neale Hanvey is contesting theKirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath constituency, where Labour has a majority of 0.6%. However, the SNP has now withdrawn all support for the former councillor's candidacy, saying he had been suspended pending disciplinary action. Mr Hanvey said he did not, in any way, consider himself to be anti-Semitic and was ""genuinely and deeply sorry"". He had shared a post on Facebook in 2016 which included an image of billionaire George Soros as a puppet master controlling world leaders. In a tweet, he said he ""did not give any thought to Mr Soros' faith and did not consider the connotations of the image in that context. I fully accept that was wrong and I apologise unreservedly for any offence caused"". Mr Hanvey also apologised for another post in which he drew parallels between the treatment of Palestinians and the ""unconscionable treatment"" of Jews in World War Two. ""This was insensitive, upsetting and deeply offensive and is in direct contravention of the IHRA definition of antisemitism,"" he said. ""For that I give an unequivocal apology"".

He added that he fully supported the decision to suspend him and said Nicola Sturgeon was right to take a zero-tolerance approach. ""Although I do not in any way consider myself to be anti-Semitic, on reflection the language I used was, and this is clearly unacceptable,"" he said. He said he hoped his errors could be be used to further the understanding of anti-Semitic language and ""seek to make amends for these dreadful errors of judgement with the Jewish community"". Mr Hanvey's name will still appear on the ballot paper on 12 December, but the SNP has pulled support from his campaign and he would sit as an independent if elected. Business convener Kirsten Oswald said: ""Anti-Semitism has no place in Scotland, and no place in the SNP. All political parties have a duty to show leadership, and to take tough action. ""Neale Hanvey is no longer an SNP candidate, and his membership has been suspended pending disciplinary action. All support for his campaign has been withdrawn."" Mr Hanvey is the third candidate to have been dropped by Scottish parties inside two days.

Trump makes unannounced visit to Afghanistan,"This video can not be played Donald Trump told US troops it was the first Thanksgiving that he didn't get any Turkey President Donald Trump made an unannounced visit to US troops in Afghanistan - his first time in the country - for the Thanksgiving holiday. During the brief appearance at Bagram Airfield, Mr Trump served turkey to soldiers, posed for photographs, and met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani. In a speech to troops, Mr Trump said the US was in talks with the Taliban, which he said ""wants to make a deal"". Mr Trump also said the US was ""substantially"" reducing troop numbers. Some 13,000 US troops remain in Afghanistan 18 years after the US intervention to oust the Taliban following the 11 September 2001 attacks. Inside the prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban Who are the Taliban? Why is there a war in Afghanistan? The visit comes after a prisoner swap with the Taliban aimed at resuming peace negotiations. Earlier this month,the Taliban freed two Western academicswho had been held hostage since 2016 - American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks - in exchange for three imprisoned senior militants. ""We're meeting with them [Taliban] and we say it has to be a ceasefire and they didn't want to do a ceasefire and now they want to do a ceasefire,"" Mr Trump said at the base near the capital, Kabul. ""I believe it will probably work out that way."" It is not clear how substantive the talks have been. Afghan officials have long demanded a ceasefire but the Taliban, who now control more territory than at any point since they were ousted in 2001, have refused to hold direct talks with the government until a US deal is agreed. Taliban leaders confirmed that meetings with senior US officials were being held in Doha since last weekend but that formal talks had not yet resumed, Reuters news agency reported. Mr Trump also reaffirmed his plan to cut troop levels to about 8,600 but did not say how many personnel would leave or when. ""We're going to stay until such time as we have a deal or we have total victory, and they want to make a deal very badly."" Mr Trump arrived at 20:30 local time (16:00 GMT) on Thursday and left before midnight on a trip that was shrouded in secrecy for security reasons. The White House confirmed that there was an arrangement for the president's Twitter account to post messages during the trip to prevent suspicions arising about his long silence. Donald Trump said the Taliban ""wants to make a deal"" Upon his arrival, Mr Trump was greeted by US Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen Mark Milley who, on Wednesday, said the chances of a successful outcome from peace talks were higher than before and could happen in the ""near term"". The president, who travelled with a number of aides, then served turkey to troops, sat down to eat Thanksgiving dinner with them before posing for photos. ""There is nowhere I'd rather celebrate this Thanksgiving than right here,"" Mr Trump said, ""with the toughest, strongest, best and bravest warriors on the face of the earth."" President Ghani thanked the US troops who have made the ""ultimate sacrifice"" in Afghanistan, saying: ""Afghan security forces are taking the lead now."" Reacting to the meeting on Twitter later, Mr Ghani did not mention Mr Trump's comments about talks with the Taliban and said: ""Both sides underscored that if the Taliban are sincere in their commitment to reaching a peace deal, they must accept a ceasefire."" There was no immediate reaction from the Taliban, and many have previously raised questions over the group's willingness to engage in serious negotiations or whether it can be trusted. By Chris Buckler, North America correspondent Donald Trump is proud of the military might of his country but this trip overseas should not be interpreted as a sign of his interest in the region. The commander-in-chief has repeatedly stated that he wants his troops home and not bogged down in seemingly endless conflicts like the one in Afghanistan, which holds the unenviable title of America's longest war. Mr Trump's priorities lie inside the borders of the US - borders that he is keen to strengthen. But foreign policy is important to members of his Republican Party, as the ""America First"" president learned when he was heavily criticised for his apparent acquiescence to Turkey's invasion of northern Syria. Since then he has been able to claim a share of the success in the US special forces operation that led to the death of the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. And now there is the teasing possibility of a peace deal with the Taliban. Mr Trump talked up the potential of an agreement - but it is not clear how much has changed since he pronounced negotiations ""dead"" in September. While these are foreign policy issues it is worth recognising that for every president visits like this tend to play into domestic politics - last Christmas, President Trump flew to Iraq. Showing solidarity with soldiers abroad is important for support back home, particularly at holiday time when those troops are thousands of miles away from their families. Talks with the Taliban collapsed in September soon after President Trump invited senior Taliban leaders and President Ghani to meet at the US presidential retreat of Camp David, near Washington DC. But a Taliban attack in the Afghan capital two days earlier, which killed a US soldier and 11 others, prompted Mr Trump to pull out, saying the group ""probably don't have the power to negotiate"" if they were unable to agree to a ceasefire during talks. Mr Ghani said this month's prisoner exchange aimed to ""facilitate direct peace negotiations."" However, the Taliban have long refused to negotiate with Mr Ghani's administration, calling it a puppet of the US. A month of killing in Afghanistan Taliban are back - what next for Afghanistan?

EU net migration to UK at lowest for 16 years,"EU net migration to the UK has fallen to its lowest level for 16 years, ONS figures show. The difference between how many people from the EU came to the UK for at least 12 months and how many left dropped to 48,000 - the lowest level since 2003. The ONS says this was down to fewer people coming to Britain for work, while a record high returned home. In the year to June, overall net migration from both EU and non-EU countries was 212,000. The number of people arriving from the EU now stands at its lowest level since the year ending March 2013, according tothe figures published by the Office for National Statistics,external. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said there had also been a steady rise in the number of EU citizens returning home - 151,000 emigrated in the past 12 months, double the number six years ago and the highest figure on record. EU net migration previously hit peak levels of more than 200,000 in 2015 and early 2016. Meanwhile, net migration from outside the EU has gradually increased for the past six years as more non-EU citizens came to the UK to study, the ONS says. Migration Watch UK's chairman Alp Mehmet said it was ""hardly surprising"" that EU net migration had fallen due to Brexit uncertainty. However, Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, suggested other reasons could also be behind the fall. She said: ""The reasons for this will include things like the lower value of the pound making the UK less attractive, improving economic prospects in EU countries of origin, and potentially the political uncertainty of the prolonged Brexit process."" Immigration figures were reclassified as ""experimental"" earlier this year after officials said there was ""significant uncertainty"" about the reliability of recent data. Since 2016, there has been a decrease in immigration for work while people coming to the UK for study has gradually increased, the report adds. It says the fall in immigration for work has mainly been because of a decrease in EU citizens coming to the UK looking for work, particularly those from eight of the countries which joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. The ONS estimated that about 229,000 more non-EU citizens moved to the UK than left in the year ending June 2019. This non-EU net migration has gradually increased since 2013 as immigration has risen and emigration for this group has remained ""broadly stable"". Is this the Brexit effect? EU immigration has fallen by 85,000 since the 'in-out' referendum in 2016 while EU emigration has increased by 56,000. It's a steep, clear trend that has taken EU net migration back to what it was before the expansion of the bloc in 2004. That was when people from 10 nations, including Poland, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania, were controversially given free movement rights to live and work in the UK. In some areas, the influx of migrants from this group of countries fuelled concerns about immigration, stoking a wider debate about control of Britain's borders and membership of the EU. It's ironic, therefore, that just as the UK stands on the brink of severing its ties with the European Union one of the key factors that persuaded people to vote leave may be - in numerical terms at least - diminishing as an issue. The ONS says the rise in non-EU immigration is mainly because of a gradual increase in those coming to the UK for formal study. A spokesman for the ONS said: ""Our best assessment using all data sources is that long-term immigration, emigration and net migration have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016. However, we have seen different patterns for EU and non-EU citizens. ""While there are still more EU citizens moving to the UK than leaving, EU net migration has fallen since 2016, driven by fewer EU arrivals for work. ""In contrast, non-EU net migration has gradually increased for the past six years, largely as more non-EU citizens came to study."" In response to the figures, business leaders said that ensuring firms had access ""to the people and skills they need"" was ""as important as forging our future trading relationship with the EU"". Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said ""shortages already exist at all skill levels"" and that future immigration policy should not only focus on the ""brightest and best"". ""To build new homes and schools, we don't just need architects and engineers, but bricklayers and plumbers too,"" he said.

How many trees can you plant in a day?,"The political parties have been promising huge increases in tree planting in their election manifestos. The most eye-catching is Labour's plan toplant two billion trees by 2040. Impossible, some say - that's more than a quarter of a million trees every day. But it's not necessarily unrealistic. It's just that it will require a sea change in the way things are done today. In the year to March 2019, the number of trees planted across the UK went up: 13,400 hectares of new woodland was planted. Most of it was in Scotland (11,200 hectares), while there was actually a decrease in planting in England. But these UK-wide figures fall way short of where they were in the late 1980s, when about 30,000 hectares were planted every year. Experts who advocate sustainable woodland are not huge fans of the way planting was done in that decade, but it does show that the current rate of planting could rise dramatically. Meanwhile, the Conservatives have pledged to plant at least 30 million more trees every year, the Lib Dems and the SNP each say they will plant 60 million trees a year, while the Green Party would aim to plant 700 million trees by 2030.  Tree-plantingHow many trees are the parties pledging to plant? Labour: 100ma year (2bn by 2040) Greens: 70ma year Lib Dems: 60ma year SNP: 60m targeta year Conservatives: 30ma year It's difficult to say precisely because trees can be planted at a density of anything between 1,000 and 2,500 per hectare. But if you take a mid-range, then planting 30,000 hectares means you are planting roughly (and we should stress this is an estimate) 50 million trees a year. Did Ethiopia plant 350 million trees in a day? That's still a long way short of the rate of planting Labour would need to achieve, in order to meet its target. But it suggests that it could be done. Experts can plant trees incredibly quickly. But the Woodland Trust, the UK's largest woodland conservation charity, says several things need to happen to encourage a huge tree-planting programme: Far more people need to be involved in tree-planting schemes at national and local government levels, and within statutory bodies The UK needs to boost substantially its stocks of trees for planting More money or grants need to be found for farmers and other landowners to persuade them to plant trees Natural reforestation needs to be encouraged alongside new planting ""We know that the investment needed will pay back,"" says Darren Moorcroft, the chief executive of the Woodland Trust. ""It will require landowners willing to provide the public benefits that society needs, and public funds to support it."" CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external The Committee on Climate Change, a statutory body which provides advice to government, says the UK needs a net increase of 32,000 hectares of woodland every year for the next 30 years, in order to help achieve the legally-binding target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. That equates to about one-and-a-half billion trees. Again that sounds like an awful lot, but at the moment only 13% of the UK's land area is covered in trees (and in England it is 10%). The aim is to increase that UK-wide figure to 17% by 2050. The average tree cover across the EU is about 35%, so it's actually quite a modest overall target. To put things into further perspective, there have been multiple efforts elsewhere in the worldto plant millions of trees in a single day. Guinness World Records say roughly 50 million were planted by volunteers in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh on a single day in 2016. So, ambitious targets for the UK should not be dismissed out of hand. But to get there, from where we are now, will take a gargantuan effort.

At-a-glance: DUP manifesto,"The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)has launched its manifesto ahead of the 12 December general election. The full document,which you can see here,external, sets out the policies the party would support becoming law if its MPs are returned to Westminster. Some areas, such as education or health, are devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has been suspended since January 2017. This means the Stormont executive would need to be restored, with assembly members supporting the particular policy, before it could be introduced. The manifesto also sets out how the DUP wants to see devolved government restored. The main policies from the party's 2019 manifesto are: Leaving the EU as one United Kingdom, with no border in the Irish Sea A 12-point plan to ""get Northern Ireland moving again"" Infrastructure investment that delivers for the whole UK Keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of Downing Street There are no surprises when it comes to the DUP's position on Brexit. The Leave-supporting party is standing by its long-established red lines: The UK must leave the EU as one country, with no border in the Irish Sea There must be unfettered access for Northern Ireland to and from the Great Britain market Work towards a Brexit deal in Northern Ireland's interests The DUP campaigned in favour of Brexit in 2016, but now fiercely opposes Boris Johnson's deal, arguing it will not take the UK out of the EU as one undivided nation. If Mr Johnson is the next prime minister, the DUP wants him to change aspects of his deal regarding customs and democratic consent. The party was willing to concede different food and animal health regulations for Northern Ireland, but only if unionists could veto anything they opposed. However the DUP rejects the proposal that Northern Ireland will have to follow many EU rules on goods, that there will be some checks on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, and that this arrangement can only be ended by a majority vote. Instead they want the EU deal - like other contentious matters at the Stormont assembly - to require the parallel approval of both unionists and nationalists. Unlike some other unionists, the DUP won't concede that Brexit has destabilised the UK, and its leaders don't talk about switching to Remain. Instead, they insist it is the way Brexit has been dealt with which has been damaging: The party wants an inquiry to be set up into the handling of the UK government's Brexit negotiations. The DUP is often thought of as a right-wing party, but while this is true on many social issues, it does not extend to the party's economic policies. Raising the living wage, free TV licences for pensioners and an end to the freeze on benefits all feature in the manifesto. The DUP has always made much of being supportive of older people and this election is no different. The personal tax allowance should rise in line with inflation each year Raise the national living wage to Â£10.50 by the end of the parliamentary term End the freeze on benefits, which should rise in line with inflation Abolish the television licence fee but restore free licences for over-75s as long as it remains Retain the pensions triple lock and retain winter fuel payments The infamousbridge from Northern Ireland to Scotlandmakes an appearance in the manifesto. It has been mooted on a number of occasions, despite a number of potential barriers to its construction. Not everyone believes those barriers are insurmountable, though. The party also supports the expansion of Heathrow, a policy at least partly linked to the airport's dozens of flights a week to Belfast which bring with them trade and tourism. Cancel the planned high-speed railway line from London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds (HS2) Build a third runway at Heathrow Airport Expand the public transport bus fleet and shift it away from diesel to alternative energy If the feasibility study on a bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Scotland is positive, it should be pursued by Westminster and devolved governments A 1,000km long electricity interconnector from Iceland to make landfall in Northern Ireland Larne has been suggested as one end of the huge bridge construction project If the DUP makes much of its support for the elderly, it also sees itself as a champion of farmers, fishermen and those who work in the rural economy which makes up much of Northern Ireland. Once again the party backs financial support for farmers and it casts an eye towards the role of the rural economy after Brexit. There is also some detail on climate change, an issue which has become a bigger focus for voters recently. Increase financial support for farmers Ensure agriculture is afforded protection in post-Brexit trade deals A new fisheries bill for the UK to take back control of our territorial waters Meet the net zero carbon neutral target for Northern Ireland by 2050 Ban all new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035 Arlene Foster says DUP votes could well still be crucial to the next government Getting Northern Ireland's stalled assembly back up and running is a key priority for the party, which says it has no preconditions for going back government with its former power-sharing partner Sinn FÃ©in: Work with other parties to secure a balanced deal and remain willing to set up an executive immediately Far-reaching reform of any new assembly Bring forward legislation to address culture and language issues within a time-limited period to be agreed alongside parallel talks The DUP's handling of a green energy financial scandal was what sparked the political fallout that brought down devolution in January 2017. Since then, there's been a fresh assembly election - which saw the DUP's majority in Stormont reduced - and several failed talks processes. The DUP insists it would go back into a power-sharing government tomorrow, without preconditions - and that outstanding issues such as legislating for an Irish Language Act should be addressed alongside a functioning government. But that idea has been rejected time and again by Sinn FÃ©in, the largest nationalist party at Stormont and the DUP's former power-sharing partner. It has maintained that restoring the institutions without reform will not work. In recent weeks, there's been more conciliatory language from the DUP on language and culture - and the Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has said one final round of fresh talks should be convened after the election to try and reach a breakthrough, claiming a deal is ""raring to go"". What happens in this election will surely determine how the Stormont parties approach any future negotiations. Nothing can be ruled out at the moment - but the consensus is that if there's no agreement by early next year, another assembly election could be on the cards. The DUP is a strong supporter of the military and veterans and is beefing up those credentials with a commitment to increase the percentage of GDP spent on defence. Its other key policies on defence are long-standing: Spend 2.2% of UK GDP on defence every year Fully implement the Armed Forces Covenant across the UK Maintain an independent nuclear deterrent Repeal the Fixed Term Parliaments Act Cabinet to meet in Belfast once a year Reform the House of Lords, including electing two-thirds of its members A Royal Commission to produce proposals for supporting and sustaining a modern social care system Develop a points-based immigration system CONFUSED?A simple election guide POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote Here's a guide to where the the other main parties in Northern Ireland stand on key issues in this election campaign.

How will millennials be helped to beat the housing crisis?,"With the general election only a fortnight away, housing is a topic that has been on the minds of our readers. Here, we answer a selection of your questions. Young people in particular are less likely to own a home than previous generations,according to the think tank the Resolution Foundation. The Conservatives want to introduce a new mortgage with long-term fixed rates, requiring only a 5% deposit, to help young people buy their first homes. This is in addition to creating a scheme where first-time buyers will be able to get a 30% discount on new homes in their local area. Labour has also said it would give local people ""first dibs"" on new homes built in their area. It has also promised to review Help to Buy. This is a government scheme which lets buyers access a loan of up to 20% of the purchase price, or 15% in Scotland, or 40% in London. The loan is interest-free for the first five years, and it only applies to new-builds. Young people aged 25 to 34 make up the largest proportion of renters in the UK,according to the Office for National Statistics.,external In addition to making pledges on home ownership, some parties say they will overhaul private renting. The Conservatives have promised to introduce a scheme where renters can transfer deposits from one rental property to another. Labour, on the other hand, announced that it would cap rent prices with inflation, as well as introduce open-ended tenancies. It also wants to bring in an annual ""property MOT"", to ensure flats and houses meet minimum standards. What are rent controls? The Liberal Democrats say they would set up a new Help to Rent scheme, where first-time renters under 30 could apply for loans for deposits on their first properties. Several parties including Labour and the Green Party have also said they want to end no-fault evictions, also known as ""Section 21 evictions"", where landlords can evict tenants without a reason after their fixed-term tenancy has ended. The governmenthas previously proposed to scrap these notices. Several experts have said that the UK faces a shortfall in housing. The number of new houses being built has fallen in recent years,and stood at 164,390 in 2018.,external Labour has promised to build 100,000 new council houses a year in England, and at least 50,000 affordable homes through housing associations. The Conservatives want to boost private housebuilding. They've pledged a million homes over five years, and an overhaul of the planning system. The Lib Dems want to build 300,000 homes a year by 2024, andthe Greens want an extra 100,000 council homes a year. The construction sector has said,externalfor a number of years that it faces a shortage of skills, so there are challenges to ramping up construction. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external IN-DEPTH:More general election explainers and features Stamp duty is a tax thatpeople who buy property or land over a certain price must pay.,externalIn England and Northern Ireland buyers pay Stamp Duty Land Tax, in Scotland it is Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. In Wales, buyers pay Land Transaction Tax. The Conservatives have announced that if they're elected, foreigners buying property in the UK will be forced to pay 3% more in stamp duty than UK residents. The Lib Dems have also promised a surcharge on overseas buyers, but have not specified the amount. The Green Party plans to scrap stamp duty, along with other property taxes including council tax and business rates, and replace them with a new Land Value Tax. Plaid Cymru, the SNP and Labour make no reference to stamp duty, or their equivalents, in their manifestos, although Labour proposes a levy on overseas companies buying housing. Labourwants to introduce a new annual levy on second homes,externalused as holiday homes in England ""to help deal with the homelessness crisis, so that those who have done well from the housing market pay a bit more to help those with no home"". The annual levy would be equivalent to 200% of the current council tax bill for the property. Labour estimates that this could currently raise up to Â£560m a year. The council tax database indicates that as of October 2018 there are just over 250,000 properties classed as second homes for council tax purposes in England. However, the Â£560m is calculated as revenue from second homes that are specifically only used as holiday homes, and not for other purposes such as employment. It sounds like an obvious solution but governments have often been wary of insisting on anything that would add to the costs of building new homes. A key priority - until now at least - has been affordability, and the price tag for even the simplest solar panel installation will be several thousand pounds. But as the costs of all types of renewable energy continue to fall, and if home buyers start demanding a greener option, it may well be that developers fit solar panels with or without government intervention.

PM refuses to confirm Andrew Neil interview,"This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson refuses to commit to Andrew Neil interview Boris Johnson has refused to say whether he will take part in a BBC interview with presenter Andrew Neil. The leaders of Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party have all agreed to be questioned for 30 minutes by the journalist. But when asked several times by the BBC's Ben Wright if he would appear, the prime minister would not confirm it, saying he would have ""all sorts of interviews with all sorts of people"". Labour accused him of ""running scared"". On Wednesday, the BBC Press Office tweeted it was ""in ongoing discussions"" with No 10, but said they had not ""yet been able to fix a date"" for the sit-down discussion between Mr Neil and the PM. Live: Latest from the election campaign trail BBC complains to Tories over Facebook advert Climate debate fact-checked Conservative leader Mr Johnson - who faced Andrew Neil during the Conservative leadership election in July - confirmed negotiations were still taking place, but he said it was ""not my job"" to make the final decision. He added: ""Other people than me are responsible for those discussions and negotiations, and I do not want to pre-empt what they may decide."" When it was put to Mr Johnson that his critics would say he was avoiding scrutiny, he replied: ""I'm very happy to submit to all manner of scrutiny, all manner of debates and have done so, and lots of conversations are happening about that matter right now."" SNP leader Nicola SturgeonandLabour leader Jeremy Corbyntook part in interviews with Mr Neil earlier this week. The BBC's interview with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is set to air on 4 December and another with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage will be shown on 5 December. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said of Mr Johnson: ""He's running scared because every time he is confronted with the impact of nine years of austerity, the-cost-of-living crisis and over his plans to sell out our NHS, the more he is exposed."" In a separate row, Channel 4 News has criticised Mr Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage for declining invitations to take part in a debate about climate change. Channel 4 replaced Boris Johnson with an ice sculpture The hour-long Emergency On Planet Earth debate features Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price and Green co-leader Sian Berry. The Conservatives offered cabinet minister Michael Gove instead of Mr Johnson - but Mr Gove was turned away from the Channel 4 News studios ahead of the debate. Channel 4 News editorBen de Pear tweeted,externalthat Mr Gove and Boris Johnson's father Stanley, who accompanied him, were ""lovely and charming but neither are the leader"". The broadcaster set up two ice sculptures alongside empty podiums, representing the absence of Mr Johnson and Nigel Farage. Mr de Pear said: ""These two ice sculptures represent the emergency on planet earth, not in any human form but are a visual metaphor for the Conservative and Brexit parties after their leaders declined our repeated invitations to attend tonight's vital climate debate."" And at the end of the debate, Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said: ""As we made clear from the start, this debate was for leaders only. ""And our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders."" Boris Johnson faced Andrew Neil during the Conservative leadership election Speaking in a Facebook Live video on the Conservative Party's page, Mr Gove claimed the other party leaders ""vetoed"" him from appearing on the programme. He said: ""I wanted to take part, but unfortunately [when] the editor of Channel 4 News... asked the other party leaders, they all said 'absolutely no'. ""They'd rather debate a block of ice."" The Conservative Party has written to broadcasting regulator Ofcom accusing Channel 4 of breaking its codes by depriving the Tories of any representation at the debate. The party calls the ""empty chairing"" of Mr Johnson - and his replacement with an ice sculpture - a ""provocative partisan stunt, which would itself constitute making a political opinion in its own right,"" something the Tory letter argues is against the broadcasting code. ""It is clear that denying the Conservative Party any opportunity to contribute to this cross-party event is unfair and breaches the requirements to 'preserve' impartiality and does not offer an 'appropriately wide range of significant views' to the public,"" the letter adds. It comes aftera Conservative source told BuzzFeed News,externalthat if the party wins the coming election it will reassess Channel 4's public service broadcasting licence, after Mr Johnson was replaced by the ice sculpture. In response to the BuzzFeed story, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it was ""deeply concerning"" for Mr Johnson to ""threaten Channel 4 in this way"". Labour says Mr Watson has written to Ofcom to urge the regulator to ""call out this meddling"". The Liberal Democrat's shadow foreign secretary Chuka Umunna said the alleged threat to Channel 4 was a ""pathetic attempt to cover up for Boris Johnson's own cowardice"", adding: ""Time and again Johnson has tried to duck scrutiny."" A live TV election debate featuring representatives from seven political parties takes place on BBC One and the BBC News Channel on Friday at 19:00 GMT. Senior figures from the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Greens, Plaid Cymru and the Brexit Party will take part in the event, chaired by Nick Robinson, in Cardiff.

Met Police defends stance on Epstein abuse claims,"A US woman who says she was forced to have sex with the Duke of York aged 17 has given her first UK television interview - on Monday's BBC Panorama. Virginia Giuffre, one of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's accusers, says both she and Prince Andrew ""know what happened"". The prince ""categorically"" denies having any sexual contact with her. Earlier the Met Police defended its decision not to probe a trafficking claim by Ms Giuffre against Epstein. The force said it stood by its conclusion that it was ""not the appropriate authority"" to investigate the American woman's claims. Ms Giuffre - then called Virginia Roberts - alleges she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew three times between 2001 - when she was 17 - and 2002, in London, New York and Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Buckingham Palace has described the allegations as ""false and without any foundation"". In aninterview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlisearlier this month, the prince said the alleged incidents ""never happened"". In a special hour-long Panorama,to be aired on BBC One on 2 Decemberbut recorded before the Newsnight interview, Ms Giuffre says: ""It was a really scary time in my life. ""He knows what happened, I know what happened. And there's only one of us telling the truth."" Letter casts doubt on when duke met Epstein Six things we learned from the duke's interview Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew - the Queen's third child - has been facing questions over his ties to Epstein, a US financierwho took his own lifein August awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. The prince has faced a growing backlash following an the Newsnight interview about his friendship with the US financier. He has stepped back from royal dutiesbecause the Epstein scandal has become a ""major disruption"" to the Royal Family. He later said he deeply sympathised with sex offender Epstein's victims and everyone who ""wants some form of closure"". Companies he has links with, such as BT and Barclays, have joined universities and charities in distancing themselves from him. In a statement, the prince said he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew says he has wracked his brains but cannot recall any incident involving Virginia Roberts. During his Newsnight interview, Prince Andrew said he could not recall ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said that on the night she claims they first met he had gone to Pizza Express in Woking and then returned home. He sought to cast doubt on her testimony claiming that he was ""profusely sweating"" in a nightclub, saying that a medical condition at the time meant he could not perspire. Ms Giuffre's latest comments form part of a longer investigation by Panorama into the Epstein scandal and the prince's links with the convicted child sex offender. During the programme, BBC reporter Darragh MacIntyre will also look at another of the prince's friends, Ghislaine Maxwell, investigating her alleged links to the Epstein scandal. Earlier on Thursday, the Metropolitan Police defended its decision not to investigate a claim of trafficking by Ms Giuffre. She says the force failed to check her allegation that she had been trafficked to London in 2001 by Epstein. Commander Alex Murray said that after taking legal advice, ""it was clear that any investigation into human trafficking would be largely focused on activities and relationships outside the UK"". The Met reviewed that decision after Epstein died in US custody earlier this year. Commander Murray said that ""our position remains unchanged"". Panorama: The Prince and the Epstein Scandal will air on Monday at 21:00 GMT, BBC One.

Violence during consensual sex 'normalised',"This video can not be played Anna says she has had her hair pulled, been slapped and had a man put his hands round her neck during sex Violence during consensual sex has become normalised, campaigners have warned. It comes after more than a third of UK women under the age of 40 have experienced unwanted slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during consensual sex, research for BBC Radio 5 Live suggests. Of the women who had experienced any of these acts, wanted or otherwise, 20% said they had been left upset or frightened. Anna, 23, says she has experienced unwanted acts of violence during consensual sex on three separate occasions, with different men. For her, it started with hair pulling and slapping. Then the man tried to put his hands around her neck. ""I was shocked,"" she said, ""I felt extremely uncomfortable and intimidated. If someone slapped or choked you on the street, it would be assault"". It wasn't until Anna spoke to her friends about it that she realised how common it was. ""From then on, pretty much all the guys would try at least one, if not multiple combinations, of these acts."" On another occasion, she says she was choked by a man during sex - without consent or warning. Anna, who graduated from university this year, also says she had a partner who handled her so forcefully, that she was left bruised and in pain for days. ""I know some women will say they like this. What is problematic is when men assume that every woman wants this."" Research company Savanta ComRes asked 2,002 UK women aged between 18 and 39 if they had experienced slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during consensual sex, and if it was ever unwanted. The sample was weighted to be representative of all UK women by age and region. More than a third (38%) had experienced these acts and said they were unwanted at least some of the time, while just under two-thirds of women had either experienced it and said it was never unwanted (31%), or they had no experience, didn't know or preferred not to say (31%). The Centre for Women's Justice told the BBC the figures showed the ""growing pressure on young women to consent to violent, dangerous and demeaning acts"". It said: ""This is likely to be due to the widespread availability, normalisation and use of extreme pornography."" Adina Claire, Acting Co-Chief Executive of Women's Aid, said it indicated ""how frequently sexual violence is being experienced by women under 40, with partners they consent to have sex with going on to humiliate or frighten them. ""Consenting to have sex with someone does not lessen the seriousness of slapping or choking someone."" 'Emma' is in her thirties and had just come out of a long-term relationship when she had a one-night stand. ""We ended up in bed and during sex - without warning - he started choking me. I was really shocked and felt terrified. I didn't say anything at the time because at the back of my head, I felt vulnerable, like this man could overpower me."" She also puts this down to the influence of pornography. ""It felt like this was stuff he had seen online and wanted to play out in real life."" The research also suggested that of those who had experienced slapping, choking, gagging or spitting during consensual sex, 42% felt pressured, coerced or forced into it. Steven Pope is a psychotherapist specialising in sex and relationships. He told 5 Live that he deals with the negative impact of the rise of acts of these kinds ""day in, day out"". ""It's a silent epidemic. People do it because they think it's the norm but it can be very harmful. What we see is that for many, it devalues the relationship but - at its worst - violence becomes acceptable."" He is concerned that those who engage in these acts are not aware of the risks. ""People come to me when they've had 'near misses'; when strangulation or 'choking out' has overstepped the mark, and they were unconscious for a long time. ""The thing with strangulation is that it's always high-risk, but that's literally the last thing people are thinking about."" Campaigner Fiona McKenzie described the survey findings as ""especially frightening"". ""I regularly hear from women who had been choked, slapped, spat on, verbally abused and punched by men they were having otherwise consensual sex with.  In many cases women weren't initially able to recognise this as the traumatic assault it is."" She set up a campaign group, We Can't Consent to This, after she noticed a rise in the number of cases where women had been killed during a so-called 'sex game gone wrong' - and where consent was used as a defence or mitigation. Anna said sex has become ""very male-centric... It has become so 'pornified', there isn't much in it for women."" And she said violence during sex has become normalised: ""They were just ordinary guys. There was nothing unifying about them, although I assume they are fairly frequent consumers of porn. They watch that and assume that's what women want, but they don't ask."" The research comes in the wake of recent cases that have heard defences of 'rough sex' - such as that of murdered British backpacker Grace Millane.

Hillsborough Disaster timeline,"Hillsborough remains the worst disaster in British sporting history On a sunny spring afternoon in 1989, a crush developed at the Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield resulting in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans attending the club's FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest. It remains the UK's worst sporting disaster. Since then, many families and survivors have led a 30-year campaign to discover how and why they died. Here are some of the key events. 15 April 1989:Fans gather at Sheffield Wednesday's football ground amid a ""carnival atmosphere"". The mood is described as ""boisterous"" but jovial. As kick-off approaches, a large crowd builds up outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles. Following an urgent request to relieve the pressure, match commander Ch Supt David Duckenfield gives the order to open an exit gate. Two thousand Liverpool fans enter via a tunnel on to already-packed terraces. A severe crush develops in the central pens and people are pulled out in a ""human cascade"". Ninety-six men, women and children lose their lives with hundreds more injured. The oldest victim was 67, the youngest just 10 years old. April 1989:As the disaster unfolds, Ch Supt Duckenfield tells key people that a gate was ""forced"" by Liverpool fans, a claim reinforced in briefings to media sources. The lie goes around the world, in TV and radio news bulletins. Newspapers take up the story pointing the finger at ""drunk and ticketless"" supporters. The Sun prints its now infamous front page alleging Liverpool fans had ""urinated on police officers"" and ""picked the pockets of the dead"". The tunnel leading to pens 3 and 4 was directly opposite the turnstiles January 1990:A judicial inquiry is held into the tragedy. Lord Justice Taylor's report concludes the failure to close off the tunnel was ""a blunder of the first magnitude"" and match commander David Duckenfield ""failed to take effective control"". His final report recommends a move to all-seater stadia, which leads to a ban on standing at football matches, eventually imposed on all clubs in the top two divisions in 1994. August 1990:The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) rules out bringing criminal charges against Sheffield Wednesday FC, Sheffield City Council and stadium safety engineers Eastwoods. It is a blow for the families who had hoped someone would be held accountable. March 1991:The original inquests into the deaths prove hugely controversial. Coroner Dr Stefan Popper rules out any evidence relating to fans' deaths beyond 3.15pm because, by this time, he said ""the damage was done"". This is ""strongly disputed"" by bereaved families. November 1991:David Duckenfield is medically retired from South Yorkshire Police on full pension, two years after being suspended from duty. A police doctor diagnoses him with ""severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder"". Donna Miller, with a picture of her brother, Paul Carlile, who was 19 when he died at Hillsborough March 1993:The 96th victim of the Hillsborough disaster, Tony Bland, dies after being left severely brain damaged in the crush. After nearly four years in a persistent vegetative state, life support is removed after a legal battle. He was 18 at the time of the tragedy but 22 when he died. December 1996:Hillsborough, a controversial drama-documentary by acclaimed Liverpool writer Jimmy McGovern, reveals new evidence claiming some of the 96 were still alive after 3.15pm. Researchers also track down Roger Houldsworth, the stadium's video technician, who said it should have been ""obvious"" to police that the pens were ""very, very full"" when gate C was opened. February 2000:In a bid to hold someone criminally responsible for the deaths of the 96, the Hillsborough Families Support Group begins a private prosecution. David Duckenfield and his deputy Bernard Murray are charged with manslaughter and misconduct in public office. The jury acquits Mr Murray and, after they fail to reach a verdict on Mr Duckenfield, the judge imposes a ""stay of prosecution"" saying he should not face a retrial. April 2009:At the 20th Hillsborough memorial event at Anfield, fans heckle the then Culture Secretary Andy Burnham demanding ""justice for the 96"". Their anger prompts the MP, an Everton fan from Merseyside who is now mayor of Greater Manchester, to join calls for any information held by public bodies on Hillsborough to be made released. A 140,000-signature petition forces a Commons debate leading to the full disclosure of 300,000 documents. A memorial at Anfield remembers the 96 fans who died January 2010:The Hillsborough Independent Panel (HIP) is appointed to review previously unseen evidence. September 2012:After sitting for two years, the HIP publishes a damning report into the tragedy. It is highly critical of the emergency response by a number of organisations and blames senior officers for opening exit gates without thinking about what would happen. September 2012:Former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie offers ""profuse apologies to the people of Liverpool"" for blaming fans for the Hillsborough tragedy. He says ""I published in good faith and I am sorry that it was so wrong."" Trevor Hicks, of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, says it was ""too little, too late"". December 2012:The High Court quashes the original inquest verdicts that had stood for more than 20 years. Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge also orders new inquests after the HIP report said 41 of those who died might have been saved. Then home secretary Theresa May announces a new police inquiry into the disaster. April 2013:The families' joy at the quashing of the original inquest verdicts is tempered by the death of campaigner Anne Williams from cancer at the age of 60. She never believed her son Kevin, and 94 others, were dead by 3.15pm on the day of the disaster and led calls to have verdicts overturned. March 2014:The new Hillsborough inquests open in Warrington and last for two years - the longest inquests in UK legal history. March 2015:After six days of questioning, David Duckenfield admits his failure to close a tunnel before opening gate C ""was the direct cause of the deaths of 96 people"". Under pressure, he ""froze"" and failed to consider the consequences of admitting thousands of fans on to already-packed terraces, he told the jury. David Duckenfield gave evidence to the fresh Hillsborough inquests in 2015 April 2016:Hillsborough Inquests conclude the 96 who died in the 1989 disaster were unlawfully killed. Jurors agree fans played no part in the deaths and instead blame police failures, stadium design faults, and a delayed response by the ambulance service. Families celebrate as they emerge from court. June 2017:The Crown Prosecution Service announces David Duckenfield is to be charged with manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 people. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. June 2017:Five other men also face charges: Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell is charged with safety offences; former South Yorkshire Police (SYP) chief inspector Sir Norman Bettison is charged with four counts of misconduct in public office; former SYP solicitor Peter Metcalf and former SYP officers Donald Denton and Alan Foster are charged with perverting the course of justice. June 2018:An order imposed in 2000 preventing Mr Duckenfield from being tried on charges relating to Hillsborough is lifted. August 2018:All charges against Sir Norman Bettison, who was accused of trying to blame Liverpool fans for the disaster, are dropped because of insufficient evidence. January 2019:The first Hillsborough trial begins at Preston Crown Court. Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. Graham Mackrell denies two health and safety offences, one of which is later dropped due to lack of evidence. April 2019:The jury fails to return a verdict on the manslaughter charge against Mr Duckenfield. Prosecutors say they will seek a retrial. Jurors did find Mackrell guilty by majority on a health and safety charge relating to the adequate provision of turnstiles on the day. November 2019:After a six-week trial at Preston Crown Court, David Duckenfield is found not guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans. April 2021:Trial of retired Ch Supt Donald Denton, retired Det Ch Insp Alan Foster and former South Yorkshire Police solicitor Peter Metcalf accused of altering police statements after the disaster opens at the Nightingale Court at the Lowry Theatre, Salford. May 2021:Mr Denton, Mr Foster and Mr Metcalf are acquitted of perverting the course of justice. Mr Justice William Davis ruled they had no case to answer. July 2021:Andrew Devine, who suffered life-changing injuries in the crush, dies at the age of 55. A coroner rules later that month that he had been unlawfully killed.

How 'the stars aligned' for a Pussycat Dolls reunion,"L-R: Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta, Nicole Scherzinger, Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar The Pussycat Dolls reunion was supposed to be top secret. Rumours had been swirling for several months, but journalists were under instruction not to confirm anything ahead of the group's surprise reunion performance on X Factor: Celebrity this weekend. Louis Walsh, however, may have missed the memo. ""You know who's coming on? The Pussycat Dolls are the special guests!""he told Lorraine Kelly,externalduring a live TV interview on Monday. ""There's an exclusive for you. They're back together."" The pussycat was firmly out of the bag. ""Half the time, Louis doesn't even know what he's talking about, so I was just surprised he got that one right,"" laughs his co-judge Nicole Scherzinger, lead singer of the Dolls. ""You could see in his face though,"" adds Carmit Bachar. ""After he said it, he was like 'did I just drop the ball?'"" It's now beenofficiallyannounced that Nicole and Carmit, along with Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Jessica Sutta, are all set to return for nine live UK shows in April 2020. ""It's been a few years in the making,"" explains Kimberly. ""But I think ultimately there's some unfinished business with the Pussycat Dolls. The Pussycat Dolls had UK number one hits with Stickwitu and Don't Cha ""We're ready to get out there and do what we love. And the stars aligned. We've all been busy making babies and all those kinds of things,"" she adds (before Nicole interjects: ""Speak for yourself!""). The Dolls broke up relatively early, in 2010, having released just two albums. And it's not as if their star was fading at the time they split. They'd scored number one hits in the UK with Stickwitu and Don't Cha, while Jai Ho, Beep, Buttonz and When I Grow Up all hit the top 10 over their five years together. Nonetheless, the group splintered off for various solo projects, but all have kept strong links with the UK. Kimberly now lives in London with her British husband. Ashley appeared on Strictly and I'm A Celebrity and now presents on Heart radio. Nicole has performed in the West End, judged on X Factor and topped the UK singles chart with one of her solo hits, Don't Hold Your Breath. ""LA was our home, but the UK was our second home because the British just scooped us up,"" says Ashley. ""So our lives ended up here as well, some of us, so the fans have just been holding on strong with wanting this reunion and our biggest fanbase is over here."" One member - Melody Thornton - is notably absent from the reunion,amid suggestions,externalthat she was requesting a larger share of the singing parts. Nicole sang 95% of the group's vocals across their first two albums,by her own admission,external. Melody Thornton is not taking part in the reunion Speaking to VH1's Behind The Music in 2012, producer Ron Fair confirmed: ""Melody sang a bit here and there but the records were Nicole, with the exception of an occasional ad lib. They were Nicole."" As a result, Melody has often spoken about feeling under-used as a singer during her time with the group. ""They said, 'we're going to have Nicole do all of the recording, you're going to have to learn to dance with the rest of the girls',""Melody explained earlier this year,externalwhen she was in the UK for Dancing on Ice. ""And for me it really affected my confidence because I wasn't using my best asset [my voice]. And I was the weakest dancer."" Explaining her absence from the reunion tour, Ashley says: ""Mel's got a lot of projects going on in life. ""She was included in all of this, she's our sister, the door is always open, but it just wasn't the right timing for her right now. We wish her well."" The Dolls avoid the question of whether the vocals will be divided up more evenly this time around - which, to be fair, could just be down to the fact they haven't started rehearsals yet. But Nicole says: ""This is a tour that we've never created, so we're really excited. Everybody brings their own unique gifts to the table. The other Dolls were quite literally kept in the shadows during some early performances ""We're just going to push each other, we want to see each other shine, we're going to push the boundaries together as a group with each other, so everybody is going to have their own time to shine."" She breezes past any suggestion that there is disharmony within the group. ""We're not famous for that are we? We get along, it's a sisterhood, we love each other, we have the best chemistry,"" she says. ""We feed off each other, and if we ever have an issue, we've always been open about communication and talking it through. ""Naturally, when you're so close, there may be some disagreements, some arguments. But that's the beauty, what makes you stronger. We've evolved so much. Like, bye drama! We want this to be really enjoyable for us."" The Dolls were known for their suggestive outfits and dancing, which occasionally landed them in trouble. A company who booked them for a gig in Malaysia in 2006was fined after authorities objected to their sexually explicit dancing.,external Culturally, things have shifted a little since then. Lingerie brandVictoria's Secret announced last weekthey were dropping their annual fashion show amid criticism it was sexist and outdated. With that in mind, will the Dolls change any of their image or choreography? ""It's evolved, but we are the Pussycat Dolls and we stand together in having fun on stage and embracing our female bodies, whatever shape they may be in,"" says Ashley. Carmen Electra (centre) performing with the Pussycat Dolls in 2002 ""And I think that will continue, fashion has evolved and we get to have fun and play and getting dressed up is what the Dolls is about."" Nicole adds: ""We're excited about being fashion forward. We'll be taking a lot of inspiration from the runways. We really love what Dua [Lipa] has been doing with fashion, so it's going to be the best of both worlds. But danceable!"" The sexually suggestive image is a nod to the Dolls' roots as a burlesque dance troupe. The group, which was founded by Robin Antin in 1995, attracted a huge following in Hollywood, with stars like Britney Spears, Pink and Carmen Electra joining them on stage. Nicole was recruited after auditioning for talent show Popstars to sing the lead vocals, and chart success and headline world tours soon followed. This time around, the five-piece are keen to ensure they savour and enjoy the whole experience. ""It was such a whirlwind,"" Ashley recalls of their rise to fame. ""It was all just going, going, going, and it's hard to stay present within it and have gratitude for that present moment. Ashley Roberts was paired with Pasha Kovalev on last year's Strictly Come Dancing ""But I think with us maturing over the last 10 years and all the life experience that's happened, we can hopefully bring that in and stay within the moment and enjoy it."" The tour could potentially be the first of several new Dolls projects, according to Nicole. ""We're working on new music. But we're doing one thing at a time. We're together, we're focusing, we've got a massive performance [on X Factor] at the end of this week, which is huge for us, and then we're all focusing on the tour."" She adds how much of a relief it is to once again be surrounded by her bandmates after pursuing her own projects for so long. This year alone, Nicole has judged on The Masked Singer, Australia's Got Talent and X Factor: Celebrity. ""I feel blessed because I'm doing all these different shows, different continents, and these press days, it's so much more fun and way easier with the girls 'cause I'm like, 'we got this!'

"Supergirl star was 'in an abusive relationship'Melissa Benoist says she hopes speaking out will ""help prevent more stories"" like hers from happening.Newsbeat","Melissa Benoist said she hoped sharing her story would 'help prevent more' from happening Supergirl star Melissa Benoist has spoken out about being in an abusive relationship - saying at one point she had to learn to lock herself in a room. In a video on Instagram, the actress says she ""never thought"" she'd be sharing a story like this. She then gives details of how the ""violence escalated"" and how she ""had to get out"". ""I hope telling my story might help prevent more stories like mine happening,"" she says. WARNING: This article contains details which some people may find upsetting Inthe video,external, which is captioned Life Isn't Always What It Seems, the actress never names the alleged perpetrator or suggests when the relationship took place or how long it lasted. Melissa says ""the abuse was not violent at first"" but was more manipulative. ""Work in general was a touchy subject,"" she says. ""He didn't want me ever kissing or even having flirtatious scenes with men..."" She says she turned down auditions and job offers because she ""didn't want to hurt him"" and now sees that behaviour as a ""red flag"" for what was to come. The actress has played Kara Danvers in the Supergirl series since 2015 The 31-year-old says the violence started with ""a smoothie being thrown in my face"" before escalating to the point where she was ""pinned down, slapped and repeatedly punched"". ""I learned to lock myself in rooms but quickly stopped because the door was inevitably broken down,"" she says. In the video, she says her ""most vivid memories"" are arguments ending when ""a wave of guilt would wash over him"" and he'd ""carry me to an empty bath"" before crying and giving what she calls ""the typical abuser's apology speech"".

She closes the video by addressing anyone who might be going through something similar. ""What I went through caused a tectonic shift in my outlook on life. I will be healing from this for the rest of my life. And that's OK. ""If you are enduring what I went through and you see this... at least you might begin to think of your freedom. ""You can and deserve to live a violence-free life."" Since the video was released, hundreds of people have responded to the post and the hashtag #IStandWithMelissa was trending on Twitter.

Breaking|Breaking newsHillsborough chief Duckenfield cleared of manslaughterHillsborough match commander David Duckenfield not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans,"David Duckenfield was in charge of policing the 1989 FA Cup semi-final Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield has been found not guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. The former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent, 75, was in charge of the FA Cup semi-final in which 96 fans were fatally injured. Men, women and children were crushed on the Leppings Lane terrace. Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, was cleared after a seven-week retrial at Preston Crown Court. Due to the law at the time, there can be no prosecution over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland. This is because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. The jury at Mr Duckenfield's original trial earlier this year failed to agree a verdict. There were gasps in court as the seven women and three men on the jury returned the verdict, following 13 hours and 43 minutes of discussions. This video can not be played Margaret Aspinall reacts to Mr Duckenfield's trial verdict Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James was among those who died, said: ""The question I'd like to ask all of you and people within the system is who put 96 people in their graves, who is accountable?"" A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the verdict did not affect the findings of the Hillsborough inquests, which ruled the victims had been unlawfully killed. This video can not be played The Hillsborough match commander apologised to the families Christine Burke, whose father Henry Burke was killed in the disaster, stood in the public gallery and addressed the judge after the verdict was read out. ""With all due respect, my lord, 96 people were found unlawfully killed to a criminal standard,"" she said. ""I would like to know who is responsible for my father's death because someone is."" Reaction as David Duckenfield is cleared of manslaughter Timeline of the 1989 stadium disaster Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, died in the disaster, said: ""I'm shocked and stunned by the verdict of the jury. ""We, the families, have fought for 30 years valiantly."" Mr Duckenfield's defence counselargued the case against him was ""deeply unfair"". Benjamin Myers QC told the jury his client had become ""the focus of blame"". ""We say that is unfair, there are so many other people at fault, and so many causes,"" the barrister added. The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster The prosecution alleged Mr Duckenfield had a ""personal responsibility"" for what happened at the match. The court heard he had ordered the opening of exit gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 14:52 BST on 15 April 1989 - eight minutes before kick-off, after the area outside the turnstiles became dangerously overcrowded. More than 2,000 fans then entered through exit gate C, with many heading for the tunnel ahead of them, which led to the central pens of the terrace where the crush happened. Paul Robinson, whose brother Steven was killed in the stadium crush, said: ""As a family we would like to thank all those who have supported us over the years in our quest for justice and accountability. ""We firmly believe that we have done everything in our power to do right by our Steven and we walk away from this case with our dignity and our heads held high."" The crush developed in the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough stadium Mr Duckenfield's wife, Ann, went over to comfort her husband in the courtroom after the verdict was read out. The former match commander's solicitor, Ian Lewis, said: ""David is of course relieved that the jury has found him not guilty, however his thoughts and sympathies remain with the families of those who lost their loved ones. ""He understands the public interest in this case, but would ask that his privacy and that of his family is respected, and will not be commenting further."" Clive Coleman, BBC legal affairs correspondent For a person to be found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter the prosecution has to prove that he - or she - owed a duty of care to the victim and negligently breached it. It also must be proved that it could be foreseen the breach would give rise to an obvious risk of death, that it caused the death and - most challenging of all - that the circumstances of the breach were so reprehensible as to justify the conclusion that it amounted to gross negligence and required criminal sanction. That sets the bar very high for the prosecution. The defendant's conduct must fall so far below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent and careful person in the defendant's position, that it was something truly, exceptionally bad. The CPS spokeswoman said: ""The disaster at Hillsborough 30 years ago has caused unimaginable suffering to the families of those who sadly lost their lives and to everybody affected by the tragic events of that day."" ""It is important to remember that criminal proceedings have a very different purpose to an inquest."" Liverpool FC said it shared ""the reactions and frustrations by the families today and those affected by the Hillsborough tragedy"". ""The journey that reached today's stage, and will continue, is testament to the perseverance and determination of all involved in the ongoing campaign for justice,"" the club said. ""We have immense admiration for the Hillsborough families, survivors and campaigners for what they have achieved and our thoughts remain with them and those 96 Liverpool supporters who went to watch their team and never came home."" David Duckenfield pictured in 1989, a month after the Hillsborough disaster Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, who was in overall command of Operation Resolve - the criminal inquiry into the disaster, acknowledged the jury ""had a difficult and challenging task"". ""It is right that an impartial and thorough investigation was carried out, and it is right that a jury was asked to make a judgement of the facts. What is wrong is that it has taken 30 years to get to this point. ""Thirty years means myths took root about fans being a cause of the disaster, now unequivocally shown by both defence and prosecution evidence to be wrong. And 30 years means many people, especially families, have had to constantly relive their terrible experience."" Ninety-six people were fatally injured in the 1989 disaster Relatives and friends of the victims were gathered at the Cunard Building on Liverpool's waterfront when the verdict was announced. Ms Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, thanked those who had supported the families over the past 31 years. ""I am really angry but I am trying be calm for these families who have suffered,"" she said. Judith Moritz, BBC North of England correspondent The acquittal of David Duckenfield is the latest twist in the history of a disaster which has lasted 30 years. For all that time, the families of those who died, and the survivors of the crush, have campaigned for justice and accountability. Mr Duckenfield did not dispute that he ordered the opening of a gate at Hillsborough to let fans in, or that he failed to close the tunnel to the terraces which were already full. In 2015 at the Hillsborough Inquests he accepted that this was the direct cause of the 96 deaths. But an inquest is not a criminal court, and so it was for another jury to decide whether Mr Duckenfield's mistakes amounted to gross negligence manslaughter. The crown's case was that the Chief Superintendent's failings were so extraordinary that they met that test. But the jury accepted the defence case that the 75-year-old was a target of blame who was unfairly singled out for prosecution. He will now be able to resume his life in retirement on the south coast. But the Hillsborough families and survivors will find the outcome hard to takeâ¦ and will ask hard questions about the Â£65m spent on a criminal investigation which has ended with no one convicted for so many lives lost.

How do election spending plans compare?,"TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has been focusing on the spending pledgesfrom the Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats' manifestos. Even before the general election was called, the government had already set out plans for day-to-day public spending to rise by Â£34bn a year by 2024. So how much more do the parties intend to spend on top of these existing plans? Compared to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative Party has set out the most modest plans for spending, by some distance. On top of existing government plans, the Conservatives are offering only an additional Â£2.9bn a year on day-to-day spending by 2024. Day-to-day spending is money that goes on wages and raw materials, like the cost of medicines and teachers' salaries. The single most expensive manifesto policy, coming in at Â£900m a year by 2024, is a planto increase the number of NHS nurses in England by 50,000.Out of this figure, the Conservatives say that 18,500 can be found by using policies to ensure fewer nurses leave the NHS. Day-to-day NHS spending in England would, under the Conservatives, increase by an average of 3.2% per year between now and 2024, the  IFS says. This is based on existing government plans to increase NHS spending by Â£20.5bn a year by 2024 (once adjusted for inflation). This particular spending commitment was announced before the election was called - so it is not costed in the manifesto. The IFS says the Conservatives' overall Â£2.9bn additional spending pledgewould leave spending on public services, apart from health, about 15% lower than it was at the start of the 2010s,,externalonce adjusted for inflation. As well as day-to-day spending, there is also spending on investment. This is money that goes on long-term things, like roads, bridges, school buildings and equipment. The Conservatives want an extra Â£8.1bn of investment spending, on top of current plans, by 2024. According to the IFS, this would be 15% higher than the Â£53.8bn pencilled in at the time of the last Budget. If delivered, it would be worth 2.4% of national income, higher than has been sustained at any point in the last 40 years. However, this is still smaller than the Labour and Lib Dems' proposals. Overall, the Conservatives are not intending to spend much more than what they have previously set out in government. But they argue that their spending plans are responsible and fully-costed. The Conservatives' plans will not change the overall tax take much: there will be modest reductions in National Insurance for individuals, but corporation tax cuts have been postponed. What is in the Conservative manifesto? Tory manifesto a 'steady as she goes' document The Labour Party has the most ambitious spending plan by far. By 2024, it would spend an additional Â£98bn a year on day-to-day expenditure, according to IFS analysis. Social care is the most expensive single Labour pledge, with Â£10.8bn being spent per year by 2024 to provide free personal care for over-65s in England. Another big ticket item is the cost of abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants, coming in at a net cost of Â£7.2bn by 2024. Since the publication of its manifesto, Labour has also announced a compensation package to women who lost out to changes in the state pension. Labourhas said its promise may cost Â£58bn- a figure which the IFS has since factored into its analysis, on the basis it is paid over four years. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC the compensation pledge ""drives a coach and horses"" through Labour's manifesto pledge to achieve a current budget surplus. That is when the amount of government revenue coming in matches the amount going on day-to-day spending. Why should we trust the IFS? Labour wants to increase spending on NHS England by an average of 3.8% a year, which is more generous than the Conservative Party. Labour would also double the level of spending on free childcare, the IFS says. According to the IFS analysis, Labour would also increase investment spending by Â£55bn a year, doubling current levels and substantially more than the Conservatives' offering. This includes the party's nationalisation plans on areas such as broadband. If Labour's plans are realised, overall spending would rise to a peacetime high. However, there is a question over whether such large sums of public sector spending could be ramped up so quickly. For example, are there enough people available to immediately start working on new investment projects? Labour plans the largest tax increases of all three parties. They are aimed at corporations and the wealthiest, although there has been debate about whether the burden will hit more than just the top 5% of earners. What is in the Labour manifesto? Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan The Liberal Democrats have focused on childcare as their main area of spending. According to their own costings, they plan to spend an extra Â£13bn to provide free childcare in England by 2024. This would be more than four-and-a-half times higher than current plans. Overall, the party plans to spend an additional Â£37bn on day-to-day expenditure by 2024 - more than the Conservatives, but less than Labour. The Liberal Democrats have proposed an average increase of 3.7% a year on day-to-day NHS spending in England - similar to Labour's pledge and more than the Conservatives. Like the other two parties, the Lib Dems have also pledged a big increase in investment spending - an extra Â£26bn a year. Again, this places the party in-between the Conservative and Labour offerings. The Liberal Democrats will raise money by taxing income, frequent flyers and corporations. They say the rest of the cost will be met from the financial benefits of cancelling Brexit. Compared with Labour and the Conservatives plans, the IFS say the Lib Dems are the only party which would ""put debt on a decisively downward path"". What is in the Liberal Democrats manifesto? Why did the Lib Dems go tough on spending? SNP key policies Brexit Party key policies Green Party manifesto key points Plaid Cymru manifesto key points Tory and Labour spending plans 'not credible' - IFS IFS: 'The choice could not be clearer' for voters.

"EU net migration to UK at lowest for 16 yearsFewer people came to the UK from the EU to work and a record number returned home, the ONS says.UKComments","EU net migration to the UK has fallen to its lowest level for 16 years, ONS figures show. The difference between how many people from the EU came to the UK for at least 12 months and how many left dropped to 48,000 - the lowest level since 2003. The ONS says this was down to fewer people coming to Britain for work, while a record high returned home. In the year to June, overall net migration from both EU and non-EU countries was 212,000. The number of people arriving from the EU now stands at its lowest level since the year ending March 2013, according tothe figures published by the Office for National Statistics,external. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said there had also been a steady rise in the number of EU citizens returning home - 151,000 emigrated in the past 12 months, double the number six years ago and the highest figure on record. EU net migration previously hit peak levels of more than 200,000 in 2015 and early 2016. Meanwhile, net migration from outside the EU has gradually increased for the past six years as more non-EU citizens came to the UK to study, the ONS says. Migration Watch UK's chairman Alp Mehmet said it was ""hardly surprising"" that EU net migration had fallen due to Brexit uncertainty. However, Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, suggested other reasons could also be behind the fall. She said: ""The reasons for this will include things like the lower value of the pound making the UK less attractive, improving economic prospects in EU countries of origin, and potentially the political uncertainty of the prolonged Brexit process."" Immigration figures were reclassified as ""experimental"" earlier this year after officials said there was ""significant uncertainty"" about the reliability of recent data. Since 2016, there has been a decrease in immigration for work while people coming to the UK for study has gradually increased, the report adds. It says the fall in immigration for work has mainly been because of a decrease in EU citizens coming to the UK looking for work, particularly those from eight of the countries which joined the EU in 2004, including Poland. The ONS estimated that about 229,000 more non-EU citizens moved to the UK than left in the year ending June 2019. This non-EU net migration has gradually increased since 2013 as immigration has risen and emigration for this group has remained ""broadly stable"". Is this the Brexit effect? EU immigration has fallen by 85,000 since the 'in-out' referendum in 2016 while EU emigration has increased by 56,000. It's a steep, clear trend that has taken EU net migration back to what it was before the expansion of the bloc in 2004. That was when people from 10 nations, including Poland, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania, were controversially given free movement rights to live and work in the UK. In some areas, the influx of migrants from this group of countries fuelled concerns about immigration, stoking a wider debate about control of Britain's borders and membership of the EU. It's ironic, therefore, that just as the UK stands on the brink of severing its ties with the European Union one of the key factors that persuaded people to vote leave may be - in numerical terms at least - diminishing as an issue. The ONS says the rise in non-EU immigration is mainly because of a gradual increase in those coming to the UK for formal study. A spokesman for the ONS said: ""Our best assessment using all data sources is that long-term immigration, emigration and net migration have remained broadly stable since the end of 2016. However, we have seen different patterns for EU and non-EU citizens. ""While there are still more EU citizens moving to the UK than leaving, EU net migration has fallen since 2016, driven by fewer EU arrivals for work. ""In contrast, non-EU net migration has gradually increased for the past six years, largely as more non-EU citizens came to study."" In response to the figures, business leaders said that ensuring firms had access ""to the people and skills they need"" was ""as important as forging our future trading relationship with the EU"". Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said ""shortages already exist at all skill levels"" and that future immigration policy should not only focus on the ""brightest and best"". ""To build new homes and schools, we don't just need architects and engineers, but bricklayers and plumbers too,"" he said.

DUP 'will still seek changes' to Brexit deal,"Arlene Foster say DUP votes could still be crucial to the next government The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) will seek further changes to Boris Johnson's Brexit deal, if he remains prime minister after the general election. Leader Arlene Foster said the number of DUP MPs elected would determine ""the shape and direction of this country"". The party, which won 10 seats in the 2017 general election, launched its manifesto in Belfast on Thursday. The DUP opposes elements of the Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland. A simple guide to the DUP Is the DUP affair over? At-a-glance: DUP manifesto It has been strongly critical of the revised plan because it would see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. Mr Johnson's agreement with the EU includes special arrangements for Northern Ireland, including a consent mechanism that would see the Northern Ireland Assembly given a simple majority vote on how the rules on customs arrangements in Northern Ireland would work after Brexit. The DUP argues that any vote on contentious matters should be done on a cross-community basis, with a majority of unionists and nationalists approving them rather than a straight majority. At Thursday's manifesto launch in Belfast, deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the deal would be dangerous ""to the economic and constitutional position of Northern Ireland"". Mrs Foster added that if Mr Johnson was returned as prime minister, the DUP would reiterate that unionism in Northern Ireland was united in its ""rejection"" of the deal, and would still seek to secure further changes to it. The DUP entered into a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative Party after the 2017 Westminster election, after Theresa May lost her majority. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson sign the confidence and supply agreement in June 2017 Mrs Foster said the DUP would not support a government led by Jeremy Corbyn if the upcoming election resulted in a hung parliament - in which no one party would have enough seats to form a government by itself. She said: ""The outcome of this election across the UK is still uncertain. ""As we have proved over the past two years our votes may still be crucial. ""The DUP is committed to a deal that works for the whole of the UK and which does not leave Northern Ireland behind, with no border in the Irish Sea."" Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to ""protect"" Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom and that its MPs would continue to vote against legislation and policies that would damage unionism and destabilise politics across the UK. ""I believe strongly and so do others in the Commons that after this [Brexit] is done, there should be a full proper inquiry set up at a high level into what went wrong with the British government's negotiations, how could we have such a catastrophic conduct in negotiations for one of the most important issues of our time?"" he said. Some of the party's key manifesto pledges include: Opposing the current Brexit deal and securing one that works for the whole United Kingdom Protecting and strengthening the union of the United Kingdom Restoring the Stormont assembly Abolishing the television licence fee but restore free licences for over-75s as long as it remains Supporting the pursuit of a strong interconnection energy strategy including with Iceland The party also insisted it wants to see devolution in Northern Ireland restored as soon as possible, and that it would be involved in any future negotiations regarding the future of power-sharing. The assembly collapsed in January 2017, after a green energy financial scandal that caused a split between the DUP and its then power-sharing partner Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP is running in 17 constituencies in next month's election, standing aside in Fermanagh and South Tyrone to allow the Ulster Unionists to run unopposed against non-unionist political parties.

Breaking|Breaking newsHillsborough chief cleared of manslaughterHillsborough match commander David Duckenfield not guilty of gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans,"David Duckenfield was in charge of policing the 1989 FA Cup semi-final Hillsborough match commander David Duckenfield has been found not guilty of the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. The former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent, 75, was in charge of the FA Cup semi-final in which 96 fans were fatally injured. Men, women and children were crushed on the Leppings Lane terrace. Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, was cleared after a seven-week retrial at Preston Crown Court. Due to the law at the time, there can be no prosecution over the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland. This is because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. The jury at Mr Duckenfield's original trial earlier this year failed to agree a verdict. There were gasps in court as the seven women and three men on the jury returned the verdict, following 13 hours and 43 minutes of discussions. This video can not be played Margaret Aspinall reacts to Mr Duckenfield's trial verdict Margaret Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son James was among those who died, said: ""The question I'd like to ask all of you and people within the system is who put 96 people in their graves, who is accountable?"" A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the verdict did not affect the findings of the Hillsborough inquests, which ruled the victims had been unlawfully killed. This video can not be played The Hillsborough match commander apologised to the families Christine Burke, whose father Henry Burke was killed in the disaster, stood in the public gallery and addressed the judge after the verdict was read out. ""With all due respect, my lord, 96 people were found unlawfully killed to a criminal standard,"" she said. ""I would like to know who is responsible for my father's death because someone is."" Reaction as David Duckenfield is cleared of manslaughter Timeline of the 1989 stadium disaster Barry Devonside, whose son Christopher, 18, died in the disaster, said: ""I'm shocked and stunned by the verdict of the jury. ""We, the families, have fought for 30 years valiantly."" Mr Duckenfield's defence counselargued the case against him was ""deeply unfair"". Benjamin Myers QC told the jury his client had become ""the focus of blame"". ""We say that is unfair, there are so many other people at fault, and so many causes,"" the barrister added. The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster The prosecution alleged Mr Duckenfield had a ""personal responsibility"" for what happened at the match. The court heard he had ordered the opening of exit gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at 14:52 BST on 15 April 1989 - eight minutes before kick-off, after the area outside the turnstiles became dangerously overcrowded. More than 2,000 fans then entered through exit gate C, with many heading for the tunnel ahead of them, which led to the central pens of the terrace where the crush happened. Paul Robinson, whose brother Steven was killed in the stadium crush, said: ""As a family we would like to thank all those who have supported us over the years in our quest for justice and accountability. ""We firmly believe that we have done everything in our power to do right by our Steven and we walk away from this case with our dignity and our heads held high."" The crush developed in the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough stadium Mr Duckenfield's wife, Ann, went over to comfort her husband in the courtroom after the verdict was read out. The former match commander's solicitor, Ian Lewis, said: ""David is of course relieved that the jury has found him not guilty, however his thoughts and sympathies remain with the families of those who lost their loved ones. ""He understands the public interest in this case, but would ask that his privacy and that of his family is respected, and will not be commenting further."" Clive Coleman, BBC legal affairs correspondent For a person to be found guilty of gross negligence manslaughter the prosecution has to prove that he - or she - owed a duty of care to the victim and negligently breached it. It also must be proved that it could be foreseen the breach would give rise to an obvious risk of death, that it caused the death and - most challenging of all - that the circumstances of the breach were so reprehensible as to justify the conclusion that it amounted to gross negligence and required criminal sanction. That sets the bar very high for the prosecution. The defendant's conduct must fall so far below the standard to be expected of a reasonably competent and careful person in the defendant's position, that it was something truly, exceptionally bad. The CPS spokeswoman said: ""The disaster at Hillsborough 30 years ago has caused unimaginable suffering to the families of those who sadly lost their lives and to everybody affected by the tragic events of that day."" ""It is important to remember that criminal proceedings have a very different purpose to an inquest."" Liverpool FC said it shared ""the reactions and frustrations by the families today and those affected by the Hillsborough tragedy"". ""The journey that reached today's stage, and will continue, is testament to the perseverance and determination of all involved in the ongoing campaign for justice,"" the club said. ""We have immense admiration for the Hillsborough families, survivors and campaigners for what they have achieved and our thoughts remain with them and those 96 Liverpool supporters who went to watch their team and never came home."" David Duckenfield pictured in 1989, a month after the Hillsborough disaster Assistant Commissioner Rob Beckley, who was in overall command of Operation Resolve - the criminal inquiry into the disaster, acknowledged the jury ""had a difficult and challenging task"". ""It is right that an impartial and thorough investigation was carried out, and it is right that a jury was asked to make a judgement of the facts. What is wrong is that it has taken 30 years to get to this point. ""Thirty years means myths took root about fans being a cause of the disaster, now unequivocally shown by both defence and prosecution evidence to be wrong. And 30 years means many people, especially families, have had to constantly relive their terrible experience."" Ninety-six people were fatally injured in the 1989 disaster Relatives and friends of the victims were gathered at the Cunard Building on Liverpool's waterfront when the verdict was announced. Ms Aspinall, chairwoman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, thanked those who had supported the families over the past 31 years. ""I am really angry but I am trying be calm for these families who have suffered,"" she said. Judith Moritz, BBC North of England correspondent The acquittal of David Duckenfield is the latest twist in the history of a disaster which has lasted 30 years. For all that time, the families of those who died, and the survivors of the crush, have campaigned for justice and accountability. Mr Duckenfield did not dispute that he ordered the opening of a gate at Hillsborough to let fans in, or that he failed to close the tunnel to the terraces which were already full. In 2015 at the Hillsborough Inquests he accepted that this was the direct cause of the 96 deaths. But an inquest is not a criminal court, and so it was for another jury to decide whether Mr Duckenfield's mistakes amounted to gross negligence manslaughter. The crown's case was that the Chief Superintendent's failings were so extraordinary that they met that test. But the jury accepted the defence case that the 75-year-old was a target of blame who was unfairly singled out for prosecution. He will now be able to resume his life in retirement on the south coast. But the Hillsborough families and survivors will find the outcome hard to takeâ¦ and will ask hard questions about the Â£65m spent on a criminal investigation which has ended with no one convicted for so many lives lost.

Madonna cancels shows amid 'overwhelming pain',"The star's Madame X Tour sees her playing smaller, more intimate venues Madonna has cancelled three dates of her Madame X tour dates in Boston, saying she was experiencing ""overwhelming"" pain. ""Please forgive this unexpected turn of events,""she told fans on Facebook,external. ""Doing my show every night brings me so much joy and to cancel is a kind of punishment... But the pain I'm in right now is overwhelming, and I must rest and follow doctor's orders."" The star did not specify the cause of her injury. However, earlier this month, she told fans in San Francisco she was suffering from a ""torn ligament"" and ""a bad knee"". After her most recent tour date in Los Angeles, anInstagram video showed her,externaltaking ""my usual ice bath for multiple injuries"". In anearlier video,external, she displayed a painful bruise on her right thigh. The star said she was having a 5Â°C ice bath at three in the morning, after coming off stage Madonna is notoriously reluctant to cancel shows, abandoning only a handful of dates over the course of her 37-year career. When she was inducted to the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 2008, Justin Timberlake even recalled how the star had given him vitamin B12 injections to stop him succumbing to illness while she was working with him. ""She gave me a shot in my ass and looks at me and says, 'Nice top shelf,'"" he said ""That was one of the greatest days of my life."" However, the Boston shows are not the first setback on Madonna's Madame X Tour. She postponed the opening dates in New York in September due to production delays. Then, after several dates at the BAM Howard Gilman Opera House in New York, she had to call off a show due to injury. The opening night of her LA residency was also cancelled. Tour promoter Live Nation said the scrapped shows will not be rescheduled ""due to the tight scheduling through the balance of the year"". Refunds will be automatically issued to credit card holders. The Madame X tour, which sees Madonna trading sports arenas for intimate theatre venues, is due to come to the UK in January 2020, with a 15-night residency in the London Palladium.

How 'the stars aligned' for a Pussycat Dolls reunionThe group are reuniting for a string of UK live dates - but Melody isn't taking part.,"L-R: Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta, Nicole Scherzinger, Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar The Pussycat Dolls reunion was supposed to be top secret. Rumours had been swirling for several months, but journalists were under instruction not to confirm anything ahead of the group's surprise reunion performance on X Factor: Celebrity this weekend. Louis Walsh, however, may have missed the memo. ""You know who's coming on? The Pussycat Dolls are the special guests!""he told Lorraine Kelly,externalduring a live TV interview on Monday. ""There's an exclusive for you. They're back together."" The pussycat was firmly out of the bag. ""Half the time, Louis doesn't even know what he's talking about, so I was just surprised he got that one right,"" laughs his co-judge Nicole Scherzinger, lead singer of the Dolls. ""You could see in his face though,"" adds Carmit Bachar. ""After he said it, he was like 'did I just drop the ball?'"" It's now beenofficiallyannounced that Nicole and Carmit, along with Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Jessica Sutta, are all set to return for nine live UK shows in April 2020. ""It's been a few years in the making,"" explains Kimberly. ""But I think ultimately there's some unfinished business with the Pussycat Dolls. The Pussycat Dolls had UK number one hits with Stickwitu and Don't Cha ""We're ready to get out there and do what we love. And the stars aligned. We've all been busy making babies and all those kinds of things,"" she adds (before Nicole interjects: ""Speak for yourself!""). The Dolls broke up relatively early, in 2010, having released just two albums. And it's not as if their star was fading at the time they split. They'd scored number one hits in the UK with Stickwitu and Don't Cha, while Jai Ho, Beep, Buttonz and When I Grow Up all hit the top 10 over their five years together. Nonetheless, the group splintered off for various solo projects, but all have kept strong links with the UK. Kimberly now lives in London with her British husband. Ashley appeared on Strictly and I'm A Celebrity and now presents on Heart radio. Nicole has performed in the West End, judged on X Factor and topped the UK singles chart with one of her solo hits, Don't Hold Your Breath. ""LA was our home, but the UK was our second home because the British just scooped us up,"" says Ashley. ""So our lives ended up here as well, some of us, so the fans have just been holding on strong with wanting this reunion and our biggest fanbase is over here."" One member - Melody Thornton - is notably absent from the reunion,amid suggestions,externalthat she was requesting a larger share of the singing parts. Nicole sang 95% of the group's vocals across their first two albums,by her own admission,external. Melody Thornton is not taking part in the reunion Speaking to VH1's Behind The Music in 2012, producer Ron Fair confirmed: ""Melody sang a bit here and there but the records were Nicole, with the exception of an occasional ad lib. They were Nicole."" As a result, Melody has often spoken about feeling under-used as a singer during her time with the group. ""They said, 'we're going to have Nicole do all of the recording, you're going to have to learn to dance with the rest of the girls',""Melody explained earlier this year,externalwhen she was in the UK for Dancing on Ice. ""And for me it really affected my confidence because I wasn't using my best asset [my voice]. And I was the weakest dancer."" Explaining her absence from the reunion tour, Ashley says: ""Mel's got a lot of projects going on in life. ""She was included in all of this, she's our sister, the door is always open, but it just wasn't the right timing for her right now. We wish her well."" The Dolls avoid the question of whether the vocals will be divided up more evenly this time around - which, to be fair, could just be down to the fact they haven't started rehearsals yet. But Nicole says: ""This is a tour that we've never created, so we're really excited. Everybody brings their own unique gifts to the table. The other Dolls were quite literally kept in the shadows during some early performances ""We're just going to push each other, we want to see each other shine, we're going to push the boundaries together as a group with each other, so everybody is going to have their own time to shine."" She breezes past any suggestion that there is disharmony within the group. ""We're not famous for that are we? We get along, it's a sisterhood, we love each other, we have the best chemistry,"" she says. ""We feed off each other, and if we ever have an issue, we've always been open about communication and talking it through. ""Naturally, when you're so close, there may be some disagreements, some arguments. But that's the beauty, what makes you stronger. We've evolved so much. Like, bye drama! We want this to be really enjoyable for us."" The Dolls were known for their suggestive outfits and dancing, which occasionally landed them in trouble. A company who booked them for a gig in Malaysia in 2006was fined after authorities objected to their sexually explicit dancing.,external Culturally, things have shifted a little since then. Lingerie brandVictoria's Secret announced last weekthey were dropping their annual fashion show amid criticism it was sexist and outdated. With that in mind, will the Dolls change any of their image or choreography? ""It's evolved, but we are the Pussycat Dolls and we stand together in having fun on stage and embracing our female bodies, whatever shape they may be in,"" says Ashley. Carmen Electra (centre) performing with the Pussycat Dolls in 2002 ""And I think that will continue, fashion has evolved and we get to have fun and play and getting dressed up is what the Dolls is about."" Nicole adds: ""We're excited about being fashion forward. We'll be taking a lot of inspiration from the runways. We really love what Dua [Lipa] has been doing with fashion, so it's going to be the best of both worlds. But danceable!"" The sexually suggestive image is a nod to the Dolls' roots as a burlesque dance troupe. The group, which was founded by Robin Antin in 1995, attracted a huge following in Hollywood, with stars like Britney Spears, Pink and Carmen Electra joining them on stage. Nicole was recruited after auditioning for talent show Popstars to sing the lead vocals, and chart success and headline world tours soon followed. This time around, the five-piece are keen to ensure they savour and enjoy the whole experience. ""It was such a whirlwind,"" Ashley recalls of their rise to fame. ""It was all just going, going, going, and it's hard to stay present within it and have gratitude for that present moment. Ashley Roberts was paired with Pasha Kovalev on last year's Strictly Come Dancing ""But I think with us maturing over the last 10 years and all the life experience that's happened, we can hopefully bring that in and stay within the moment and enjoy it."" The tour could potentially be the first of several new Dolls projects, according to Nicole. ""We're working on new music. But we're doing one thing at a time. We're together, we're focusing, we've got a massive performance [on X Factor] at the end of this week, which is huge for us, and then we're all focusing on the tour."" She adds how much of a relief it is to once again be surrounded by her bandmates after pursuing her own projects for so long. This year alone, Nicole has judged on The Masked Singer, Australia's Got Talent and X Factor: Celebrity. ""I feel blessed because I'm doing all these different shows, different continents, and these press days, it's so much more fun and way easier with the girls 'cause I'm like, 'we got this!'

"Boys admit threatening women who refused to kissThree teenagers admit harassing two women, who were pelted with coins on a date in London.London","Melania Geymonat (right) and her date Chris needed hospital treatment Three teenage boys have admitted threatening two women who refused to kiss each other on a bus. Melania Geymonat, 28, and her date Christine Hannigan were pelted with coins on a Camden night bus on 30 May. The teenagers, aged 15, 16 and 17, had previously denied charges of harassment by using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. They admitted the public order offences ahead of a scheduled trial at Highbury Corner Youth Court. The 17-year-old will appear in court on Friday for a Newton hearing, to decide whether an aggravating factor of homophobia should be considered on sentencing. All three boys will be sentenced at the same court on 23 December. This video can not be played 'I was and still am angry at bus attack' Prosecutor Saira Khan said the teenagers each played different roles in the nine-minute incident. Ms Geymonat and Ms Hannigan were initially sitting alone on the top deck of the N31 bus when they were approached by the group of boys. The women were surrounded and sexual gestures were made by the teenagers. CCTV showed a fight breaking out on the bus, with both Ms Geymonat and Ms Hannigan being punched several times. The suspects also left with a phone and a bag. It was alleged the boys threw coins at the women, who were both taken to hospital for treatment to facial injuries. In addition to the public order offences, a 16-year-old boy also pleaded guilty to handling a stolen mobile phone while a 15-year-old boy admitted handling a stolen bank card. Judge Susan Williams said the abuse ""was quite clearly directed towards this couple because of who they are"". Transport for London's Mandy McGregor said after the hearing: ""This sickening incident was utterly unacceptable. Homophobic abuse is a hate crime and won't be tolerated on our network."" Police said charges were dropped against another 17-year-old boy. Speaking after the attack in May, Ms Hannigan told the BBC she was ""not scared to be visibly queer"". ""If anything, you should do it more,"" she added. Ms Geymonat, who is a qualified doctor but works for Ryanair as a flight attendant, said she agreed. Ms Hannigan said: ""I was and still am angry.

China rebukes US for backing Hong Kong protestersBeijing's warning comes after President Trump signed a bill in support of pro-democracy activists.,"This video can not be played Hong Kong protesters celebrate Thanksgiving China has warned the US it could take ""firm counter-measures"" if Washington continues to show support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The warning came after US President Donald Trump signed the Human Rights and Democracy Act into law. The act mandates an annual review, to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify special status with the US. Mr Trump is currently seeking a deal with China, in order to end a trade war between the two countries. ""The US has been disregarding facts and distorting truth,""a Chinese foreign ministry statement said.,external ""It openly backed violent criminals who rampantly smashed facilities, set fire, assaulted innocent civilians, trampled on the rule of law, and jeopardised social order."" The ministry threatened ""counter measures"" if the US continued ""going down the wrong path"". US-China trade war in 300 words Will the US law derail trade talks? Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Aftermath of Hong Kong university siege The new law requires Washington to monitor Beijing's actions in Hong Kong. The US could revoke the special trading status it has granted the territory if China undermines the city's rights and freedoms. Among other things, Hong Kong's special status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland. The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests. Analysts say the move could complicate negotiations between China and America to end their trade war. China's foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador to demand that Washington stops interfering in Chinese internal affairs. What happens when an ambassador is summoned Hong Kong's government also reacted, saying the American bill would send the wrong signal and would not help to ease the situation. But a key activist in the Hong Kong protest movement, Joshua Wong, said the US law was a ""remarkable achievement"" for ""all Hongkongers"". The bill was introduced in June in the early stages of the protests in Hong Kong, and wasoverwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives last month. Mr Trump said he signed it ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"". He had previously been non-committal, saying he was ""with"" Hong Kong but also that Mr Xi was ""an incredible guy"". However, the bill had widespread congressional support, which meant that even if he vetoed it, lawmakers could potentially have voted to overturn his decision. Anti-government protests have been held in Hong Kong since June The president also signed a second bill, which bans the export of crowd-control munitions to the police in Hong Kong - including tear gas, rubber bullets and stun guns. ""[The bills] are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences, leading to long-term peace and prosperity for all,"" Mr Trump said. The US move comes amid a lull in protests following a pro-democracy landslide in local elections. Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement. The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets. Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and attacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality. On Sunday,Hong Kong held local council electionsthat were seen as a barometer of public opinion towards the government and the protesters. The elections saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. On Thursday, authorities moved into the Polytechnic University days after it had beenthe site of a fierce standoffbetween student activists and riot police. The police said they had found hundreds of petrol bombs and other home-made devices, and were dusting them for fingerprints. A search found no remaining activists at the site but it is thought there could still be about a dozen people still hiding inside. Could a US Hong Kong rights law hurt trade talks?

"'Secret Santa' spreads village Christmas cheerThe gifts, which have been appearing over the past two weeks, are ""spreading the Christmas spirit"".Leicester","Mum Emma Aldous said her son Douglas has learnt about ""paying it forward"" A mysterious ""Secret Santa"" has been dotting presents around a village, leaving its residents delighted. People living in Kegworth, Leicestershire, have been discovering festive gifts - usually with a note that calls it ""random acts of kindness"" - in the last two weeks. One recipient, Katharine Deadman, found a wrapped Christmas pudding on a bench while walking with her dad and baby. The 26-year-old said it has ""definitely spread Christmas spirit"". Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Miss Deadman said: ""It was the best surprise to find on our walk and we'd never seen anything like it in the village. The gifts have described as ""random acts of kindness"" ""Even if I'd not liked the gift, the whole idea still would have made my day. It's so thoughtful and selfless, two things that are not easy to come by."" She plans to leave her own parcel somewhere nearer to Christmas Day. Katharine Deadman said the gift she found is ""great"" as she is the only one in her family who likes Christmas pudding Other presents found over the past two weeks in the parks and streets of the village, estimated population 3,500, include shortbread and chocolates. Lorrae Sunley found wrapped chocolates on a bench by the local chippy while out with her mum on her birthday. She told the BBC: ""I have no idea who the Secret Santa is but I think they've done something really nice and I think it's made a lot of people happy."" Lorrae Sunley found wrapped chocolates while out with her mum on her birthday 'Dystopian' Christmas decorations ridiculed 'At Christmas everyone should have something' 'My fight to help the homeless' Villagers have taken to the local Facebook page to share images of their finds. Mum Emma Aldous found a gift wrapped up on the school run with her four-year-old son Douglas. She said: ""He was so happy and excited. I have no idea who is leaving the gifts out, but just one tiny act of kindness made such a big difference to our day. ""My son now wants to wrap up one of his toys and leave it out for someone else to find. How lovely is that?"" The presents have been found throughout the village Dozens said it has ""brought joy"" or ""brightened their day"" - although some did feel November was a bit early to start gift giving. The identity of the ""Secret Santa"" is still unknown but the idea has started to spread via social media to other local communities.

The key policies in the Conservative manifesto,"The Conservative Party launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain's Potential. It sets out the policies the party aimed to introduce should it win the election, which it has now done by a huge majority. Thefull document,externalran to 59 pages. But what were the promises that the party hoped would grab the public's attention? Reintroduce maintenance grants for nursing students. At present, there are just under 300,000 full-time equivalent posts. The party hopes to train more nurses by reintroducing maintenance grants of between Â£5,000 and Â£8,000 a year for students. The scrapping of these grants in 2017 was controversial and was followed by a fall in applicants. So, it is something of a U-turn. However, the policy will not involve a return to the pre-2017 policy of free tuition for nursing students. The 50,000 figure is reached by including foreign recruitment and policies for better retention of nurses. Labour promised to recruit 24,000 nurses - based on higher numbers in training - and introduce free tuition fees and maintenance grants. Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales would benefit from the funding. 11 charts on why the NHS matters in this election Is the NHS the best health service possible? This video can not be played Boris Johnson launches the party's manifesto Get Brexit ""done"" early in 2020. In the least surprising promise in this manifesto, Boris Johnson made a personal guarantee that he would get Brexit ""done"" in January if he won a majority. He said that will end the political divisions in the country, but that seems unlikely. The Conservatives also promise to negotiate a trade deal with the EU next year, and confirm that they will not extend the post-Brexit transition period beyond December 2020. That is an incredibly short amount of time to finalise a trade deal of any significant ambition, and it means the EU knows in advance what the UK's negotiating deadlines are. The Conservatives say the UK will be outside the EU single market, and any form of customs union. But until we know the terms of a new relationship with the EU, it will be hard to argue that Brexit has really been done. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? A little bit more spending - and a bit more tax. There were no rabbits out of the hat, no huge tax cuts, or rises, and no big ticket new spending item. By design, the tax and spend numbers were smaller than those of the Liberal Democrats and, especially, Labour. They have space to do a lot more within the new borrowing rules. But Chancellor Sajid Javid and Prime Minister Boris Johnson want to keep a tight ship. There will be a little bit more spending and a bit more tax too. But it amounts to less than 1% of the size of the economy. The big picture is several billion a year of extra spending, but not several tens of billions. Keep the so-called triple lock on the state pension. Keeping the popular ""triple lock"" means the state pension will be increased by the CPI measure of inflation, wage growth or 2.5% each year - whichever is the highest. Critics say that keeping it in place is unaffordable and that it doesn't help the poorest and oldest pensioners who are on the old state pension. But tampering with it would have been politically radical - all of the major parties have committed to it in this election. The Conservatives have learned from past mistakes. Theresa May pledged to scrap the 2.5% guarantee in the 2017 election, and was forced to abandon the pledge to win support from the DUP. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. A cross-party consensus on care will be built. Boris Johnson promised tofix the crisis in adult social care, but the manifesto contains little more than the guiding principle that no-one will have to sell their home to pay for care. As things stand, few would call these details an ambitious plan, but the Conservatives' pledge to urgently build a cross-party consensus on future care will be welcomed. The system is already at breaking point, and experts warn the extra Â£1bn a year promised for the next five years won't be enough to prop it up. Not least, because the money will be shared with equally overstretched children's services. The Tory calculation appears to be that it is best to say as little as possible, rather than risk being tripped up by an issue that cost them dearly at the last election. Social care is devolved so this will only apply in England. Meet the pledge to cut emissions to virtually zero. Conservative climate policies will attract scrutiny. In June, they set aworld-leading goal of cutting emissions to virtually zero by 2050. And they've created a boom in cheap offshore wind energy. Butinterim emissions targets are already slipping away,external. What's more, some scientists are warning that the climate needs even more urgent repair. That led the Lib Dems and SNP to propose an earlier clean-up date of 2045. Labour says it should be by the 2030s. The Greens want 2030 - which would mean practically all petrol and diesel vehicles banned, all homes insulated and all central heating boilers changed within a decade. So, it's not just a question of the date - it's whether the policy can be delivered. Energy policy applies to the whole of the UK, as does policy relating to exports. What is a climate emergency? Where the UK's recycling really goes CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? Improve the energy efficiency of social housing. The UK's homes are so poorly insulated that to meet the country's 2050 climate commitments we need a nationwide programme to upgrade them. This pledge to spend Â£2,860 per household on improving the energy efficiency of social housing would affect 2.2m homes. But there's no mention of what would be done for those who own their own home. The claim that households could save up to Â£750 a year on their energy bills sounds optimistic and could only apply to homes with terrible energy efficiency. The typical saving after such work on housing, experts say, tends to be more like Â£50. The policy is dwarfed by Labour's promises of spending Â£9,300 per home on almost all of the 27 million homes in the UK, at a cost of Â£250bn. Housing is devolved so this will only apply to England. Fewer lower-skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. The last Conservative manifesto reiterated the leadership's intention to reduce net migration to less than 100,000. It became an albatross - a much-criticised target that was never achieved.  Boris Johnson had already jettisoned it in favour of an Australian style points-based system, attracting ""the brightest and the best"". The focus on control means that fewer lower skilled migrants will be allowed into the UK. But while the Conservatives can argue this will mean less pressure on public services, it is these services which often rely on migrant labour. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Reduce poverty through changes to tax and benefits. The Conservatives confirm they will continue the roll out of universal credit, despite the controversy that has dogged the new benefits system. As has already been announced they are ending the freeze on benefits, which will mean a 1.7% increase in the money people get next April. They also pledge to reduce the number of reassessments that people with disabilities face for their benefits, with a national strategy for disabled people promised by the end of 2020. There is a commitment to reduce poverty, including child poverty, through changes to tax and benefits. But there is little detail on how ongoing complaints about the failings of universal credit will be addressed. This policy applies to the whole of the UK. Help parents by making childcare available in the holidays. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are offering multi-billion pound, universal childcare policies for pre-school children. But for the Tories this is a much more strategic offer - aiming to create 250,000 extra childcare places during the holidays for primary school-age children - about 5% of that age group. It would cost Â£250m per year for three years, with Â£250m for one-off costs such as buildings. This recalls the era of former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, with its pre-austerity expansion of breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday clubs. Much of this will be delivered through schools, so it will depend on them being able to make their premises available over the summer holidays. Childcare is devolved so will only apply to England. Freeze of tuition fees at Â£9,250 likely to continue. For most degree students and their universities there is little in this manifesto. Simply a promise to look carefully at the ""thoughtful"" suggestions in the review into student finance and university and college funding, led by Philip Augar. In the short term, this suggests the current freeze of tuition fees in England at their current level of Â£9,250 will continue. That could eventually have the same effect as the cut proposed by the Augar panel because of inflation. Interest rates on student loans are to be reviewed again. On lifelong learning, the offer is more modest than both the Lib Dems training wallet and Labour's promise of six years of free adult learning. Instead the manifesto says the Conservatives would work towards a right to retrain. Tuition fees and education are devolved, so any policy changes will apply to England only. And there's Â£2bn to fill potholes. It's telling that top of the Tories' transport list is a promise to build a new rail line linking Manchester and Leeds. It's a long-held and well-founded grievance in the north of England that transport infrastructure is substandard compared with the south. But the project isn't expected to be complete before 2040. The more immediate infrastructure conundrum is High Speed 2 which is already under way. Given how much that project polarises opinion it wasn't a surprise when a Conservative government said it would make a decision after the election. And by singling-out funding of Â£2bn for potholes and a further Â£29bn for roads, the Conservatives are more at ease than the other main parties in reaffirming their commitment to the car as a predominant mode of transport. In truth, on transport there are no huge policy surprises. It will look into the constitutional power balance. The Supreme Court's ruling in September - that Boris Johnson's advice to the Queen to prorogue (suspend) Parliament was unlawful - was the latest and most dramatic example of judicial review. There is now almost no area of government decision-making that cannot be subject to scrutiny by judges. Some feel it has pulled the judiciary too far into areas of political decision-making. The Conservatives' proposed ""constitution, democracy and rights"" commission is intended to look afresh at the constitutional power balance between the three great institutions of state, the executive (government and crown), Parliament and the judiciary.

What are key Labour manifesto pledges?,"The Labour Party has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan It's Time For Real Change. It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 105 pages. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The party also wants to cut private provision in the NHS. The 4.3% per year rise is at the top end of what health think tanks and analysts have been calling for. Labour would also have to find money to cover revenue lost from its pledges to scrap prescription, basic dentistry and hospital car parking charges. A key section covers Labour's plan to cut private provision in the NHS, which currently accounts for about 7% of the health budget in England. This would clearly involve outsourced contracts, for example for physiotherapy and community health. But will NHS hospitals suddenly see their waiting lists balloon as a result of operations outsourced to private hospitals being brought back into the public sector? And are these pledges longer-term aspirations or shorter-term priorities? Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but the devolved nations would benefit from the funding. This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour will renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, and hold a referendum on the deal or Remain within six months The short section called ""The Final Say on Brexit"" only begins on page 89 of this manifesto. The other main UK-wide parties have simple slogans, but Labour's policy is more complicated and doesn't fit on a manifesto cover or the side of a bus. It promises to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on a new UK-EU customs union and close EU single market alignment. It would also give EU nationals living and working in the UK the automatic right to stay. That deal would then be put to a legally-binding referendum within six months, alongside the option to remain in the EU. Labour wants to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers and to give the people the final say. It would implement the referendum result immediately. But Mr Corbyn will not say how he would vote in it. And that continues to divert attention away from his other practical policies. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Update: On 22 November Jeremy Corbyn revealed that he would remain neutral if there was another referendum. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Will this be a Brexit election? It would boost anyone over the age of 25 earning the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage. The Conservatives had already announced the living wage would gradually increase to Â£10.50 over the next six years. Labour is now promising more and faster, with all workers over 16 years old getting Â£10 an hour within the next year. It is an attempt to tackle the growing issue of in-work poverty. It's cheaper than other policy announcements because employers, rather than government, mostly pay the wages, but it's a big jump for them to swallow in a very short timeframe. Labour is also promising extra measures to boost workers' rights, including longer maternity and paternity pay, and guaranteed bereavement pay. This would apply to the whole of the UK. How high could the lowest wages go? Is the minimum wage enough to live on? Pension age would remain at 66 while retirement ages for those in arduous and stressful jobs will be reviewed. Not long ago, government number-crunchers suggested workers under 30 may not receive a state pension until they turned 70. So Labour's plan to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future has been called a ""gargantuan promise"" by one analyst. It would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. Yet, it would clearly be popular among middle-age voters. For existing pensioners, the so-called triple-lock - linking annual state pension rises to the highest of average earnings, the cost of living, or 2.5% - would continue, as all the major parties have promised. There are also pitches to specific groups. The so-called Waspi women - born in the 1950s and furious with ""surprise"" pension age changes - are promised compensation. This would apply to the whole of the UK. The fight over women's pensions Why 70 may be the new 65 Provide ""community-based, person-centred"" support in England, including free personal care. Labour's plan for a comprehensive National Care Service is bold. The question will be whether their costings stand-up to scrutiny. That is not just about the affordability of the plan now, but also its cost as the population ages. At the heart of the policy is free personal care for older people who need help with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication. This system already operates in Scotland, but in England, the idea was rejected 20 years ago by the then-Labour government as too expensive. There are also promises to double the number of people receiving help, so easing NHS pressures. Plans to reform the care system have ended up as political footballs in past elections - the challenge for Labour will be building a consensus around their ideas. Health and social care is devolved. This would apply to England only. Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power? To put the UK on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s. The date for reducing carbon emissions to effectively zero is much sooner than the government envisages. It's not quite the neat formulation of ""net zero"" by 2030 that many party activists wanted (and the Green Party has promised). Instead, in one line, the document talks of achieving ""the substantial majority of our emissions reductions"" by 2030. In another, it mentions putting the UK ""on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s"". Presumably that creates enough stretch room to get to 2040 - five years earlier than the Lib Dems' target year and 10 years earlier than the Tories. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? The party will nationalise the so-called big six energy firms, National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, railways and the broadband arm of BT. Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two. Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate themselves will also face a huge change in the way they are supervised by government. The current inhabitants of company boardrooms are very aware life would be very different under a Labour government. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Start work on a new benefits system to replace controversial benefit. Labour's plan to scrap Universal Credit deals with its immediate concerns about the much-criticised benefit. However, the party does not say what it would replace it with. Universal Credit was originally introduced to tackle the complexity and unfairness of the existing benefits system. But many of the accompanying changes became linked to austerity measures like benefit caps. Going back to the system which Universal Credit replaced would create its own problems. And its introduction shows just how difficult it can be to devise a new system that works. Labour has said it will start work on ideas for a new system immediately, but getting that right is likely to take years. This would apply across the UK. There are also plans to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for the poorest students. The controversial policy of abolishing private schools, voted through at conference, is being parked for the moment. But there is a firm commitment to remove their charitable tax status. The big pledge, as in 2017, is the abolition of tuition fees. Universities will worry that the commitment to find public money to replace them could come under pressure if public finances tighten. Scrapping tuition fees will benefit the wealthiest students most. Maintenance grants would be restored for the poorest. The combined cost is estimated at Â£12bn a year. On school funding, Labour's promise goes further than the Conservatives and Lib Dems. By 2022-2023, spending would be Â£10.5bn higher in cash terms, which would reverse cuts (and then some) made since 2010. Education is devolved. This would apply to England only. Labour will also bring the railways back into public ownership. Labour says it will bring the railways back into public ownership when the current rail franchises expire. The party says that means there will be no cost to the government as the contracts will have ended. However, it is unclear who will then own the trains and the associated costs. The use of driver-only operated trains will also be stopped, having caused years of disruption because of industrial action by disgruntled staff. Industry estimates this would cost more than Â£200m a year. And the bus system will fall under council control again while thousands of routes that have been cut will be reinstated. Free bus travel is also promised for under-25s. The costs for this are not provided in the manifesto. Labour promises a Â£250bn green transformation fund; HS2 will be built and extended into Scotland and long-suffering train passengers in the north of England will get ""Crossrail for the North"". Transport is partly devolved. Free bus travel for under-25s would apply to England only, while infrastructure projects and renationalisation would apply across the UK. It will mean EU citizens in the UK no longer have to apply to continue living and working in the country. The settlement scheme was set up by the Conservative government to formalise the rights of EU citizens to continue living and working in the UK after Brexit. Ministers have claimed the system is working well with applications from around 2.45 million people so far. But that means almost one million EU nationals have yet to sign up, raising concerns that some who have difficulty proving they've been in Britain could be at risk of deportation. Labour's proposal would end the worry and uncertainty for EU citizens in Britain, but it could create problems for border staff after Brexit in distinguishing between those who've already been living in the UK and new arrivals who may have certain restrictions. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Start a rapid programme of homebuilding. Labour's promise to build 100,000 council homes and 50,000 housing association properties a year by the end of the five-year Parliament marks a rapid change. Building on this scale has not been seen for 40 years. The UK's population is getting older and one in five people has a disability, so the type of homes proposed will face close scrutiny.  There are also questions over the availability of construction workers to build them. More people have rented from private landlords than social ones since 2013. Many are aged under 35. For them, rent controls would aim to keep down costs by linking rent rises to inflation (the cost of living) and giving city authorities the power to be even stricter. This will reignite debate over their effectiveness. The plan for a new Department for Housing shows how central this area is to Labour's key policies. Housing is devolved so this policy would apply to England only.

UK house price growth 'low for a year',"Annual growth in UK house prices has been below 1% each month for the last year in a relatively stagnant market, a major mortgage lender has said. Prices rose 0.8% in the year to late November, the Nationwide said - a slight pick-up on the previous month. It said the housing market was being affected by wider economic uncertainty over weak global growth and Brexit. The average UK home costs Â£215,734, the building society said. The figures, which are based on the Nationwide's mortgage data, suggest that prices rose by 0.5% in November compared with the previous month. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""November's month-to-month gain in Nationwide's index was the biggest since July 2018, indicating that support from the recent fall in mortgage rates is starting to kick in."" Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender Octane Capital, said: ""The property market is hardly all guns-blazing but neither has it given up the ghost. ""Ultra-low borrowing rates and a deep-seated boredom around Brexit mean transaction levels continue to tick over. People have said enough is enough and are getting on with their lives, something that really shone through in November."" 'We live apart to save more money to buy a home' 'Freehold charges cost us our dream home' The Nationwide also said that election periods tended not to have a direct impact on the housing market. Broader economic conditions were more dominant over the decisions of buyer or sellers. ""Rightly or wrongly, for most home buyers, elections are not foremost in their minds while buying or selling their home,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.

Escalating Iraq protests leave 15 dead,"This video can not be played Watch protesters running away from the sound of rapid gunfire in Nasiriya Nearly 40 people have been killed in Iraq on one of the bloodiest days since anti-government protests began last month, medics and officials say. At least 25 people died when security forces opened fire to clear bridges in the southern city of Nasiriya. Another four protesters died in Baghdad and 10 more in the city of Najaf, where Iran's consulate was also burnt. Iraqis have been taking to the streets to demand more jobs, an end to corruption and better public services. The Iraq protests explained in 100 and 500 words Is a new Arab Spring unfolding in the Middle East? The Iraqi military has announced it is setting up military ""crisis cells"" to quell unrest. The military command said an emergency unit had been created to ""impose security and restore order"". At least 350 people have been killed and thousands wounded since the unrest began. The military had sent reinforcements to tackle unrest in Nasiriya, the birthplace of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and a hotspot for protests. Troops used live ammunition and tear gas to clear sit-ins on two bridges, medics and security sources reported, with protesters responding by torching a police station. Protesters near Ahrar Bridge in Baghdad, where at least four people died on Thursday Amnesty International's Middle East research director, Lynn Maalouf, said the scenes ""more closely resemble a war zone than city streets and bridges"", accusing security forces of ""appalling violence against largely peaceful protesters"". Agence France-Presse, quoting Iraqi state media, said Mr Abdul Mahdi had now sacked Gen Jamil Shummary, one of the commanders sent to restore order in Nasiriya. Late in the evening, Iraqi media reported that the governor of Dhi Qar, of which Nasiriya is the capital, had resigned. Live rounds were also fired at the strategic Ahrar Bridge in Baghdad, sources said, as protesters tried to cross towards the so-called Green Zone that hosts the country's parliament. As well as the four who died there, more than 20 people were wounded. Clashes broke out between protesters and police in the city on Thursday, leaving three demonstrators dead and 18 more wounded, medical sources said. Security forces were cracking down after protesters set fire overnight to the Iranian consulate in the city - the seat of Iraq's Shia religious authority and the location of the revered Imam Ali shrine, where the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad is buried. Protesters chanted ""Iran out of Iraq"" as flames engulfed the building. Reports say staff at the consulate managed to flee just before protesters broke in. Iran swiftly condemned the attack and said that the Iraqi government was responsible for protecting its consulate. Protesters chanted ""Iran out of Iraq"" as the consulate burned on Wednesday night This is the second attack on an Iranian consulate in Iraq this month after an office in the Shia holy city of Karbalawas targeted three weeks ago. Although Iraq's anti-government protests have been directed mainly at the country's political leaders, many of those taking part have also expressed anger at Iran's influence over Iraq's internal affairs, which has steadily grown since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. Protesters accuse Iran of complicity in what they see as Iraq's governance failure and corruption. Mr Abdul Mahdi took office just over a year ago, promising reforms that have not materialised. Young Iraqis angered by his failure to tackle high unemployment, endemic corruption and poor public services took to the streets of Baghdad for the first time at the beginning of October. This video can not be played Protester Safaa al Saray died after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister After the first wave of protests, which lasted six days and saw 149 civilians killed, Mr Abdul Mahdi promised to reshuffle his cabinet and cut the salaries of high-ranking officials, and also announced schemes to reduce youth unemployment.

Boys to be admitted to last all-girl state school,"Notre Dame High has always been a girls-only school The last state all-girls school in Scotland is to admit boys for the first time in 2021. Councillors voted unanimously to allow boys to attend Notre Dame High School in Glasgow, which has taught only girls since its opening in 1897. It follows fierce debate among parents and a lengthy consultation about the school's future. Education officers recommended making the school ""co-educational"" after a vote at Glasgow City Council. They said changes should not directly affect current students and that boys would be introduced in year groups from S1 in 2021. Maureen McKenna, executive director of education at Glasgow City Council said: ""Now that the decision has been made by elected members, education officers will start to develop transition plans and will engage with school and parent representatives from all the associated primary schools and secondary schools affected by changes."" She said that the council would be sensitive in recognising it was a significant change for the school and local community. Notre Dame, in the west end of Glasgow, has admitted only girls since it opened more than 120 years ago. At the time girls-only schools were commonplace. There are still some other state schools for girls in other parts of the UK. A recent paper for councillors spelled out details of the options for Notre Dame's future. The paper said that if Notre Dame started to take in boys, the school would gradually become co-educational over five years. There would be boys in each fresh S1 intake, but boys would not join other year groups. This means that all the current students would still be educated in girl-only classes. The council said about Â£750,000 of work would be needed to improve toilet and other facilities at Notre Dame to make them suitable for boys. The school was founded in 1897 The catchment area for Notre Dame High will also be altered to include Notre Dame Primary School, St Patrick's Primary School and St Joseph's Primary School. That will also lead to changes in the catchment areas for three other nearby secondaries - St Thomas Aquinas Secondary School, St Roch's Secondary School and John Paul Academy. The city's administration committee rejected two other options that would have kept Notre Dame as a girls' school. Supporters of the school fought a powerful campaign against change. They argued that sending a child to Notre Dame was a positive choice - some would contend girls may also do better in subjects such as maths and science in an environment where they cannot be perceived as ""boys' subjects"". At the start of November, some pupils held a demonstration outside Glasgow City Council's headquarters. A consultation earlier this year showed just how mixed local opinion was. The single most popular option was for the school to start admitting boys with 45.9% backing the co-education option, with a change to catchment area. However, the majority supported one of the options keeping Notre Dame as a single-sex school. The status quo was supported by 39.9% and 13.4% wanted the status quo plus a change to catchment area.

US envoy to EU accused of sexual misconduct,"Gordon Sondland denies the allegations against him Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct. The allegations,published by Portland Monthly magazine and ProPublica,external, date back to before he became an ambassador. At the time of the alleged incidents he was developing hotels in Portland and Seattle in the Pacific Northwest. Mr Sondland denies all of the allegations, and accuses the women of targeting him for his role in President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings. ""These untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and, I believe, co-ordinated for political purposes,"" he said in a statement. ""They have no basis in fact, and I categorically deny them."" All three women said Mr Sondland retaliated against them professionally after they rejected his sexual advances - by verbally abusing them at their workplace, reneging on a promised investment, and withdrawing offers of professional introductions. One of the women, Nicole Vogel, said she met Mr Sondland for dinner in 2003 in order to secure investment for her new magazine. Ms Vogel is the owner of Portland Monthly. The magazine said she was not involved editorially in the story, and it had teamed up with ProPublica, a respected non-profit news group, to report the claims independently. She said that after dinner Mr Sondland took her to one of his hotels and invited her to see a room. He then requested a hug, she added, but instead ""grabs my face and goes to kiss me"". She said she deflected him and left the hotel, and later received an email from Mr Sondland changing the terms of his investment. Another woman, Jana Solis, said she met Mr Sondland in 2008 when she was seeking work as a hotel safety expert. When he offered her the job, she said, he called her ""my new hotel chick"" and slapped her rear. She then said that on another occasion he invited her to his home in Portland to evaluate his art collection, before exposing himself. On a third occasion, he asked her to inspect his penthouse apartment and then forcibly kissed her, she said. As it happened: Gordon Sondland's testimony Trumpâs man in Brussels in eye of the storm Five key Sondland moments - analysed The third accuser, Natalie Sept, was working in local politics in Portland for a candidate Mr Sondland had donated money to. After they were introduced through her boss, she claims Mr Sondland invited her to dinner to discuss work opportunities. She said he asked for a hug at the end of the night, but then pushed himself towards her and tried to forcibly kiss her. In response, Mr Sondland described the article as ""underhanded journalism"" that was ""fundamentally false"". Astatement on his website,externalsaid: ""Both the timing and sourcing of the reporting seem obviously intended to influence congressional proceedings in which Ambassador Sondland is a witness."" ""These false incidents are at odds with my character,"" he added in a separate statement. He suggested that Ms Vogel was ""a source angry that I long ago declined to invest in her magazine, the same magazine now presenting its owner's outlandish claims"". He said he intended to take legal action against the two publications. Mr Sondland provided key testimony at Mr Trump's impeachment hearing last week, where he said he followed President Donald Trump's orders to pressure Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.

"Labour candidate removed over anti-Semitism claimsThe party says it took ""immediate action"" to remove Safia Ali, who had been its candidate for the Falkirk seat.","Labour said it had removed Safia Ali as its candidate over Facebook posts Labour has removed one of its general election candidates over allegations that she made anti-Semitic posts on Facebook. Safia Ali had been due to stand for the party in the Falkirk seat in next month's election. But Scottish Labour said it had taken ""immediate action"" to remove her as its candidate after the posts emerged. It also expressed its ""deep regret"" that she had been selected to stand for the party. Scottish Labour general secretary Michael Sharpe confirmed that the party had withdrawn its support from Ms Ali  - although her name will still appear on the ballot paper because she was removed after the close of nominations. But he said he would not go into specific details about her case. Latest from the election campaign trail Chief rabbi in election attack on Labour A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Mr Sharpe added: ""I deeply regret the people of the Falkirk constituency will no longer have a Labour candidate to campaign and vote for on 12 December. ""There is no place for anti-Semitism, or any form of racism and bigotry, in our party. That is why Labour is taking robust action to root it out of our movement and wider society."" Mr Sharpe insisted that the party had ""significantly strengthened"" its procedures, with ""swift suspensions, new processes for rapid expulsions and an education programme for members"". BBC Scotland has been unable to contact Ms Ali for comment. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard denied that anti-Semitism is rife throughout his party and suggested that the Facebook posts at the centre of the allegations against Ms Ali had escaped the party's attention during a trawl of her online activity. On a visit to a community shop in Midlothian, Mr Leonard was asked five times by the BBC if he would like to apologise to the Jewish community. He said those who had made anti-Semitic comments should do so, and insisted that Scottish Labour was ""not complacent"" about anti-Jewish racism in the party and was keen to root it out. Scottish Labour came second to the SNP's John McNally at the 2017 election in Falkirk, trailing by 4,923 votes. Labour has been embroiled in allegations of anti-Semitism for more than three years, with the chief rabbi claiming earlier this week that the party is not doing enough to root out anti-Jewish racism. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil on Tuesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was asked four times whether he would like to apologise to the British Jewish community -but declined to do so. However, Mr Corbyn has stressed that there is no place for anti-Semitism within Labour and said those guilty of anti-Jewish racism have been ""brought to book"". Meanwhile, the Scottish Conservativessuspended their Glasgow Centralcandidate, Flora Scarabello, on Wednesday after she was accused of using ""anti-Muslim language"". Last week, the Tories alsosuspended their candidate for Aberdeen North, Ryan Houghton, over allegations he had made anti-Semitic, Islamophobic and homophobic comments seven years previously.

Vue boss plans to rescreen banned film,"This video can not be played Vue chief executive Tim Richards says the chain is looking at ""beefing up security"" to bring the film back The boss of a cinema chain that banned a London gang film after a mass brawl in Birmingham has told the BBC he plans to resume screenings by the weekend. Vue banned Blue Story after saying there had been 25 serious incidents in 16 of its cinemas. But its chief executive, Tim Richards, said it was now looking at ""beefing up security"" to restart screenings. It comes after Blue Story's director, Rapman, questioned whether there were ""hidden reasons"" for the ban. Rapman questions 'hidden reasons' for film ban 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Cinema chains pull gang film after 'machete' brawl Rapman, whose real name is Andrew Onwubolu, previously told the BBC there was ""no connection"" between his movie and the brawl in Birmingham, which led to five arrests. ""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced? ""Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing?"" This video can not be played Rapman says he feels cheated following Vue's decision Vue has said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race. Responding to Rapman, Mr Richards said the chain wanted ""more movies like this on our screens, not less"". ""Right now we are looking at trying to get that movie back onto our screens by the weekend and possibly, if we can, to accelerate that,"" he said. ""Our plans right now are to look at the timings and look at who's buying the tickets, and we're going to be beefing up security where we've had problems. ""There will be one or two cinemas, like Birmingham, where it will be very difficult to justify screening it again there."" Rapman (centre) on the set of Blue Story Blue Story focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes on rival sides of a street war. It is rated 15 for strong language, strong violence, threat, sex and drug misuse. Another cinema chain, Showcase, had also initially stopped showing the film after the incident in Birmingham, butreinstated screenings on Monday nightafter ""careful consideration and discussions with the distributor"". In a statement, Vue added: ""Following an ongoing review of security to protect the safety of our staff and customers, we hope to be showing the film from this weekend with additional security arrangements in our cinemas to ensure everyone can enjoy the film in comfort and safety."" Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, welcomed Vue's decision and expressed gratitude to ""everyone who fought for this movie like it was their own"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson's agreement with the EU includes special arrangements for Northern Ireland, including a consent mechanism that would see the Northern Ireland Assembly given a simple majority vote on how the rules on customs arrangements in Northern Ireland would work after Brexit. The DUP argues that any vote on contentious matters should be done on a cross-community basis, with a majority of unionists and nationalists approving them rather than a straight majority. At Thursday's manifesto launch in Belfast, deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the deal would be dangerous ""to the economic and constitutional position of Northern Ireland"". Mrs Foster added that if Mr Johnson was returned as prime minister, the DUP would reiterate that unionism in Northern Ireland was united in its ""rejection"" of the deal, and would still seek to secure further changes to it. The DUP entered into a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservative Party after the 2017 Westminster election, after Theresa May lost her majority. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Tory Chief Whip Gavin Williamson sign the confidence and supply agreement in June 2017 Mrs Foster said the DUP would not support a government led by Jeremy Corbyn if the upcoming election resulted in a hung parliament - in which no one party would have enough seats to form a government by itself. She said: ""The outcome of this election across the UK is still uncertain. ""As we have proved over the past two years our votes may still be crucial. ""The DUP is committed to a deal that works for the whole of the UK and which does not leave Northern Ireland behind, with no border in the Irish Sea."" Mr Dodds added that the DUP wanted to ""protect"" Northern Ireland's place within the United Kingdom and that its MPs would continue to vote against legislation and policies that would damage unionism and destabilise politics across the UK. ""I believe strongly and so do others in the Commons that after this [Brexit] is done, there should be a full proper inquiry set up at a high level into what went wrong with the British government's negotiations, how could we have such a catastrophic conduct in negotiations for one of the most important issues of our time?"" he said. Some of the party's key manifesto pledges include: Opposing the current Brexit deal and securing one that works for the whole United Kingdom Protecting and strengthening the union of the United Kingdom Restoring the Stormont assembly Abolishing the television licence fee but restore free licences for over-75s as long as it remains Supporting the pursuit of a strong interconnection energy strategy including with Iceland The party also insisted it wants to see devolution in Northern Ireland restored as soon as possible, and that it would be involved in any future negotiations regarding the future of power-sharing. The assembly collapsed in January 2017, after a green energy financial scandal that caused a split between the DUP and its then power-sharing partner Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP is running in 17 constituencies in next month's election, standing aside in Fermanagh and South Tyrone to allow the Ulster Unionists to run unopposed against non-unionist political parties.

Escalating Iraq protests leave 13 dead,"This video can not be played Watch protesters running away from the sound of rapid gunfire in Nasiriya Nearly 40 people have been killed in Iraq on one of the bloodiest days since anti-government protests began last month, medics and officials say. At least 25 people died when security forces opened fire to clear bridges in the southern city of Nasiriya. Another four protesters died in Baghdad and 10 more in the city of Najaf, where Iran's consulate was also burnt. Iraqis have been taking to the streets to demand more jobs, an end to corruption and better public services. The Iraq protests explained in 100 and 500 words Is a new Arab Spring unfolding in the Middle East? The Iraqi military has announced it is setting up military ""crisis cells"" to quell unrest. The military command said an emergency unit had been created to ""impose security and restore order"". At least 350 people have been killed and thousands wounded since the unrest began. The military had sent reinforcements to tackle unrest in Nasiriya, the birthplace of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and a hotspot for protests. Troops used live ammunition and tear gas to clear sit-ins on two bridges, medics and security sources reported, with protesters responding by torching a police station. Protesters near Ahrar Bridge in Baghdad, where at least four people died on Thursday Amnesty International's Middle East research director, Lynn Maalouf, said the scenes ""more closely resemble a war zone than city streets and bridges"", accusing security forces of ""appalling violence against largely peaceful protesters"". Agence France-Presse, quoting Iraqi state media, said Mr Abdul Mahdi had now sacked Gen Jamil Shummary, one of the commanders sent to restore order in Nasiriya. Late in the evening, Iraqi media reported that the governor of Dhi Qar, of which Nasiriya is the capital, had resigned. Live rounds were also fired at the strategic Ahrar Bridge in Baghdad, sources said, as protesters tried to cross towards the so-called Green Zone that hosts the country's parliament. As well as the four who died there, more than 20 people were wounded. Clashes broke out between protesters and police in the city on Thursday, leaving three demonstrators dead and 18 more wounded, medical sources said. Security forces were cracking down after protesters set fire overnight to the Iranian consulate in the city - the seat of Iraq's Shia religious authority and the location of the revered Imam Ali shrine, where the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad is buried. Protesters chanted ""Iran out of Iraq"" as flames engulfed the building. Reports say staff at the consulate managed to flee just before protesters broke in. Iran swiftly condemned the attack and said that the Iraqi government was responsible for protecting its consulate. Protesters chanted ""Iran out of Iraq"" as the consulate burned on Wednesday night This is the second attack on an Iranian consulate in Iraq this month after an office in the Shia holy city of Karbalawas targeted three weeks ago. Although Iraq's anti-government protests have been directed mainly at the country's political leaders, many of those taking part have also expressed anger at Iran's influence over Iraq's internal affairs, which has steadily grown since the US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. Protesters accuse Iran of complicity in what they see as Iraq's governance failure and corruption. Mr Abdul Mahdi took office just over a year ago, promising reforms that have not materialised. Young Iraqis angered by his failure to tackle high unemployment, endemic corruption and poor public services took to the streets of Baghdad for the first time at the beginning of October. This video can not be played Protester Safaa al Saray died after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister After the first wave of protests, which lasted six days and saw 149 civilians killed, Mr Abdul Mahdi promised to reshuffle his cabinet and cut the salaries of high-ranking officials, and also announced schemes to reduce youth unemployment. This video can not be played The story behind an abandoned high-rise building taken over by protesters in Baghdad But the protesters said their demands had not been met and returned to the streets in late October. The demonstrations escalated and spread across the country after security personnel responded with deadly force.

Bags for life 'adding to rising plastic waste',"Sales of ""bags for life"" rose to 1.5bn last year as the amount of plastic used by supermarkets increased to 900,000 tonnes, Greenpeace research has found. Campaigners are calling for higher charges for the bags or a complete ban as the research showed households bought an average of 54 a year. In 2016, there were 2bn single-use bags sold. Bags for life must be used four times to be better for the environment. Retailers say they have reduced plastic packaging for their own-brand products. This video can not be played How plastic bags were supposed to help the planet In their second annual study of plastic use by UK supermarkets,external, Greenpeace and campaigning charity the Environmental Investigation Agency conclude the rising sales of bags for life mean they are used as a disposable option by many customers. Many supermarkets have stopped selling 5p single-use bags altogether in favour of stronger 10p bags, which are intended to be reused. Plastic bag sales in England halved in past year Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Plastic or paper: Which bag is greener? A study by the Environment Agency,externalconcluded that these plastic bags for life needed to be used at least four times to ensure they contributed less to climate change than the lighter, single-use bags. The Greenpeace and EIA research says that bag for life sales were cut by 90% in the Republic of Ireland by setting higher prices of 70 cents. The report recommends a charge of 70p or ""ideally"" a government ban. The research also found that overall supermarket plastic use has risen to more than 900,000 tonnes in 2018, despite pledges by retailers to cut down on packaging. The previous year, they used 886,000 tonnes of single-use plastic packaging. Fiona Nicholls, ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: ""Supermarkets are failing on plastics and failing their customers. ""We hear piecemeal supermarket announcements on plastic every other week, but in reality they are putting more plastic on the shelves than ever."" The report found that supermarkets had slightly reduced the plastic from own-brand goods but that packaging from branded goods increased. All major supermarkets have pledged to reduce their use of plastic packaging Only Tesco has given suppliers an ultimatum to cut plastic use or see their products removed from the shelves. The report ranked the supermarkets by their progress on reducing plastic and their future plans. Waitrose was ranked top for cutting its packaging and trying out refill stations for products such as coffee, rice, pasta, wine and detergent. Morrisons came second and was praised for setting a quantified target to increase reusable and refillable packaging, as well as making its loose and refillable products 10% cheaper than packaged alternatives. The British Retail Consortium, which represents major supermarkets and other shops, said retailers achieved a drop in their own-brand plastic use by removing all polystyrene packaging and plastic cutlery as well as trialling refillable options. But Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability, said ""more needs to be done"" and supermarkets have set ""challenging"" targets with the aim of making all packaging 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable.

"Vue boss plans to rescreen banned filmVue is looking at ""beefing up security"" to bring Blue Story back to its screens, the chain's boss says.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Vue chief executive Tim Richards says the chain is looking at ""beefing up security"" to bring the film back The boss of a cinema chain that banned a London gang film after a mass brawl in Birmingham has told the BBC he plans to resume screenings by the weekend. Vue banned Blue Story after saying there had been 25 serious incidents in 16 of its cinemas. But its chief executive, Tim Richards, said it was now looking at ""beefing up security"" to restart screenings. It comes after Blue Story's director, Rapman, questioned whether there were ""hidden reasons"" for the ban. Rapman questions 'hidden reasons' for film ban 'Institutionally racist': Blue Story ban faces backlash Cinema chains pull gang film after 'machete' brawl Rapman, whose real name is Andrew Onwubolu, previously told the BBC there was ""no connection"" between his movie and the brawl in Birmingham, which led to five arrests. ""And then you start thinking, is there hidden reasons there? What's the owner like? Has he got an issue with young urban youth? Is he prejudiced? ""Does he believe that this film brings a certain type? Is there a colour thing?"" This video can not be played Rapman says he feels cheated following Vue's decision Vue has said the decision to pull Blue Story from its 91 cinemas nationwide was ""categorically not"" related to race. Responding to Rapman, Mr Richards said the chain wanted ""more movies like this on our screens, not less"". ""Right now we are looking at trying to get that movie back onto our screens by the weekend and possibly, if we can, to accelerate that,"" he said. ""Our plans right now are to look at the timings and look at who's buying the tickets, and we're going to be beefing up security where we've had problems. ""There will be one or two cinemas, like Birmingham, where it will be very difficult to justify screening it again there."" Rapman (centre) on the set of Blue Story Blue Story focuses on two friends from different south London postcodes on rival sides of a street war. It is rated 15 for strong language, strong violence, threat, sex and drug misuse. Another cinema chain, Showcase, had also initially stopped showing the film after the incident in Birmingham, butreinstated screenings on Monday nightafter ""careful consideration and discussions with the distributor"". In a statement, Vue added: ""Following an ongoing review of security to protect the safety of our staff and customers, we hope to be showing the film from this weekend with additional security arrangements in our cinemas to ensure everyone can enjoy the film in comfort and safety."" Rapman, real name Andrew Onwubolu, welcomed Vue's decision and expressed gratitude to ""everyone who fought for this movie like it was their own"". Allow Twitter content?

TikTok apologises and reinstates banned US teen,"This video can not be played WATCH: Feroza Aziz rejects TikTok's explanations for blocking her from its app Chinese-owned social network TikTok has apologised to a US teenager who was blocked from the service after she posted a viral clip criticising China's treatment of the Uighur Muslims. The firm said it had now lifted the ban,external, maintaining it was due to 17-year-old Feroza Aziz's prior conduct on the app - and unrelated to Chinese politics. Additionally, the firm said ""human moderation error"" was to blame for the video being taken down on Thursday for almost an hour. TIkTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, has insisted it does not apply Chinese moderation principles to its product outside of mainland China. Ms Azizposted on Twitter,externalthat she did not accept the firm's explanation. ""Do I believe they took it away because of a unrelated satirical video that was deleted on a previous deleted account of mine? Right after I finished posting a three-part video about the Uighurs? No.â Ms Aziz said she wanted to raise awareness about China's detainment of ""innocent Muslims"" In an interview with BBC News reporter Vivienne Nunis, Ms Aziz said: ""I will continue to talk about it, and I will talk about it on Twitter, on Instagram, on any platform I have, even TikTok. ""I'm not scared of TikTok, even after the suspension. I won't be scared of TikTok.â Eric Han, TikTok's head of safety for the US, said Ms Aziz had been banned earlier this month after she posted a video containing an image of Osama Bin Laden. ""While we recognise that this video may have been intended as satire,"" Mr Han said, ""our policies on this front are currently strict.â Teen's TikTok video about China's Muslim camps goes viral Should we be worried about TikTok? Data leak reveals how China 'brainwashes' Uighurs When TikTok bans users, it also prevents the same device being used to set up another account. It was on a new account, set up on the same device, that Ms Aziz posted her video about the Uighurs, done in the style of a make-up tutorial, a popular genre on the network. TikTok said that account was disabled after it ran a ""platform-wide enforcement"" that locked out Ms Aziz's device, as well as 2,406 devices belonging to other users who had fallen foul of the site's policies. Mr Han wrote: ""Because the user's banned account (@getmefamousplzsir) was associated with the same device as her second account (@getmefamouspartthree), this had the effect of locking her out of being able to access her second, active account from that device. ""However, the account itself remained active and accessible, with its videos continuing to receive views.â But on Thursday morning, the viral video - which has been viewed more than nine million times, across multiple networks - was also removed from TikTok, due to what Mr Han described as a ""human moderation errorâ. ""It's important to clarify that nothing in our community guidelines precludes content such as this video, and it should not have been removed,"" he said. ""We would like to apologise to the user for the error on our part this morning.â Human Rights Watch told the BBC that a lack of transparency is deserving of increased scrutiny. ""It is hard for outsiders to know the real reasons for the suspension of Azizâs account,"" said Yaqiu Wa, the non-profit's China researcher. ""TikTok does not make public the data on the videos it removes or the users it suspends, or the artificial intelligence tools it uses to determine the removals and suspensions. ""While TikTok has repeatedly stressed that it does not take orders from the Chinese government in terms of what content it promotes or removes outside of China, it has done little to quench the suspicion, given that all Chinese companies are not only accountable to its shareholders, but also to the Chinese Communist Party."" The incident marks an early, high-profile censorship dispute for TikTok, a network which has exploded in popularity over the past two years. Globally, the app has now been downloaded 1.5 billion times, according to mobile intelligence analysts Sensor Tower. It looks set to end 2019 as the third most-downloaded non-gaming app, ahead of rivals Facebook and Instagram. That surge in popularity has caused concern in Western markets, due to the nature of its Chinese ownership. In the US, TikTok's deal to buyMusical.ly,external, a music-based social network, is now being examined by the US Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The committee is looking specifically at data storage and privacy practices. In February the firm was handed the largest ever finefor a US case involving children's data privacy. The company agreed to pay $5.7m (Â£4.3m) over its handling of data on users who were under 13, acquired thanks to its takeover ofMusical.ly,external. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

How wet has 2019 autumn really been?,"This video can not be played BBC Weather's Matt Taylor explains why it has been so wet in November With days of rain and extensive floods, the autumn of 2019 seems to have been much wetter than normal. Has it though? BBC Weather has been looking at the level of rainfall across the country to see how this autumn, which has seemed very wet, actually compares to previous years. Watnall near Nottingham, Sheffield in South Yorkshire and Scampton and Coningsby in Lincolnshire have all had their wettest autumns on record and are on course for their wettest ever Novembers. Rainfall from 1 September to 27 November Sheffield456mm (previous record 425.2mm in 2000) Watnall, Notts367.8mm (previous record 339.6mm in 2000) Coningsby, Lincs341.6mm (previous record 284.8mm in 2000) Scampton, Lincs303.2mm (previous record 271.7mm in 1993) Furthermore, the average autumn rainfall in Lincolnshire is about 163mm and the annual rainfall is 613mm, so they have had double the seasonal average and about half of their expected annual rainfall in just three months. But while there have been some dramatic weather events locally, nationally the record has been a long way from being broken. Fishlake near Doncaster was flooded after a river and beck burst their banks This autumn is currently ranked as the 24th wettest on record for England and Wales with 372.1mm falling on average across the two nations. The record was set in 2000 when 502.7mm was recorded.

MP abuse: 'I had police escort after death threat',"This video can not be played Four politicians from across the political spectrum described their experience of abuse More than 100 abuse complaints against Scottish politicians have been reported since the summer, with 35 leading to criminal investigations. Police attribute it to the ""febrility"" of the political atmosphere. Politicians have increasingly become the target of abuse, and, as polling day approaches, women politicians are speaking up about it. BBC Scotland has spoken to four female parliamentarians from the 2017-2019 term about its impact. Joanna Cherry has been one of the MPs who received the most abuse Joanna Cherry is accustomed to abuse, describing most of it as ""just offensive"". But recently she received something far more sinister. ""Earlier this year, I did receive something... which [police] took to be a credible death threat and I had to have a police escort to my constituency surgery,"" she recalls. That was one of the more serious messages she received - but there have been many more abusive messages that went unreported to police. Last year,research suggested,externalthat for a period around the 2017 election the SNP politician was the second most abused member of parliament on social media, behind Labour's Dianne Abbott - who also received racist abuse as well as abuse about being a woman. Ms Cherry said. ""A lot of abuse I receive is misogynistic, but it's also homophobic, anti-Catholic, and also people resent me because they see me as a strong voice in favour of Scottish independence... and Brexit"". The problem, she believes, is ""rife"" across the political spectrum. Had she known the level of abuse she would receive she says she ""may not have chosen to follow this path"". The abuse has upset her family, and has at times affected her in a ""significant"" way too, but after more than four years in the job, she says she has developed a ""thick skin"". But she worries that such abuse might discourage other women from entering politics and believes social media companies should take stronger action to protect women from misogynistic abuse. ""We should never forget that a female member of parliament was murdered by a man motivated by right-wing terrorism"", she added. Jo Cox: MP's killing raises questions about security Kirstene Hair thinks threats have to be taken seriously Kirstene Hair was the only female Scottish Conservative MP in the last parliament. The ""torrent"" of abuse directed at her was, she says, far more intense than that received by her male colleagues. ""I can deal with it - the problem is I don't want to deal with it"", she said. ""I do ignore it - I would go insane if I didn't."" She believes it would be a mistake not to take the threats seriously. ""The thing I say back to everyone who says 'you're just a snowflake', or 'you need to man up', is you don't know when someone writes something... on social media if they are actually capable of doing something much worse and we don't know that therefore... we do have to have additional security and support."" Events have demonstrated, she says, that the hatred directed at politicians can have real, harmful consequences. ""It's not just a threat on social media, we've seen people go further. I can't just say 'that won't happen to me'."" Ms Hair added: ""I'm 30, a lot of my friends are about the age that we want people to start... getting involved [in politics]... they turn round and say 'I couldn't do your job'."" Christine Jardine doesn't want to let bullies win Christine Jardine, of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, is another politician who is no stranger to abuse. Despite the hurt she says she has never  thought about quitting politics - because ""that would be letting the bullies win"". She believes it is a ""safety mechanism"" to assume that most threats are ""just someone mouthing off"". Most cases of abuse go unrecorded. But politicians are encouraged to report serious incidents to the police. Ms Jardine recounted an incident where she did just that, after receiving an answer phone message which contained threats of rape and beatings. More than 100 complaints have been made to police by Scottish MPs and MSPs since the summer - roughly one for every two parliamentarians in Scotland - and 35 have triggered criminal investigations. Ms Jardine said: ""You expect people not to agree with you in politics... but you don't expect people to actually write personally nasty things abut you. ""British politics has always been tribal and nasty. But it's got worse... We have to try and fix the system."" Danielle Rowley said it was ""terribly sad"" that there is so much anger towards politicians While much of the abuse happens on social media, MPs are still routinely targeted by email, letter, on the phone and sometimes face to face. Labour's Danielle Rowley told of one incident when she received a handwritten letter which imagined her being attacked with acid at a public meeting. She said it was ""terribly sad"" that there was so much anger towards politicians. It isn't acceptable for anyone to be threatened. She accepts that politicians had ""always been target for anger"" but she believes the problem has worsened considerably. The number of elections and referendums in recent years has meant people face  ""wall to wall coverage"", which opens politicians up to more abuse. Despite the growing pressures, she said that helping constituents made the job worthwhile: ""When I carried out surgeries, when you're able to help [constituents] and advocate for change, that's so important and that's what keeps you going. ""I'll always take hope for being able to help people."" Police Scotland's Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams says there has been a definite rise in the volume of cases this year. He puts that down to the ""febrility"" of the political atmosphere, with ongoing debates over Brexit and independence. ACC Williams said the force was determined to tackle harassment, threats and physical and verbal abuse. ""We take it very seriously and we will investigate it and we will bring those people to justice"" he said. You can find a full list of candidates standing in the general election here.

Netflix 'reactivated' users without permission,"Former Netflix customers who cancelled their subscription months ago have had their accounts reactivated without their consent. BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme has learned that criminals can log in to dormant accounts and reactivate them without knowing users' bank details. The video streaming service wants it to be easy for customers to rejoin. As a result, customer data is held on the site for 10 months, including billing details. Netflix says this information is available to members who choose to cancel and they will delete it all if requested by email. Netflix takes over its first cinema Netflix to disappear on older Samsung smart TVs Emily Keen from Oxford cancelled her Netflix service in April 2019, but found her account had been charged Â£11.99 by Netflix in September. She said: ""I tried to login to my account, but it said my email and password had not been recognised. ""It turns out the criminals had changed my login details completely and had signed me up for the most expensive service."" Ms Keen contacted Netflix customer services and was told her card would be blocked and she would be refunded. However, Netflix went on to take two more payments in October and November, and refunded her only in part. Former Netflix subscribers have been complaining on Twitter about it happening to them too: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Johnson vows to help women in politics,"Boris Johnson will vow to ""support women to reach their full potential"" in politics and the workplace if the Conservatives win the general election. He will also announce the ""biggest drive"" to recruit female Tory activists, members and candidates. On the 100th anniversary of the election of the first woman to sit in the Commons, the PM will pledge to make 50% of future Tory candidates women. In this election 30% of Tory candidates and 53% of Labour candidates are women. Labour has hit back by criticising the prime minister's attitude towards women, highlighting ""sexist"" remarks he has made in the past. Record number of women set to stand in election The party says in articles written for The Spectator magazine, Mr Johnson made disparaging comments about single mothers and unmarried women. They say this shows his attitude is ""straight out of the dark ages"". Mr Johnson's announcement comes as a statue of Nancy Astor - the first woman MP to take a seat in Parliament, 100 years ago - is due to be unveiled in Plymouth. Commenting on her career, Mr Johnson said: ""She was a trailblazer, ripping up the conventions that held women back from joining the workplace. ""A Conservative majority government will support women to reach their full potential - be that in the workplace, by opening up new opportunities to work flexibly or start their own business, or through our work internationally to make sure all young women get 12 years of education."" Mrs Astor was elected to represent Plymouth for the Conservative Party, the year after women over 30 who met a property qualification were given the vote. Constance Markievticz was the first woman to be elected to Parliament in 1918, but her membership of the Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in stopped her from taking the oath, meaning she could not sit in the Commons. Nancy Astor became the first female MP in Westminster in 1919 Women make up about a third of candidates in next month's election. According to BBC analysis of Press Association figures earlier this month, 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates are women. The Tories say they have 193 female Conservative parliamentary candidates, while Labour has 335. Mr Johnson said: ""I have often said that talent and brilliance is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. I will make sure that women are supported to take up the opportunities that politics present."" The Conservatives say they want to encourage flexible working, review how to better support self-employed workers and protect women returning from maternity leave by reforming redundancy law. But the Labour Party highlighted ""sexist and misogynistic"" comments made by Mr Johnson in articles written in the 1990s. Labour's shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti said: ""Someone whose attitudes towards women are straight out of the dark ages is not fit to be prime minister of our country."" In September it emerged that Mr Johnson wrote that David Cameron was a ""girly swot"" on a private cabinet paper. And days earlier Mr Johnson was criticised for calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""big girl's blouse"" over the Labour leader's decision not to back the prime minister's bid for an election while the risk of a no-deal Brexit remained.

If you're just joining us, here's a quick summary of what's been happening today. Speaking about tonight's Channel 4
leadersâ climate debate, Rebecca
Newsom from Greenpeace UK says it ""laid bare the ambitions of
the leaders who took part, and exposed the disregard for this existential
crisis of those who couldnât be bothered to turn up."" She praises ""strong action plans"" on energy systems and homes, but says the leaders ""dodged"" sectors that required bigger personal lifestyle changes like flying and meat consumption. Max Wakefield,
director at Possible, an organisation advocating for a zero carbon society, says the debate proved the issue would not be sidelined in elections ""as it has in the past"". ""And no
matter what the result of this election, it will not be forgotten that Boris
Johnson refused to spend an hour of his time telling the public how he plans to
tackle the greatest threat to our society and the natural world,""  he says. Reality Check Jo Swinson said: ""We need to make sure that now we have a target for all new-build homes to be zero carbon and to have those high standards. And the Conservatives who can't be bothered to turn up tonight scrapped those plans."" Plans to make all UK homes zero-carbon were first proposed by Gordon Brown in 2006, and cancelled by the Conservative government in 2015. Zero-carbon homes have better energy efficiency standards, and generate all the energy they need onsite through solar panels and suchlike. The justification for the move was to reduce regulations on housebuilders, which would have made it harder for the government to meet its targets for home construction. The following year, the Mayor of London put in place a zero carbon standard for homes in the city.   We've heard some party pledges on climate change and the environment - including cutting emissions, planting more trees, insulation homes and taxing flight travel. But what do they say in their manifestos? Here BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabintakes a closer look.

Reality Check Nicola Sturgeon said: âWe need more support for onshore wind which the Tories disgracefully have taken away.â It is true that onshore wind installations in the UK last year were at their lowest since 2011, at 598 MW of generating capacity. That followed a bumper year in 2017, when 2,666 MW were installed, according to Renewables UK, the industry group. It blamed the peak in 2017 and the subsequent downturn on government policy. 2017 was the last year of the renewable obligation scheme, which supported many large scale renewable projects. Also, it said onshore wind projects are not able to bid for subsidies under another renewable support scheme, contracts for difference. In addition the Conservative government changed the planning rules to give local councils in England more powers to block new wind farm schemes. Overall, however, the UK has made impressive progress in decarbonising its electricity generation, helped among other things by a big increase in offshore wind generation. According to Carbon Brief, since 2008 âthe UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy.â A statement posted on Twitter,externalby Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the party decided not to take part in the Channel 4 debate because ""we have no faith that the broadcaster will conduct this
debate in a fair and objective way"". âBrexit is the defining issue of our age and the fact that
Channel 4 does not want to discuss it speaks volumes about this broadcaster and
its Remain position,"" the statement said. Michael
Gove says other political parties ""vetoed a Conservative voice"" when he was refused the chance to stand in for Boris Johnson in Channel 4's televised leaders' debate on climate change. Speaking in a Conservative Facebook Live, the former environment secretary says he âwanted to take part"". But he says the editor of Channel 4 News asked the other parties for their permission and they said âabsolutely noâ. âTheyâd
rather debate a block of ice,"" he adds, in reference to the programme-makers' decision to put ice sculptures on display where Mr Johnson and the also-absent leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, would have been standing. âItâs
a pity that we couldnât have a proper and full debate on the climate emergency
with the other parties tonight,"" he says. Moving on, he describes what would happen if other parties took power from the Tories. âInstead of planting trees to
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, weâll have two referendums sucking all the
oxygen out of our political system,"" he says. That may be it for Channel 4's debate - but there's plenty more climate change content for you to get your teeth into: It's the end of the debate. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy thanks the party leaders for taking part. He adds: ""Thank you also to Michael Gove from the Conservative Party, who did come here, but sadly, as we made clear from the start, this debate
was for leaders only. âAnd our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders. ""Our offer to Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come here and
discuss the climate emergency remains open."" Two ice sculptures were set up instead of the Conservative Party and Brexit Party leaders.  Presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks the leaders to give their own personal climate change resolutions. Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP says her energy provider uses renewable resources, that she has a smart meter, is trying to fly less and be more conscious about what she eats. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says she uses a reusable cup and makes sure she does the recycling. She also points out that her electric campaign bus is electric. Plaid's Adam Price looks to the New Year. He says he's going to start cycling to work every day and he's going to start using an electric car. He also says he has convinced his partner they should use re-usable nappies for their one-year-old son. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will ""do everything I can to improve recyling in local authorities and elsewhere"", as well as combatting ""excessive packaging"". Mr Corbyn adds that he's ""always the last one to turn the heating on"", and that the heating only went on in his house last week. ""I'm quite miserable actually... because I don't like to see the waste of energy,"" he adds. Despite the sincerity with which each of these leaders give their resolutions, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry laughs at their answers. ""It isn't about lists,"" she says. She says politicians often list what they're going to do but that leads to ""broken promises"". ""I just cannot sit back and let this happen again,"" she adds. Ms Berry adds that she isn't a homeowner so finds it difficult to make her privately-rented home more green. Instead, she says, she ""works to change the system"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Gove says other political parties ""vetoed a Conservative voice"" when he was refused the chance to stand in for Boris Johnson in Channel 4's televised leaders' debate on climate change. Speaking in a Conservative Facebook Live, the former environment secretary says he âwanted to take part"". But he says the editor of Channel 4 News asked the other parties for their permission and they said âabsolutely noâ. âTheyâd
rather debate a block of ice,"" he adds, in reference to the programme-makers' decision to put ice sculptures on display where Mr Johnson and the also-absent leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, would have been standing. âItâs
a pity that we couldnât have a proper and full debate on the climate emergency
with the other parties tonight,"" he says. Moving on, he describes what would happen if other parties took power from the Tories. âInstead of planting trees to
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, weâll have two referendums sucking all the
oxygen out of our political system,"" he says. That may be it for Channel 4's debate - but there's plenty more climate change content for you to get your teeth into: It's the end of the debate. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy thanks the party leaders for taking part. He adds: ""Thank you also to Michael Gove from the Conservative Party, who did come here, but sadly, as we made clear from the start, this debate
was for leaders only. âAnd our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders. ""Our offer to Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come here and
discuss the climate emergency remains open."" Two ice sculptures were set up instead of the Conservative Party and Brexit Party leaders.  Presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks the leaders to give their own personal climate change resolutions. Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP says her energy provider uses renewable resources, that she has a smart meter, is trying to fly less and be more conscious about what she eats. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says she uses a reusable cup and makes sure she does the recycling. She also points out that her electric campaign bus is electric. Plaid's Adam Price looks to the New Year. He says he's going to start cycling to work every day and he's going to start using an electric car. He also says he has convinced his partner they should use re-usable nappies for their one-year-old son. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will ""do everything I can to improve recyling in local authorities and elsewhere"", as well as combatting ""excessive packaging"". Mr Corbyn adds that he's ""always the last one to turn the heating on"", and that the heating only went on in his house last week. ""I'm quite miserable actually... because I don't like to see the waste of energy,"" he adds. Despite the sincerity with which each of these leaders give their resolutions, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry laughs at their answers. ""It isn't about lists,"" she says. She says politicians often list what they're going to do but that leads to ""broken promises"". ""I just cannot sit back and let this happen again,"" she adds. Ms Berry adds that she isn't a homeowner so finds it difficult to make her privately-rented home more green. Instead, she says, she ""works to change the system"". Â© 2025 BBC.

US lawmakers back HK bill,"Thousands of protesters rallied in Hong Kong on Monday in support of the Human Rights and Democracy Act US lawmakers have supported Hong Kong protesters by passing a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city. The bill - which still needs to pass the upper house, the Senate - would mandate an annual review, to see whether Hong Kong had sufficient autonomy from the rest of China to justify its special trading status. The lower chamber also approved stopping tear gas exports to Hong Kong. On Monday, Hong Kong protesters took to the streets to support the US bill. The bill passed by the House of Representatives - which was introduced in June asHong Kong's protests took hold- says Hong Kong enjoys""unique treatment under US law"",external. ""Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system,"" it says. ""The [annual review] shall assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law as protected by Hong Kong's Basic Law."" Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland. US-China trade war in 300 words The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas, even if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests. And it says anyone ""responsible for abducting and torturing people for exercising internationally-recognized human rights"" should be barred from the US - and have sanctions imposed. The bill was supported by Republicans and Democrats and was passed by a ""voice vote"" in the House of Representatives, meaning a recorded vote was not needed. ""If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interest, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world,"" said house speaker Nancy Pelosi. Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat, said: ""The house just sent a strong message to the people of Hong Kong: we stand with you in the fight for democracy and justice.""

""We express our strong indignation and firm opposition to the US House of Representatives' insistence on passing the so-called 'Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act',"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. China's relationship with the United States would be damaged should the bill become law, the spokesman added. Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement. The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets. Protesters have thrown petrol bombs andattacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing. The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality.

HK leader will 'reflect',"Pro-democracy voters celebrating in Hong Kong Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam has said the government will ""seriously reflect"" after local elections saw massive gains by pro-democracy candidates. Seventeen of the 18 district councils are now controlled by pro-democracy councillors, according to local media. The election, the first since the wave of anti-Beijing protests began, saw an unprecedented turnout of more than 71%. It is being seen as a stinging rebuke of Ms Lam's leadership and a show of support for the protest movement. Hong Kong's young winners and the veterans they toppled Hong Kong has seen months of increasingly violent protests since Ms Lam tried to introduce a controversial bill enabling extradition to China. Carrie Lam has become increasingly unpopular in Hong Kong In a statement released online,externalon Monday, Ms Lam said the government respected the results. She said many felt the results reflected ""people's dissatisfaction with the current situation and the deep-seated problems in society"". The government would ""listen to the opinions of members of the public humbly and seriously reflect"", she said. Some 2.94 million people voted in the election, compared with 1.4 million in 2015. Pro-democracy candidates won close to 60% of the total vote on Sunday, but achieved a landslide in terms of seats because of the first-past-the-post system, local media report. Pro-democracy contenders were victorious in 347 of the 452 district council seats up for grabs; pro-Beijing candidates won 60 seats; while independents - many of them pro-democracy - got 45, according to the South China Morning Post. In the last election four years ago, pro-Beijing councillors won 298 seats, but the distribution of these seats meant they took control of all 18 district councils. They retained control of only the Islands District Council after Sunday's vote. The territory's district councillors have little political power and mainly deal with local issues such as bus routes and rubbish collection, so the district elections do not normally generate such interest. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result But the councillors also get to choose 117 of their number to sit on the 1,200-member committee that selects Hong Kong's chief executive, who is then formally appointed by the Chinese government. The landslide results mean all of those 117 seats are now likely to go to pro-democracy candidates, so they will have a greater influence over that decision, which is set to be made in 2022. Read more on how Hong Kong is run But the result is also highly symbolic, as it was the first opportunity for people to express at the ballot box their view of Ms Lam's handling of the crisis. The government, and China's leaders in Beijing, had been hoping the election would bring a show of support from the so-called ""silent majority"" which they say disapproves of the protests. But that did not materialise - instead some high-profile pro-Beijing candidates lost their seats as voters  backed pro-democracy candidates. The hope from activists is that the overwhelming victory of anti-establishment parties will force the government to take their demands more seriously. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he welcomed the holding of the elections, which he described as ""an important opportunity for the people of Hong Kong to make their voices heard"". ""There is now an opportunity to find a way through the crisis with political dialogue that reflects the legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong and respects the one country two systems model,"" he said. By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Hong Kong So what now? Will the protests resume? It seems almost certain they will, unless the government starts responding to protesters' demands. Carrie Lam has acknowledged that the results show dissatisfaction with her administration, and promised to listen in a spirit of humility. But she can only make concessions if China agrees. Beijing may prefer to see her replaced by a less toxic figure. But there are challenges too for the opposition. The new intake of young councillors will have to take on the responsibility of addressing local concerns, like public transport and other amenities, rather than the grander ideals of democracy. They will need to work together more effectively than they have in the past, and work out how the demands and tactics of more radical protesters can most effectively be channelled to get concessions from a Chinese central government unnerved by yet another show of defiance in Hong Kong. There has been no official comment from Beijing. But Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking in Japan, reiterated that ""no matter what happens, Hong Kong is a part of China"". ""Any attempt to mess up Hong Kong, or even damage its prosperity and stability, will not succeed,"" he said. State media outlets have been cautious in reporting the results. State news agency Xinhua reported the votes had been counted, but did not detail the results. It said ""some rioters harassed patriotic candidates"" on election day, and that the ""most pressing task for Hong Kong at present is still to bring the violence and chaos to an end and restore order"". Meanwhile, the English edition of state-backed tabloid Global Times attributed the result to the ""abnormal"" circumstances which made it easier for the pro-democracy camp to mobilise their voters. It also alleged that ""Western forces"" have been supporting the opposition. Ahead of the vote, state media had been urging people to vote for stability and against the unrest. Hong Kong, once a British colony, is part of China, butit has some autonomy and people have more rightsthan on the mainland That special status is set to expire in 2047, and many in Hong Kong do not want to become ""another Chinese city"". The current protests started in June against a planned law which would have cleared the way for criminal suspects to be extradited to the mainland. Many feared this would undermine the city's freedoms or be used to silence anti-Beijing voices. The bill was withdrawn in September,but demonstrations continued. Clashes between police and activists have become increasingly violent, with police firing live bullets and protesters attacking officers with bows and arrows or throwing petrol bombs. The demands of the protesters, mostly young people, have expanded to include genuine universal suffrage and an inquiry into allegations of police brutality.

Hong Kong's young winners,"A record breaking number of people turned out to vote Hong Kong's district elections have delivered an unprecedented landslide victory for the city's pro-democracy movement, leaving the government reeling. For months, young people have visibly been at the helm of demonstrations, protests and clashes, sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill which morphed into a broader cry for democracy and police accountability. These elections saw many young and novice candidates take on political heavyweights - in the name of Hong Kong's democracy movement - and emerge victorious. Here are four of their stories. Jimmy Sham has been attacked twice this year In the months since the protest movement began, Jimmy Sham has been beaten up twice - by unknown hammer and bat-wielding assailants for reasons that still remain unclear. Nevertheless the 32-year-old leader of the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), one of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy groups which has organised several major rallies, has emerged one of the biggest winners. He won his seat in the Lek Yuen constituency by almost 1,000 votes over the incumbent Michael Wong of the pro-Beijing Civil Force. Mr Sham  might have risen to prominence as leader of the CHRF but he has been an active LGBT rights campaigner for years and even in the last few months his gay identity became the focus of attacks on him on social media. The most recent physical assault on Mr Sham in Octoberleft him lying in the street and covered in blood. The CHRF linked that attack to government supporters. Why are there protests in Hong Kong? What is the Basic Law and how does it work? HK leader will 'seriously reflect' after election He persisted with his vocal campaign and is quoted as saying after his victory:  ""No matter how strong Carrie Lam is I hope she can comply with the wishes of the people, fulfil the five demands [and] give the youngsters a chance."" Karrine Fu won her Fort Street constituency by the smallest of margins - just 59 votes. The 23-year-old was born and bred in the Fortress Hill area. She is a third-generation Fujianese  Hong Konger - so is part of a community who came over from China's Fujian province and which is known to be more conservative and pro-Beijing. It makes her victory all the more remarkable. She defeated the incumbent, 45-year-old Hung Lin Cham, a secondary school teacher representing the main pro-Beijing Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB), who won the past three elections without contest. He is also of Fujianese descent and has held sway over this relatively conservative pro-Beijing  stronghold since 2007. According to news outlet HK01, Ms Fu,  an arts graduate from the University of Hong Kong, decided to run in the district elections precisely because of the anti-government protests. She told the news outlet that she felt ""encouraged"" to do more for Hong Kong as a result of the movement. Reports say she was offered a job in a school but turned it down because of the protests. The university leader beat ""triple councillor"" Horace Cheung By winning the Sai Wan constituency last night, a fourth-year politics and public administration student took out one of the biggest political scalps of the election: Horace Cheung. Mr Cheung is the vice-chairman of the DAB - Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing party. Jordan Pang made his name with his articulacy and passionate advocacy of the protesters' cause as leader of the Hong Kong University Students' Union. He defeated Mr Cheung, a 45-year-old solicitor who had represented Sai Wan since 2011, by almost 800 votes: a man who was known as a ""triple councillor"" having held positions in the district council, Legislative Council and Executive Council. His opponent said the results of the elections were ""not much to do with local district work"". In a statement on Facebook, Mr Pang said he was ""humbled"" by the victory but added that there was ""still a long road ahead"". The 21-year-old is one of several high-profile student leaders who have received threatening anonymous messages. Mr Pang said he was told to surrender to the police, or face death - but he continued with his campaign. ""The victory today and record-shattering turnout rate reflects exactly the voice of the people amidst this critical plight,"" he told supporters. Cary Lo of the Democratic Party won by around 1,200 votes In what is being celebrated as perhaps the most unexpected victory by pro-democracy activists, Cary Lo of the Democratic Party unseated pro-Beijing politician Junius Ho. The 37-year-old compliance officer beat Mr Ho - one of the city's most controversial politicians - by around 1,200 votes in the Lok Tsui constituency. Mr Ho, a 57-year-old lawyer, became a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council in 2016 and so he remains a lawmaker. This video can not be played A winner and a loser in Hong Kong's historic poll result But he has recently become a hate-figure among pro-democracy activists, who accused him of helping orchestrate an attack on activists and passers-by in the district of Yuen Long. He denies such links but the anger persisted and earlier this month he was stabbed while campaigning by a man who pretended to be one of his supporters. After the results came out, images of crowds apparently cheering his defeat were circulated on social media. ""I'm moved, the opposition overwhelmed me with congratulations,"" said Mr Ho on social media. ""It is not a bad things to transform their brutality to harmony."" As far as the man who defeated him goes, his Facebook campaign page features footage of him jogging along Hong Kong's waterfront amid friendly exchanges with residents. For all his campaign cunning, many analysts would argue that simply being an alternative to Junius Ho was Cary Lo's major advantage. HK leader will 'reflect' after election rout How is Hong Kong run?

What are the key policies in the Labour manifesto?,"The Labour Party has launched its 2019 election manifesto, with the slogan It's Time For Real Change. It sets out the policies the party aims to introduce should it win the election. Thefull document,externalruns to 105 pages. But what are the promises that will grab the public's attention, and potentially win over voters on polling day, 12 December? The party also wants to cut private provision in the NHS. The 4.3% per year rise is at the top end of what health think tanks and analysts have been calling for. Labour would also have to find money to cover revenue lost from its pledges to scrap prescription, basic dentistry and hospital car parking charges. A key section covers Labour's plan to cut private provision in the NHS, which currently accounts for about 7% of the health budget in England. This would clearly involve outsourced contracts, for example for physiotherapy and community health. But will NHS hospitals suddenly see their waiting lists balloon as a result of operations outsourced to private hospitals being brought back into the public sector? And are these pledges longer-term aspirations or shorter-term priorities? Healthcare is devolved so these policies would apply to England only, but the devolved nations would benefit from the funding. This video can not be played ""Rail, mail, water and energy into public ownership"": Jeremy Corbyn launches Labour's manifesto Labour will renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, and hold a referendum on the deal or Remain within six months The short section called ""The Final Say on Brexit"" only begins on page 89 of this manifesto. The other main UK-wide parties have simple slogans, but Labour's policy is more complicated and doesn't fit on a manifesto cover or the side of a bus. It promises to renegotiate a new Brexit deal within three months, based on a new UK-EU customs union and close EU single market alignment. It would also give EU nationals living and working in the UK the automatic right to stay. That deal would then be put to a legally-binding referendum within six months, alongside the option to remain in the EU. Labour wants to appeal to both Leavers and Remainers and to give the people the final say. It would implement the referendum result immediately. But Mr Corbyn will not say how he would vote in it. And that continues to divert attention away from his other practical policies. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Update: On 22 November Jeremy Corbyn revealed that he would remain neutral if there was another referendum. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Will this be a Brexit election? It would boost anyone over the age of 25 earning the minimum wage, known as the National Living Wage. The Conservatives had already announced the living wage would gradually increase to Â£10.50 over the next six years. Labour is now promising more and faster, with all workers over 16 years old getting Â£10 an hour within the next year. It is an attempt to tackle the growing issue of in-work poverty. It's cheaper than other policy announcements because employers, rather than government, mostly pay the wages, but it's a big jump for them to swallow in a very short timeframe. Labour is also promising extra measures to boost workers' rights, including longer maternity and paternity pay, and guaranteed bereavement pay. This would apply to the whole of the UK. How high could the lowest wages go? Is the minimum wage enough to live on? Pension age would remain at 66 while retirement ages for those in arduous and stressful jobs will be reviewed. Not long ago, government number-crunchers suggested workers under 30 may not receive a state pension until they turned 70. So Labour's plan to freeze the state pension age at 66 for the foreseeable future has been called a ""gargantuan promise"" by one analyst. It would cost billions of pounds more than most recent government plans to raise the age for men and women to 68 by 2039. Yet, it would clearly be popular among middle-age voters. For existing pensioners, the so-called triple-lock - linking annual state pension rises to the highest of average earnings, the cost of living, or 2.5% - would continue, as all the major parties have promised. There are also pitches to specific groups. The so-called Waspi women - born in the 1950s and furious with ""surprise"" pension age changes - are promised compensation. This would apply to the whole of the UK. The fight over women's pensions Why 70 may be the new 65 Provide ""community-based, person-centred"" support in England, including free personal care. Labour's plan for a comprehensive National Care Service is bold. The question will be whether their costings stand-up to scrutiny. That is not just about the affordability of the plan now, but also its cost as the population ages. At the heart of the policy is free personal care for older people who need help with day-to-day tasks like washing, dressing and medication. This system already operates in Scotland, but in England, the idea was rejected 20 years ago by the then-Labour government as too expensive. There are also promises to double the number of people receiving help, so easing NHS pressures. Plans to reform the care system have ended up as political footballs in past elections - the challenge for Labour will be building a consensus around their ideas. Health and social care is devolved. This would apply to England only. Will Jeremy Corbyn's long march lead to power? To put the UK on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s. The date for reducing carbon emissions to effectively zero is much sooner than the government envisages. It's not quite the neat formulation of ""net zero"" by 2030 that many party activists wanted (and the Green Party has promised). Instead, in one line, the document talks of achieving ""the substantial majority of our emissions reductions"" by 2030. In another, it mentions putting the UK ""on track for a net-zero carbon energy system within the 2030s"". Presumably that creates enough stretch room to get to 2040 - five years earlier than the Lib Dems' target year and 10 years earlier than the Tories. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external BREXIT:Where do the parties stand? The party will nationalise the so-called big six energy firms, National Grid, the water industry, Royal Mail, railways and the broadband arm of BT. Labour's manifesto is one of the most radical proposed overhauls of the way companies are owned and run in decades. It would mark the biggest ownership takeover by the state since the nationalisations that occurred after the outbreak of World War Two. Those companies that Labour does not want to own and operate themselves will also face a huge change in the way they are supervised by government. The current inhabitants of company boardrooms are very aware life would be very different under a Labour government. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost? Start work on a new benefits system to replace controversial benefit. Labour's plan to scrap Universal Credit deals with its immediate concerns about the much-criticised benefit. However, the party does not say what it would replace it with. Universal Credit was originally introduced to tackle the complexity and unfairness of the existing benefits system. But many of the accompanying changes became linked to austerity measures like benefit caps. Going back to the system which Universal Credit replaced would create its own problems. And its introduction shows just how difficult it can be to devise a new system that works. Labour has said it will start work on ideas for a new system immediately, but getting that right is likely to take years. This would apply across the UK. There are also plans to scrap tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants for the poorest students. The controversial policy of abolishing private schools, voted through at conference, is being parked for the moment. But there is a firm commitment to remove their charitable tax status. The big pledge, as in 2017, is the abolition of tuition fees. Universities will worry that the commitment to find public money to replace them could come under pressure if public finances tighten. Scrapping tuition fees will benefit the wealthiest students most. Maintenance grants would be restored for the poorest. The combined cost is estimated at Â£12bn a year. On school funding, Labour's promise goes further than the Conservatives and Lib Dems. By 2022-2023, spending would be Â£10.5bn higher in cash terms, which would reverse cuts (and then some) made since 2010. Education is devolved. This would apply to England only. Labour will also bring the railways back into public ownership. Labour says it will bring the railways back into public ownership when the current rail franchises expire. The party says that means there will be no cost to the government as the contracts will have ended. However, it is unclear who will then own the trains and the associated costs. The use of driver-only operated trains will also be stopped, having caused years of disruption because of industrial action by disgruntled staff. Industry estimates this would cost more than Â£200m a year. And the bus system will fall under council control again while thousands of routes that have been cut will be reinstated. Free bus travel is also promised for under-25s. The costs for this are not provided in the manifesto. Labour promises a Â£250bn green transformation fund; HS2 will be built and extended into Scotland and long-suffering train passengers in the north of England will get ""Crossrail for the North"". Transport is partly devolved. Free bus travel for under-25s would apply to England only, while infrastructure projects and renationalisation would apply across the UK. It will mean EU citizens in the UK no longer have to apply to continue living and working in the country. The settlement scheme was set up by the Conservative government to formalise the rights of EU citizens to continue living and working in the UK after Brexit. Ministers have claimed the system is working well with applications from around 2.45 million people so far. But that means almost one million EU nationals have yet to sign up, raising concerns that some who have difficulty proving they've been in Britain could be at risk of deportation. Labour's proposal would end the worry and uncertainty for EU citizens in Britain, but it could create problems for border staff after Brexit in distinguishing between those who've already been living in the UK and new arrivals who may have certain restrictions. This policy would apply to the whole of the UK. Start a rapid programme of homebuilding. Labour's promise to build 100,000 council homes and 50,000 housing association properties a year by the end of the five-year Parliament marks a rapid change. Building on this scale has not been seen for 40 years. The UK's population is getting older and one in five people has a disability, so the type of homes proposed will face close scrutiny.  There are also questions over the availability of construction workers to build them. More people have rented from private landlords than social ones since 2013. Many are aged under 35. For them, rent controls would aim to keep down costs by linking rent rises to inflation (the cost of living) and giving city authorities the power to be even stricter. This will reignite debate over their effectiveness. The plan for a new Department for Housing shows how central this area is to Labour's key policies.

Tory and Labour spending plans 'not credible' - IFSThe influential group said both main parties were not being honest ahead of the general election.Election 2019,"This video can not be played Parties react to IFS analysis of manifesto spending plans Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are offering ""credible"" spending plans ahead of the general election, an influential research group has said. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said it was ""highly likely"" the Tories would end up spending more than their manifesto pledges. Labour, it warned, would be unable to deliver its spending increases as it has promised. Neither party was being ""honest"" with voters, IFS director Paul Johnson said. The Liberal Democrats' manifesto, he said, would involve lower levels of borrowing than under Labour or the Conservatives, but would still be seen as ""radical"" in ""most periods"". However, he added that, given the uncertainty around Brexit, it was difficult to determine what the exact effects of the three parties' offers would be. Labour, the Conservatives and the Lib Dems have all published their manifestos, including spending and taxation plans, ahead of the 12 December general election. More on the IFS report: Our Reality Check team analyse spending pledges Labour is promising to renationalise rail, mail, water and energy, as well as give a 5% pay increase to public sector workers in its first year in government, if elected. The Lib Dems say stopping Brexit would deliver an extra Â£10bn a year for public services - they also want to increase all income tax rates by 1% to fund more NHS spending. The Conservatives have pledged to postpone a scheduled corporation tax cut - from 19% to 17% - to increase spending on public services. This video can not be played IFS: 'The choice could not be clearer' for voters Paul Johnson said that, under Tory plans, spending on public services apart from healthcare would still be 14% lower by 2023/24 than it was in 2010/11. Despite this, he said the Conservatives were continuing to ""pretend that tax rises will never be needed to secure decent public services"" - and said a pledge from the party not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT over the next five years was ""ill-advised"". ""It is highly likely that the Conservatives would end up spending more than their manifesto implies, and thus taxing or borrowing more,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said it was ""highly likely"" Labour would need to raise taxes beyond what it is promising to pay for its proposed Â£80bn a year in extra spending. He said it was ""clearly not the case"" the party's plans would see taxes rise for only the richest 5% of taxpayers. The IFS said Labour plans to scrap a tax break for married couples and change taxes on company dividends would affect people outside this earnings bracket. It also argued the party's planned rise in corporation tax would be passed on to workers in the form of lower wages, and to consumers in the form of higher prices. ""In reality, a change in the scale and the scope of the state that they propose would require more broad-based tax increases at some point,"" Mr Johnson added. It's a plague on all your houses - but for very different reasons. The main criticism of Labour is that its spending on investment is just so big, it wouldn't be able to deliver it. The IFS also says it is highly likely the party's tax rises would impact, directly or indirectly, on more than just the top 5% of earners. There's no respite for the Conservatives though - particularly on their pledge not to extend the transition period included in the PM's Brexit deal beyond 2020, even if a trade deal has not been agreed. The idea that the UK might have to trade on World Trade Organisation terms is seen by these economists as something which would be highly damaging to the economy. It says this could cause an increase in the deficit of the same order, potentially even higher, than would be caused by Labour's tax and spending plans. Paul Johnson also said a Labour manifesto pledge to abolish poverty for people in work over the next five years was ""not achievable"", and a plan to scrap theuniversal creditbenefits payment scheme would be ""expensive, disruptive and unnecessary"". He criticised the party's promise to pay compensation tomore than three million womenaffected by an accelerated rise in the state pension age. Mr Johnson said there may be scope for ""much more limited compensation"", but the group was ""relatively well off on average"". He also criticised the Tories for failing to ""come up with any kind of plan or any kind of money for social care"". Conservative manifesto - our analysis of key policies Labour manifesto -  our analysis of key policies Lib Dem manifesto -  our analysis of key policies Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party's manifesto was ""bold"", ""ambitious"", ""prepared for"" and had been fully costed. He said he was ""very confident"" it would improve the ""lifestyle and life chances"" of the poorest people in the UK. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said his party's manifesto had made ""very substantial commitments,"" but also insisted it was ""fully costed"". He added that Labour's spending plans followed an ""out-and-out socialist approach"" that would ""push up taxes massively"". Lib Dem deputy leader Sir Ed Davey said the IFS assessment ""shows that neither the Tories or Labour have a credible plan for the economy"". ""Both are failing to come clean with the electorate and ignoring the Brexit black hole their plans would leave in the public finances,"" he added.

"Peacocks set to rescue BonmarchÃ© from collapseA deal for the fashion chain draws closer, but 30 stores are to shut putting up to 240 jobs at risk.Business","BonmarchÃ©, the womenswear retailer that fell into administration in October, is set to be rescued by rival Peacocks. Peacocks has been named the ""preferred bidder"" for the business, although further negotiations are needed before the deal is secured. However, 30 BonmarchÃ© stores will now be closed by 11 December, the administrators said, putting up to 240 jobs at risk. BonmarchÃ©'s 285 remaining stores will continue to trade. The administrators said the ""vast majority"" of these were expected to be bought by Peacocks. However, they added: ""The future of all remaining stores cannot be assured at this time and remain subject to negotiation between any future purchaser and landlords given the period of historical market difficulty on the High Street. Administrators FRP Advisory said 25 posts have already been made redundant in a number of head office and middle management roles. A spokesperson for Peacocks said: ""We are working very hard to reach a deal that secures the future of the company and the greatest number of jobs. But given the unprecedented pressures the business continues to face, it is also important to recognise this cannot be assured at this time. ""We will now enter a period of advanced negotiations with the administrator and landlords to find a way forward that provides a sustainable, long-term future for the business."" Tony Wright, joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory, said: ""There is still a lot more work to do before we can secure the future of the business. ""Whilst we are optimistic that a transaction can be completed, ultimately, it will depend on ongoing negotiations between our preferred bidder and landlords on market rents and there remains a risk that the business could cease to trade."" BonmarchÃ© appoints administrators Retailers shut 2,870 stores in first half of 2019 Peacocks has about 500 stores in the UK and was founded by Albert Frank Peacock in Warrington in 1884 as a penny bazaar, selling ""anything and everything"", according to its website. In 1940, the business moved to Cardiff, and from the 1990s it focused on clothing. It was bought out of administration itself in 2012 by Edinburgh Woollen Mill. The UK's High Streets have seen a wave of store closures News of the latest potential deal comes after a previous offer was rejected in April. BonmarchÃ© told its shareholders that an offer made by Peacock's billionaire owner, Philip Day, undervalued the business and its future prospects. But BonmarchÃ© entered administration last month, wiping out a stake Mr Day had already built up in the company. BonmarchÃ© is among a number of High Street retailers to have fallen on hard times in recent years. The sector has been hit by a combination of growing competition from online retailers and higher operating costs, such as rising business rates and the minimum wage. Research by PwC and the Local Data Company found that a net 1,234 stores closed on the UK's top 500 High Streets in the first half of the year, with fashion retailers seeing the biggest declines. The figure was up from 1,123 in the same period a year earlier and was the highest since the survey began in 2010.

How 'the stars aligned' for a Pussycat Dolls reunionThe group are reuniting for a string of UK live dates - but Melody isn't taking part.Entertainment & Arts,"L-R: Kimberly Wyatt, Jessica Sutta, Nicole Scherzinger, Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar The Pussycat Dolls reunion was supposed to be top secret. Rumours had been swirling for several months, but journalists were under instruction not to confirm anything ahead of the group's surprise reunion performance on X Factor: Celebrity this weekend. Louis Walsh, however, may have missed the memo. ""You know who's coming on? The Pussycat Dolls are the special guests!""he told Lorraine Kelly,externalduring a live TV interview on Monday. ""There's an exclusive for you. They're back together."" The pussycat was firmly out of the bag. ""Half the time, Louis doesn't even know what he's talking about, so I was just surprised he got that one right,"" laughs his co-judge Nicole Scherzinger, lead singer of the Dolls. ""You could see in his face though,"" adds Carmit Bachar. ""After he said it, he was like 'did I just drop the ball?'"" It's now beenofficiallyannounced that Nicole and Carmit, along with Ashley Roberts, Kimberly Wyatt and Jessica Sutta, are all set to return for nine live UK shows in April 2020. ""It's been a few years in the making,"" explains Kimberly. ""But I think ultimately there's some unfinished business with the Pussycat Dolls. The Pussycat Dolls had UK number one hits with Stickwitu and Don't Cha ""We're ready to get out there and do what we love. And the stars aligned. We've all been busy making babies and all those kinds of things,"" she adds (before Nicole interjects: ""Speak for yourself!""). The Dolls broke up relatively early, in 2010, having released just two albums. And it's not as if their star was fading at the time they split. They'd scored number one hits in the UK with Stickwitu and Don't Cha, while Jai Ho, Beep, Buttonz and When I Grow Up all hit the top 10 over their five years together. Nonetheless, the group splintered off for various solo projects, but all have kept strong links with the UK. Kimberly now lives in London with her British husband. Ashley appeared on Strictly and I'm A Celebrity and now presents on Heart radio. Nicole has performed in the West End, judged on X Factor and topped the UK singles chart with one of her solo hits, Don't Hold Your Breath. ""LA was our home, but the UK was our second home because the British just scooped us up,"" says Ashley. ""So our lives ended up here as well, some of us, so the fans have just been holding on strong with wanting this reunion and our biggest fanbase is over here."" One member - Melody Thornton - is notably absent from the reunion,amid suggestions,externalthat she was requesting a larger share of the singing parts. Nicole sang 95% of the group's vocals across their first two albums,by her own admission,external. Melody Thornton is not taking part in the reunion Speaking to VH1's Behind The Music in 2012, producer Ron Fair confirmed: ""Melody sang a bit here and there but the records were Nicole, with the exception of an occasional ad lib. They were Nicole."" As a result, Melody has often spoken about feeling under-used as a singer during her time with the group. ""They said, 'we're going to have Nicole do all of the recording, you're going to have to learn to dance with the rest of the girls',""Melody explained earlier this year,externalwhen she was in the UK for Dancing on Ice. ""And for me it really affected my confidence because I wasn't using my best asset [my voice]. And I was the weakest dancer."" Explaining her absence from the reunion tour, Ashley says: ""Mel's got a lot of projects going on in life. ""She was included in all of this, she's our sister, the door is always open, but it just wasn't the right timing for her right now. We wish her well."" The Dolls avoid the question of whether the vocals will be divided up more evenly this time around - which, to be fair, could just be down to the fact they haven't started rehearsals yet. But Nicole says: ""This is a tour that we've never created, so we're really excited. Everybody brings their own unique gifts to the table. The other Dolls were quite literally kept in the shadows during some early performances ""We're just going to push each other, we want to see each other shine, we're going to push the boundaries together as a group with each other, so everybody is going to have their own time to shine."" She breezes past any suggestion that there is disharmony within the group. ""We're not famous for that are we? We get along, it's a sisterhood, we love each other, we have the best chemistry,"" she says. ""We feed off each other, and if we ever have an issue, we've always been open about communication and talking it through. ""Naturally, when you're so close, there may be some disagreements, some arguments. But that's the beauty, what makes you stronger. We've evolved so much. Like, bye drama! We want this to be really enjoyable for us."" The Dolls were known for their suggestive outfits and dancing, which occasionally landed them in trouble. A company who booked them for a gig in Malaysia in 2006was fined after authorities objected to their sexually explicit dancing.,external Culturally, things have shifted a little since then. Lingerie brandVictoria's Secret announced last weekthey were dropping their annual fashion show amid criticism it was sexist and outdated. With that in mind, will the Dolls change any of their image or choreography? ""It's evolved, but we are the Pussycat Dolls and we stand together in having fun on stage and embracing our female bodies, whatever shape they may be in,"" says Ashley. Carmen Electra (centre) performing with the Pussycat Dolls in 2002 ""And I think that will continue, fashion has evolved and we get to have fun and play and getting dressed up is what the Dolls is about."" Nicole adds: ""We're excited about being fashion forward. We'll be taking a lot of inspiration from the runways. We really love what Dua [Lipa] has been doing with fashion, so it's going to be the best of both worlds. But danceable!"" The sexually suggestive image is a nod to the Dolls' roots as a burlesque dance troupe. The group, which was founded by Robin Antin in 1995, attracted a huge following in Hollywood, with stars like Britney Spears, Pink and Carmen Electra joining them on stage. Nicole was recruited after auditioning for talent show Popstars to sing the lead vocals, and chart success and headline world tours soon followed. This time around, the five-piece are keen to ensure they savour and enjoy the whole experience. ""It was such a whirlwind,"" Ashley recalls of their rise to fame. ""It was all just going, going, going, and it's hard to stay present within it and have gratitude for that present moment. Ashley Roberts was paired with Pasha Kovalev on last year's Strictly Come Dancing ""But I think with us maturing over the last 10 years and all the life experience that's happened, we can hopefully bring that in and stay within the moment and enjoy it."" The tour could potentially be the first of several new Dolls projects, according to Nicole. ""We're working on new music. But we're doing one thing at a time. We're together, we're focusing, we've got a massive performance [on X Factor] at the end of this week, which is huge for us, and then we're all focusing on the tour."" She adds how much of a relief it is to once again be surrounded by her bandmates after pursuing her own projects for so long. This year alone, Nicole has judged on The Masked Singer, Australia's Got Talent and X Factor: Celebrity. ""I feel blessed because I'm doing all these different shows, different continents, and these press days, it's so much more fun and way easier with the girls 'cause I'm like, 'we got this!'

Mum who neglected son seeking answers over murder,"No-one has ever been convicted of the murder of Rikki Neave A mother who was jailed for neglecting her child but cleared of his murder says she still lives ""under a cloud"", 25 years after his death. Ruth Neave's son Rikki, 6, was found strangled in woodland near their home on the Welland Estate in Peterborough on 29 November 1994. She was acquitted of the murder but the trial heard how she had abused him. Mrs Neave, who is still seeking answers after the case reopened in 2015, said: ""I've hung under a cloud for 25 years."" ""I don't want to live like this,"" she added. Rikki disappeared after leaving their home in Redmile Walk at 09:00 GMT on 28 November to take the five-minute footpath walk to school. Police scoured the estate for the missing boy, co-ordinating groups of volunteers. Rikki's naked body was discovered spread-eagled in undergrowth the following day. Post-mortem tests revealed he had been strangled. His school uniform was found in a nearby bin. Ruth Neave pictured after her arrest - and today The original murder inquiry found a number of assaults on children had been reported in the area in the nine months before Rikki died. However, the finger was pointed at Rikki's mother, after it was revealed the little boy had been on Cambridgeshire social services' ""at-risk"" register, and frequently skipped school. She was arrested in February 1995 and charged with her son's murder three months later. Mrs Neave went on to be cleared of murder by a jury, but admitted child neglect and cruelty charges, for which she served seven years in Holloway prison. The murder trial heard how she had threatened to kill her son, scrawled ""idiot"" across his forehead on one occasion, and squirted washing-up liquid in his mouth. Prosecutors alleged Rikki was killed in a satanic ritual by his mother, telling the jury of her interest in the occult. However, the defence argued an untraced sex attacker was responsible for his death, and she was cleared. Sentencing her for cruelty, the judge said he had rarely come across a case of such ""persistent and systematic"" abuse. Mrs Neave's two other children were taken off her and still do not speak to her. Rikki with his father Trevor Harvey, and Mrs Neave photographed after her conviction for child cruelty Mrs Neave remembers Rikki as a popular and inquisitive boy, with a talent for pulling apart and repairing ""old electrical stuff"" like cassette recorders. ""He was the most special little boy ever, a beautiful personality, very loyal to people, my little best friend,"" she said. ""He was the man of the house. He was his own little spirit. But I think I gave him too much freedom."" On the last morning he left for school, she recalls: ""There was no 'I love you'. He'd gone."" Police on the scene shortly after the murder of Rikki Police chief Paul Fullwood said continued investigations were important so he could reassure Mrs Neave that officers had done their utmost to solve the case. Mr Fullwood, assistant chief constable of Bedfordshire Police, reopened the investigation into Rikki's death, with detectives hoping modern DNA and laser imaging techniques might provide a breakthrough. A BBC Crimewatch appeal also resulted in e-fits being produced of two teenagers - now middle-aged men - who were seen in the area at the time. A police officer lays flowers in tribute to Rikki in 1994 A suspect was arrested in 2016, but released after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence to charge him. That outcome was challenged by Rikki's family through a Victim's Right to Review, with the CPS due to make its final report next month. ""Picking up an inquiry like this has been challenging, it's tested everyone. We're parents ourselves, we're human beings,"" Mr Fullwood said. ""I feel for Ruth and I want to look her in the eye and say we've done everything we can to bring whoever is responsible to justice."" These e-fits were created after a TV appeal for information Bella Saltmarsh, a former housing officer and city councillor in Peterborough, said the community had fought hard to improve its reputation, as the killing ""cast a shadow"" on the Welland Estate. ""This is a not an estate that people choose to live in, but I have never felt unsafe here,"" she said. ""People have worked hard to improve it, but it is one of the most deprived in the country... [although] the community spirit is really strong."" The woodland off Willoughby Court where Rikki's body was found, as it looks today Mrs Neave, who no longer lives in Peterborough, said she would never get over the killing of her son. As the 25th anniversary approaches, only a few close family members know where Rikki's ashes are buried. ""We have a special place,"" Mrs Neave said. ""We'll go and see him.""

Immunotherapy hope for advanced prostate cancer,"A major trial of an immunotherapy drug has shown it can be effective in some men with advanced prostate cancer. The men had stopped responding to the main treatment options. Researchers found that a small proportion of men, described as ""super responders"", remained well even after the trial ended, despite a very poor prognosis before treatment. Last week it was reported the same drug hadproved effective in treating advanced head and neck cancers. Immunotherapy uses our own immune systems to recognise and attack cancer cells. It's already being used as a standard treatment for some cancers such as melanomas - and being tested on many others too. Cancer immunotherapy drug 'prolongs life' Prostate cancer drug hailed as âbig dealâ Half of people surviving 'untreatable cancer' It found that one in 20 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug pembrolizumab - and saw their tumours actually shrink or disappear altogether. Although a relatively small number, some of them gained years of extra life, the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found. A further 19% saw some evidence of improvement. But most patients in the study lived for an average of eight months on the drug. The phase II clinical trial, led by the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden, involved 258 men with advanced prostate cancer who had run out of all other options on treatment. The most dramatic responses were seen in patients whose tumours had mutations in genes involved in repairing DNA. Researchers are now investigating whether this group might benefit the most from immunotherapy in a larger trial. But first, a test to pick out who will respond best is needed, so that doctors know which patients to give it to. It's the most common cancer in men in the UK, witharound 47,700 diagnosed in the UK each year,external. The number of people diagnosed has been rising over the last 10 years. This is probably because the population is getting older and more people are having PSA tests. Around 30% of men with advanced or stage 4 prostate cancer survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis. ""Immunotherapy has had tremendous benefits for some cancer patients, and it's fantastic news that even in prostate cancer, where we don't see much immune activity, a proportion of men are responding well to treatment,"" says Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research. ""A limitation with immunotherapy is that there's no good test to pick out those who are most likely to respond. ""It's encouraging to see testing for DNA repair mutations may identify some patients who are more likely to respond, and I'm keen to see how the new, larger trial in this group of patients plays out."" Professor Johann de Bono, a consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, was one of those who led the study. He said: ""We don't see much activity from the immune system in prostate tumours, so many oncologists thought immunotherapy wouldn't work for this cancer type. ""But our study shows that a small proportion of men with end-stage cancer do respond, and crucially that some of these men do very well indeed. ""We found that men with mutations in DNA repair genes respond especially well to immunotherapy, including two of my own patients who have now been on the drug for more than two years."" Last week, a separate trial found the same drug kept some people's advanced head and neck cancers at bay for an average of two years - five times longer than under chemotherapy. Both studies are part of a growing body of research suggesting immunotherapy could offer hope to an increasing number of cancer patients.

Peacocks set to rescue BonmarchÃ© from collapse,"BonmarchÃ©, the womenswear retailer that fell into administration in October, is set to be rescued by rival Peacocks. Peacocks has been named the ""preferred bidder"" for the business, although further negotiations are needed before the deal is secured. However, 30 BonmarchÃ© stores will now be closed by 11 December, the administrators said, putting up to 240 jobs at risk. BonmarchÃ©'s 285 remaining stores will continue to trade. The administrators said the ""vast majority"" of these were expected to be bought by Peacocks. However, they added: ""The future of all remaining stores cannot be assured at this time and remain subject to negotiation between any future purchaser and landlords given the period of historical market difficulty on the High Street. Administrators FRP Advisory said 25 posts have already been made redundant in a number of head office and middle management roles. A spokesperson for Peacocks said: ""We are working very hard to reach a deal that secures the future of the company and the greatest number of jobs. But given the unprecedented pressures the business continues to face, it is also important to recognise this cannot be assured at this time. ""We will now enter a period of advanced negotiations with the administrator and landlords to find a way forward that provides a sustainable, long-term future for the business."" Tony Wright, joint administrator and partner at FRP Advisory, said: ""There is still a lot more work to do before we can secure the future of the business. ""Whilst we are optimistic that a transaction can be completed, ultimately, it will depend on ongoing negotiations between our preferred bidder and landlords on market rents and there remains a risk that the business could cease to trade."" BonmarchÃ© appoints administrators Retailers shut 2,870 stores in first half of 2019 Peacocks has about 500 stores in the UK and was founded by Albert Frank Peacock in Warrington in 1884 as a penny bazaar, selling ""anything and everything"", according to its website. In 1940, the business moved to Cardiff, and from the 1990s it focused on clothing. It was bought out of administration itself in 2012 by Edinburgh Woollen Mill. The UK's High Streets have seen a wave of store closures News of the latest potential deal comes after a previous offer was rejected in April. BonmarchÃ© told its shareholders that an offer made by Peacock's billionaire owner, Philip Day, undervalued the business and its future prospects. But BonmarchÃ© entered administration last month, wiping out a stake Mr Day had already built up in the company. BonmarchÃ© is among a number of High Street retailers to have fallen on hard times in recent years. The sector has been hit by a combination of growing competition from online retailers and higher operating costs, such as rising business rates and the minimum wage. Research by PwC and the Local Data Company found that a net 1,234 stores closed on the UK's top 500 High Streets in the first half of the year, with fashion retailers seeing the biggest declines. The figure was up from 1,123 in the same period a year earlier and was the highest since the survey began in 2010.

Trump signs law backing Hong Kong protesters,"Anti-government protests have been held in Hong Kong since June US President Donald Trump has signed into law a bill that supports pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. The Human Rights and Democracy Act mandates an annual review, to check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify its special status with the US. Mr Trump said he signed the law ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"". China's foreign ministry threatened ""counter measures"" if the US continued ""going down the wrong path"". Mr Trump is currently seeking a deal with China, in order to end a trade war between the two countries. ""The US has been disregarding facts and distorting truth,""a Chinese foreign ministry statement said.,external ""It openly backed violent criminals who rampantly smashed facilities, set fire, assaulted innocent civilians, trampled on the rule of law, and jeopardized social order."" The foreign ministry summoned the US ambassador to demand that Washington stops interfering in Chinese internal affairs. Hong Kong's government also reacted, saying the American bill would send the wrong signal and would not help to ease the situation. But a key activist in the Hong Kong protest movement, Joshua Wong, said the US law was a ""remarkable achievement"" for ""all Hongkongers"". US-China trade war in 300 words Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Aftermath of Hong Kong university siege Mr Trump had previously been non-committal about whether he would sign the bill, saying he was ""with"" Hong Kong but also that Mr Xi was ""an incredible guy"". President Trump said he signed the bill ""out of respect for President Xi [Jinping], China, and the people of Hong Kong"" However, the bill had widespread congressional support, which meant that even if he vetoed it, lawmakers could potentially have voted to overturn his decision. The president also signed a second bill, which bans the export of crowd-control munitions to the police in Hong Kong - including tear gas, rubber bullets and stun guns. ""[The bills] are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of China and Hong Kong will be able to amicably settle their differences, leading to long-term peace and prosperity for all,"" Mr Trump said. The bill was introduced in June in the early stages of the protests in Hong Kong, and wasoverwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives last month. It says: ""Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system. ""The [annual review] shall assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law as protected by Hong Kong's Basic Law."" Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland. The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas, even if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests. Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement. The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets. Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and attacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing. This video can not be played The history behind Hong Kong's identity crisis and protests - first broadcast November 2019 The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality. On Sunday,Hong Kong held local council electionsthat were seen as a barometer of public opinion towards the government and the protesters. The elections saw a landslide victory for the pro-democracy movement, with 17 of the 18 councils now controlled by pro-democracy councillors. On Thursday, authorities moved into the Polytechnic University days after it had beenthe site of a fierce standoffbetween student activists and riot police. The police searched the campus for dangerous items, to gather evidence and to see whether any students were still left on the site. US lawmakers back bill to support HK protesters Why Starbucks?

Massive Attack in live music climate change plan,"Massive Attack are donating four years of touring data for the report. Scientists from theUniversity of Manchester,externalare creating a blueprint to help bands and pop stars to perform live and tour the world without contributing to climate change. It's after theTyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,externalwere approached by the group Massive Attack who say they want to help find solutions to the climate crisis. The findings will be shared with musicians from across the industry and, it's hoped, will inspire millions of fans to live more sustainably. Massive Attack have spent a lot of 2019 with the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, even playing a set at one of their protests in London in April. Robert del Naja, aka 3D, told the BBC he felt conflicted because of how his career has contributed to climate change. ""[As musicians] we have enjoyed a high carbon lifestyle. But as a society we've all existed in a fossil fuel economy for a long time and had very little choice in that. ""The challenge now is to not only make personal sacrifices, but to insist on the systemic change that's needed. Business as usual is over."" The news comes a week afterColdplay announced they would not tour with their latest album for environmental reasons. This video can not be played Chris Martin: ""Everyone will catch up if you prove that it's easy to do it the right way"" Meanwhile, Billie Eilish is offering fans a chance to earn tickets to her next tour by fighting climate change and there'll be eco-villages at each concert where fans can learn more about the issues facing the planet. What will the scientists be looking at? This new research will look at all aspects of touring and how its carbon footprint can be reduced to zero, or as close to zero as possible. It's not looking simply at balancing out emissions from concerts by planting trees for removing carbon dioxide from the air - a process known as carbon offsetting. Instead, researchers will look at how to reduce the amount of energy used during concerts and in moving musicians, crews and sets between different venues and cities, as well as the impact audiences have. Tyndall Manchester's Director, Prof Carly McLachlan, says they'll be looking at where switches can be made to renewable energy sources, how to reduce the amount of energy being consumed but also thinking about how touring could be different. ""It is a high carbon sector and we need to try and tackle that, because every sector has to be part of the transition to a low-carbon economy."" It's not yet known what impact, if any, changing the way tours are put on will have on ticket prices, routes or number of concerts. Glastonbury festival-goers were praised this year by Sir David Attenborough for cutting back on their plastic use. Just how bad is live music for the environment? Musicians are often criticised when they speak out about climate change and carbon because they have high carbon lifestyles. Promoting albums and performing in cities around the world means artists and their teams fly a lot. Then there are the carbon emissions from tour buses, from moving sets, from making merchandise, on top of the energy needed for things like lighting and sound. Recent figures,externalsuggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK every year. Prof Carly McLachlan says music and art and culture are a ""really beautiful part of what it is to be human"". ""If this is something we really value in our lives, we need to make sure we can do it in a way that has reduced impact."" Follow Laura ontwitter,external.

Stormzy posed with the Labour leader at an awards ceremony in 2017 The Grime 4 Corbyn campaign group says a Conservative win at the election could lead to people ""dying from austerity cuts"" and ""freezing to death in their homes"". Co-organiser Sofia Mason, who grew up in east London, says the importance of the election in two weeks ""can't be overstated"". The campaign group, which counts Stormzy and DJ Logan Sama among its supporters, was inspired by grime artists expressing support for the Jeremy Corbyn at the 2017 election, and works with musicians to put on events. Ms Mason describes Mr Corbyn as the ""exact opposite"" of Conservative leader Boris Johnson, who she says people view as ""a liar"" and ""self-serving"". ""Since the last election we have seen the Tories' true colours with the Windrush atrocities and the tragedy of Grenfell burning to the ground. It is clear they don't care about our lives,"" she says. Read more: Is grime still '4 Corbyn'? Head over to our news channelnow if you want to catch this week's Brexitcast. Tonight Chris Mason and Adam Fleming are joined by BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith, in the absence of Laura Kuenssberg and Katya Adler. The Conservative Party has refused to take Facebook adverts down after the BBC complained that it had distorted footage. But what are these adverts about? One of the ads the BBC has taken issue with includes an edited clip of our political editor Laura Kuenssberg saying ""pointless delay to Brexit"", followed by newsreader Huw Edwards stating ""another Brexit delay"". It also features the caption: ""A hung parliament = gridlock. Stop the chaos. Vote Conservative."" The BBC News press team said adverts using edited BBC content are a ""completely unacceptable use of BBC content which distorts our output and which could damage perceptions of our impartiality"". It has asked the Conservatives to remove the adverts. The Facebook Ad Library -which the technology company launched in the UK last year to make campaigning on its platform more ""transparent""- says the Tories have spent up to Â£2,000 on several versions of the advert so far. It is being targeted at 35 to 54-year-olds in England. Our digital elections reporter tweets... The Conservative Party hits back at the BBC's criticism of its Facebook advert that used edited BBC footage. As per our post at 18:45, the BBC Press Office says the Tories ""distorted"" BBC content to use in Facebook adverts. But the Tories disagree and say they aren't going to remove the ad. The Conservative Party spokesman has made a bit of a slip-up though, calling on people to vote for Boris Johnson on 13 December (the election is on 12 December, folks). Allow Twitter content?

If you're just joining us, here's a quick summary of what's been happening today. Speaking about tonight's Channel 4
leadersâ climate debate, Rebecca
Newsom from Greenpeace UK says it ""laid bare the ambitions of
the leaders who took part, and exposed the disregard for this existential
crisis of those who couldnât be bothered to turn up."" She praises ""strong action plans"" on energy systems and homes, but says the leaders ""dodged"" sectors that required bigger personal lifestyle changes like flying and meat consumption. Max Wakefield,
director at Possible, an organisation advocating for a zero carbon society, says the debate proved the issue would not be sidelined in elections ""as it has in the past"". ""And no
matter what the result of this election, it will not be forgotten that Boris
Johnson refused to spend an hour of his time telling the public how he plans to
tackle the greatest threat to our society and the natural world,""  he says. Reality Check Jo Swinson said: ""We need to make sure that now we have a target for all new-build homes to be zero carbon and to have those high standards. And the Conservatives who can't be bothered to turn up tonight scrapped those plans."" Plans to make all UK homes zero-carbon were first proposed by Gordon Brown in 2006, and cancelled by the Conservative government in 2015. Zero-carbon homes have better energy efficiency standards, and generate all the energy they need onsite through solar panels and suchlike. The justification for the move was to reduce regulations on housebuilders, which would have made it harder for the government to meet its targets for home construction. The following year, the Mayor of London put in place a zero carbon standard for homes in the city.   We've heard some party pledges on climate change and the environment - including cutting emissions, planting more trees, insulation homes and taxing flight travel. But what do they say in their manifestos? Here BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabintakes a closer look. And earlier this month science editor David Shukman consideredhow big an issue climate change is for voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Nicola Sturgeon said: âWe need more support for onshore wind which the Tories disgracefully have taken away.â It is true that onshore wind installations in the UK last year were at their lowest since 2011, at 598 MW of generating capacity. That followed a bumper year in 2017, when 2,666 MW were installed, according to Renewables UK, the industry group. It blamed the peak in 2017 and the subsequent downturn on government policy. 2017 was the last year of the renewable obligation scheme, which supported many large scale renewable projects. Also, it said onshore wind projects are not able to bid for subsidies under another renewable support scheme, contracts for difference. In addition the Conservative government changed the planning rules to give local councils in England more powers to block new wind farm schemes. Overall, however, the UK has made impressive progress in decarbonising its electricity generation, helped among other things by a big increase in offshore wind generation. According to Carbon Brief, since 2008 âthe UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy.â A statement posted on Twitter,externalby Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the party decided not to take part in the Channel 4 debate because ""we have no faith that the broadcaster will conduct this
debate in a fair and objective way"". âBrexit is the defining issue of our age and the fact that
Channel 4 does not want to discuss it speaks volumes about this broadcaster and
its Remain position,"" the statement said. Michael
Gove says other political parties ""vetoed a Conservative voice"" when he was refused the chance to stand in for Boris Johnson in Channel 4's televised leaders' debate on climate change. Speaking in a Conservative Facebook Live, the former environment secretary says he âwanted to take part"". But he says the editor of Channel 4 News asked the other parties for their permission and they said âabsolutely noâ. âTheyâd
rather debate a block of ice,"" he adds, in reference to the programme-makers' decision to put ice sculptures on display where Mr Johnson and the also-absent leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, would have been standing. âItâs
a pity that we couldnât have a proper and full debate on the climate emergency
with the other parties tonight,"" he says. Moving on, he describes what would happen if other parties took power from the Tories. âInstead of planting trees to
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, weâll have two referendums sucking all the
oxygen out of our political system,"" he says. That may be it for Channel 4's debate - but there's plenty more climate change content for you to get your teeth into: It's the end of the debate. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy thanks the party leaders for taking part. He adds: ""Thank you also to Michael Gove from the Conservative Party, who did come here, but sadly, as we made clear from the start, this debate
was for leaders only. âAnd our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders. ""Our offer to Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come here and
discuss the climate emergency remains open."" Two ice sculptures were set up instead of the Conservative Party and Brexit Party leaders.  Presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks the leaders to give their own personal climate change resolutions. Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP says her energy provider uses renewable resources, that she has a smart meter, is trying to fly less and be more conscious about what she eats. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says she uses a reusable cup and makes sure she does the recycling. She also points out that her electric campaign bus is electric. Plaid's Adam Price looks to the New Year. He says he's going to start cycling to work every day and he's going to start using an electric car. He also says he has convinced his partner they should use re-usable nappies for their one-year-old son. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will ""do everything I can to improve recyling in local authorities and elsewhere"", as well as combatting ""excessive packaging"". Mr Corbyn adds that he's ""always the last one to turn the heating on"", and that the heating only went on in his house last week. ""I'm quite miserable actually... because I don't like to see the waste of energy,"" he adds. Despite the sincerity with which each of these leaders give their resolutions, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry laughs at their answers. ""It isn't about lists,"" she says. She says politicians often list what they're going to do but that leads to ""broken promises"". ""I just cannot sit back and let this happen again,"" she adds. Ms Berry adds that she isn't a homeowner so finds it difficult to make her privately-rented home more green. Instead, she says, she ""works to change the system"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Netflix 'reactivated' users without permissionSome former Netflix customers are being charged subscription fees, months after closing their accounts.Business","Former Netflix customers who cancelled their subscription months ago have had their accounts reactivated without their consent. BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme has learned that criminals can log in to dormant accounts and reactivate them without knowing users' bank details.

Utah family terrorised by Hawaii 'extreme stalker',"The suspect appeared in the federal courthouse in Honolulu, Hawaii A Hawaii man accused of terrorising a family with threats and unsolicited deliveries to their home in Utah has appeared in court in Honolulu. Prosecutors say Loren Okamura, 44, sent hundreds of people - from locksmiths to drug dealers to sex workers - to the family's home over more than a year. The victims were ""tormented"" by ""extreme cyberstalking"", federal prosecutor John Huber said. Mr Okamura will remain in detention until he is sent to Utah for a hearing. Walt Gilmore, his wife, his children and grandchildren living with him were repeatedly targeted over 15 months at their home near Salt Lake City with threatening messages and online postings. Some posts included requests for drugs and prostitutes. Others were for random deliveries or services such as plumbing, woodworking, tree trimming and towing. In one case, a group of teenagers drove from Idaho to sell fishing gear to the unsuspected homeowner.  In another case, a person with medical problems had been promised a ride to Portland and was upset to find out they had been hoaxed. Mr Gilmore said his encounters with angry contractors, deliverymen, prostitutes and pimps were ""scary"". Some visitors were told to come to the home to find lost pets, leaving Mr Gilmore and his neighbours to tell them they had been scammed. Police estimate as many as 500 unwanted visitors have come to the home since August 2018, leading the homeowner to post a large sign outside warning guests ""we are all victims of this scam"" and asking visitors to contact police. Mr Okamura was arrested by an FBI team in Hawaii on Friday. He faces charges of cyberstalking, making interstate threats and transporting people to engage in prostitution. Prosecutors say he also sent Mr Gilmore's daughter threatening texts and emails, including one in May telling her to ""sleep with one eye open and keep looking over her shoulder."" The email also said: ""You should just kill yourself and do your family a favour."" Police say the Gilmore family and Mr Okamura knew each other, although the motive behind the harassment is unclear. He was identified as the prime suspect in January, but it took investigators until now to gather enough evidence because he was using encryption apps to contact the victims, Mr Huber said. Mr Gilmore says he knows why his family was targeted, but does not want to discuss that until the trial, the Hawaii News TV station reports.

Stormzy posed with the Labour leader at an awards ceremony in 2017 The Grime 4 Corbyn campaign group says a Conservative win at the election could lead to people ""dying from austerity cuts"" and ""freezing to death in their homes"". Co-organiser Sofia Mason, who grew up in east London, says the importance of the election in two weeks ""can't be overstated"". The campaign group, which counts Stormzy and DJ Logan Sama among its supporters, was inspired by grime artists expressing support for the Jeremy Corbyn at the 2017 election, and works with musicians to put on events. Ms Mason describes Mr Corbyn as the ""exact opposite"" of Conservative leader Boris Johnson, who she says people view as ""a liar"" and ""self-serving"". ""Since the last election we have seen the Tories' true colours with the Windrush atrocities and the tragedy of Grenfell burning to the ground. It is clear they don't care about our lives,"" she says. Read more: Is grime still '4 Corbyn'? Head over to our news channelnow if you want to catch this week's Brexitcast. Tonight Chris Mason and Adam Fleming are joined by BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith, in the absence of Laura Kuenssberg and Katya Adler. The Conservative Party has refused to take Facebook adverts down after the BBC complained that it had distorted footage. But what are these adverts about? One of the ads the BBC has taken issue with includes an edited clip of our political editor Laura Kuenssberg saying ""pointless delay to Brexit"", followed by newsreader Huw Edwards stating ""another Brexit delay"". It also features the caption: ""A hung parliament = gridlock. Stop the chaos. Vote Conservative."" The BBC News press team said adverts using edited BBC content are a ""completely unacceptable use of BBC content which distorts our output and which could damage perceptions of our impartiality"". It has asked the Conservatives to remove the adverts. The Facebook Ad Library -which the technology company launched in the UK last year to make campaigning on its platform more ""transparent""- says the Tories have spent up to Â£2,000 on several versions of the advert so far. It is being targeted at 35 to 54-year-olds in England. Our digital elections reporter tweets... The Conservative Party hits back at the BBC's criticism of its Facebook advert that used edited BBC footage. As per our post at 18:45, the BBC Press Office says the Tories ""distorted"" BBC content to use in Facebook adverts. But the Tories disagree and say they aren't going to remove the ad. The Conservative Party spokesman has made a bit of a slip-up though, calling on people to vote for Boris Johnson on 13 December (the election is on 12 December, folks). Allow Twitter content?

If you're just joining us, here's a quick summary of what's been happening today. Speaking about tonight's Channel 4
leadersâ climate debate, Rebecca
Newsom from Greenpeace UK says it ""laid bare the ambitions of
the leaders who took part, and exposed the disregard for this existential
crisis of those who couldnât be bothered to turn up."" She praises ""strong action plans"" on energy systems and homes, but says the leaders ""dodged"" sectors that required bigger personal lifestyle changes like flying and meat consumption. Max Wakefield,
director at Possible, an organisation advocating for a zero carbon society, says the debate proved the issue would not be sidelined in elections ""as it has in the past"". ""And no
matter what the result of this election, it will not be forgotten that Boris
Johnson refused to spend an hour of his time telling the public how he plans to
tackle the greatest threat to our society and the natural world,""  he says. Reality Check Jo Swinson said: ""We need to make sure that now we have a target for all new-build homes to be zero carbon and to have those high standards. And the Conservatives who can't be bothered to turn up tonight scrapped those plans."" Plans to make all UK homes zero-carbon were first proposed by Gordon Brown in 2006, and cancelled by the Conservative government in 2015. Zero-carbon homes have better energy efficiency standards, and generate all the energy they need onsite through solar panels and suchlike. The justification for the move was to reduce regulations on housebuilders, which would have made it harder for the government to meet its targets for home construction. The following year, the Mayor of London put in place a zero carbon standard for homes in the city.   We've heard some party pledges on climate change and the environment - including cutting emissions, planting more trees, insulation homes and taxing flight travel. But what do they say in their manifestos? Here BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabintakes a closer look. And earlier this month science editor David Shukman consideredhow big an issue climate change is for voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Reality Check Nicola Sturgeon said: âWe need more support for onshore wind which the Tories disgracefully have taken away.â It is true that onshore wind installations in the UK last year were at their lowest since 2011, at 598 MW of generating capacity. That followed a bumper year in 2017, when 2,666 MW were installed, according to Renewables UK, the industry group. It blamed the peak in 2017 and the subsequent downturn on government policy. 2017 was the last year of the renewable obligation scheme, which supported many large scale renewable projects. Also, it said onshore wind projects are not able to bid for subsidies under another renewable support scheme, contracts for difference. In addition the Conservative government changed the planning rules to give local councils in England more powers to block new wind farm schemes. Overall, however, the UK has made impressive progress in decarbonising its electricity generation, helped among other things by a big increase in offshore wind generation. According to Carbon Brief, since 2008 âthe UK has cleaned up its electricity mix faster than any other major world economy.â A statement posted on Twitter,externalby Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage says the party decided not to take part in the Channel 4 debate because ""we have no faith that the broadcaster will conduct this
debate in a fair and objective way"". âBrexit is the defining issue of our age and the fact that
Channel 4 does not want to discuss it speaks volumes about this broadcaster and
its Remain position,"" the statement said. Michael
Gove says other political parties ""vetoed a Conservative voice"" when he was refused the chance to stand in for Boris Johnson in Channel 4's televised leaders' debate on climate change. Speaking in a Conservative Facebook Live, the former environment secretary says he âwanted to take part"". But he says the editor of Channel 4 News asked the other parties for their permission and they said âabsolutely noâ. âTheyâd
rather debate a block of ice,"" he adds, in reference to the programme-makers' decision to put ice sculptures on display where Mr Johnson and the also-absent leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, would have been standing. âItâs
a pity that we couldnât have a proper and full debate on the climate emergency
with the other parties tonight,"" he says. Moving on, he describes what would happen if other parties took power from the Tories. âInstead of planting trees to
suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, weâll have two referendums sucking all the
oxygen out of our political system,"" he says. That may be it for Channel 4's debate - but there's plenty more climate change content for you to get your teeth into: It's the end of the debate. Channel 4 presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy thanks the party leaders for taking part. He adds: ""Thank you also to Michael Gove from the Conservative Party, who did come here, but sadly, as we made clear from the start, this debate
was for leaders only. âAnd our leaders were only prepared to debate other leaders. ""Our offer to Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to come here and
discuss the climate emergency remains open."" Two ice sculptures were set up instead of the Conservative Party and Brexit Party leaders.  Presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy asks the leaders to give their own personal climate change resolutions. Nicola Sturgeon from the SNP says her energy provider uses renewable resources, that she has a smart meter, is trying to fly less and be more conscious about what she eats. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says she uses a reusable cup and makes sure she does the recycling. She also points out that her electric campaign bus is electric. Plaid's Adam Price looks to the New Year. He says he's going to start cycling to work every day and he's going to start using an electric car. He also says he has convinced his partner they should use re-usable nappies for their one-year-old son. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says he will ""do everything I can to improve recyling in local authorities and elsewhere"", as well as combatting ""excessive packaging"". Mr Corbyn adds that he's ""always the last one to turn the heating on"", and that the heating only went on in his house last week. ""I'm quite miserable actually... because I don't like to see the waste of energy,"" he adds. Despite the sincerity with which each of these leaders give their resolutions, Green Party co-leader Sian Berry laughs at their answers. ""It isn't about lists,"" she says. She says politicians often list what they're going to do but that leads to ""broken promises"". ""I just cannot sit back and let this happen again,"" she adds. Ms Berry adds that she isn't a homeowner so finds it difficult to make her privately-rented home more green. Instead, she says, she ""works to change the system"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Johnson vows to help women in politicsBoris Johnson says he wants more women in the Tories, as Labour highlights ""sexist"" comments.Election 2019","Boris Johnson will vow to ""support women to reach their full potential"" in politics and the workplace if the Conservatives win the general election. He will also announce the ""biggest drive"" to recruit female Tory activists, members and candidates. On the 100th anniversary of the election of the first woman to sit in the Commons, the PM will pledge to make 50% of future Tory candidates women. In this election 30% of Tory candidates and 53% of Labour candidates are women. Labour has hit back by criticising the prime minister's attitude towards women, highlighting ""sexist"" remarks he has made in the past. Record number of women set to stand in election The party says in articles written for The Spectator magazine, Mr Johnson made disparaging comments about single mothers and unmarried women. They say this shows his attitude is ""straight out of the dark ages"". Mr Johnson's announcement comes as a statue of Nancy Astor - the first woman MP to take a seat in Parliament, 100 years ago - is due to be unveiled in Plymouth. Commenting on her career, Mr Johnson said: ""She was a trailblazer, ripping up the conventions that held women back from joining the workplace. ""A Conservative majority government will support women to reach their full potential - be that in the workplace, by opening up new opportunities to work flexibly or start their own business, or through our work internationally to make sure all young women get 12 years of education."" Mrs Astor was elected to represent Plymouth for the Conservative Party, the year after women over 30 who met a property qualification were given the vote. Constance Markievticz was the first woman to be elected to Parliament in 1918, but her membership of the Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in stopped her from taking the oath, meaning she could not sit in the Commons. Nancy Astor became the first female MP in Westminster in 1919 Women make up about a third of candidates in next month's election. According to BBC analysis of Press Association figures earlier this month, 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates are women. The Tories say they have 193 female Conservative parliamentary candidates, while Labour has 335. Mr Johnson said: ""I have often said that talent and brilliance is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. I will make sure that women are supported to take up the opportunities that politics present."" The Conservatives say they want to encourage flexible working, review how to better support self-employed workers and protect women returning from maternity leave by reforming redundancy law. But the Labour Party highlighted ""sexist and misogynistic"" comments made by Mr Johnson in articles written in the 1990s. Labour's shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti said: ""Someone whose attitudes towards women are straight out of the dark ages is not fit to be prime minister of our country."" In September it emerged that Mr Johnson wrote that David Cameron was a ""girly swot"" on a private cabinet paper. And days earlier Mr Johnson was criticised for calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""big girl's blouse"" over the Labour leader's decision not to back the prime minister's bid for an election while the risk of a no-deal Brexit remained.

US ambassador to EU accused of sexual misconduct,"Gordon Sondland denies the allegations against him Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, has been accused by three women of sexual misconduct. The allegations,published by Portland Monthly magazine and ProPublica,external, date back to before he became an ambassador. At the time of the alleged incidents he was developing hotels in Portland and Seattle in the Pacific Northwest. Mr Sondland denies all of the allegations, and accuses the women of targeting him for his role in President Donald Trump's impeachment hearings. ""These untrue claims of unwanted touching and kissing are concocted and, I believe, co-ordinated for political purposes,"" he said in a statement. ""They have no basis in fact, and I categorically deny them."" All three women said Mr Sondland retaliated against them professionally after they rejected his sexual advances - by verbally abusing them at their workplace, reneging on a promised investment, and withdrawing offers of professional introductions. One of the women, Nicole Vogel, said she met Mr Sondland for dinner in 2003 in order to secure investment for her new magazine. Ms Vogel is the owner of Portland Monthly. The magazine said she was not involved editorially in the story, and it had teamed up with ProPublica, a respected non-profit news group, to report the claims independently. She said that after dinner Mr Sondland took her to one of his hotels and invited her to see a room. He then requested a hug, she added, but instead ""grabs my face and goes to kiss me"". She said she deflected him and left the hotel, and later received an email from Mr Sondland changing the terms of his investment. Another woman, Jana Solis, said she met Mr Sondland in 2008 when she was seeking work as a hotel safety expert. When he offered her the job, she said, he called her ""my new hotel chick"" and slapped her rear. She then said that on another occasion he invited her to his home in Portland to evaluate his art collection, before exposing himself. On a third occasion, he asked her to inspect his penthouse apartment and then forcibly kissed her, she said. As it happened: Gordon Sondland's testimony Trumpâs man in Brussels in eye of the storm Five key Sondland moments - analysed The third accuser, Natalie Sept, was working in local politics in Portland for a candidate Mr Sondland had donated money to. After they were introduced through her boss, she claims Mr Sondland invited her to dinner to discuss work opportunities. She said he asked for a hug at the end of the night, but then pushed himself towards her and tried to forcibly kiss her. In response, Mr Sondland described the article as ""underhanded journalism"" that was ""fundamentally false"". Astatement on his website,externalsaid: ""Both the timing and sourcing of the reporting seem obviously intended to influence congressional proceedings in which Ambassador Sondland is a witness."" ""These false incidents are at odds with my character,"" he added in a separate statement. He suggested that Ms Vogel was ""a source angry that I long ago declined to invest in her magazine, the same magazine now presenting its owner's outlandish claims"". He said he intended to take legal action against the two publications. Mr Sondland provided key testimony at Mr Trump's impeachment hearing last week, where he said he followed President Donald Trump's orders to pressure Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.

Scientists draw up climate change plan for live music,"Massive Attack are donating four years of touring data for the report. Scientists from theUniversity of Manchester,externalare creating a blueprint to help bands and pop stars to perform live and tour the world without contributing to climate change. It's after theTyndall Centre for Climate Change Research,externalwere approached by the group Massive Attack who say they want to help find solutions to the climate crisis. The findings will be shared with musicians from across the industry and, it's hoped, will inspire millions of fans to live more sustainably. Massive Attack have spent a lot of 2019 with the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion, even playing a set at one of their protests in London in April. Robert del Naja, aka 3D, told the BBC he felt conflicted because of how his career has contributed to climate change. ""[As musicians] we have enjoyed a high carbon lifestyle. But as a society we've all existed in a fossil fuel economy for a long time and had very little choice in that. ""The challenge now is to not only make personal sacrifices, but to insist on the systemic change that's needed. Business as usual is over."" The news comes a week afterColdplay announced they would not tour with their latest album for environmental reasons. This video can not be played Chris Martin: ""Everyone will catch up if you prove that it's easy to do it the right way"" Meanwhile, Billie Eilish is offering fans a chance to earn tickets to her next tour by fighting climate change and there'll be eco-villages at each concert where fans can learn more about the issues facing the planet. What will the scientists be looking at? This new research will look at all aspects of touring and how its carbon footprint can be reduced to zero, or as close to zero as possible. It's not looking simply at balancing out emissions from concerts by planting trees for removing carbon dioxide from the air - a process known as carbon offsetting. Instead, researchers will look at how to reduce the amount of energy used during concerts and in moving musicians, crews and sets between different venues and cities, as well as the impact audiences have. Tyndall Manchester's Director, Prof Carly McLachlan, says they'll be looking at where switches can be made to renewable energy sources, how to reduce the amount of energy being consumed but also thinking about how touring could be different. ""It is a high carbon sector and we need to try and tackle that, because every sector has to be part of the transition to a low-carbon economy."" It's not yet known what impact, if any, changing the way tours are put on will have on ticket prices, routes or number of concerts. Glastonbury festival-goers were praised this year by Sir David Attenborough for cutting back on their plastic use. Just how bad is live music for the environment? Musicians are often criticised when they speak out about climate change and carbon because they have high carbon lifestyles. Promoting albums and performing in cities around the world means artists and their teams fly a lot. Then there are the carbon emissions from tour buses, from moving sets, from making merchandise, on top of the energy needed for things like lighting and sound. Recent figures,externalsuggest that live music generates 405,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK every year. Prof Carly McLachlan says music and art and culture are a ""really beautiful part of what it is to be human"". ""If this is something we really value in our lives, we need to make sure we can do it in a way that has reduced impact."" Follow Laura ontwitter,external.

"Immunotherapy hope for advanced prostate cancerA small number of men were ""super responders"" and remained well even after the trial ended.","A major trial of an immunotherapy drug has shown it can be effective in some men with advanced prostate cancer. The men had stopped responding to the main treatment options. Researchers found that a small proportion of men, described as ""super responders"", remained well even after the trial ended, despite a very poor prognosis before treatment. Last week it was reported the same drug hadproved effective in treating advanced head and neck cancers. Immunotherapy uses our own immune systems to recognise and attack cancer cells. It's already being used as a standard treatment for some cancers such as melanomas - and being tested on many others too. Cancer immunotherapy drug 'prolongs life' Prostate cancer drug hailed as âbig dealâ Half of people surviving 'untreatable cancer' It found that one in 20 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug pembrolizumab - and saw their tumours actually shrink or disappear altogether. Although a relatively small number, some of them gained years of extra life, the study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found. A further 19% saw some evidence of improvement. But most patients in the study lived for an average of eight months on the drug. The phase II clinical trial, led by the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden, involved 258 men with advanced prostate cancer who had run out of all other options on treatment. The most dramatic responses were seen in patients whose tumours had mutations in genes involved in repairing DNA. Researchers are now investigating whether this group might benefit the most from immunotherapy in a larger trial. But first, a test to pick out who will respond best is needed, so that doctors know which patients to give it to. It's the most common cancer in men in the UK, witharound 47,700 diagnosed in the UK each year,external. The number of people diagnosed has been rising over the last 10 years. This is probably because the population is getting older and more people are having PSA tests. Around 30% of men with advanced or stage 4 prostate cancer survive their cancer for five years or more after diagnosis. ""Immunotherapy has had tremendous benefits for some cancer patients, and it's fantastic news that even in prostate cancer, where we don't see much immune activity, a proportion of men are responding well to treatment,"" says Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of The Institute of Cancer Research. ""A limitation with immunotherapy is that there's no good test to pick out those who are most likely to respond. ""It's encouraging to see testing for DNA repair mutations may identify some patients who are more likely to respond, and I'm keen to see how the new, larger trial in this group of patients plays out."" Professor Johann de Bono, a consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, was one of those who led the study. He said: ""We don't see much activity from the immune system in prostate tumours, so many oncologists thought immunotherapy wouldn't work for this cancer type. ""But our study shows that a small proportion of men with end-stage cancer do respond, and crucially that some of these men do very well indeed. ""We found that men with mutations in DNA repair genes respond especially well to immunotherapy, including two of my own patients who have now been on the drug for more than two years."" Last week, a separate trial found the same drug kept some people's advanced head and neck cancers at bay for an average of two years - five times longer than under chemotherapy. Both studies are part of a growing body of research suggesting immunotherapy could offer hope to an increasing number of cancer patients.

Iraqi protesters set fire to Iranian consulate,"Protesters chanted ""Iran out of Iraq"" as the consulate burned A group of protesters in Iraq have set fire to Iran's consulate in the southern city of Najaf amid ongoing anti-government demonstrations. Protesters chanted ""Iran out of Iraq"" as flames engulfed the building. Reports say staff at the consulate managed to flee just before protesters broke in. This is the second attack on an Iranian consulate in Iraq this month after the office in the Shia holy city of Karbalawas targeted three weeks ago. At least 344 people have been killed in nearly two months of unrest. Why Iraq has reached boiling point Is a new Arab Spring unfolding in the Middle East? People are demanding an end to corruption, more jobs and better public services in the demonstrations, which have mostly affected southern Iraq and the capital Baghdad. Demonstrators accuse Iran of interfering in Iraq's internal affairs and propping up the government. This video can not be played Safaa al Saray died after being shot in the head with a tear gas canister Protesters stormed the consulate and set it alight, despite police attempts to keep them at bay. Iran, which backs the government and a number of powerful local Shia Muslim militias, had previously urged protesters to seek changes within the ""framework of legal structures"". It has also accused the West of ""spreading turmoil"" in Iraq. Consulate staff managed to evacuate before the building was stormed Elsewhere, security forces shot dead two people in Karbala on Tuesday night and two in Baghdad on Wednesday, while a fifth person was killed after security forces opened fire in Basra, Reuters reported. Protesters blocked government employees from entering work in Basra with slabs of concrete painted as mock coffins of relatives lost in the uprising, an eyewitness said. Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi took office just over a year ago, promising reforms that have not materialised. On 1 October, young Iraqis angered by his failure to tackle high unemployment, endemic corruption and poor public services took to the streets of Baghdad for the first time. The protests escalated and spread across the country after security personnel responded with deadly force. This video can not be played The story behind an abandoned high-rise taken over by protesters in Baghdad After the first wave of protests, which lasted six days and saw 149 civilians killed, Mr Abdul Mahdi promised to reshuffle his cabinet, cut the salaries of high-ranking officials, and announced schemes to reduce youth unemployment. But the protesters said their demands had not been met and returned to the streets in late October. President Barham Saleh has saidMr Abdul Mahdi will resign if parties can agree on a replacement.

Labour promises to plant two billion trees by 2040,"This video can not be played Labour says it will create ""natural solutions"" to climate change Labour is pledging to plant two billion new trees in England by 2040 if it wins the general election. The party is also promising 10 new national parks during its first term, as part of its ""plan for nature"". The Tories want to plant 30 million trees a year, while the Lib Dems have pledged 60 million if they win power. Friends of the Earth has hailed Labour's plan - which would mean more than 270,000 trees being planted a day - as the most ambitious of the three. What the parties' promises on the environment really mean The Green Party has pledged to plant 700 million trees by 2030, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has also said he would support a wide-scale tree planting programme. Labour claims its plan will lead to 20,000 new green jobs in forestry management and timber trades, contributing to its overall goal of creating a million green jobs if it wins the race to Downing Street. Speaking at the launch of the policy, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This election is our last chance to tackle the climate and environment emergency. Labour is on your side and on the side of the environment."" Large-scale tree planting 'no easy task' How much will this be a climate change election? 'Bleak' outlook as carbon emissions gap grows Labour says it will make Â£2.5bn available to plant the trees in a number of sites, including urban parks, farmland and schools. And along with the new national parks, the party would invest an extra Â£75m a year into new and existing park authorities to manage them. Areas being considered for the parks include the Malvern Hills, Chiltern Hills, Lincolnshire Wolds and North Pennines. Labour says it is wants 75% of the population in England to live within half-an-hour of a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty. These moves - alongside the investment into restoring habitats, such as woodlands, grasslands and meadows - could help store up to 47 million tonnes of CO2 each year by 2050, and allow endangered species to recover. The party said it would also reverse the 20% cuts the Conservatives had made to the annual national park authorities budget since 2010, increasing funding by 50% ""in order to enable the parks to provide natural solutions to the climate and environment emergency"". Our Reality Check team has asked Labour where its figures came from - but looking atstatistics provided by the government in March,external, the Conservatives cut the authorities' budget by closer to 10% in cash terms (comparing the numbers directly) or 25% in real terms (when inflation is taken into account). Commenting on Labour's announcement, Friends of the Earth tree campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ""This is by far the most ambitious tree-planting pledge we've seen from a political party. ""Tree cover in the UK needs to double as part of the fight against climate breakdown and this means adding three billion new trees, and fast. ""If sustained, Labour's promised tree-planting rates would achieve this by 2050. While parties have been racing to make bigger trees pledges, it's crucial to remember that trees will only help fix the climate crisis if emissions cuts happen at the same time."" Although Labour's plans are just for England, the party said it would work with devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to develop more nature recovery works and provide funds towards extra national parks.

UK 'has the technology' for zero carbon emissions,"Trebling solar power is a possible way the UK could met its net zero carbon emissions target Eliminating greenhouse gas emissions in the UK is achievable with current technology, according to a new report. TheCentre for Alternative Technology(CAT) said a net zero-carbon Britain is already possible, without relying on future developments. The Powys-based charity said changes to buildings, transport and industry could help slash UK energy demand by 60%. ""We have the technology to combat climate change and we can start today,"" said project coordinator Paul Allen. The CAT report -Zero Carbon Britain: Rising to the Climate Emergency,external- also claims making further changes to energy, diets and land use could help provide 100% renewable energy and cut emissions from agriculture and industry. That would mean the UK would not be reliant on ""as yet unproven"" technologies, such as carbon or air capture, said Machynlleth-based CAT. Established 45 years ago, CAT Charity, based in Machynlleth, is known as a centre of excellence for environmental education Mr Allen said using alternatives to technology that is ready to be rolled out at scale was ""not worth the risk"". However, the UK government described carbon capture as a ""game-changing technology"" in addressing climate change and saidthe country's first project should be operational next year. Britain was the first major nation to propose cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero,promising to do so by 2050. Vegan burgers are now a regular on restaurant menus Reducing energy use CAT said more new houses should be built to high Passivhaus standards that canreduce energy costs to just Â£15 a yearby using insulated masonry and concrete, triple-glazing, LED lighting and air-source heat pumps. Some of these changes could also be fitted to existing buildings to improve temperature control and potentially reduce heating use by around 50%. Transport energy demand could also be cut by 78% by increased use of public transport, walking, cycling and using electric vehicles whilecutting flights by two-thirds. Heat pumps could be crucial to helping reduce energy costs in buildings Increasing energy supplies Based on the past decade's weather and energy use, it is possible to fully match the UK's entire energy demand with renewable and carbon-neutral energy, the report claims, if CAT's recommendations are carried out. What is a climate emergency? Old coal mines 'perfect' food farms Half of that would be provided by wind while other sources suited to the UK climate - including geothermal, hydro, tidal and solar - would produce most of the rest. Carbon-neutral synthetic fuelsare also an important alternative to electricity, especially in some areas of industry and transport. Wind could provide half the energy required in a zero carbon UK Transforming land and diets Switchingfrom meat and dairy to plant-based proteins, reducing food waste and improving agriculture could go a long way to cutting carbon emissions, the report said. CAT says the UK can: Reduce on-farm greenhouse gas emissions by 57% (compared to 2017) Cut food imports from 42% to 17% Use 75% of current livestock grazing land for restoring forests and peat-lands ""We can still have coffee, chocolate and tea in a zero-carbon Britain, but the UK currently imports many foods that we can easily grow here,"" said Mr Allen. ""By changing what we eat and how it's grown, and by wasting less food, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase resilience and improve health and wellbeing."" Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? Will eating less meat save the planet? How much will this be a climate change election? CAT is urging politicians to come up with action plans with policy frameworks and large-scale investment as a matter of urgency. This video can not be played What to look out for on climate change and the environment in this election Recent polling said the environment was one of the top priorities for voters at this year's general election. As well as the 2050 pledge, theConservatives announced a halt to fracking, the controversial process of extracting gas from shale rock. Labour derided the halt as a pause rather than a total ban. Labour followed that with awarm homes planto insulate the country's nearly 27 million households and help with solar panels and heat pumps. The Tories dismissed the scheme's Â£250bn bill as unaffordable and unrealistic. The Liberal Democrats havepledged a Â£100bn climate fundover five years to be funded through borrowing and tax changes. The Green Party has gone further, promisingÂ£100bn, every yearto reach net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2030. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has called for aÂ£20bn ""green jobs revolution""in Wales including three tidal lagoons, a barrage and a new offshore wind farm.

Can you vote on what matters to you?,"This video can not be played What does devolution mean for voters? Voters across the UK are set to go the polls on 12 December for the third general election in four years. But as politicians compete for the votes of people living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, will your choice make any difference to what matters most to you? Devolution has seen the transfer of powers from central government to nations which make up the UK, a process which started following referendums in 1997 and 1998. These resulted in the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. What exactly is devolved varies in each nation, but the process has limited the power of the UK government to set policy in these nations. This means voters in the devolved nations will not be able to influence important areas of policy such as health and education at a general election. But it is not quite that simple. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external REGISTER:What you need to do to vote The UK government, led by the prime minister in Downing Street, is responsible for policy on all powers which have not been devolved - known as ""reserved powers"". Scotland's devolved government and parliament control more areas of policy than the Welsh Assembly or Welsh Government, particularly when it comes to criminal justice and the courts. Justice and policing were also devolved in Northern Ireland, but the assembly there is not currently sitting and there is no Northern Ireland executive. The main areas which are reserved to Westminster are: The constitution Defence and national security Foreign policy Immigration and citizenship Social security (devolved in Northern Ireland and to be fully devolved in Scotland by 2021) Pensions Most forms of tax (but not in Scotland) The complexities of devolution do create confusion for voters, according to Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University. ""It's very hard for anyone in a multi-layered political system to determine what's up for grabs, and this happens virtually everywhere where there is multi-layered governance,"" she said. ""The polls show, even in this election which has been dominated by Brexit, that there has been a big focus on health and education. ""Should it be the case? Well, you could argue not, because everything should be about what's at stake, what's under the control and competence of who you are voting for."" Laura McAllister says voters can have an impact on how much money devolved administrations receive Prof McAllister argued Welsh politicians often willingly elevate the issue of health at general elections because it resonates, even though they know it is not strictly relevant to voters in Wales. The way in which voters in devolved nations can influence devolved policy at a general election is through funding. The Barnett formula is a system of grants which dictates the level of public spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The formula is named after its inventor, the former Labour Chief Secretary to the Treasury Joel Barnett, who devised it in the late 1970s. Under the formula, extra funding - or cuts - from Westminster are allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them. Lord Barnett said the formula which bore his name was no longer fit for purpose When the UK government increases or decreases funding for departments such as health and education in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive. Crucially, the amount of money the devolved government receives - roughly 5% in Wales - is not ring-fenced, meaning it can spend it how it likes. On the face of it, Wales does not do too badly when it comes to public spending - at just under Â£10,400 per person in 2017-18, it is 11% higher than the UK average of Â£9,350. But when you compare this with Scotland, 16% higher, and Northern Ireland, 20% higher, the reality is less favourable. In later life Lord Barnett, who was made a member of the House of Lords in 1983 anddied in 2014, said the formula was""grossly unfair""and should be abolished. As Prof McAllister pointed out, while voters in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not get a direct vote on devolved issues such as health in this election, the way they vote could have an impact on how much money the devolved administrations receive - or lose out on - from the UK government.

Half of students get degree place with lower grades,"Nearly half of young people were given a place at university this year with A-level grades lower than the advertised entry requirements, new figures show. The admissions service, Ucas, says 49% of 18-year-olds in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, who sat at least three A-levels, were accepted with lower grades than those advertised. Universities generally advertise grade requirements on their websites. Disadvantaged students were more likely to take up places with lower grades. In its end-of-cycle report for 2019, Ucas says that 60% of applicants from the fifth most disadvantaged backgrounds were accepted on to courses with A-level grades below the advertised requirements. Unconditional uni offers face clampdown Uni offers 'should be made after results' Students 'want backgrounds taken into account' This may be due to ""contextualised offers"", where institutions take into account factors that can restrict a student's achievement at school. ""Findings from the 2019 cycle suggest that applicants should not be deterred from applying to courses with challenging entry requirements,"" the Ucas report says. ""Universities and colleges frequently accept applicants who perform below their entry requirements. Encouragingly, this is most often experienced by disadvantaged applicants."" The Ucas report also says this is a good time to apply for a degree place, as the UK 18-year-old population is expected to fall to its lowest point in recent years in 2020. ""Consequently, now may be the best time ever to apply to higher education - particularly since this population is expected to grow again from 2021, reaching 2010's height by 2024,"" the report says. It also shows: a record 541,240 students were accepted onto undergraduate courses this year the number of places being offered through Clearing has continued to rise - in 2019, over 34,000 18-year-olds (14% of all placed applicants) secured a place this way, the highest number on record nearly three in four (73.6%) of the UK's 18-year-olds who were accepted onto a course, got a place at their first-choice university. Ucas says around one in six (17%) of the most disadvantaged students said they had received acontextual offer,external. But the report raises concerns that many disadvantaged students are unaware that some UK universities will take account of their background when making offers, saying only 60% of the most disadvantaged applicants knew about these offers. Ucas says that while  disadvantaged students were 61% more likely to enter university now than 10 years ago, more needs to be done to raise awareness. It says teachers and advisers should ""familiarise themselves with the practice of contextualised admissions"" so that they can offer ""the best advice and support"" and encourage ""aspirational choices"". Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said that while the equality gap between the number of rich and poor students entering university had narrowed, it is still ""far too wide"". Responding to Ucas's suggestions, Mr Barton said: ""This is easier said than done. UCAS itself acknowledges that contextualised admissions practices vary substantially between higher education providers. ""And schools and colleges have suffered years of real-terms cuts, which means they are simply unable to provide the level of student support that they would like to be able to offer. ""They are struggling to keep the existing plates spinning, let alone adding new ones."" Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant said: ""Today's report shows the unprecedented opportunity for anyone currently thinking of applying to university to be ambitious with their choices. ""The trends identified through our analysis are very likely to continue into this year, with universities, colleges and schools continuing to support students from a variety of backgrounds."" President of Universities UK, Professor Julia Buckingham, said universities were committed to widening access to higher education. ""It is fantastic to see that disadvantaged students are more likely to access a place at university than ten years ago. ""However, it is clear that a number of challenges and disparities remain, and there is a shared will in the sector to see gaps narrow further. ""Universities will continue to work to do this.""

Row over Labour's 'NHS for sale' claim,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""This election is now a fight for survival of NHS"" A row has broken out after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn claimed he had ""proof"" the NHS was at risk under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US. Mr Corbyn said he had a 451-page dossier showing initial talks had taken place, proving the NHS was ""for sale"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the claims were ""nonsense"" and the NHS would not be part of trade talks. The Tory manifesto explicitly states neither the price paid for drugs nor NHS services will be ""on the table"". Meanwhilethe SNP has published its manifestowhich includes a pledge to ""stop the NHS becoming a lever in any international trade deal"" through its NHS Protection Act. And other parties have criticised the Tories, including Liberal Democrat shadow Brexit secretary Tom Brake, who said the public would be ""horrified by what looks like a deal cooked up between the Tories and Donald Trump that puts our NHS on the table"". Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Reality Check: Five things from the leaked trade papers What we learned from the leaked US trade documents Jeremy Corbyn interview fact-checked Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said the Conservative Party ""can no longer claim the NHS is not for sale"", adding: ""Under their watch, it is."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Jeremy Corbyn's 451 page NHS dossier is a ""diversionary tactic"" Mark Dayan, policy analyst and the head of public affairs at the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was not being ""flogged off"" in the sense that US companies will not own hospitals. But he said the documents suggest the US is trying various tactics to get the NHS to pay more money to their pharmaceutical companies for the drugs that they sell. ""Obviously from the NHS's point of view, that is a concern... you're really losing out in that situation,"" he said. Mr Dayan said if talks with the US continue, UK negotiators must ""push hard for the interests of the UK and the NHS"". This video can not be played Barry Gardiner and Andrew Neil on Labour claims about UK-US talks about the UK market for buying drugs. Labour obtained uncensored government documents covering six rounds of talks between US and UK officials in Washington and London between July 2017 and July 2019. They are all preparatory meetings ahead of formal trade talks. These documents provide more detail on the meetingsChannel 4's Dispatches programme reported,externalon last month. They show the US is interested in discussing drug pricing - mainly, extending patents that stop cheaper generic medicines being used. One document quotes a UK official saying the talks are helpful in determining the areas the US may want to discuss, while acknowledging the UK would have objections. As well as the pharmaceutical industry, the talks also covered other areas including agriculture and climate change. The UK team inquired about including a reference to climate change in any US-UK trade deal, something the US side said was not allowed by Congress. The document also refers to the US policy of making ""total market access"" a starting point in any trade talks - but says it is up to other countries to specify anything they want to be excluded from talks. There is no indication in the documents that the UK team agreed to anything in the talks. Jeremy Corbyn doesn't provide evidence ministers have agreed the health service should be part of a trade deal with US. But details of discussions about the demands of US pharmaceutical companies will still be motivating for Labour voters worried about the NHS. ""Not for sale,"" has been the biggest mantra at Labour events, even though the Tories have always furiously denied the NHS is in any way ""up for sale"". It's clear US drug companies want access to UK markets - Labour suggests the UK has agreed they could extend the patents on some medicines, which could cost the NHS more, for example. But whether any UK government would ever do a deal that made medicines much more expensive for the NHS, and therefore the taxpayer, which would be massively costly for the government and probably prove deeply unpopular, is a big political question. The Conservative manifesto says the NHS will not be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks. Currently, the NHS is able to use its bargaining power as a centralised health system to negotiate low prices for drugs. It also has a strong track record in resisting attempts to lengthen patents on drugs, to allow cheaper generics to be used more quickly than they are in the US. The US currently pays two and a half times more for drugs than the NHS does. Meanwhile, about 7% of the NHS budget in England goes on private companies that provide NHS services, mainly non-emergency treatments such as knee and hip replacements and some community services. And Labour has warned this market could be extended further under the Tories. Mr Corbyn said the documents showed talks were at a ""very advanced stage"" and gave the lie to Boris Johnson's claims the NHS would not be part of any trade talks. ""The uncensored documents leave Boris Johnson's denials in absolute tatters,"" he told a news conference in London. ""We have now got evidence that under Boris Johnson the NHS is on the table and will be up for sale. ""He tried to cover it up in a secret agenda and today it has been exposed."" Reacting to Mr Corbyn's latest claims, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was simply a stunt. ""Jeremy Corbyn is getting desperate and is out and out lying about what the documents contain. ""People should not believe what he says."" Mr Johnson, meanwhile, said the claims were ""total nonsense"". ""This is continually brought up by the Labour Party as a diversionary tactic from the difficulties they are encountering,"" he said. And he could give an ""absolute cast iron guarantee"" the NHS would not be on the table. He also pointed out the documents had been available online for two months.

Labour vow to plant two billion trees by 2040,"This video can not be played Labour says it will create ""natural solutions"" to climate change Labour is pledging to plant two billion new trees in England by 2040 if it wins the general election. The party is also promising 10 new national parks during its first term, as part of its ""plan for nature"". The Tories want to plant 30 million trees a year, while the Lib Dems have pledged 60 million if they win power. Friends of the Earth has hailed Labour's plan - which would mean more than 270,000 trees being planted a day - as the most ambitious of the three. What the parties' promises on the environment really mean The Green Party has pledged to plant 700 million trees by 2030, and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has also said he would support a wide-scale tree planting programme. Labour claims its plan will lead to 20,000 new green jobs in forestry management and timber trades, contributing to its overall goal of creating a million green jobs if it wins the race to Downing Street. Speaking at the launch of the policy, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""This election is our last chance to tackle the climate and environment emergency. Labour is on your side and on the side of the environment."" Large-scale tree planting 'no easy task' How much will this be a climate change election? 'Bleak' outlook as carbon emissions gap grows Labour says it will make Â£2.5bn available to plant the trees in a number of sites, including urban parks, farmland and schools. And along with the new national parks, the party would invest an extra Â£75m a year into new and existing park authorities to manage them. Areas being considered for the parks include the Malvern Hills, Chiltern Hills, Lincolnshire Wolds and North Pennines. Labour says it is wants 75% of the population in England to live within half-an-hour of a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty. These moves - alongside the investment into restoring habitats, such as woodlands, grasslands and meadows - could help store up to 47 million tonnes of CO2 each year by 2050, and allow endangered species to recover. The party said it would also reverse the 20% cuts the Conservatives had made to the annual national park authorities budget since 2010, increasing funding by 50% ""in order to enable the parks to provide natural solutions to the climate and environment emergency"". Our Reality Check team has asked Labour where its figures came from - but looking atstatistics provided by the government in March,external, the Conservatives cut the authorities' budget by closer to 10% in cash terms (comparing the numbers directly) or 25% in real terms (when inflation is taken into account). Commenting on Labour's announcement, Friends of the Earth tree campaigner Guy Shrubsole said: ""This is by far the most ambitious tree-planting pledge we've seen from a political party. ""Tree cover in the UK needs to double as part of the fight against climate breakdown and this means adding three billion new trees, and fast. ""If sustained, Labour's promised tree-planting rates would achieve this by 2050. While parties have been racing to make bigger trees pledges, it's crucial to remember that trees will only help fix the climate crisis if emissions cuts happen at the same time."" Although Labour's plans are just for England, the party said it would work with devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to develop more nature recovery works and provide funds towards extra national parks.

Johnson vows to help women reach 'full potential',"Boris Johnson will vow to ""support women to reach their full potential"" in politics and the workplace if the Conservatives win the general election. He will also announce the ""biggest drive"" to recruit female Tory activists, members and candidates. On the 100th anniversary of the election of the first woman to sit in the Commons, the PM will pledge to make 50% of future Tory candidates women. In this election 30% of Tory candidates and 53% of Labour candidates are women. Labour has hit back by criticising the prime minister's attitude towards women, highlighting ""sexist"" remarks he has made in the past. Record number of women set to stand in election The party says in articles written for The Spectator magazine, Mr Johnson made disparaging comments about single mothers and unmarried women. They say this shows his attitude is ""straight out of the dark ages"". Mr Johnson's announcement comes as a statue of Nancy Astor - the first woman MP to take a seat in Parliament, 100 years ago - is due to be unveiled in Plymouth. Commenting on her career, Mr Johnson said: ""She was a trailblazer, ripping up the conventions that held women back from joining the workplace. ""A Conservative majority government will support women to reach their full potential - be that in the workplace, by opening up new opportunities to work flexibly or start their own business, or through our work internationally to make sure all young women get 12 years of education."" Mrs Astor was elected to represent Plymouth for the Conservative Party, the year after women over 30 who met a property qualification were given the vote. Constance Markievticz was the first woman to be elected to Parliament in 1918, but her membership of the Irish republican party Sinn FÃ©in stopped her from taking the oath, meaning she could not sit in the Commons. Nancy Astor became the first female MP in Westminster in 1919 Women make up about a third of candidates in next month's election. According to BBC analysis of Press Association figures earlier this month, 1,124 of 3,322 registered candidates are women. The Tories say they have 193 female Conservative parliamentary candidates, while Labour has 335. Mr Johnson said: ""I have often said that talent and brilliance is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. I will make sure that women are supported to take up the opportunities that politics present."" The Conservatives say they want to encourage flexible working, review how to better support self-employed workers and protect women returning from maternity leave by reforming redundancy law. But the Labour Party highlighted ""sexist and misogynistic"" comments made by Mr Johnson in articles written in the 1990s. Labour's shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti said: ""Someone whose attitudes towards women are straight out of the dark ages is not fit to be prime minister of our country."" In September it emerged that Mr Johnson wrote that David Cameron was a ""girly swot"" on a private cabinet paper. And days earlier Mr Johnson was criticised for calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""big girl's blouse"" over the Labour leader's decision not to back the prime minister's bid for an election while the risk of a no-deal Brexit remained.

US lawmakers back bill to support HK protesters,"Thousands of protesters rallied in Hong Kong on Monday in support of the Human Rights and Democracy Act US lawmakers have supported Hong Kong protesters by passing a bill aimed at upholding human rights in the city. The bill - which still needs to pass the upper house, the Senate - would mandate an annual review, to see whether Hong Kong had sufficient autonomy from the rest of China to justify its special trading status. The lower chamber also approved stopping tear gas exports to Hong Kong. On Monday, Hong Kong protesters took to the streets to support the US bill. The bill passed by the House of Representatives - which was introduced in June asHong Kong's protests took hold- says Hong Kong enjoys""unique treatment under US law"",external. ""Hong Kong is part of China but has a largely separate legal and economic system,"" it says. ""The [annual review] shall assess whether China has eroded Hong Kong's civil liberties and rule of law as protected by Hong Kong's Basic Law."" Among other things, Hong Kong's special trading status means it is not affected by US sanctions or tariffs placed on the mainland. US-China trade war in 300 words The bill also says the US should allow Hong Kong residents to obtain US visas, even if they have been arrested for being part of non-violent protests. And it says anyone ""responsible for abducting and torturing people for exercising internationally-recognized human rights"" should be barred from the US - and have sanctions imposed. The bill was supported by Republicans and Democrats and was passed by a ""voice vote"" in the House of Representatives, meaning a recorded vote was not needed. ""If America does not speak out for human rights in China because of commercial interest, then we lose all moral authority to speak out for human rights anyplace in the world,"" said house speaker Nancy Pelosi. Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat, said: ""The house just sent a strong message to the people of Hong Kong: we stand with you in the fight for democracy and justice."" This video can not be played Protecting Hong Kong's young protesters: ""Beat us, don't beat the kids"" The so-called ""PROTECT Hong Kong Act"" is designed to stop US exports of non-lethal crowd control weapons, such as tear gas and rubber bullets. The bill says such items have been used""unnecessarily and disproportionately"",externalby Hong Kong police. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words Try to split China and get 'bodies smashed' - Xi Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong Kong It also needs to be approved by the Senate. Lawmakers also approved a non-binding resolution recognising Hong Kong's relationship to the United States, which condemns Beijing's ""interference"". After the bill was passed, Beijing called for Washington to ""stop meddling"". ""We express our strong indignation and firm opposition to the US House of Representatives' insistence on passing the so-called 'Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act',"" said foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang. China's relationship with the United States would be damaged should the bill become law, the spokesman added. Hong Kong's protests started in June against a proposed law to allow extradition to mainland China but it has since transformed into a larger pro-democracy movement. The protests have also seen increasingly violent clashes, with police being attacked, and officers firing live bullets. Protesters have thrown petrol bombs andattacked businesses seen as being pro-Beijing. The protesters, meanwhile, have accused police of brutality.
