South Western Railway workers to hold 27 days of strikes,"The RMT has announced drivers and guards will take 27 days of industrial action A union has announced 27 days of rail strikes during December and on New Year's Day as part of a long-running dispute over train guards. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said its staff at South Western Railway (SWR) had been left with ""no choice"" but to take industrial action. The union said the dispute would continue for as long as SWR ""refuse to give assurances"" on the role of guards. SWR said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the planned strikes. A spokesperson for the company added: ""The deliberate targeting of services up to, and during, the Christmas period is typical of the lack of concern the RMT continue to have for our customers."" The union has told its members not to book on for duty: From 00:01 GMT on Monday 2 December until 23:59 on Wednesday 11 December From 00:01 on Friday 13 December until 23:59 on Tuesday 24 December From 00:01 on Friday 27 December 2019 until 23:59 on the 1 January RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""At the last meeting we held with SWR, principles in agreements were made in good faith with the company's negotiating team and we now feel hugely let down again. ""As long as the company continues to refuse to give assurances on the future operational role of the guard, we will remain in dispute. ""I want to congratulate our members on their continued resolve in their fight for safety and the role of the guard on SWR. ""It is wholly down to the management side that the core issue of the safety critical competencies and the role of the guard has not been agreed."" In a statement, SWR said it has offered to keep guards on all trains and the union was ""purely focussed on keeping control of train doors in a misguided attempt to hold power over the industry"". It added: ""Whilst we have shown commitment to the role of the guard by introducing over 80 additional guard roles since the start of our franchise, the RMT do not have the long-term interests of either our customers or our colleagues, including their members, at the heart of their actions. ""We remain committed to finding a solution that will help us build a better railway for everyone. ""We will do everything we can to keep customers moving during strike action.""

Top mandarin blocks Tory plan to cost Labour plans,"Civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill has dramatically blocked a Conservative plan to use civil servants to cost the Labour Party's fiscal plans. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell had complained vociferously to Treasury Permanent Secretary Tom Scholar in a meeting on Tuesday over the Conservative plan. One government insider described the situation as a ""Whitehall farce"". But Labour argued it was interfering in the upcoming general election. The opposition had been infuriated by the government's plan to use the civil service to calculate the cost of Labour's announced policies, and release it as an official document. BBC News understands these concerns were forcefully reiterated to the Treasury at a meeting with Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell this morning. At the end of that meeting, described as a ""courtesy call"" by the Treasury's top official, Labour sources had assumed the document would be published. Labour's legal team had also written to complain about the ""ethics and propriety"" of the decision to involve the civil service in the costings so close to an election. On Tuesday afternoon, the Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, after a phone call with the Treasury, told the opposition the document would not, after all, be published. One government insider called it a ""Whitehall farce"" occurring after the Chancellor had announced the document at Cabinet on Tuesday morning. They said it was an ""established process"" for a government to cost opposition policies in this way. And previous Conservative and Labour Governments have indeed done this ahead of general elections and referendums, although there was not time to do this in 2017. It has not in recent years been done days before the ""purdah"" period where civil servants are strictly restricted in their actions. The opposition said it was a ""scandal"" and that the government had been caught ""red handed"" using civil servants in this way so close to an election, and at a time when the government has chosen not to do an economic assessment of its own landmark policy - the new Brexit deal.

Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond to stand down as MP,"Mr Hammond said he felt ""aggrieved"" at his treatment by the party Former Chancellor Philip Hammond is to leave Parliament ""with great sadness"" after deciding against standing as an independent in his Surrey constituency. Mr Hammond lost the Conservative whip in September after defying Boris Johnson over a no-deal Brexit. As a result, he cannot stand as a Tory candidate in Runnymede and Weybridge, which he has represented since 1997. He said he would not stand as an independent as that would be a ""direct challenge"" to the party he loved. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Hammond was among 21 Tory MPs thrown out of the parliamentary party in September for backing legislation designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal - the so-called Benn Act. Unlike a number of the group, he has not had the whip restored after rebelling again earlier this month to back Labour calls for more time to scrutinise Boris Johnson's deal. The PM blamed him and other former Tory rebels for stopping the UK leaving the EU on the 31 October deadline. Which MPs are standing down? In a letter to constituents, Mr Hammond said he continued to feel ""aggrieved"" at his punishment given he had been a member of the party for 45 years and had served as an MP for more than two decades. ""The Conservative Party that I have served has always had room for a wide range of opinions and has been tolerant of measured dissent. Philip Hammond was a constant by Theresa May's side despite reported disagreements ""Many parliamentary colleagues have defied the party whip on occasions without any action taken against them."" But he said he would not follow the lead of a number of former colleagues, such as Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, who are standing as independents in the 12 December election. ""I remain a Conservative and I cannot therefore embark on a course of action that would represent a direct challenge in a general election to the party I have supported all my adult life,"" he said. He said he would continue to make the case for a Conservative Party that was ""broad-based, forward-looking, pro-business and pro-markets"". ""I will remain an active party member and will continue to make the case for doing whatever is necessary to deliver a close negotiated future economic and security partnership with the EU."" Mr Hammond served as chancellor for three years under Theresa May, during which he angered Tory Brexiteers for his opposition to a no-deal exit and desire to maintain the closest possible trading relations with the bloc. Before that was foreign secretary, defence secretary and transport secretary under David Cameron. He acquired the nicknames Spreadsheet Phil and Box Office Phil for his attention to detail and somewhat dry political style. Elsewhere, ex-minister Nick Herbert has joined the growing list of Tory MPs from the One Nation wing of the party deciding not to contest the next election, saying he would step down as MP for Arundel and South Downs to focus on his new role as chairman of the Countryside Alliance. Other leading Conservative figures who are leaving Parliament include Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan, Rory Stewart and Margaret James. But announcing her intention to stand as an independent in Guildford, Mrs Milton said she wanted to ""represent her constituency without being bound by party politics"".

"Boy, nine, tried to save drowning sea fall boy","Pigeon's Cove is popular with both local residents and tourists A boy who was playing in a cove slipped from rocks and drowned despite efforts of his nine-year-old friend to rescue him, an inquest heard. Dillan Brown, 13, from Llandudno was with his friend on 4 May at the town's Great Orme when he fell into the sea. His friend, who cannot be named, managed to drag him from the sea and tried to give CPR up to 10 times before going for help. The coroner said Dillan's death had been a ""very unusual incident"". The inquest in Llandudno heard from the friend that Dillan had been on rocks near the water's edge in Pigeon's Cove in the early evening and was ""messing about dangling his feet off the edge"". He slipped and fell into the water, and the boy heard several cries for help before a big wave came. The boy managed to pull Dillan to the shore, although the court heard later it was possible Dillan was in the water for as long as 40 minutes before his friend could get him out. Sea fall death boy was 'much-loved' The boy tried between five and 10 times to administer CPR before climbing back up to the road, Marine Drive, and stopping a cyclist, Scott Hughes. Mr Hughes and Steve Hargreaves, another passer-by, made their way to the shore to help Dillan. Mr Hargreaves said in a statement: ""It became quite apparent he was not breathing and I could not feel any pulse."" The Great Orme in Llandudno The men carried out resuscitation until a rescue team arrived. Dillan was airlifted to Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor but was pronounced dead at 23:00 BST. Pathologist Dr Brian Rogers gave a cause of death as drowning as well as cold water immersion. Assistant coroner David Pojor was told the area was popular with groups of young people but the volume of call outs to the area because of people getting into difficulties was ""very low"". Richard Thomas for Mostyn Estates, which owns the land around the cove, said they had never been approached about putting warning signs in the area. Mr Pojor said he would not write a report calling for signs to be erected because he questioned how practical it would be. He paid tribute to those who had tried to help Dillan, saying the nine-year-old boy had ""acted bravely and responsibly for such a young boy in trying to save his friend"". He recorded a conclusion of accidental death.

Police arrested after Briton abducted in Indonesia,"The British man was driving in Jakarta when he was abducted Four police officers have been arrested after a British man was kidnapped and ransomed for $900,000 (Â£697,000) in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. The officers stopped the man at a road block last week on the pretext of an arrest, investigators allege. But after being taken to a police station, he was moved to a hotel, where payment was demanded for his release. The man, whom the BBC is not naming, is believed to have been freed after the ransom was paid. The British Embassy confirmed they were aware of the incident but they told news agency AFP the investigation was being handled by local police. The mass killer who re-enacted his crimes Man who set strict adultery laws flogged for adultery According to local media, the man was reported missing by his wife on 31 October. He had been stopped on one of the city's highways and taken to the police station before ending up in the hotel in east Jakarta, where his alleged captors interrogated him all day. It ended with them demanding he call his boss to ask for the ransom, to be paid in US dollars But police swooped on the suspects as they attempted to convert the money into local currency. Jakarta Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told CNN Philippines the kidnap attempt had involved ""unscrupulous"" members of the police force. Two civilians are also under arrest for their alleged roles in the man's abduction.

Kuenssberg: A predictably unpredictable election campaign,"The day before the election campaign starts in earnest, a bucket of cold, hard reality has been chucked over any Tories around the place who thought they might be able to set the terms of the debate, or control exactly what will happen in the next six weeks. The man in the pinstripes who charms some Brexiteers stumbled into the first hideous mistake of this election campaign. Jacob Rees-Mogg may have apologised for hisinsensitive remarksabout what happened at Grenfell Tower. But it is toxic for the Tories, playing straight into familiar accusations about the party that they can't understand, and therefore cannot seek to represent, ordinary people for whom life is sometimes a struggle. Boris Johnson and his team are often accused of being simply a bunch of grown-up public school boys, who know little of the world beyond their gilded ascent to power. Rees-Mogg Grenfell comments 'insulting' Election could bring 'seismic change' - Swinson A really simple guide to the UK general election Stereotypes of any type are often overcooked in politics, but wise Conservatives are very well aware they have an image problem on this front that is hard to shed. Today's mistake just gave Labour all of the ammunition it needed to make the charge again and again, and then ensuing upset from some of their backers like Stormzy, the rapper and singer, which will have its own long-lasting half life on social media. There aren't always very many moments of that elusive ""cut through"" in campaigns. This might just be the first moment this time round -  although it is impossible to know yet if the upset over these remarks will shift any votes away from the Tories, or just enrage those who plan to choose other parties already. And elections bring with them weeks, and tides and tides of news that can wash away early horrors or successes for any political party. So far, so predictable - the parties all know well the view of the Conservative prime minister decades ago, Harold Macmillan, who warned what knocked parties off course was ""the opposition of events"". (Yes, apparently he never said, ""events, dear boy, events"", if you want to feel like a clever clogs). But surprises can work in their favour too - and the Liberal Democrats are hoping the election will be just as unpredictable as the last few crazy years. If you had heard a Liberal Democrat leader proclaim they were standing to be a candidate for prime minister not so long ago, you'd have wanted to check their temperature. And yet every time Jo Swinson gets anywhere near a microphone, it's what she says. Have things really become so strange that a party that got 12 MPs in 2017 is knocking on the door of No 10? Never, quite, say never. Although in our first-past-the-post system, you may love or hate, it is vanishingly unlikely that a party could go from 12 MPs to the magic 326 that gives a party a majority, the power to govern, and to get things done. Jo Swinson says the election could be a ""moment for seismic change"". So what are they on about? Well, just as Jacob Rees-Mogg's dreadful gaffe will create terrible headlines for the Conservatives online and in the press, so too, the Lib Dems hope, the bold claim from Jo Swinson that she could genuinely end up in Downing Street creates noise and headlines, a sense of what might, just about, be possible. The more familiar the message, the less far-fetched it might seem, so the theory goes, even though chat from some activists at the party's launch this morning was that getting back up to 50 or 60 seats or would be a pretty good night. Expect the party leader, though, who believes she has a massive opportunity at her fingertips, to repeat her claim about No 10 again and again and again. It may not be the most outlandish campaign we hear in the next few weeks. Welcome to the predictably unpredictable campaign of 2019, and the prime minister hasn't even yet been to the Palace.

How we are targeted online,"Election campaigns are a branch of the marketing industry. In the 21st Century, that means they have shifted online. The appeal of social media platforms such as Facebook for someone with a message to sell is irresistible: they're cheap, fast, less regulated, and you can target much more specifically than through, say, billboard advertising. Once upon a time, like say the middle of the twentieth century, the sources of media in our culture were finite. This was deleterious to democracy, because it limited scrutiny of power, information available to citizens, and led to excessive concentrations of power. But it may - may - have had some benefits in creating social solidarity. Establishing a set of facts that are commonly accepted helps keep a society glued together. Now the glue is gone, and we're being ripped apart by the forces of modern media. All our social media feeds - for those of us who are on social media, that is - vary according to interest. So what we know is very different. And the reason so many people, especially the young, are glued to social media is that their attention has been captured by the smartest engineers on the planet. Those engineers designed platforms which are the greatest cash cows in human history. Every time you do anything on these platforms, you provide them with information which allows anyone with a message to sell to target you. This is why the likes of Facebook (to coin a phrase) are also in essence a branch of the marketing industry. This is boom time for those in the industry. But how do they work exactly? I asked the boss of a marketing agency that doesn't work for any UK political party. It's called BrainLabs.

How a misleading story about Lib Dem leader went viral,"Jo Swinson and her husband Duncan Hames were the subjects of a viral misleading story on Facebook Misleading politics stories go viral online all the time. The action gets particularly frantic during an election campaign. This is the story of how one tale - involving Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson and her husband Duncan Hames - became one of the most-shared politics stories in the first few days of 2019's battle, with a potential audience of more than 1.5 million people. A BBC Trending investigation tracked down the people, from an Italian in North Wales to a barman in London, who exaggerated genuine facts and helped the story go viral via some of Britain's biggest political pages and groups on Facebook. Multiple versions of the story exist, many with different details. But the false allegation at the core is the same: that Ms Swinson's husband personally benefits from European Union funds and this is the main reason why she is against Brexit. The first trace we can find of the story was in a tweet by anaccount called @SammyPants6,externalon 30 September, which showed a number of screenshots. But the story really went viral a few hours later when a tweet by an account called ""HenryVIII"" was retweeted more than 1,000 times. Some elements of the tweet are correct. Duncan Hames, who was an MP from 2010-2015, works for the UK branch of Transparency International. The Berlin office of the non-governmental organisation received a grant of 4m euros (Â£3.4m) from the European Commission in 2018. But the funding for the UK branch - again, the one that Mr Hames works for - is separate. It did receive smaller EU grants: Â£21,000 in 2016/17 and Â£2,000 in 2017/18. The European Commission funds many charities and NGOs and grants go to general accounts - not Mr Hames' own pocket. According to the viral tweet above, the grant paid to Transparency International, which works on anti-corruption projects, explains why Ms Swinson and Mr Hames ""love the EU so much"". But both have a long record of support for the EU. They supported Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, before Hames joined Transparency International. The Liberal Democrats declined to comment for this story. Ms Swinson and Mr Hames are longstanding supporters of the European Union BBC Trending spoke to ""Henry VIII"" via Twitter direct message. The person behind the account claims to be an Italian man named Dino living in north Wales. The account mainly shares posts written in Italian and about Italian politics, but we were not able to independently verify his identity. ""I wanted to know why Jo was so pro-EU,"" he wrote. ""I was told to always follow the money."" He says he posted the tweet after looking into Transparency International's financial accounts, which are published online. Two days later the story jumped from Twitter to a far larger social network. The following post appeared on the Facebook page of Michael Barton, a freelance writer based in London: Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. You may want to readMetaâs Facebook cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The post sticks to the same facts in the tweet by ""Henry VIII"". Mr Barton told the BBC that he didn't see the original tweet and instead compiled the post after conducting his own research. This post caught on, and more and more people started talking about Ms Swinson's husband in Facebook groups and on Twitter. Judging from the groups and pages where the story was spread, it's clear that most of the impetus came from Brexiteers - some supporters of the Conservatives or Brexit Party, and others who are left-wing Labour activists. The online rumours became so strong that the UK branch of Transparency Internationalreleased a statement,externalin early October. ""Transparency International UK (TI-UK) is independent and politically impartial and does therefore both engage with and objectively criticise politicians regardless of their political opinion or party affiliation,"" it said. ""TI-UK has neither advocated for or against the UK's continued membership of the European Union. ""TI-UK is not working on any projects funded by the European Union."" But that press release did not stop the story from spreading and morphing. It exploded into the mainstream when it was shared by Leave.EU, a pro-Brexit Facebook page with almost a million followers. This post was shared 18,000 times and received thousands of likes and comments: Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

It got even further traction over the next few days when it was written up by politically themed Facebook pages with big followings that purport to post news stories. One called ""Unity News Network"", which was set up by pro-Brexit activists, put up a post broadly similar to the examples above. The post linked to an article which hinted at ""sinister facts"" and asked: ""Does Mrs Swinson have a vested interest in remaining in the EU?"" Oliver Down of Unity News Network told the BBC: ""We did not imply anything but merely asked the question to allow readers to make up their own mind."" Others pushed the facts of the story past the breaking point. On 4 October a Facebook page and website called Nye Bevan News, which describes itself as ""pro-proletariat"" and ""anti-establishment"", posted its version of the story. This time it included clearly inaccurate statements: that Mr Hames ""owns"" Transparency International and that the organisation is a ""family company."" The editor of the page is Ben Jenkins, a 34-year-old originally from South Wales who works in a bar in London. Mr Jenkins' page often shares positive posts praising ""Old Labour"" figures like Tony Benn and Nye Bevan. It also frequently criticises ""New Labour"" figures like Tony Blair and his former communications chief Alastair Campbell, who is now a backer of staying in the EU. When he met BBC reporters, Mr Jenkins denied that he set out to be misleading, but described the wording of his post about Swinson as ""spin"". ""We're all Alastair Campbell's illegitimate children,"" Mr Jenkins said, referring to Campbell's stint as the No 10 communications chief and the frequent description of him as a ""spin doctor"". ""He taught us how to do this and he can deal with the consequences."" Mr Jenkins said his page enlists a number of volunteer moderators. No money changes hands, he said, but his popular page - it has more than 113,000 likes - shares their posts. ""They get traffic, I get content,"" he said. The post reached a far bigger audience in pages and groups with names like ""British Voice"", ""WTO Brexit Now"" and ""We Support Jeremy Corbyn"", according to research by misinformation expert Maarten Schenk ofTrendolizer,external. These groups came from across the political spectrum, including communities supporting Labour, the SNP, the Brexit Party, UKIP, and the Conservatives. While it kept spreading on Facebook, the post took a month to reach its peak. It was one of the most popular politics posts on the social network on 4 November. It has now been posted by at least 248 different pages and groups, had close to 50,000 interactions (shares, comments and likes), and the story has now been viewed by a potential audience of over 1.5 million, according to analysis from BBC Monitoring.  248Different Facebook groups and pages where it was posted 47,000+Interactions: Likes, shares, comments 1.5m+Potential audience: followers of pages where story appeared From one obscure tweet, this misleading story has entered mainstream conversation as the UK gears up for an election on 12 December. When we wrotean unrelated articlelast week we quickly received an email saying: ""It is widely reported that Jo Swinson's husband's company has received in excess of Â£4 million from the EU, why doesn't the BBC report this on mainstream news?"" The Swinson story is one example of a misleading politics story going viral. But it's not the only one - or even the first one related to the 2019 election. One of the most viral election videos so far was produced by Joe.co.uk, a left-leaning site aimed at young men. ""Monster Crash"" is a joke video with a serious message - it implies that Boris Johnson and the Conservative cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg stand to profit by engineering a financial crash brought on by a no-deal Brexit. This video has 4m views on Facebook and Twitter The video indirectly references a story which went viral in anti-Brexit circles, again at the beginning of October. Again there were multiple versions of the story, but at the heart of all of them were allegations that financial speculators who help fund the Conservative Party are pushing the UK towards a no-deal Brexit. However, last month the prime minister renegotiated a deal with the EU, which Mr Rees-Mogg voted for. This would seem to pour cold water on the conspiracy theory that they are working to trigger a no-deal Brexit ""monster crash"" for financial gain. As with the Swinson story, several of the elements of the story are true - for instance Mr Rees-Mogg does have astake in a major investment fund.,external But,as the BBC's Simon Jack has explained, ""there has not been enough evidence produced that a few shadowy financiers are pulling the strings of a no-deal Brexit puppet."" Online misinformation has become a hot topic ever since completely made-up posts with fake headlines like ""Pope Francis Shocks World, Endorses Donald Trump for President"" spread during the 2016 US presidential election. Death threats circulate in Brexit Facebook groups The (almost) complete history of 'fake news' The city getting rich from fake news Three years later, online misinformation is more ambiguous, and arguably more difficult to spot. Social media companies have taken some steps to combat outright fakes. Fact-checkers have multiplied, and audiences are savvier. Today, misinformation more often resembles the story about Ms Swinson - deploying genuine facts out of context to point to a inaccurate or biased conclusion. But the effect can be the same. As it spirals through the internet, and is rewritten and re-shared, kernels of fact fall by the wayside, and mistruths spread like wildfire. Have you spotted misleading posts?

Labour's Â£500m a week NHS claim fact-checked,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has claimed a Conservative trade deal with the US after Brexit could cost the NHS up to Â£500m a week, by driving up the price of medicines. Mr Corbyn said this money ""could be taken out of the NHS and handed to big drugs companies"", in a speech setting out his own party's Brexit position. US trade negotiators have set out their objectives for any trade deal with the UK, including ""full market access"" for US pharmaceuticals - although the government says the NHS ""will not be on the table"". We asked Labour, who directed us to an interview with World Health Organization adviser Dr Andrew Hill on a recent Channel 4 Dispatches programme. Dr Hill, from the University of Liverpool, told the BBC that the Â£500m a week figure, which comes from a report he co-wrote with academics at Harvard University, was designed to illustrate how much more the US currently pays for drugs than the UK. ""It's a guide to how much money could be involved but it's difficult to predict how much money would be involved,"" he said. The report itself says it was not trying to estimate how much the NHS would actually spend as a result of a trade deal with the US. But, to give an idea of the ""worst case scenario"", Dr Hill said, they had compared how much was spent on medicines per person in the US and the UK. The report said this was a way to ""crudely estimate"" how much it would cost the NHS if it spent exactly the same as the US on drugs per head of population: The NHS in England spent an estimated Â£18bn on medicines in 2017-18 The US spent 2.5 times as much per head,  according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Multiplying Â£18bn by 2.5 gives an annual cost of Â£45bn That's an extra Â£27bn a year or about Â£519m a week In practice it's highly unlikely that NHS spending on medicines per person would end up being the same as the US's. The Labour leader was asked about the Â£500m figure at his speech on Tuesday and said: ""I believe it to be an accurate and credible figure... and I'm very happy for anybody else to analyse it and tell me if I've understated the case."" Labour have also used the figure on Facebook, on a mocked-up bus (with a nod to the Vote Leave bus Boris Johnson campaigned in front of in 2016 -we've checked its Â£350m claimbefore). The Labour Party used the figure in a post on its official Facebook page At the moment, according to the Office for National Statistics, 9% of all medicines imported by the NHS come directly from the US. In contrast, 79% of medicine imports come from the European Union. But, Dr Hill says, this figure is likely to underestimate the proportion of drugs coming from American manufacturers, because some US companies sell drugs into the UK via other countries. Because of the NHS's size and purchasing power, though, it has a lot of clout when it comes to negotiating prices. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) assesses the benefits of a particular drug and decides the acceptable cost for this benefit. Then the NHS negotiates with companies to lower their prices, rather than paying the market price. NHS prices are also used by several countries as a reference point, meaning those countries will not pay more for drugs than the UK does. Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? There's also a voluntary scheme signed up to by many drug companies selling to the UK. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry says this five-year agreement helps keep drug prices down too. ""The strict processes the UK has in place to ensure value for money mean we have some of the lowest prices for medicines in Europe and this is good for NHS patients,"" a spokesperson said. Why do the US pay so much for prescription drugs? The US view is this is unfair to Americans, who pay more, and ""significantly undervalues"" medicines that are costly to develop and make. US trade negotiators have said that as part of a deal with the UK after Brexit, they want ""non-discriminatory"" access to the UK market. As an example, in a free trade agreement with South Korea the US stipulated that prices for pharmaceutical products should be ""based on competitive market-derived prices"".

Mystery as white foam covers city river,"This video can not be played The foam was seen floating down the River Irwell A city centre river has been covered in a mystery white foam overnight. Part of the River Roch and a large stretch of the River Irwell between Salford and Manchester is blanketed in the unknown substance. Residents suggested it looked like ""leaking bubble bath"" and expressed concerns for wildlife on the river. Environment Agency officers are on site investigating and Salford City Council said it would ""advise residents accordingly"". ""At certain times of year we get a lot of calls about foam in rivers and still waters,"" an Environment Agency spokesman said. The white foam appeared on the River Irwell overnight Mike Duddy, from Mersey Rivers Trust in Salford, advised the public not to enter the waterways after the ""huge icebergs of foam"" were discovered. While the source of the white foam has yet to be confirmed, he told BBC Radio Manchester it is believed someone has poured a pollutant down a surface water drain. ""People shouldn't go in the river until it is considered safe to do so,"" he added. ""Pollutants can be acid, alkaline or it might be a simple detergent which is what we think might have happened today. "" While Mr Duddy hasn't witnessed any evidence of animals, fish and insects in distress, he said it demonstrates how ""a simple act of putting the wrong thing down a surface water drain can have this terrible effect"".

11 charts on what's happened to the NHS,"The NHS faces a number of challenges and often tops the list of concerns voiced by the public, but what state is it actually in? Last year more than Â£156bn was spent on health across the UK - about 12 times the figure that was spent 70 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. It means today about 30p out of every Â£1 spent on public services goes on health. Ever since the early 1950s the budget has been increasing, but the scale of those rises has varied quite considerably. The average rise has been just over 4%. The biggest rises were seen under the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010 when the average annual rise was about 6%. This dropped to 1% under the post-financial crisis coalition government between 2010 and 2015 - a figure which then rose under the majority Conservative government of recent years. The Conservatives have said their five-year funding plan for the NHS will see the budget rise by an average of 3.4% a year above inflation. It means that by 2023-24 there would be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison, during the 2019 General Election, Labour proposed increasing it by 3.9% - bringing the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems were marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. Spot the difference on the NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? Labour often talk about the risk of privatisation of the NHS, accusing the Conservatives of wanting to do a deal with US President Donald Trump. Private firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12. These can be deals to run a specific service or to take on some NHS patients for routine treatments like hip and knee replacements. But it still leaves the overwhelming majority of care provided by the state and state-employed staff. Actually, GPs are technically independent small businesses contracted to provide a service to the NHS - but they tend not to be considered as private providers. Reality Check: How much does the NHS spend on the private sector? NHS money also goes to the private sector to purchase drugs and equipment. Nearly all of this is bought centrally so the NHS can use its bargaining power to negotiate good deals. A recent example of this was the agreement reached with Vertex to fund its cystic fibrosis treatments. The NHS got a significant saving on the price the drug manufacturer originally wanted. Fears have been raised that US firms would want the NHS to agree more lucrative deals - they get more money for their drugs in their own country.  But given the cost to the NHS of such a concession many doubt this is likely. There are three key targets for hospitals: covering A&E, cancer care and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements. All parts of the UK have been struggling to hit them. The way they are measured differs between the UK nations. The A&E target is the most directly comparable - in that each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland than it is in England and Scotland. Scotland is the last nation to have hit the target - back in the summer of 2017. Meanwhile, in cancer care patients are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral. But that too is being missed, while waiting lists for routine treatments are rising. In England it has topped 4.4 million - the highest on record. Some 15% have waited more than the target time of 18 weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor for the growing pressures - and it is one with which all health systems in the world are struggling. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacksdo not claim the lives of people earlyin the same numbers. Evencancer is not the death sentence it once was- half of peoplenow survive for a decade or more. 'I won't let my chronic illness trap me in loneliness' What do the people of the world die from? But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. That level of ill-health means the average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. A 90-year-old costs more than seven times as much. As the number of older people continues to rise so will the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by other factors, including the rising cost of new drugs and high levels of obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions' UK most obese nation in Western Europe All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to receive more generous rises than other areas of government spending. But despite this the UK has been left trailing some other parts of Europe when it comes to spending as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a gap that has widened since the previous Labour government was in power from 1997 to 2010. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders, which tend to tax people more. Germany, for example,has almost twice as many nurses per capita,externalthan the UK. But the lack of staff in the NHS is not just because of less spending, the health service cannot even fill the posts for which it has got funding. The NHS in Englandhas nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled at the moment,external. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes about 40,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. Some of the gaps are filled using overtime and agency staff, but some simply go unfilled. There are various initiatives in place to recruit and retain staff. And the number of training places for doctors and nurses are increasing. While the government has been able to put more money into the NHS, one element of the budget that has been cut is the money set aside for capital projects. That covers the cost of infrastructure, such as building works and IT. In recent years that has resulted in a growing maintenance backlog with hospitals having to contend with leaky roofs, out-of-date equipment and crumbling buildings. NHS claims fact-checked Government plans billions for hospital projects The capital budget increased by Â£1bn for 2019-20, bringing the budget up to Â£7bn. The NHS is also under pressure because of the problems in the social care system. Social care includes day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. The system is means-tested in England, which means only the poorest receive help from councils towards the cost of care. But even then it is heavily rationed. The result is growing numbers of older people going without care. According to Age UK, 1.4 million people over the age of 65 are not getting the care they need. That represents one in seven of all older people and is a rise of nearly a fifth in two years. This lack of care in the community has been directly linked to the growing pressures on hospitals by the Care Quality Commission, the body responsible for regulating standards across health and social care. Where in England does care cost the most? The crisis in care Does free personal care solve the crisis? Hunt: Care cuts went 'too far' The regulator believes that without reform of the system, the extra money being put into the NHS could be swallowed up without a noticeable improvement in performance. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Despite the challenges being faced by the NHS, the majority of the public say they are satisfied with services. The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of people in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services in 2018. But levels of satisfaction are falling. The latest score was athree percentage point drop since 2017and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts say waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

Rees-Mogg Grenfell comments 'insulting',"Jacob Rees-Mogg later said he ""profoundly apologised"" Jacob Rees-Mogg has been criticised for saying it would have been ""common sense"" to flee the Grenfell Tower fire, ignoring fire brigade advice. The Leader of the House of Commons was appearing on a radio phone-in on the findings of aGrenfell inquiry reportwhen he made the comments. The Grenfell United group called the MP's comments ""insulting"". Mr Rees-Mogg said he ""profoundly apologised"". Seventy-two people died in a fire at the tower block on 14 June 2017. Speaking on LBC's Nick Ferrari Show on Monday, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""The more one's read over the weekend about the report and about the chances of people surviving, if you just ignore what you're told and leave you are so much safer. ""And I think if either of us were in a fire, whatever the fire brigade said, we would leave the burning building. It just seems the common sense thing to do. ""And it is such a tragedy that that didn't happen."" Seventy-two people died in the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017 On Tuesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said: ""What I meant to say is that I would have also listened to the fire brigade's advice to stay and wait at the time. ""However, with what we know now and with hindsight I wouldn't and I don't think anyone else would. I would hate to upset the people of Grenfell if I was unclear in my comments."" Grime artist Stormzy has called for Mr Rees-Mogg to resign. In a series of tweets, he said it was as if Mr Rees-Mogg was saying ""those who lost their lives weren't smart enough to escape"". He wrote: ""Let's bare [sic] in mind for 2 secs how horrifying and terrifying the situation would of been for the victims.... and then imagine they're being instructed by firefighters - trusted government authorities - to stay put."" This video can not be played Grenfell survivor Marcio Gomes says he ""had to trust"" advice from firefighters In a statement, survivors' group Grenfell United said: ""The Leader of the House of Commons suggesting that the 72 people who lost their lives at Grenfell lacked common sense is beyond disrespectful. ""It is extremely painful and insulting to bereaved families."" Replying to Mr Rees-Mogg's comments, Grenfell survivor Marcio Gomes said: ""It's common sense not to build houses or flats with flammable material."" Hamid Al Jafari, who lost his father in the fire, said: ""My dad had common sense but when they have no option what should they do? ""Saying sorry doesn't make any difference to us. Any MP needs to think about what they're going to say before they comment so they don't have to apologise."" The blaze reached the top of Grenfell Tower within an hour of the first 999 call Shadow Cabinet minister John Trickett said it was ""not for a minister of the crown to second guess how those people would have reacted"". Tory MP Andrew Bridgen defended Mr Rees-Mogg's commentstelling the BBCthey were ""uncharacteristically clumsy."" ""Jacob is a leader, he's an authority figure. ""What he's actually saying is that he would have given a better decision than the authority figures who gave that advice."" Grenfell inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said fewer people would have died if the London Fire Brigade (LFB) had taken certain actions earlier. Sir Martin criticised the LFB for following a ""stay put"" strategy, where firefighters and 999 operators told residents to stay in their flats for nearly two hours after the blaze broke out. The advice is designed to prevent hundreds of people descending stairs while firefighters are coming up during a contained fire.

As flames spread around Grenfell's external cladding, the advice may have prevented some families escaping, the report found. LFB Commissioner Dany Cotton told the London Assembly on Tuesday the brigade would respond differently to a Grenfell-like fire in the future. She told the fire resilience and emergency planning committee: ""Knowing what we know now about Grenfell Tower and similar buildings with ACM cladding, our response would be very different.""

Election could bring 'seismic change' - Swinson,"This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""Change is absolutely possible"" The general election could be ""a moment for seismic change"", when ""a new and different politics"" emerges, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said. In a speech at the party's campaign launch, she said she could do ""a better job"" than either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. In response, the Conservatives said a vote for the Lib Dems ""risks putting"" Mr Corbyn into Downing Street. The UK will go to the polls on 12 December. Elsewhere in the election campaign: Jeremy Corbyn makes a speechaccusing the PM of trying to ""hijack Brexit to sell out our NHS"" and pledging to ""get Brexit sorted"" in six months. Boris Johnson claims Labour's position is ""to go back to square one"", and urges the Labour leader to ""come clean"" on his Brexit proposals. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also focuses on Europe, telling voters that a vote for her party is ""a vote to escape from Brexit"". The political parties are ramping up their campaigning, ahead of the official start to the five-week election period at just after midnight on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Lib Dems said they would take legal action against ITV over its plans for a head-to-head election debateincluding only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, saying the decision to exclude its leader was ""outrageous"". The party's lawyers have written to the broadcaster to give it ""the opportunity to correct this serious mistake"". ITV has said it intends to offer viewers balanced election coverage. Speaking in London, Ms Swinson said: ""Our country needs us to be more ambitious right now - and we are rising to that challenge. ""It is not about the red team or the blue team, because on this issue they merge into one - both Labour and the Conservatives want to negotiate and deliver Brexit. ""I never thought that I would stand here and say that I'm a candidate to be prime minister, but when I look at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, I am absolutely certain I could do a better job than either of them."" Ms Swinson said Mr Johnson had ""lied to the Queen, lied to Parliament and lied to the country"" and ""was not fit to to be prime minister"". And she accused the Labour leader of failing to ""give a straight answer on the biggest issues facing this country"". The Lib Dems currently have 20 MPs - out of a possible 650 - and they are especially hopeful of gaining seats in London and south-west England, but they would need a dramatic shift in the electoral landscape if they were to win a majority. However, responding to questions from journalists, Ms Swinson said ""stranger things have happened"" and pointed to the SNP's success in the 2015 general election. By chief political correspondent Vicki Young Jo Swinson says she wants to be prime minister - but how credible is that? The Lib Dems are not at the moment even the third largest party in the UK. Ms Swinson cites the example of the SNP surge in 2015, when the party won almost every seat in Scotland - and she personally lost her seat to the SNP candidate. She argues that politics is volatile, it is in flux, and things have changed because of Brexit - people are voting for very different reasons. Therefore, there is no reason why the party can't be incredibly ambitious, she argues. But the problem for the Liberal Democrats is that the way their votes are distributed around the country, it is much harder for them to win seats than for other parties. In 2010, they won seven million votes but got fewer than 60 seats. The Lib Dem leader was introduced by one of the party's newer MPs, Luciana Berger, who used to be in the Labour Party but quit over the issue of anti-Semitism - something Ms Swinson accused Mr Corbyn of failing to ""root out"". Asked whether her party could support a Labour government in the event of a hung Parliament, Ms Swinson said: ""I am absolutely, categorically ruling out Lib Dem votes putting Jeremy Corbyn in No 10."" Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Where do the parties stand on Brexit? The Lib Dem leader said her party was ""the only party standing up to stop Brexit and build a brighter future for the UK"". She argued that stopping Brexit would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" for public services over the next five years The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexitaltogether if they win power at the next general election. If they do not win a majority at the election they would support another referendum. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, told the BBC many Remain supporters were ""uncomfortable"" with the Lib Dems' plan to effectively ""rub out"" the 2016 referendum result and believed EU membership had to be ""argued for and won"" in another public vote. This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""We are the only party that will stop Brexit"" The party said the Â£50bn figure - the amount that it has calculated will be saved over the next five years by staying in the EU - is based on the UK economy being 1.9% larger in 2024-25. It reflects the extra tax income over the next five years and is based on a 0.4% average annual boost to GDP if the UK stays in the EU. Deputy leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Lib Dems ""actually think these are quite cautious figures"", adding that all the independent forecasters ""were clear that there will be a big boost if we stay"". Paul Johnson, from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was a reasonable calculation in line with their own forecasts, adding: ""We could expect the economy to be bigger if we were to remain and this assumes a relatively modest effect if anything, although obviously subject to a huge amount of uncertainty"". BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the vast majority of forecasts do expect the economy would be bigger if the UK were to stay in the EU. But he said the size of that ""bonus"" cannot be predicted with any certainty, and Â£50bn was not a hugely significant amount in terms of overall government expenditure.

Minister must quit - rape trial 'sabotage' victim,"At the time of Ross England's (R) selection to stand as an assembly member, Alun Cairns (L) endorsed Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" A rape victim has called on a UK cabinet minister to quit after his former aide - a Tory Welsh assembly candidate - ""sabotaged"" her trial. Ross Englandmade claims about the victim's sexual history in an April 2018 trialwhich led to its collapse. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns denied knowing about this, but BBC Wales has seen an email sent to him in August 2018 mentioning the matter. Mr England was picked as the assembly election candidate in December 2018. Mr Cairns has been asked to comment. Asked if the minister should resign, the victim - who worked for the Conservative Party - said: ""Absolutely. If he'd come out and condemned Ross [England] in the first instance, he wouldn't be in this position. ""I would like an apology from the party and Alun Cairns for selecting him in the first place. I can't believe that not one senior Welsh Conservative has said that what he did was wrong."" The email on 2 August 2018 was sent to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser. It was also copied to Richard Minshull - the director of the Welsh Conservatives - and another member of staff. It said: ""I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."" Mr Cairns said he only became aware of Ross England's role in the trial's collapse when the story broke last week Mr England, who was selected as the candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan,said he had given an ""honest answer"" while giving evidence at the rape trialof his friend James Hackett. Mr England told the court he had a casual sexual relationship with the complainant - which she denied - despite the judge in the case making it clear that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. The judge, Stephen John Hopkins QC, said to him: ""Why did you say that? Are you completely stupid? ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. Mr Englandwas suspended as a candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan and as an employee last weekafter details of the court case emerged and the party said a ""full investigation will be conducted"". Mr England was selected to stand for the Welsh Conservatives for the 2021 assembly election At the time of his selection to stand as an assembly member, Mr Cairns endorsed Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". A Welsh Conservatives source told the BBC: ""I can't really see how he [Mr Cairns] can possibly carry on - the toxic nature of these revelations could bring down the whole Conservative campaign in Wales. ""If he did have any decency he'd put the party and country first and resign."" A spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives said: ""There is no new information from this leaked document confirming an informal conversation which took place a considerable time after the trial collapsed and is consistent with statements made. ""The full details of this case are still not known and we have taken action in writing to the court. All forthcoming information will be taken into account as the party conducts a thorough investigation."" Christina Rees, Labour's shadow secretary of state for Wales, said the decision to select Mr England as a candidate was ""an error of judgement"" and called on Mr Cairns to resign. Echoing the call, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: ""At worst, Mr Cairns is complicit in the attempted cover up of his former staff member's actions which collapsed a rape trial. ""At best, he has displayed gross incompetence in judgement."" In the first of two statements issued on Thursday, Welsh Tory party chairman Lord Davies of Gower said the party only became aware of the ""full extent of the proceedings"" when Hackett's appeal process ended in October. He said: ""We were fully aware that Ross England was involved as a witness in a sensitive case. We are also aware of the responsibility we have as employers. ""Since the end of the Appeal Court case, we have now been made aware of the full extent of the proceedings."" Mr England gave a speech at the Welsh Conservative conference in 2016 In a second statement, he said he could ""categorically state"" he and Mr Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". Mr England used to work for Mr Cairns in the Vale of Glamorgan and was selected as the party's candidate to fight for the constituency seat at the 2021 Welsh assembly elections. Mr Cairns previously told BBC Wales he only became aware of Mr England's role in the trial's collapse when the story broke last week. In a statement, he said he only became aware of the collapse of the trial ""some considerable time afterwards and had no knowledge of the role of Ross England"". Mr England said he acted honestly during the collapsed trial and did not know that any evidence had been ruled inadmissible. The victim said Mr England's Conservative selection ""shows how little respect they have for me"". She added: ""It is completely shocking to me that Ross England would stand up in court and say these things given that they are untrue. ""He was asked if we worked together, and the answer to that is yes. ""Nobody asked him if we were in a sexual relationship or not. For him to just blurt that out proves to me that it was a formulated plan that he and whoever else conjured to try and derail the trial. ""I think it was an absolutely deliberate attempt to sabotage the trial."" In a statement, Mr England said: ""I gave an honest answer, honouring the oath I took to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ""I complied fully with the conditions of the court before and after the trial."" One Conservative Party source told BBC Wales they called the party's Cardiff headquarters on the day the trial collapsed to inform management Mr England's actions led to that happening. Judge Hopkins went on to say he would be writing to Mr England's political allies in the hope they would take ""appropriate action"". Lord Davies has said ""at no time"" had any party officials received any correspondence in relation to the matter. Mr Evans and Lord Davies have also been asked to comment.

All Mothercare UK stores to close,"Troubled baby goods retailer Mothercare has called in administrators, putting 2,500 UK jobs at risk. There will be a phased closure of all of its 79 UK stores, administrators from PwC said. The UK firm ""has been loss-making for a number of years"", but international franchises are profitable, PwC said. On Monday the baby goods firm said it was ""not capable"" of being sufficiently profitable and that it had failed to find a buyer. Joint administrator Zelf Hussain said: ""This is a sad moment for a well-known High Street name,"" adding that Mothercare ""has been hit hard by increasing cost pressures and changes in consumer spending."" ""It's with real regret that we have to implement a phased closure of all UK stores. Our focus will be to help employees and keep the stores trading for as long as possible,"" Mr Hussain said. Mothercare chairman Clive Whiley said there was ""deep regret and sadness that we have been unable to avoid the administration of Mothercare"" and that the board ""fully understand the significant impact on those UK colleagues and business partners who are affected"". He added: ""However, the board concluded that the administration processes serve the wider interests of ensuring a sustainable future for the company, including the wider group's global colleagues, its pension fund, lenders and other stakeholders."" What has gone wrong at Mothercare? Mothercare looks to protect its UK pension schemes Mothercare: Parents share their memories Do you work for Mothercare? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Mothercare said it was in continuing talks over possible UK concession stores and about using the brand to sell goods online. It said it wouldmove its pensions scheme across to its international business. Former Mothercare store manager Michelle Smith lost her job in October 2018 when her Isle of Wight store was one of 51 to close. She said she felt sorry for the people who will lose their jobs due to the administration. When her store closed, it was ""devastating"" for the Isle of Wight, she said. ""My store was the only child and baby shop on the island,"" she said. While branded baby products can be cheaper online, a lot of people like to see, touch and feel products before buying them, she added. However, online retailers don't have the same overheads, she said. Michelle is now a store manager for Co-op. The administration will be ""disappointing for all the employees but it's not unexpected"", said Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. Since the firm negotiated a rescue deal with lenders last year, ""they haven't changed anything fundamentally"", she said. ""The levels of investment needed to future-proof the business would have been so significant and they couldn't make that leap,"" she added.

Bristol approves clean air diesel ban,"Bristol needs to reduce air pollution to meet legal limits Bristol is set to become the UK's first city to ban diesel cars from entering parts of the city centre in a bid to cut air pollution. Bristol City Council has agreed to ban privately owned diesel cars from a central zone in the daytime. Commercial vehicles will pay to enter the area. The city has long suffered from poor air quality, particularly from high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The scheme, which needs government approval, is due to start in 2021. A public consultation earlier this year looked at a clean air zone and a diesel ban. The proposal is largely an amalgamation of both The central ban zone, where privately owned diesel cars will be banned between 07:00 and 15:00, includes part of the M32, the old city, Redcliffe, Spike Island, the Harbourside, and part of Hotwells. Vehicles, with the exception of taxis and emergency services, will incur fines if they stray into the area. A wider Clean Air Zone (CAZ) extends further away from the city centre. Diesel powered lorries, vans, buses and taxis which pay to enter the wider clean air zone will also be allowed in the central zone. Taxis and vans will pay a daily charge of Â£9 and buses and HGVs Â£100. Private diesel cars will not be charged to enter the wider clean air zone. A number plate recognition system, similar to the one used to police London's congestion charge will be used. The city council has agreed a business proposal for the idea, but details of specifics such as how much fines will be, and which categories of vehicles and people might be exempt from the ban, are yet to be decided. Bristol City Council is under a legal obligation to reduce air pollution in the city by lowering toxic NO2 levels to within legal limits as quickly as possible. However the city has twice missed government deadlines for providing details of a clean air zone. It is hoped this new plan will enable it to achieve clean air compliance by 2025. Taxis and vans will pay a daily charge of Â£9 and buses and HGVs Â£100 Pete Simson, BBC Radio Bristol politics reporter, said: ""It's hard to overstate how significant a policy intervention this is. ""This is a first, no other UK city is introducing an outright diesel ban, and it will require the government to introduce new legislation."" Low emissions zones have already been debated in several other UK cities, including Birmingham, London and Leicester. Many of these schemes involve older, more polluting diesel vehicles being banned from certain areas or vehicles having to pay to enter zones. Similar systems exist in many European cities. In Oslo a total diesel ban can be enforced on the most polluted days. While some local people have welcomed the idea, others say the plans are too complicated and fear it will simply move the most polluted area away from the city centre. There are also concerns the scheme will hit low-income families the hardest. Alan Peters from bus company Abus which operates services around the city, said penalising buses was ""excessive and the wrong approach"". ""They should be encouraging the use of buses rather than increasing the cost."" He said it would need Â£1.25m of investment to replace his vehicles on the route between the city centre and Keynsham.

Police arrested after Briton abducted in IndonesiaThe alleged abductors are said to have been caught trying to change ransom money into local currency.,"The British man was driving in Jakarta when he was abducted Four police officers have been arrested after a British man was kidnapped and ransomed for $900,000 (Â£697,000) in the Indonesian capital Jakarta. The officers stopped the man at a road block last week on the pretext of an arrest, investigators allege. But after being taken to a police station, he was moved to a hotel, where payment was demanded for his release. The man, whom the BBC is not naming, is believed to have been freed after the ransom was paid. The British Embassy confirmed they were aware of the incident but they told news agency AFP the investigation was being handled by local police. The mass killer who re-enacted his crimes Man who set strict adultery laws flogged for adultery According to local media, the man was reported missing by his wife on 31 October. He had been stopped on one of the city's highways and taken to the police station before ending up in the hotel in east Jakarta, where his alleged captors interrogated him all day. It ended with them demanding he call his boss to ask for the ransom, to be paid in US dollars But police swooped on the suspects as they attempted to convert the money into local currency. Jakarta Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told CNN Philippines the kidnap attempt had involved ""unscrupulous"" members of the police force. Two civilians are also under arrest for their alleged roles in the man's abduction.

Nursery children 'potential sex assault victims',"The nursery can cater for more than 50 children up to the age of five ""A number of children"" have been identified as potential victims by police investigating claims of a sexual assault at a nursery. Officers were called to Jack and Jill Childcare, in Torquay, in July. Devon and Cornwall Police said it had since identified several children as ""potential victims of contact offences"". An employee, who was arrested and bailed in July, has been moved out of the area while inquiries continue. The nursery, which caters for children as young as two, has had its licence suspended. Acting Det Ch Insp James Stock, of Devon and Cornwall Police's Public Protection Unit, said more than 250 hours of CCTV at the nursery had been reviewed. He said ""a number of children aged two-plus have been identified as potential victims of contact offences"" as a result. More than 100 families who have children at the nursery have been contacted as part of the investigation, police said. Officers and social workers had visited parents and guardians of those believed to be victims. CCTV at the nursery has been reviewed by police In a notice posted on a window at the nursery, Ofsted said the suspension runs from 24 October to 24 December. ""The purpose of the suspension is to allow time to investigate our belief that a child may be exposed to a risk of harm and for any necessary steps to be taken to eliminate or reduce the risk of harm,"" the notice said. ""We will regularly review the situation and will stop the suspension within this period if we believe children are no longer at risk. ""Suspension does not automatically mean that a provider is unsuitable to provide care in the future or that we will cancel registration. ""We only take steps to cancel registration if we consider that the provider is no longer suitable to provide childcare."" Acting Det Ch Insp Stock said contact with the suspect appeared to be ""limited to within the nursery setting and we do not believe that any other member of staff had knowledge of these matters"". ""These appear to be the actions of a lone individual. and the offences do not involve the taking or distributing of any images,"" he said. Nancy Meehan, deputy director of Torbay Children's Services, said safeguarding children was taken ""incredibly seriously"" and ahelpline had been set up,externalfor anyone who had concerns.

No 10 denies suppressing Russia interference report,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference The government has denied claims it is suppressing a report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy until after the general election. Sources said No 10 was stalling on releasing the report, which has gained the standard security clearance. A former head of MI5, Lord Evans of Weardale, is among those calling for the document to be published. Foreign minister Christopher Pincher said the PM would release the report in ""due course"". He added: ""We cannot rush this process at the risk of undermining our national security."" Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report No Russia interference report until after election A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The report, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. It examines Russian activity - including allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in elections - and includes evidence from UK intelligence services such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 concerning covert Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Approval for its publication has yet to be given - andis not due to be until after polling day. Dominic Grieve, the chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, said there was no legitimate reason for delaying the report and voters had a right to see it before going to the polls. During an urgent question in the Commons, the former attorney general said there was a ""longstanding agreement"" that the prime minister would endeavour to respond to the committee's reports within 10 days. Mr Grieve also said the intelligence agencies had indicated that publication of the report would not prejudice the discharge of their functions. But foreign office minister Mr Pincher said the turnaround time for the report was ""not unusual"" - and gave examples of reports that had taken six weeks to get Downing Street's approval. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Downing Street's decision not to clear the report for publication before the general election was ""clearly politically motivated"". ""This is nothing less than an attempt to suppress the truth from the public and from Parliament and it is an affront to our democracy,"" she told the Commons. Ms Thornberry said No 10 realised the report would lead to ""other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and with the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign"". She went on: ""Publish this report and let us see for ourselves, otherwise there is only one question: what have you got to hide?"" Mr Pincher denied the decision not to publish the report before the election was politically motivated. BBC Newsnight diplomatic editor Mark Urban tweeted,externalthat the government's assertion the report was being held back because of a need to ""vet and balance"" it was ""unusual to say the least"". ""It's more normal for govt [sic] to respond after publication,"" he said. Earlier, Lord Evans, MI5 director general until 2013, told the Today programme ministers should explain why they were not prepared to release the report. ""In principle, I think it should be released,"" he said. ""Part of the reason for having an Intelligence and Security Committee is that issues of public concern can be properly considered and the public can be informed through the publication of the reports once they have gone through the security process."" He added: ""If the government have a reason why this should not be published before the election, then I think they should make it very clear what that reason is."" Ex-terrorism watchdog Lord Anderson said on Monday further delay would ""invite suspicion"" of the government's motives ahead of the election.

Power to break law 'critical' for MI5 informants,"MI5 headquarters in London Rules letting MI5 informants commit crimes are ""critical"" to national security, lawyers for the Security Service have told a court. MI5 is fighting an attempt to disclose secret guidance its officers can authorise informants to take part in crimes and not tell prosecutors. Campaign groups told the Investigatory Powers Tribunal the policy is unlawful and could be hiding serious abuses. MI5 said it does not authorise activity that would breach human rights. The unique case, large parts of which will take place in secret, comes a year after the government confirmed the existence of a previously secret document, dubbed the ""Third Directive"". Signed by former Prime Minister David Cameron, the directive confirmed for the first time that MI5 officers could allow their recruited informants and agents to commit crimes in the national interest, without any duty to tell police and prosecutors what had happened. But the accompanying detailed guidance on how the policy works in practice remains largely secret. The disclosed elements stress that any authorisation must be in the interests of preventing a more serious offence, protecting an informant's cover or to protect national security. A redacted document shows some of the guidance governing how MI5 can authorise its agents to commit crimes Four campaign groups - two of which are from Northern Ireland - are now seeking to have the guidance disclosed and ruled illegal. In submissions to the tribunal, they say that ""grave abuses"" in Northern Ireland showed the public had a right to know. They include allegations that the state covered up its involvement in the 1989 murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane and a massive investigation into suspected crimes committed by the UK's most valuable agent at the heart of the IRA, codenamed ""Stakeknife"". Q&A: The murder of Pat Finucane Stakeknife: Top British spy 'helped SAS kill IRA men' Ben Jaffey QC, for the four campaign groups, told the court ""the agents in question are not officers of the Security Service, but they are recruited and given directions by MI5"". However, he said those MI5 officers could become criminally liable as an accessory. Mr Jaffey said MI5's policy amounted to the Security Service deciding for itself that it could brush aside criminal law. ""They are trying to do by the back door what Parliament won't give them by the front door,"" he said. ""The practical effect of the policy is to grant the immunity that they wanted but were not prepared to ask Parliament to give them."" But in legal papers disclosed on Tuesday morning, government lawyers for MI5 said: ""It would be impossible [for MI5 to fulfil its functions] effectively without covert human intelligence sources. They are indispensable. ""The Security Service does not, and does not purport to, confer immunity from criminal liability. It is not able to authorise activity which would breach... the European Convention on Human Rights. The case is that they do not do so."" ""The Security Service has, since its inception, run agents; and agents have had to participate in conduct that might be or would be criminal as an integral part of their ability to operate,"" the lawyers said. The tribunal was told MI5 had reviewed all available records of agents being involved in crimes since October 2000. The result of that secret audit has been given to the tribunal - but not disclosed to the public. ""This is not a 'nice to have power'... it is critical,"" the Security Service's lawyers said. ""The whole point of the agent involvement is to avoid loss of life and limb."" The tribunal is due to hear submissions over four days and is expected to reserve its judgment.

Mystery as white foam covers city riverLocals said it looked like bubble bath had spilled into the water between Salford and Manchester.,"This video can not be played The foam was seen floating down the River Irwell A city centre river has been covered in a mystery white foam overnight. Part of the River Roch and a large stretch of the River Irwell between Salford and Manchester is blanketed in the unknown substance. Residents suggested it looked like ""leaking bubble bath"" and expressed concerns for wildlife on the river. Environment Agency officers are on site investigating and Salford City Council said it would ""advise residents accordingly"". ""At certain times of year we get a lot of calls about foam in rivers and still waters,"" an Environment Agency spokesman said. The white foam appeared on the River Irwell overnight Mike Duddy, from Mersey Rivers Trust in Salford, advised the public not to enter the waterways after the ""huge icebergs of foam"" were discovered. While the source of the white foam has yet to be confirmed, he told BBC Radio Manchester it is believed someone has poured a pollutant down a surface water drain. ""People shouldn't go in the river until it is considered safe to do so,"" he added. ""Pollutants can be acid, alkaline or it might be a simple detergent which is what we think might have happened today. "" While Mr Duddy hasn't witnessed any evidence of animals, fish and insects in distress, he said it demonstrates how ""a simple act of putting the wrong thing down a surface water drain can have this terrible effect"".

European arrest warrant issued for Clara Ponsati,"This video can not be played Clara Ponsati: 'I feel outrage and injustice' A new European arrest warrant has been issued for a St Andrews University professor over her role in the 2017 push for independence in Catalonia. Clara PonsatÃ­, who was education minister in the Catalan government, is wanted in Spain on a charge of sedition. Prof Ponsati, 62, denies wrongdoing and says she will resist extradition. A previous warrant was withdrawn last summer, but the academic again faces being sent to Spain to stand trial. The move comes after nine Catalan leaders were convicted of sedition over their role in an unsanctioned referendum on independence in 2017. Protestserupted in Barcelona last monthafter they were sentenced to between nine and 13 years in prison by Spain's Supreme Court. Prosecutors argued that the unilateral declaration of independence was an attack on the Spanish state and accused some of those involved of a serious act of rebellion. They also said separatist leaders had misused public funds while organising the 2017 referendum. Riot police in Barcelona tried to disperse protesters who set up burning barricades last month Speaking to BBC Political Correspondent Niall O'Gallagher, Prof Ponsati said: ""I feel a very intense feeling of outrage and injustice. ""A guilty verdict on the Catalan leaders is a guilty verdict on the Catalan people that went to the polls on the referendum day. So everyone will feel the verdict in their own souls."" Prof Ponsati said she did not regret returning to her post at St Andrews University early last year, having fled the Catalan capital. She added: ""I think I can be more useful as a free person."" Catalonia's bid for independence from Spain explained Catalonia crisis in 300 words Prof PonsatÃ­ considers herself an exile, unable to go home for fear of arrest. Asked if there were moments when she wondered if it was worth it, she replied: ""Of course - but at this point all I can do is keep up the fight, and submit to Scottish justice if I have to. ""This is much greater than myself, I'm just one small grain of sand."" Prof Ponsati was given a standing ovation after addressing the SNP conference in Aberdeen last year Prof Ponsati's lawyer Aamer Anwar confirmed she will report to St Leonard's Police Office in Edinburgh at 10:30 on Thursday where she will be detained and arrested. The academic will then be transferred to Edinburgh Sheriff Court for a hearing where her legal team will apply for bail. Mr Anwar confirmed Prof Ponsati faces a single charge of sedition and, if extradited and convicted, could face a sentence of up to 15 years. He said: ""It will be argued by Clara's legal team that there is no guarantee of a right to a fair trial in Spain, where most members of the Catalan government are already in prison or in exile. ""Clara believes the charge to be part of 'a political motivated prosecution' and submits her extradition would be unjust and incompatible with her human rights."" Mr Anwar vowed the extradition will be ""opposed robustly"" and said the academic is ""deeply grateful"" for the support she has received. He added: ""Once again she is taking on the might of the Spanish state and Clara is resolute and determined to fight and believes that Spain will never be able to crush the spirit of the Catalan People.""

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm we are in possession of a European Arrest Warrant for Clara Ponsati. ""We have now been in contact with her solicitor, who is making arrangements for her to hand herself in to police."" Spain withdrew the previous European arrest warrantfor Prof Ponsati last July, four months after she was arrested by Scottish police. At the time Prof Ponsati argued that the charges against her were politically-motivated, and claimed she would not receive a fair trial if she returned to Spain. The independence movement in Catalonia has close links with its Scottish counterpart, and Prof Ponsati was given a standing ovation at the SNP conference in Aberdeen last year. Prof Ponsati had been working as the director of the School of Economics and Finance at St Andrews University since January 2016, before being appointed as the Catalan government's education minister in July 2017. She returned to work at St Andrews last year, having been in Belgium since fleeing Spain with deposed Catalan president Carles Puigdemont and three other former cabinet members following an unsuccessful bid to declare independence from Spain in October 2017. Catalan nationalists have long complained that their region, which has a distinct history dating back almost 1,000 years, sends too much money to poorer parts of Spain, as taxes are controlled by Madrid. The wealthy region is home to about 7.5 million people, with their own language, parliament, flag and anthem. During the Supreme Court case last month prosecutors argued the leaders had carried out a ""perfectly planned strategy... to break the constitutional order and obtain the independence of Catalonia"" illegally. Carme Forcadell, the former parliament speaker who read out the independence result on 27 October 2017, was also accused of allowing parliamentary debates on independence despite warnings from Spain's Constitutional Court.

Rail workers to hold 27 days of strikes,"The RMT has announced drivers and guards will take 27 days of industrial action A union has announced 27 days of rail strikes during December and on New Year's Day as part of a long-running dispute over train guards. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said its staff at South Western Railway (SWR) had been left with ""no choice"" but to take industrial action.

No 10 denies suppressing Russia interference reportDowning Street is accused of delaying a report on Brexit referendum allegations until after the election.,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference The government has denied claims it is suppressing a report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy until after the general election. Sources said No 10 was stalling on releasing the report, which has gained the standard security clearance. A former head of MI5, Lord Evans of Weardale, is among those calling for the document to be published. Foreign minister Christopher Pincher said the PM would release the report in ""due course"". He added: ""We cannot rush this process at the risk of undermining our national security."" Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report No Russia interference report until after election A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The report, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. It examines Russian activity - including allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in elections - and includes evidence from UK intelligence services such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 concerning covert Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Approval for its publication has yet to be given - andis not due to be until after polling day. Dominic Grieve, the chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, said there was no legitimate reason for delaying the report and voters had a right to see it before going to the polls. During an urgent question in the Commons, the former attorney general said there was a ""longstanding agreement"" that the prime minister would endeavour to respond to the committee's reports within 10 days. Mr Grieve also said the intelligence agencies had indicated that publication of the report would not prejudice the discharge of their functions. But foreign office minister Mr Pincher said the turnaround time for the report was ""not unusual"" - and gave examples of reports that had taken six weeks to get Downing Street's approval. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Downing Street's decision not to clear the report for publication before the general election was ""clearly politically motivated"". ""This is nothing less than an attempt to suppress the truth from the public and from Parliament and it is an affront to our democracy,"" she told the Commons. Ms Thornberry said No 10 realised the report would lead to ""other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and with the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign"". She went on: ""Publish this report and let us see for ourselves, otherwise there is only one question: what have you got to hide?"" Mr Pincher denied the decision not to publish the report before the election was politically motivated. BBC Newsnight diplomatic editor Mark Urban tweeted,externalthat the government's assertion the report was being held back because of a need to ""vet and balance"" it was ""unusual to say the least"". ""It's more normal for govt [sic] to respond after publication,"" he said. Earlier, Lord Evans, MI5 director general until 2013, told the Today programme ministers should explain why they were not prepared to release the report. ""In principle, I think it should be released,"" he said. ""Part of the reason for having an Intelligence and Security Committee is that issues of public concern can be properly considered and the public can be informed through the publication of the reports once they have gone through the security process."" He added: ""If the government have a reason why this should not be published before the election, then I think they should make it very clear what that reason is."" Ex-terrorism watchdog Lord Anderson said on Monday further delay would ""invite suspicion"" of the government's motives ahead of the election.

"Mothercare collapses into administrationThe baby goods firm, which has 79 retail stores in the UK, has appointed administrators from PwC.Business","Troubled baby goods retailer Mothercare has called in administrators, putting 2,500 UK jobs at risk.

"Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - CorbynBut the Tories say his proposal for a new deal and referendum within six months is a ""fairy tale"".Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The Tories have failed on Brexit for three years"" Labour's promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" within six months of winning power has been dismissed as ""fairytale politics"" by the Conservatives in the first clash of the election campaign on the issue. In a speech in Essex, Jeremy Corbyn said his plan to get a better deal and then put it to the public in another referendum was ""clear and simple"". He said a deadline to hold the vote next summer was ""realistic and doable"". But the Tories said Labour's plan would result in ""paralysing uncertainty"". However, the Conservative commitment to negotiate a new free trade deal with the EU in just over a year is also coming under scrutiny. It took seven years for the EU to conclude a free trade deal with Canada, an agreement which many Brexiteers see as a template for the UK. Any deal would need to be agreed by all 27 remaining EU states before it could come into force. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, said a majority Conservative government would ""absolutely not"" extend the transition period after the UK's departure from the EU - under Mr Johnson's deal it is due to end at the start of 2021. Pressed on whether this could ultimately lead to a no-deal exit - with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules - if no free trade deal could be agreed by that point, he pointed out that Mr Johnson had been able to secure major changes to the current withdrawal agreement in ""just 90 days"". Ex-Justice Secretary David Gauke, who lost the Tory whip after rebelling over Brexit, said it would be ""reckless"" to exit transition without a trade deal and MPs must get a vote before this happened.

The political parties are ramping up their election campaigning, ahead of the official start to the five-week campaign period at just after midnight on Wednesday. Brexit is set to be a crucial issue when voters go to the polls on 12 December, with Mr Johnson insisting the UK will leave in January if he wins power. The UK and US have both said they are eager to do a free trade deal after Brexit, and in August, President Donald Trump predicted that leaving the EU would be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". But in a speech in Harlow - a target seat for Labour - Mr Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of seeking to ""hijack Brexit to sell out the NHS"" to American firms in a future trade deal with the US. Labour is hoping its candidate Laura McAlpine will take the Conservative-held seat of Harlow The PM's strategy could see an extra Â£500m a week spent on buying medicines, he claimed, as well as leading to a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights and product standards. Mr Johnson has insisted the NHS would ""not be on the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks with the US. FACT CHECK: Labour's Â£500m a week NHS claim The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the Â£500m figure was a theoretical worst-case scenario in which the prices of all medicines used in the NHS were the same as the prices of those medicines in the US. However, he said in practice that was highly unlikely - although there was no question US pharmaceutical companies would lobby aggressively for greater access to the NHS, and the ability to set higher prices. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mr Corbyn claimed Boris Johnson's EU exit deal will ""unleash Thatcherism on steroids"". ""Given the chance, they'll slash food standards to match those of the US where 'acceptable levels' of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed,"" he will claim. ""And they will put chlorinated chicken on the supermarket shelves."" If elected next month, Mr Corbyn said he could strike a ""sensible"" new deal with the EU within months ""based on terms we have already discussed with the EU - including membership of a customs union and absolute guarantees on workers rights. At the same time, a Labour government would plan for a new public vote in June or July. ""Labour's plan would get Brexit sorted so a Labour government can get on with delivering the real change Britain needs,"" he told activists. Boris Johnson said his cabinet could be ""proud"" of its record on Brexit ""Only a Labour government would put a decision in your hands... It cannot be left to the politicians...The Brexit crisis must be resolved but it must done democratically."" Mr Corbyn has refused to say whether he would back Leave or Remain, but said he would ""immediately carry out"" the public's decision so the country could ""move on"". Speaking at the same event, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would ""rip up"" Mr Johnson's deal with the EU, describing it as a ""trap door"" to a no-deal exit at the end of the transition period. He said reaching a new economic and security relationship with the EU was a ""massive task"" and there would be ""no safety net"" if the talks were not concluded next year. But Mr Johnson said another referendum would be a ""disastrous, clamorous"" waste of time. Addressing ministers in Downing Street at his final cabinet meeting before Parliament is dissolved for the election, he said his government ""could be proud"" of what it had achieved on Brexit, despite failing to meet his ""do-or-die"" deadline to leave on 31 October. ""We've achieved something people thought we really couldn't do - get a great new deal on Brexit from EU - they said it couldn't be done. ""The choice before country is really very clear - do you want to go forward with our agenda which is to get Brexit done and then get on with delivering all the wonderful things we want to do for this country... or do you want to waste 2020?"" And Mr Gove suggested Mr Corbyn was incapable of negotiating a new Brexit deal in the way Mr Johnson had done. ""It is a fairy tale if you imagine Jeremy Corbyn can get Brexit done. His policy on Brexit has been constructed by a terminally weak leader in order to paper over the cracks in his party."" And on a visit to a gymnasium in the Derbyshire seat of Bolsover, Nigel Farage said The Brexit Party was ""going after"" Labour MPs who he said had failed to deliver what people voted for in the 2016 referendum.

10 charts on what's happened to the NHS,"The NHS faces a number of challenges and often tops the list of concerns voiced by the public, but what state is it actually in? Last year more than Â£156bn was spent on health across the UK - about 12 times the figure that was spent 70 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. It means today about 30p out of every Â£1 spent on public services goes on health. Ever since the early 1950s the budget has been increasing, but the scale of those rises has varied quite considerably. The average rise has been just over 4%. The biggest rises were seen under the Labour governments between 1997 and 2010 when the average annual rise was about 6%. This dropped to 1% under the post-financial crisis coalition government between 2010 and 2015 - a figure which then rose under the majority Conservative government of recent years. The Conservatives have said their five-year funding plan for the NHS will see the budget rise by an average of 3.4% a year above inflation. It means that by 2023-24 there would be Â£149bn of funding available. By comparison, during the 2019 General Election, Labour proposed increasing it by 3.9% - bringing the budget to Â£155bn by 2023-24. The Lib Dems were marginally behind this coming in at Â£154bn. Spot the difference on the NHS Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? Labour often talk about the risk of privatisation of the NHS, accusing the Conservatives of wanting to do a deal with US President Donald Trump. Private firms are already involved in providing NHS care. Just over 7% of the budget goes on private providers, up from just over 5% in 2011-12. These can be deals to run a specific service or to take on some NHS patients for routine treatments like hip and knee replacements. But it still leaves the overwhelming majority of care provided by the state and state-employed staff. Actually, GPs are technically independent small businesses contracted to provide a service to the NHS - but they tend not to be considered as private providers. Reality Check: How much does the NHS spend on the private sector? NHS money also goes to the private sector to purchase drugs and equipment. Nearly all of this is bought centrally so the NHS can use its bargaining power to negotiate good deals. A recent example of this was the agreement reached with Vertex to fund its cystic fibrosis treatments. The NHS got a significant saving on the price the drug manufacturer originally wanted. Fears have been raised that US firms would want the NHS to agree more lucrative deals - they get more money for their drugs in their own country.  But given the cost to the NHS of such a concession many doubt this is likely. There are three key targets for hospitals: covering A&E, cancer care and routine operations, such as knee and hip replacements. All parts of the UK have been struggling to hit them. The way they are measured differs between the UK nations. The A&E target is the most directly comparable - in that each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland than it is in England and Scotland. Scotland is the last nation to have hit the target - back in the summer of 2017. Meanwhile, in cancer care patients are meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral. But that too is being missed, while waiting lists for routine treatments are rising. In England it has topped 4.4 million - the highest on record. Some 15% have waited more than the target time of 18 weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor for the growing pressures - and it is one with which all health systems in the world are struggling. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacksdo not claim the lives of people earlyin the same numbers. Evencancer is not the death sentence it once was- half of peoplenow survive for a decade or more. 'I won't let my chronic illness trap me in loneliness' What do the people of the world die from? But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. That level of ill-health means the average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. A 90-year-old costs more than seven times as much. As the number of older people continues to rise so will the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by other factors, including the rising cost of new drugs and high levels of obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. Colluding drug firms 'cost NHS millions' UK most obese nation in Western Europe All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to receive more generous rises than other areas of government spending. But despite this the UK has been left trailing some other parts of Europe when it comes to spending as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. It is a gap that has widened since the previous Labour government was in power from 1997 to 2010. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders, which tend to tax people more. Germany, for example,has almost twice as many nurses per capita,externalthan the UK. But the lack of staff in the NHS is not just because of less spending, the health service cannot even fill the posts for which it has got funding. The NHS in Englandhas nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled at the moment,external. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes about 40,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. Some of the gaps are filled using overtime and agency staff, but some simply go unfilled. There are various initiatives in place to recruit and retain staff. And the number of training places for doctors and nurses are increasing. While the government has been able to put more money into the NHS, one element of the budget that has been cut is the money set aside for capital projects. That covers the cost of infrastructure, such as building works and IT. In recent years that has resulted in a growing maintenance backlog with hospitals having to contend with leaky roofs, out-of-date equipment and crumbling buildings. NHS claims fact-checked Government plans billions for hospital projects The capital budget increased by Â£1bn for 2019-20, bringing the budget up to Â£7bn. The NHS is also under pressure because of the problems in the social care system. Social care includes day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. The system is means-tested in England, which means only the poorest receive help from councils towards the cost of care. But even then it is heavily rationed. The result is growing numbers of older people going without care. According to Age UK, 1.4 million people over the age of 65 are not getting the care they need. That represents one in seven of all older people and is a rise of nearly a fifth in two years. This lack of care in the community has been directly linked to the growing pressures on hospitals by the Care Quality Commission, the body responsible for regulating standards across health and social care. Where in England does care cost the most? The crisis in care Does free personal care solve the crisis? Hunt: Care cuts went 'too far' The regulator believes that without reform of the system, the extra money being put into the NHS could be swallowed up without a noticeable improvement in performance. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Despite the challenges being faced by the NHS, the majority of the public say they are satisfied with services. The British Social Attitudes poll of nearly 3,000 people found 53% of people in England, Scotland and Wales were satisfied with services in 2018. But levels of satisfaction are falling. The latest score was athree percentage point drop since 2017and the lowest level since 2007. A peak of 70% was seen in 2010. Experts say waiting times and a lack of staff were major concerns as ratings for GPs dropped to an all-time low. Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn?

Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond to stand down as MPThe former Tory will not stand in Runnymede and Weybridge after losing the whip over Brexit.Election 2019,"Mr Hammond said he felt ""aggrieved"" at his treatment by the party Former Chancellor Philip Hammond is to leave Parliament ""with great sadness"" after deciding against standing as an independent in his Surrey constituency. Mr Hammond lost the Conservative whip in September after defying Boris Johnson over a no-deal Brexit. As a result, he cannot stand as a Tory candidate in Runnymede and Weybridge, which he has represented since 1997. He said he would not stand as an independent as that would be a ""direct challenge"" to the party he loved. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Hammond was among 21 Tory MPs thrown out of the parliamentary party in September for backing legislation designed to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal - the so-called Benn Act. Unlike a number of the group, he has not had the whip restored after rebelling again earlier this month to back Labour calls for more time to scrutinise Boris Johnson's deal. The PM blamed him and other former Tory rebels for stopping the UK leaving the EU on the 31 October deadline. Which MPs are standing down? In a letter to constituents, Mr Hammond said he continued to feel ""aggrieved"" at his punishment given he had been a member of the party for 45 years and had served as an MP for more than two decades. ""The Conservative Party that I have served has always had room for a wide range of opinions and has been tolerant of measured dissent. Philip Hammond was a constant by Theresa May's side despite reported disagreements ""Many parliamentary colleagues have defied the party whip on occasions without any action taken against them."" But he said he would not follow the lead of a number of former colleagues, such as Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton, who are standing as independents in the 12 December election. ""I remain a Conservative and I cannot therefore embark on a course of action that would represent a direct challenge in a general election to the party I have supported all my adult life,"" he said. He said he would continue to make the case for a Conservative Party that was ""broad-based, forward-looking, pro-business and pro-markets"". ""I will remain an active party member and will continue to make the case for doing whatever is necessary to deliver a close negotiated future economic and security partnership with the EU."" Mr Hammond served as chancellor for three years under Theresa May, during which he angered Tory Brexiteers for his opposition to a no-deal exit and desire to maintain the closest possible trading relations with the bloc. Before that was foreign secretary, defence secretary and transport secretary under David Cameron. He acquired the nicknames Spreadsheet Phil and Box Office Phil for his attention to detail and somewhat dry political style. Elsewhere, ex-minister Nick Herbert has joined the growing list of Tory MPs from the One Nation wing of the party deciding not to contest the next election, saying he would step down as MP for Arundel and South Downs to focus on his new role as chairman of the Countryside Alliance. Other leading Conservative figures who are leaving Parliament include Amber Rudd, Nicky Morgan, Rory Stewart and Margaret James. But announcing her intention to stand as an independent in Guildford, Mrs Milton said she wanted to ""represent her constituency without being bound by party politics"".

Teenage boys sentenced for KriÃ©gel murder,"Ana KriÃ©gel was sexually assaulted and beaten to death in May 2018 A boy convicted of the murder of schoolgirl Ana KriÃ©gel has been sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of release for 12 years. A second boy has been sentenced to at least 15 years in prison with no possibility of release for eight years. The boys, both 15, became two of Ireland's youngest convicted killers when they were foundguilty of murdering the 14-year-old. The victim's parents said ""justice has been served for Ana"". However, Patric KriÃ©gel, the victim's father, added that ""forever is not long enough"" when it comes to how long the two killers spend in prison. ""Please remember Ana and keep her in your hearts somewhere,"" he said. The trial heard Boy A attacked and murdered Ana after she was brought to him by Boy B Ana KriÃ©gel was found dead in May 2018 in an abandoned house in Dublin, where she had been taken by one of the boys. The boys, both 13 at the time, denied the charges and were granted anonymity during the trial due to their age, being referred to as Boy A and Boy B. Boy A was also convicted of aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced at Dublin's Central Criminal Court on Tuesday to life for murder and aggravated sexual assault, with a review period after 12 years. Boy B was sentenced to 15 years' detention, with a review after eight years. Justice Paul McDermott said her life ""should not be defined by how she died"" Sentencing the boys at Dublin's Central Criminal Court on Tuesday, Justice Paul McDermott said the ""denial of Ana's right is at the core of this process"". ""A healthy 14 year-old girl, with her future before her and her short life should not be defined by how she died,"" he said. ""Her family are bereft, the joy and security of the Kriegel family shattered in the most cruel circumstances."" by Shane Harrison, Ireland correspondent, at the court This video can not be played Patric KriÃ©gel: ""Forever is not long enough"" Because of the sensitivity of the trial, and the age of the boys, only five journalists were allowed at the in-camera trial. The rest of us sat in Court 13 of the Courts of Criminal Justice building, watching proceedings on a video link. The camera concentrated on the judge, occasionally turning to the lawyers. Of the boys, their families and the KriÃ©gel family, there was no sight. But they were in court. Once Mr Justice Paul McDermott gave his sentence, some of the two boys' families nodded at waiting reporters, with sadness written all over their faces. It was nothing, though, compared to the grief and sadness of the KriÃ©gel family who now, in the words of the judge, face their own life sentence. He added that Ana's murder had resulted in a ""lifelong sentence"" for her parents. The judge told the court the boys' sentences may seem long to them but are proportionate for what they did. ""You will have the opportunity for a future and a second chance - something you wilfully deprived Ana KriÃ©gel of,"" he said. Ana was born in Russia in February 2004, and at the age of two was adopted by Irish woman Geraldine KriÃ©gel and her French-born husband Patric, who lived in Lucan. Her naked body was found with a ligature around the neck in a derelict house three days after she went missing in May 2018. A former state pathologist identified 50 areas of injury on the schoolgirl's head and body, concluding the cause of her death was blunt force trauma to the head and neck. Who was Ana KriÃ©gel? Murdered teen's parents 'broken' without her On 14 May, Ana had left her house with Boy B in the early evening, thinking she was being taken to meet a boy she liked. She was taken to the abandoned Glenwood House in Lucan in Dublin, about 3km (1.9 miles) away from her home, where Boy A was waiting. The journey took 30 minutes. During their trial, the court was told Boy A attacked and murdered Ana while Boy B watched. On the first day of the trial, the court was told by Ana's mother that her daughter was very vulnerable and that, while she looked older, she was ""a child on the inside"". It also heard that Ana had suffered horrific bullying and been targeted on social media in the months leading up to her murder. At a sentencing hearing last week, the court heard Boy A has accepted he caused Ana's death, while the boy's grandfather said his grandson was ""incredibly sorry"" for what happened. A lawyer for Boy B, however, said it was clear from reports that his client does not accept his role in the murder of Ana. The court heard there had been a falling out between Boy B and his father, who was not in court, over Boy B's failure to intervene and assist Ana. The lawyer asked the court to be as lenient as possible, pointing out that no DNA belonging to Boy B was found at the derelict house where Ana was found. The court also heard a victim impact statement from Geraldine KriÃ©gel, in which she said ""life without Ana is no longer a life"". ""It is a misery we must endure for the rest of our lives.""

Sweeping changes coming to the Brit AwardsCategories are cut and fan votes are cancelled as producers tackle falling ratings.,"Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris took this year's Brit Award for best British single, for their summer banger One Kiss The Brit Awards have announced a major revamp for 2020, with fewer awards and an end to fan votes. Organisers promise ""more music"" as a result, with artists being given full creative control of their performances. Prizes like best British video and best international group have been cut, while the outstanding contribution award has been retired for 2020. Despite press reports earlier this year, gendered awards for best male and best female will remain. Brit Awards 'will review' male and female prizes Brits 2019: The real winners and losers Brit Awards 2019: The ceremony in pictures The changes come after several years of falling ratings. This year's ceremony, which saw performances from Pink, Dua Lipa and George Ezra, was watched by 4.1m people, down 400,000 from 2018. The decision to scrap some of the awards makes for a more streamlined show, but fans of BTS are already angry about the loss of best international group. Allow Twitter content?

The full list of categories is as follows (all British unless noted otherwise]. Male Solo Artist Female Solo Artist Best Group Best New Artist (previously British Breakthrough Act) Rising Star (previously the Critics' Choice Award) Song Of The Year (previously British Single) Mastercard Album Of The Year International Male Solo Artist International Female Solo Artist The biggest change, however, will be in the performances. The Brits say they will ""hand the stage to the artists booked to perform on the night without imposing any creative limitations"". The idea is to create more viral moments - like Kanye West's performance of All Night on a stage crammed with British rap talent, or Adele's simple but effective rendition of Someone Like You. Of course, the most surefire way to go viral is to fall off stage like Madonna in 2015, or one of Katy Perry's dancers (visually impaired by having a house for a head) two years later. But giving artists creative control could give ITV's censors a major headache. Earlier this year, Brits organisers stopped The 1975 from performing Love It If We Made It after they won best British group, due to lyrics about drug abuse. ""There were a number of complications,""said the band's manager Jamie Oborne,external, ""which included us not wanting to have the words changed and ITV not wanting Matthew shouting [swear words]."" Under the new system, the performance would presumably be allowed to go ahead. Madonna's perilous tumble is one of the most memorable Brit moments of recent years Katy Perry's dancer plummeted off the side of the stage in 2017 Winners on the night will receive the classic Lady Britannia Brit statuette, which returns after nearly a decade's rest. Recent years had seen a bespoke ""remix"" of the design, by artists such as Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor. And fan votes have been scrapped altogether - meaning an end to boy and girl-bands dominating categories like best single. This year, all awards will be decided by a 1,200-strong ""official voting academy"", made up of experts from all areas of the music industry. That's not necessarily a positive move, however, as fan votes were often the only way for phenomenally successful acts like One Direction, Girls Aloud and Little Mix to gain recognition. Brits chairman David Joseph explained the changes, saying: ""We will be putting creativity, British culture and exceptional performances at the heart of the show to make Brits night a world class celebration. ""The awards should be a global platform for the artists of the year to create moments that live beyond the night itself. We are looking at everything to put on the best possible show."" The Brits launched in 1977 to mark the Queen's silver jubilee, but didn't return until 1982 - which means 2020 will be the 40th ceremony. Organisers say the event, at London's O2 arena next February, will mark the anniversary by paying ""tribute to to many unforgettable Brits moments that are now part of a rich and much loved heritage.""

Rail workers to hold 27 days of strikesThe stoppage will affect South Western Railway services in December and on New Year's Day.England,"The RMT has announced drivers and guards will take 27 days of industrial action A union has announced 27 days of rail strikes during December and on New Year's Day as part of a long-running dispute over train guards. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said its staff at South Western Railway (SWR) had been left with ""no choice"" but to take industrial action. The union said the dispute would continue for as long as SWR ""refuse to give assurances"" on the role of guards. SWR said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the planned strikes. A spokesperson for the company added: ""The deliberate targeting of services up to, and during, the Christmas period is typical of the lack of concern the RMT continue to have for our customers."" The union has told its members not to book on for duty: From 00:01 GMT on Monday 2 December until 23:59 on Wednesday 11 December From 00:01 on Friday 13 December until 23:59 on Tuesday 24 December From 00:01 on Friday 27 December 2019 until 23:59 on the 1 January RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""At the last meeting we held with SWR, principles in agreements were made in good faith with the company's negotiating team and we now feel hugely let down again. ""As long as the company continues to refuse to give assurances on the future operational role of the guard, we will remain in dispute. ""I want to congratulate our members on their continued resolve in their fight for safety and the role of the guard on SWR. ""It is wholly down to the management side that the core issue of the safety critical competencies and the role of the guard has not been agreed."" In a statement, SWR said it has offered to keep guards on all trains and the union was ""purely focussed on keeping control of train doors in a misguided attempt to hold power over the industry"". It added: ""Whilst we have shown commitment to the role of the guard by introducing over 80 additional guard roles since the start of our franchise, the RMT do not have the long-term interests of either our customers or our colleagues, including their members, at the heart of their actions.

No 10 denies suppressing Russia interference reportDowning Street is accused of delaying a report on Brexit referendum allegations until after the election.UK Politics,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference The government has denied claims it is suppressing a report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy until after the general election. Sources said No 10 was stalling on releasing the report, which has gained the standard security clearance. A former head of MI5, Lord Evans of Weardale, is among those calling for the document to be published. Foreign minister Christopher Pincher said the PM would release the report in ""due course"". He added: ""We cannot rush this process at the risk of undermining our national security."" Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report No Russia interference report until after election A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The report, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. It examines Russian activity - including allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in elections - and includes evidence from UK intelligence services such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 concerning covert Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Approval for its publication has yet to be given - andis not due to be until after polling day. Dominic Grieve, the chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, said there was no legitimate reason for delaying the report and voters had a right to see it before going to the polls. During an urgent question in the Commons, the former attorney general said there was a ""longstanding agreement"" that the prime minister would endeavour to respond to the committee's reports within 10 days. Mr Grieve also said the intelligence agencies had indicated that publication of the report would not prejudice the discharge of their functions. But foreign office minister Mr Pincher said the turnaround time for the report was ""not unusual"" - and gave examples of reports that had taken six weeks to get Downing Street's approval. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Downing Street's decision not to clear the report for publication before the general election was ""clearly politically motivated"". ""This is nothing less than an attempt to suppress the truth from the public and from Parliament and it is an affront to our democracy,"" she told the Commons. Ms Thornberry said No 10 realised the report would lead to ""other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and with the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign"". She went on: ""Publish this report and let us see for ourselves, otherwise there is only one question: what have you got to hide?"" Mr Pincher denied the decision not to publish the report before the election was politically motivated. BBC Newsnight diplomatic editor Mark Urban tweeted,externalthat the government's assertion the report was being held back because of a need to ""vet and balance"" it was ""unusual to say the least"". ""It's more normal for govt [sic] to respond after publication,"" he said. Earlier, Lord Evans, MI5 director general until 2013, told the Today programme ministers should explain why they were not prepared to release the report. ""In principle, I think it should be released,"" he said. ""Part of the reason for having an Intelligence and Security Committee is that issues of public concern can be properly considered and the public can be informed through the publication of the reports once they have gone through the security process."" He added: ""If the government have a reason why this should not be published before the election, then I think they should make it very clear what that reason is."" Ex-terrorism watchdog Lord Anderson said on Monday further delay would ""invite suspicion"" of the government's motives ahead of the election.

Labour has clear and simple Brexit plan - Corbyn,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The Tories have failed on Brexit for three years"" Labour's promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" within six months of winning power has been dismissed as ""fairytale politics"" by the Conservatives in the first clash of the election campaign on the issue. In a speech in Essex, Jeremy Corbyn said his plan to get a better deal and then put it to the public in another referendum was ""clear and simple"". He said a deadline to hold the vote next summer was ""realistic and doable"". But the Tories said Labour's plan would result in ""paralysing uncertainty"". However, the Conservative commitment to negotiate a new free trade deal with the EU in just over a year is also coming under scrutiny. It took seven years for the EU to conclude a free trade deal with Canada, an agreement which many Brexiteers see as a template for the UK. Any deal would need to be agreed by all 27 remaining EU states before it could come into force. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, said a majority Conservative government would ""absolutely not"" extend the transition period after the UK's departure from the EU - under Mr Johnson's deal it is due to end at the start of 2021. Pressed on whether this could ultimately lead to a no-deal exit - with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules - if no free trade deal could be agreed by that point, he pointed out that Mr Johnson had been able to secure major changes to the current withdrawal agreement in ""just 90 days"". Ex-Justice Secretary David Gauke, who lost the Tory whip after rebelling over Brexit, said it would be ""reckless"" to exit transition without a trade deal and MPs must get a vote before this happened.

The political parties are ramping up their election campaigning, ahead of the official start to the five-week campaign period at just after midnight on Wednesday. Brexit is set to be a crucial issue when voters go to the polls on 12 December, with Mr Johnson insisting the UK will leave in January if he wins power. The UK and US have both said they are eager to do a free trade deal after Brexit, and in August, President Donald Trump predicted that leaving the EU would be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". But in a speech in Harlow - a target seat for Labour - Mr Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of seeking to ""hijack Brexit to sell out the NHS"" to American firms in a future trade deal with the US. Labour is hoping its candidate Laura McAlpine will take the Conservative-held seat of Harlow The PM's strategy could see an extra Â£500m a week spent on buying medicines, he claimed, as well as leading to a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights and product standards. Mr Johnson has insisted the NHS would ""not be on the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks with the US. FACT CHECK: Labour's Â£500m a week NHS claim The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the Â£500m figure was a theoretical worst-case scenario in which the prices of all medicines used in the NHS were the same as the prices of those medicines in the US. However, he said in practice that was highly unlikely - although there was no question US pharmaceutical companies would lobby aggressively for greater access to the NHS, and the ability to set higher prices.

""Given the chance, they'll slash food standards to match those of the US where 'acceptable levels' of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed,"" he will claim. ""And they will put chlorinated chicken on the supermarket shelves."" If elected next month, Mr Corbyn said he could strike a ""sensible"" new deal with the EU within months ""based on terms we have already discussed with the EU - including membership of a customs union and absolute guarantees on workers rights. At the same time, a Labour government would plan for a new public vote in June or July. ""Labour's plan would get Brexit sorted so a Labour government can get on with delivering the real change Britain needs,"" he told activists. Boris Johnson said his cabinet could be ""proud"" of its record on Brexit ""Only a Labour government would put a decision in your hands... It cannot be left to the politicians...The Brexit crisis must be resolved but it must done democratically."" Mr Corbyn has refused to say whether he would back Leave or Remain, but said he would ""immediately carry out"" the public's decision so the country could ""move on"". Speaking at the same event, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would ""rip up"" Mr Johnson's deal with the EU, describing it as a ""trap door"" to a no-deal exit at the end of the transition period. He said reaching a new economic and security relationship with the EU was a ""massive task"" and there would be ""no safety net"" if the talks were not concluded next year. But Mr Johnson said another referendum would be a ""disastrous, clamorous"" waste of time. Addressing ministers in Downing Street at his final cabinet meeting before Parliament is dissolved for the election, he said his government ""could be proud"" of what it had achieved on Brexit, despite failing to meet his ""do-or-die"" deadline to leave on 31 October. ""We've achieved something people thought we really couldn't do - get a great new deal on Brexit from EU - they said it couldn't be done. ""The choice before country is really very clear - do you want to go forward with our agenda which is to get Brexit done and then get on with delivering all the wonderful things we want to do for this country... or do you want to waste 2020?"" And Mr Gove suggested Mr Corbyn was incapable of negotiating a new Brexit deal in the way Mr Johnson had done. ""It is a fairy tale if you imagine Jeremy Corbyn can get Brexit done. His policy on Brexit has been constructed by a terminally weak leader in order to paper over the cracks in his party."" And on a visit to a gymnasium in the Derbyshire seat of Bolsover, Nigel Farage said The Brexit Party was ""going after"" Labour MPs who he said had failed to deliver what people voted for in the 2016 referendum.

UK drone registration scheme kicks off,"UK drone pilots have until the end of November to register their details with the Civil Aviation Authority. The mandatory requirement to register,externalcovers owners of drones or model aircraft weighing more than 250g (8.8oz). Owners of unregistered drones could then face the threat of a fine. At the same time, the CAA is starting a service it hopes will reunite owners with their lost drones. A quarter of owners have lost a drone at some point, CAA research suggests. Most lost drones go missing because of malfunctions in flight, the research indicates. This includes losing battery power, loss of signal or technology failures. But a quarter of cases involve pilots making mistakes. CAA spokesman Jonathan Nicholson said: ""Our aim is for the Drones Reunited platform to become an essential service for the drone community - the first port of call for anyone who has lost, or found, a drone."" The CAA said anyone who registered their drone would get free access to the service, which issues each device with a unique identification code. Pilots who lose a drone will be able to record the loss via the CAA's drones-reunited site. Anyone who finds a downed drone bearing an ID number will be able to look it up on the site and inform its owner it has been located. Registering craft weighing between 250g and 20kg costs Â£9 a year. Registered drone owners, who must be over 18, will need to pass an online test that quizzes them on using their device safely. Anyone who wants to fly a drone, including children, will also have to pass the test, which can be taken as many times as required. Not all owners must register by 30 November. Exemptions have been granted for members of several associations involved with flying model aircraft or other small, remotely controlled craft such as drones. The five associations are The UK Drone Association (Arpas UK) British Model Flying Association Scottish Aeromodellers' Association Large Model Association FPV UK Simon, Dale, chief executive of FPV UK, said it had opposed registration since it was announced. About 4,000 members of FPV UK are regular drone flyers. ""Registration will do nothing to improve safety or security because bad actors will not register their drones,"" he said. Instead, he said, the regulations would put people off model and drone flying. Mr Dale said FPV UK would continue to actively oppose registration. He added: ""Hopefully it will be scrapped before long, just like the dog licence.""

Facebook bans ad posted by ex-Downing Street aide,"Facebook has removed an advert from a tax campaign group for breaking its rules on political advertising. The Fair Tax Campaign, run by a former Boris Johnson aide, has been running an ad with the message ""could you afford an extra Â£214 each month?"" It claims that this is what Labour's tax plans would mean for everyone. Labour is yet to publish its tax plans or manifesto for the 12 December general election. But Shadow chancellor John McDonnell this weekend said that if it won the election, the party only planned to increase income tax for the top 5% of earners to help fund increased public spending. ""In terms of income tax, we've said very clearly the top 5% will pay a bit more, 95% of the earners will be protected,"" he told the BBC. A Labour spokesman called the banned Facebook ad ""fake news"" and said it was right that it had been swiftly removed. Facebook challenged over political ad policy The Fair Tax Campaign is run by Alex Crowley, a former aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Crowley left Downing Street in late September. He told the BBC the ad made a ""legitimate charge"" that was based on a New Economic Foundation Report from August this year. He said the campaign had no links with the Conservative Party. The message in the ad says ""sponsored"" but does not reveal who has paid for it. Under Facebook's rules, political advertisers have to register with the social media firm and every advert has to show who has paid for it. Facebook removed the ad after being contacted by the BBC. The company said it should have carried a ""paid for by"" disclaimer and the advertiser has been contacted ""to provide clarity"" on its policies relating to ads about politics, elections and social issues. The Fair Tax Campaign will be able to switch the ad back on if they register and insert the ""paid for by"" disclaimer. In the meantime the advert can be seen in Facebook's Ad Library, with a message explaining why it has been removed. The group says on Facebook that it believes Labour's tax plans must never be allowed to happen and calls on voters to oppose them in the 12 December general election. Three Facebook users contacted the BBC to say they had been shown the advert. They were responding to a crowd-sourcing initiative designed to reveal how the different parties are targeting paid adverts during the UK election campaign. Facebook has come under fire on both sides of the Atlantic over its policy of not policing misinformation in political adverts. Boss Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly defended the policy, insisting that free expression must be his company's priority. As the UK general election campaign gets underway, the social media platform is bound to be a vital campaigning arena, indeed it is likely to be the principal focus for party spending. That means it will be vital to know just who is being targeted with which ads - so if you receive any in your Facebook feed over the coming weeks, do let us know!

"Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal'Around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency.Science & Environment","A global group of around 11,000 scientists have endorsed research that says the world is facing a climate emergency. Thestudy,external, based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis. Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing ""untold human suffering"" the study says. The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat. 'Regret' as US begins exit from UN climate accord Quit 'coal addiction', UN boss warns Asia Climate change 'making mountaineering riskier' Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world. So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a ""suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years"". These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption. October was the warmest such month on record according to new data Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018. Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency. ""An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date,"" said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney. ""That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people."" The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor. Tree loss needs to stop if countries are serious about climate change Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference. These are: Energy:Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables. Short-lived pollutants:These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades. Nature:Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2. Food:A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical. Economy:Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence. Population:The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day. Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research. All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online. ""We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a  a problem,"" said Dr Newsome. The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action.  However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope. ""We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change. ""As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress."" The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option. Human population growth needs to be addressed, say the authors ""It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth,"" said Dr Newsome. ""It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level.""

"None of pledged starter homes built, says watchdog","A government plan to create 200,000 new homes in England for first-time buyers has resulted in no homes being built, the National Audit Office has found. Announced in 2014, ""starter homes"" were meant to be aimed at those under the age of 40 and sold at a 20% discount. But legislation to take the project forward was never passed. Labour called the policy a total failure, but the government said it had a ""great track record"" for house building. Former prime minister David Cameron committed to the scheme in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto as a way of tackling the affordable housing crisis. The project was also supposed to support the wider growth and regeneration of local areas, and some town centres. The homes were meant to be built across the country by the end of the decade and more than Â£2bn was set aside for the first tranche of 60,000 dwellings. House price calculator: Where can I afford to rent or buy? Housing crisis 'affects 8.4 million' in England Flats out of fashion with first-time buyers According to the National Audit Office (NAO), between 2015-16 and 2017-18, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) spent almost Â£174m on acquiring and preparing sites originally intended for building starter homes. These were in places such as Plymouth, Bury, Basildon, Stockport, Bridgwater, Cinderford and Bristol. But the spending watchdog said the sites were all now being used for housing more generally, only some of which was affordable. It said the scheme had faltered because the necessary legislation and planning guidance had never been put through Parliament, despite expectations it would happen in 2019. As a result, even new homes conforming to the intended specifications cannot be marketed as starter homes, which has made getting developers on board challenging. The NAO said the government also no longer had a budget dedicated to the starter homes project. Former Prime Minister David Cameron announced the starter homes scheme in 2014 Labour MP Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""Despite setting aside over Â£2bn to build 60,000 new starter homes, none were built. ""Since 2010 many housing programmes announced with much fanfare have fallen away with money then recycled into the next announcement. ""The MHCLG needs to focus on delivery and not raise, and then dash, people's expectations."" John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said the Conservative Party  had wasted four years and spent millions of pounds. ""After nearly 10 years of Conservative failure on housing, the country needs a Labour government to fix the housing crisis."" But a housing ministry spokeswoman said house building was at its highest level for all but one of the last 30 years. ""We have a great track record... with 222,000 homes delivered last year, and 1.3 million in total since 2010, including over 430,000 affordable homes."" David O'Leary, policy director at Home Builders Federation, said that even though starter homes had not got off the ground, the scheme had not been a total failure. He said the engagement it had generated between local government, builders, mortgage lenders and valuers was positive. ""The difficulty in creating a workable set of rules demonstrates the importance of ensuring that proper consideration is given to the practical implementation of interventions and their market impacts as early as possible.""

The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election. The US government says the deal puts an ""unfair economic burden"" on Americans. The agreement brought together 188 nations to combat climate change. There has been widespread international condemnation of the US move. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015, committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C,externalabove pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision to withdraw - taken by President Donald Trump after he came to office in 2017 - made the US the world's sole non-signatory and prompted high-level efforts by the European Union to keep the agreement on track. However, hundreds of local governments, businesses and organisations in the US have joined the We Are Still In movement, pledging to cut emissions and move to renewable energy. The US issued its formal notification on the first day it was possible to do so,external. Mr Trump had made withdrawing from the agreement one of his election campaign pledges but UN rules had meant it was not possible for the US to start the withdrawal process until 4 November 2019. The withdrawal is still subject to the outcome of next year's US presidential election - if Mr Trump loses, the winner may decide to change course. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But scientists and environmentalists fear the effect the Trump administration will have on climate protections in the meantime. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Paris pullout: The worst is yet to come Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal A report issued in December 2018 by the Institute of International and European Affairs suggestedPresident Trump's decision to leave had done ""very real damage"",externalto the Paris agreement, creating ""moral and political cover for others to follow suit"". The decision by the US - one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - drew condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders. An official for France's presidential office said ""we regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary."" French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet in Beijing on Wednesday, where they are expected to sign a statement declaring the ""irreversibility of the Paris accord"", the official added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the US could take more responsibility in what was a multilateral process instead of adding ""negative energy"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, a European Commission spokeswoman responded by saying the agreement was ""here to stay"". ""Its door remains open and we hope the US will join it again one day,"" she said. For Russia, which ratified the deal last month after a long delay, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was very hard to talk about a climate agreement without the US. US Democrats and environmentalists condemned the decision. Impacts 'accelerating' as leaders gather for talks Climate change: Are lifestyle changes the only answer? Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House,condemned Mr Trump's move as a ""disastrous decision that sells out our children's future"",external, while former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore derided those who would ""sacrifice the planet for their greed"". ""It is about the darkest moment in American diplomacy in a very, very long time and a huge blow to global efforts,"" Bill McKibben, leader of climate campaign group 350.org, told the BBC's Newsday programme. However, the move was welcomed by Republican congressman Gary Palmer, who tweeted: ""It is high time for the US to leave this overly regulative and burdensome agreement that doesn't really address climate change."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the agreement had imposed an ""unfair economic burden"" on the United States. Instead, he said, the US would follow ""a realistic and pragmatic model"", using ""all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently"". Mr Trump promised to turn the US into an energy superpower, and has attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He has characterised former US President Barack Obamaâs environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. He has also suggested that the Paris Agreement gives China and other big polluters an unfair advantage over the US by allowing them to continue to increase emissions. Announcing his decision to withdraw in June 2017, Mr Trump said: ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests."" He said the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost economic output and 6.5 million jobs but a US government report last year said that, on the contrary,unchecked climate change would cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars. This video can not be played Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame? Reports suggest the Trump administration has made no effort to renegotiate the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect  on the atmosphere of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Countries agreed to: Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

US Mormon children killed in Mexico attack,"Nine US citizens, three women and six children, have been killed in an attack by suspected drug cartel gunmen in northern Mexico. The victims are members of the LeBaron family, linked to a breakaway Mormon community that settled in Mexico several decades ago. The victims were travelling in a convoy of vehicles. The security minister said the group could have been targeted accidentally as a result of mistaken identity. Sonora state in northern Mexico is being fought over by two rival gangs, La LÃ­nea, which has links to the larger JuÃ¡rez cartel, and ""Los Chapos"", which is part of the Sinaloa cartel. In a tweet President Donald Trump described the victims as a group of ""wonderful family and friends"" who ""got caught between two vicious drug cartels, who were shooting at each other"". This video can not be played Brother-in-law of victim describes the ambush in local radio interview The US ""stands ready"", he said, to offer support to combat the problem of cartel violence and ""do the job quickly and effectively"". The FBI has offered to assist Mexican authorities in the investigation,CNN reports,external. Mexico's President, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, said Mexico would act with ""independence and sovereignty"" in pursuing the criminals behind the attack. A relative of the victims, Alex LeBaron, told CNN thatthe bodies of the deceased had been returned to their family ranch.,external A group of three mothers and their 14 children had set off in a convoy of three cars from Bavispe in Sonora state and were heading to the neighbouring state of Chihuahua. The women had been travelling together ""for safety reasons"", an unnamed relative told CNN. Nine people were killed after they were ambushed by gunmen in Bavispe. Who are victims of Mexico ambush? Mexico's most powerful cartels Mexico murder rate on the rise again A burnt-out SUV was later found by the side of the road with the remains of some victims and there are reports that other family members were shot at as they tried to flee. An investigation has been launched and additional security forces have been sent to the area, the governments of Chihuahua and Sonora said in a joint statement. Claudia Pavlovich Arellano, governor of the state of Sonora, described the perpetrators as ""monsters"". ""As a mother, I feel anger, revulsion and a profound pain for the cowardly acts in the mountains between Sonora and Chihuahua,"" she wrote on Twitter, in Spanish. Julian LeBaron, a cousin of one of the women, said he did not know what could have motivated the killings, which he said had involved two separate attacks. ""We want to know exactly who was behind this, why they did it and from where they are, and we need that information to be true,"" he told Mexican radio. ""We don't know who would attack women and children."" Mr LeBaron gave a detailed account of the attacks in anan interview for Mexican radio station el Heraldo,external. His cousin Rhonita Miller, 30, four of her children, two of whom were babies, died in a car in the first attack, he said. Another cousin, Dawna Ray Langford, 43, and a woman called Christina Langford Johnson, 31 later left in separate cars and were ambushed in a second attack, he said. Both women were killed, along with two of Ms Ray Langford's children, aged four and six. Faith Marie Johnson, seven months old, survived and was found by Mr LeBaron in the car, according to his account. Seven children escaped, fleeing the scene, five of whom were injured and taken to hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, Mr LeBaron added. The victims were members of a community called Colonia LeBaron which was founded by a breakaway Mormon group in the first half of the 20th Century after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the US starting cracking down on polygamy. The mainstream Mormon Church publicly rejected polygamy - the custom of having more than one spouse at the same time - in 1890 and since then, some groups who wished to continue the practice have broken away. The Colonia LeBaron community now includes both Mormons and Catholics who have settled there. Members are known for standing up to local drug gangs and speaking out about the high levels of cartel violence. It has about 3,000 members, some of whom practise polygamy. While local media say the convoy of cars may have been mistaken for that of a rival gang, the LeBaron community has been targeted by the cartels in the past. In 2009, Erick LeBaron was kidnapped for ransom. The community took a stand and said it would not pay for his release as that would just encourage future kidnappings. Erick LeBaron was eventually released without a ransom being paid. But months later, his brother Benjamin, who had led the campaign for Erick's LeBaron's release, was beaten to death. Benjamin's brother-in-law was also killed. In 2010,Julian LeBaron published an article in the Dallas Morning News,externalcalling for Mexicans to stand up against organised crime. Mr LeBaron also told Mexican radio on Tuesday that his family had received threats. ""We reported the threats, and these are the consequences,"" he said. Last year, the family also clashed with local farmers who accused the LeBarons of using excessive amounts of water to grow walnut trees on their land, allegedly leaving nearby farms dry. The Colonia LeBaron community has in the past demanded to be allowed to create its own security force. The power and influence of the Sinaloa cartel was on display last month when its members barricaded streets and clashed with security forces in CuliacÃ¡n after one of their leaders, Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n LÃ³pez, was arrested. Mexico country profile With the security forces outnumbered and surrounded, the Mexican government took the controversial decision to free Ovidio GuzmÃ¡n to prevent further bloodshed.

NZ tourist lost at sea 'survived on boiled sweets',"Kushila Stein in her rubber dinghy after being rescued by the Hellenic Coast Guard A tourist survived for two days adrift at sea in a dinghy near Greece by snacking on boiled sweets, reports say. Kushila Stein, 45, from New Zealand, was rescued from the Aegean Sea, north of Crete, on Sunday. During her 37-hour ordeal Ms Stein reportedly rationed a ""handful of boiled lollies"" and wrapped herself in plastic bags for warmth. An experienced sailor, Ms Stein put a red bag on her head and used a mirror to attract attention, reports say. After an extensive search, the Greek Coast Guard found her 101km (55 nautical miles) north of Crete, Greece's largest island. Her motherWendy Stein told Stuff.co.nz,externalher daughter's training in sea survival ""might have saved her life"". Ms Stein was helping a British man, named in media reports only as Mike, take a yacht from southern Turkey to Athens.

UK drone registration scheme kicks offOwners must pass a quiz but will get access to a scheme that seeks to match lost drones with owners.TechnologyComments,"UK drone pilots have until the end of November to register their details with the Civil Aviation Authority. The mandatory requirement to register,externalcovers owners of drones or model aircraft weighing more than 250g (8.8oz). Owners of unregistered drones could then face the threat of a fine. At the same time, the CAA is starting a service it hopes will reunite owners with their lost drones. A quarter of owners have lost a drone at some point, CAA research suggests. Most lost drones go missing because of malfunctions in flight, the research indicates. This includes losing battery power, loss of signal or technology failures. But a quarter of cases involve pilots making mistakes. CAA spokesman Jonathan Nicholson said: ""Our aim is for the Drones Reunited platform to become an essential service for the drone community - the first port of call for anyone who has lost, or found, a drone."" The CAA said anyone who registered their drone would get free access to the service, which issues each device with a unique identification code. Pilots who lose a drone will be able to record the loss via the CAA's drones-reunited site. Anyone who finds a downed drone bearing an ID number will be able to look it up on the site and inform its owner it has been located. Registering craft weighing between 250g and 20kg costs Â£9 a year. Registered drone owners, who must be over 18, will need to pass an online test that quizzes them on using their device safely. Anyone who wants to fly a drone, including children, will also have to pass the test, which can be taken as many times as required. Not all owners must register by 30 November. Exemptions have been granted for members of several associations involved with flying model aircraft or other small, remotely controlled craft such as drones. The five associations are The UK Drone Association (Arpas UK) British Model Flying Association Scottish Aeromodellers' Association Large Model Association FPV UK Simon, Dale, chief executive of FPV UK, said it had opposed registration since it was announced. About 4,000 members of FPV UK are regular drone flyers. ""Registration will do nothing to improve safety or security because bad actors will not register their drones,"" he said. Instead, he said, the regulations would put people off model and drone flying. Mr Dale said FPV UK would continue to actively oppose registration. He added: ""Hopefully it will be scrapped before long, just like the dog licence.""

Gove denies suppressing Russia interference report,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied accusations of Russian interference The government has denied claims it is suppressing a report on alleged Russian interference in UK democracy until after the general election. Sources said No 10 was stalling on releasing the report, which has gained the standard security clearance. A former head of MI5, Lord Evans of Weardale, is among those calling for the document to be published. Foreign minister Christopher Pincher said the PM would release the report in ""due course"". He added: ""We cannot rush this process at the risk of undermining our national security."" Claims No 10 'sitting on' Russian interference report No Russia interference report until after election A really simple guide to the election,external Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external The report, by Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, was finalised in March and referred to No 10 on 17 October. It examines Russian activity - including allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in elections - and includes evidence from UK intelligence services such as GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 concerning covert Russian attempts to influence the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum and 2017 general election. Approval for its publication has yet to be given - andis not due to be until after polling day. Dominic Grieve, the chairman of Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, said there was no legitimate reason for delaying the report and voters had a right to see it before going to the polls. During an urgent question in the Commons, the former attorney general said there was a ""longstanding agreement"" that the prime minister would endeavour to respond to the committee's reports within 10 days. Mr Grieve also said the intelligence agencies had indicated that publication of the report would not prejudice the discharge of their functions. But foreign office minister Mr Pincher said the turnaround time for the report was ""not unusual"" - and gave examples of reports that had taken six weeks to get Downing Street's approval. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Downing Street's decision not to clear the report for publication before the general election was ""clearly politically motivated"". ""This is nothing less than an attempt to suppress the truth from the public and from Parliament and it is an affront to our democracy,"" she told the Commons. Ms Thornberry said No 10 realised the report would lead to ""other questions about the links between Russia and Brexit and with the current leadership of the Tory party, which risks derailing their election campaign"". She went on: ""Publish this report and let us see for ourselves, otherwise there is only one question: what have you got to hide?"" Mr Pincher denied the decision not to publish the report before the election was politically motivated. BBC Newsnight diplomatic editor Mark Urban tweeted,externalthat the government's assertion the report was being held back because of a need to ""vet and balance"" it was ""unusual to say the least"". ""It's more normal for govt [sic] to respond after publication,"" he said. Earlier, Lord Evans, MI5 director general until 2013, told the Today programme ministers should explain why they were not prepared to release the report. ""In principle, I think it should be released,"" he said. ""Part of the reason for having an Intelligence and Security Committee is that issues of public concern can be properly considered and the public can be informed through the publication of the reports once they have gone through the security process."" He added: ""If the government have a reason why this should not be published before the election, then I think they should make it very clear what that reason is."" Ex-terrorism watchdog Lord Anderson said on Monday further delay would ""invite suspicion"" of the government's motives ahead of the election.

Rugby champions Saracens docked 35 points,"Saracens have won four of the past five Premiership titles Premiership champions Saracens will appeal against a 35-point deduction and Â£5.36m fine for breaching salary cap regulations over three seasons. The punishment comes afteran investigationinto business partnerships between chairman Nigel Wray and some of the club's players. European champions Saracensdescribed the sanctions as ""heavy-handed"".,external Both punishments have been suspended until the outcome of the appeal, which is likely to be next year. Why were Sarries punished and what are the consequences? Ex-captain Bracken says salary cap penalties 'very unfair' Had the points deduction been applied immediately, Mark McCall's side would drop from fourth to bottom of the Premiership with -26 points. Sarries have several of the game's highest-profile players on the books and started the current campaign with a significant number still on World Cup duty. Of the 31-man squad representing England in Japan, seven players came from Saracens - including captain Owen Farrell, and forwards Mako and Billy Vunipola, and Maro Itoje. Full-back Elliot Daly, another member of the side that lost the final against South Africa on Saturday, joins Sarries now the tournament has finished. The charges relate to a failure to disclose player payments in each of the 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons. Saracens previously claimed they ""readily comply"" with salary cap rules and were able to spend abovethe Â£7m capbecause of the high proportion - almost 60% - of home-grown players in their squad. The club apologised for ""administrative errors relating to the non-disclosure of some transactions"" to Premiership Rugby Limited, but added it will ""continue to vigorously defend this position especially as PRL precedent already exists whereby co-investments have not been deemed part of salary in the regulations"". In a separate statement, Wray said:,external""This is absolutely devastating for everyone associated with this amazing group of players, staff, partners and fans. ""It's been acknowledged by the panel that we never deliberately sought to mislead anyone or breach the cap. ""That's why it feels like the rug is being completely pulled out from under our feet. We will appeal [against] all the findings."" During an independent disciplinary panel hearing, Saracens saw their challenge of the validity of the regulations on competition law grounds rejected. Premiership Rugby introduced its salary cap in 1999 to ensure the financial viability of all clubs and the competition. The regulations are also designed to control inflationary pressures on clubs' costs and provide a level playing field for clubs and a competitive Premiership. ""The decision upholds both the principle of the salary cap and the charges brought following an extensive investigation,"" a Premiership spokesperson said. ""We're pleased this process has reached a conclusion."" BBC rugby union correspondent Chris Jones Saracens have been the dominant force in the domestic game for the best part of a decade - scooping eight major titles and providing the spine of the England World Cup team - but that success will now be considered tainted. How long has it been going on? Will the club keep their titles? What will happen with their review, given they insist they were involved in legitimate business dealings with players? What happens now to the current squad, which may need to be dismantled, especially with a Â£5m fine and the threat of relegation? And what do players, coaches and fans at other clubs think, given everyone is affected in some way by this? On that note, do any other clubs in the league have something to hide? Like with theBloodgate scandalinvolving Harlequins 10 years ago, the fallout to this will be significant and lengthy, and will damage the integrity of the Premiership just at the point the league is looking to launch a global expansion. This is probably the biggest story in English club rugby history. Saracens have developed into a true sporting powerhouse during the past decade, winning five Premiership titles and three European Champions Cups since 2010-11. Two of those domestic titles came in the timeframe that Premiership Rugby have been investigating, with Mark McCall's side winning 53 of 72 league and play-off matches during that period. They have been equally dominant in European competition, having lifted the trophy in three of the past four seasons. How the Premiership table would look if Saracens' points deduction had been applied immediately Premiership table in full In the five seasons Saracens have finished as Premiership champions, a 35-point deduction would have meant them not reaching the play-offs by finishing in the top four, but would also not have seen them relegated. They would have finished 10th last season had the same punishment been imposed. Saracens have won two of their three Premiership matches so far this season and their England players are unlikely to return for another couple of weeks.

DIY alternative to smear test 'promising',"A DIY home urine or swab test could potentially help more women discover whether they are at risk of cervical cancer, researchers say. The new method could be used as an alternative to the smear test and would not require a visit to the doctor. Scientists at Queen Mary University of London asked 600 women to provide self-collected samples for screening. Although larger trials are needed, the work has been called ""promising"" and a potential ""game-changer"" by charities. The findings, being presented at theNCRI cancer conference,externalin Glasgow, suggest the method is feasible and popular. However, larger trials may still be needed before the NHS could decide whether to offer it to patients, say experts. Even then, it would only be one option for women - as the researchers believe smear tests would continue in their current form. But the researchers say that in the future, some women could order the test kits online, use them at home and then send their sample by post to be analysed. This video can not be played Chloe Delevingne had a smear test live on the Victoria Derbyshire programme Screening aims to pick up early warning signs of cancer  - known as pre-cancers - that can be treated to prevent the disease. All women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 in the UK are invited forNHS cervical screening,,externalbut the number of women attending cervical screening in the UK has been falling. Around one in four UK women do not attend when invited, figures suggest. Time for 'smear test' to be rebranded? Experts have put the low uptake rates down to embarrassment, a lack of awareness or just putting it off. Dr Belinda Nedjai and colleagues have developed an alternative screening method that does not rely on smear tests. The S5 test measures chemical changes that are detectable in urine or self-collected vaginal fluid samples to gauge a woman's cancer risk. A high score suggests there is an increased risk of a pre-cancer lesion being present. In the study, the S5 test was good at distinguishing which women had pre-cancerous growths diagnosed following conventional screening. Dr Nedjai said the self-sampling was ""pretty accurate"", but was not as quite as effective as the UK's current smear testing programme. ""It will be soon. With improvement we'll get there,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Dr Nedjai said the S5 test needed to be tried on more than 10,000 women before it could be offered on the NHS. She predicted the at-home tests could be available via the health service in five years. Researchers say the test could also be used alongside conventional cervical screening to help improve detection and spare some women from unnecessary investigations. The NHS is currently moving to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening of smears - testing for the presence of this virus in samples before looking for abnormal cell changes. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV. Dr Manuel Rodriguez-Justo, from University College London, said: ""This is exciting research that shows it's possible to detect cervical pre-cancer that is at high risk of developing into invasive cancer in urine and vaginal samples collected by women in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. ""This has the potential to revolutionise the way a positive HPV test is followed up, as well as making it easier for women in countries with no cervical cancer screening programme to be tested."" Researchers have developed a way to identify pre-cancer lesions by analysing urine and vaginal samples Sophia Lowes, Cancer Research UK's health information manager, said: ""The results look promising for detecting women with advanced cell changes. But we need to know if this test picks up all changes and if it's as successful when testing a wider group of people."" Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said although more research was needed, DIY checks could be a ""game-changer"". ""For women who find the current methods of cervical screening difficult, including those with a physical disability or who have experienced trauma, it could mean they can access screening in a far more acceptable and accessible way."" ""It could mean those requiring treatment are identified faster and reduce the number of women having to go for potentially unnecessary investigations at colposcopy.""

"Election could bring 'seismic change' - SwinsonThe Lib Dem leader says a government led by her would ""stop Brexit and build a brighter future"".","This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""Change is absolutely possible"" The general election could be ""a moment for seismic change"", when ""a new and different politics"" emerges, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said. In a speech at the party's campaign launch, she said she could do ""a better job"" than either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister. In response, the Conservatives said a vote for the Lib Dems ""risks putting"" Mr Corbyn into Downing Street. The UK will go to the polls on 12 December. Elsewhere in the election campaign: Jeremy Corbyn makes a speechaccusing the PM of trying to ""hijack Brexit to sell out our NHS"" and pledging to ""get Brexit sorted"" in six months. Boris Johnson claims Labour's position is ""to go back to square one"", and urges the Labour leader to ""come clean"" on his Brexit proposals. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also focuses on Europe, telling voters that a vote for her party is ""a vote to escape from Brexit"". The political parties are ramping up their campaigning, ahead of the official start to the five-week election period at just after midnight on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Lib Dems said they would take legal action against ITV over its plans for a head-to-head election debateincluding only Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, saying the decision to exclude its leader was ""outrageous"". The party's lawyers have written to the broadcaster to give it ""the opportunity to correct this serious mistake"". ITV has said it intends to offer viewers balanced election coverage. Speaking in London, Ms Swinson said: ""Our country needs us to be more ambitious right now - and we are rising to that challenge. ""It is not about the red team or the blue team, because on this issue they merge into one - both Labour and the Conservatives want to negotiate and deliver Brexit. ""I never thought that I would stand here and say that I'm a candidate to be prime minister, but when I look at Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, I am absolutely certain I could do a better job than either of them."" Ms Swinson said Mr Johnson had ""lied to the Queen, lied to Parliament and lied to the country"" and ""was not fit to to be prime minister"". And she accused the Labour leader of failing to ""give a straight answer on the biggest issues facing this country"". The Lib Dems currently have 20 MPs - out of a possible 650 - and they are especially hopeful of gaining seats in London and south-west England, but they would need a dramatic shift in the electoral landscape if they were to win a majority. However, responding to questions from journalists, Ms Swinson said ""stranger things have happened"" and pointed to the SNP's success in the 2015 general election. By chief political correspondent Vicki Young Jo Swinson says she wants to be prime minister - but how credible is that? The Lib Dems are not at the moment even the third largest party in the UK. Ms Swinson cites the example of the SNP surge in 2015, when the party won almost every seat in Scotland - and she personally lost her seat to the SNP candidate. She argues that politics is volatile, it is in flux, and things have changed because of Brexit - people are voting for very different reasons. Therefore, there is no reason why the party can't be incredibly ambitious, she argues. But the problem for the Liberal Democrats is that the way their votes are distributed around the country, it is much harder for them to win seats than for other parties. In 2010, they won seven million votes but got fewer than 60 seats. The Lib Dem leader was introduced by one of the party's newer MPs, Luciana Berger, who used to be in the Labour Party but quit over the issue of anti-Semitism - something Ms Swinson accused Mr Corbyn of failing to ""root out"". Asked whether her party could support a Labour government in the event of a hung Parliament, Ms Swinson said: ""I am absolutely, categorically ruling out Lib Dem votes putting Jeremy Corbyn in No 10."" Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Where do the parties stand on Brexit? The Lib Dem leader said her party was ""the only party standing up to stop Brexit and build a brighter future for the UK"". She argued that stopping Brexit would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" for public services over the next five years The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexitaltogether if they win power at the next general election. If they do not win a majority at the election they would support another referendum. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, told the BBC many Remain supporters were ""uncomfortable"" with the Lib Dems' plan to effectively ""rub out"" the 2016 referendum result and believed EU membership had to be ""argued for and won"" in another public vote. This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""We are the only party that will stop Brexit"" The party said the Â£50bn figure - the amount that it has calculated will be saved over the next five years by staying in the EU - is based on the UK economy being 1.9% larger in 2024-25. It reflects the extra tax income over the next five years and is based on a 0.4% average annual boost to GDP if the UK stays in the EU. Deputy leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Lib Dems ""actually think these are quite cautious figures"", adding that all the independent forecasters ""were clear that there will be a big boost if we stay"". Paul Johnson, from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was a reasonable calculation in line with their own forecasts, adding: ""We could expect the economy to be bigger if we were to remain and this assumes a relatively modest effect if anything, although obviously subject to a huge amount of uncertainty"". BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the vast majority of forecasts do expect the economy would be bigger if the UK were to stay in the EU. But he said the size of that ""bonus"" cannot be predicted with any certainty, and Â£50bn was not a hugely significant amount in terms of overall government expenditure.

'Regret' as US begins exit from UN climate accordIt means the US could formally leave the Paris Agreement a day after the 2020 presidential election.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Watch Trump explain why he is pulling the US out of Paris climate accord The US has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, notifying the UN of its intention to leave, as other countries express regret and disappointment at the move. The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election. The US government says the deal puts an ""unfair economic burden"" on Americans. The agreement brought together 188 nations to combat climate change. There has been widespread international condemnation of the US move. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015, committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C,externalabove pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision to withdraw - taken by President Donald Trump after he came to office in 2017 - made the US the world's sole non-signatory and prompted high-level efforts by the European Union to keep the agreement on track. However, hundreds of local governments, businesses and organisations in the US have joined the We Are Still In movement, pledging to cut emissions and move to renewable energy. The US issued its formal notification on the first day it was possible to do so,external. Mr Trump had made withdrawing from the agreement one of his election campaign pledges but UN rules had meant it was not possible for the US to start the withdrawal process until 4 November 2019. The withdrawal is still subject to the outcome of next year's US presidential election - if Mr Trump loses, the winner may decide to change course. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But scientists and environmentalists fear the effect the Trump administration will have on climate protections in the meantime. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Paris pullout: The worst is yet to come Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal A report issued in December 2018 by the Institute of International and European Affairs suggestedPresident Trump's decision to leave had done ""very real damage"",externalto the Paris agreement, creating ""moral and political cover for others to follow suit"". The decision by the US - one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - drew condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders. An official for France's presidential office said ""we regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary."" French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet in Beijing on Wednesday, where they are expected to sign a statement declaring the ""irreversibility of the Paris accord"", the official added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the US could take more responsibility in what was a multilateral process instead of adding ""negative energy"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, a European Commission spokeswoman responded by saying the agreement was ""here to stay"". ""Its door remains open and we hope the US will join it again one day,"" she said. For Russia, which ratified the deal last month after a long delay, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was very hard to talk about a climate agreement without the US. US Democrats and environmentalists condemned the decision. Impacts 'accelerating' as leaders gather for talks Climate change: Are lifestyle changes the only answer? Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House,condemned Mr Trump's move as a ""disastrous decision that sells out our children's future"",external, while former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore derided those who would ""sacrifice the planet for their greed"". ""It is about the darkest moment in American diplomacy in a very, very long time and a huge blow to global efforts,"" Bill McKibben, leader of climate campaign group 350.org, told the BBC's Newsday programme. However, the move was welcomed by Republican congressman Gary Palmer, who tweeted: ""It is high time for the US to leave this overly regulative and burdensome agreement that doesn't really address climate change."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the agreement had imposed an ""unfair economic burden"" on the United States. Instead, he said, the US would follow ""a realistic and pragmatic model"", using ""all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently"". Mr Trump promised to turn the US into an energy superpower, and has attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He has characterised former US President Barack Obamaâs environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. He has also suggested that the Paris Agreement gives China and other big polluters an unfair advantage over the US by allowing them to continue to increase emissions. Announcing his decision to withdraw in June 2017, Mr Trump said: ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests."" He said the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost economic output and 6.5 million jobs but a US government report last year said that, on the contrary,unchecked climate change would cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars. This video can not be played Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame? Reports suggest the Trump administration has made no effort to renegotiate the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect  on the atmosphere of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Countries agreed to: Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

Anger as 800 affordable homes cut from local plan,"Councils are required to draw up a local development plan to reflect housing and business needs Wrexham will miss out on nearly 800 affordable homes as a result of changes to a key housing blueprint, opposition councillors have claimed. The Local Development Plan (LDP) for 3,400 new homes now expects 505 to be classed as affordable instead of 1,283. Plaid Cymru members claimed council officers had been pressurised by house builders who would benefit to the tune of millions of pounds. Chief planning officer Lawrence Isted said developments had to be viable. Local authorities are required to draw up an LDP to reflect expected housing and business needs, with the Wrexham plan looking ahead to 2028. Developers are generally asked to make some of the houses they build available as social or affordable housing below market rates, according tothe Local Democracy Reporting Service. The alterations partly follow an assessment by district valuers of the viability of two schemes - on Ruthin Road and Cefn Road - where more than 3,000 houses could be built. Plaid Cymru councillor Carrie Harper, who represents the Queensway area of Caia Park, said: ""Reducing the numbers of affordable homes allocated seriously jeopardises the plan as a whole and the decision seems to have been made as a result of developers putting pressure on officers and councillors. ""Why bother to have a long and detailed planning process if the goalposts can be moved at the very last minute?"" Blueprint for 8,000 new homes backed Developer wins appeal in flats dispute Council's housing plan thrown out Mr Isted defended the decision, saying: ""Whilst any reduction in affordable housing is to be regretted, the council must use the most up to date evidence available when presenting its case to the inspectors who are examining the LDP. ""The aspirations that we have for affordable housing must actually be deliverable and the LDP will have to adapt to reflect evidence of viability as well as of need."" The LDP is being examined in public on Thursday and Friday by independent inspectors who will take the decision as to how the plan, and the policy on affordable housing, is taken forward.

The Lib Dems currently have 20 MPs - out of a possible 650 - and they are especially hopeful of gaining seats in London and south-west England, but they would need a dramatic shift in the electoral landscape if they were to win a majority. However, responding to questions from journalists, Ms Swinson said ""stranger things have happened"" and pointed to the SNP's success in the 2015 general election. By chief political correspondent Vicki Young Jo Swinson says she wants to be prime minister - but how credible is that? The Lib Dems are not at the moment even the third largest party in the UK. Ms Swinson cites the example of the SNP surge in 2015, when the party won almost every seat in Scotland - and she personally lost her seat to the SNP candidate. She argues that politics is volatile, it is in flux, and things have changed because of Brexit - people are voting for very different reasons. Therefore, there is no reason why the party can't be incredibly ambitious, she argues. But the problem for the Liberal Democrats is that the way their votes are distributed around the country, it is much harder for them to win seats than for other parties. In 2010, they won seven million votes but got fewer than 60 seats. The Lib Dem leader was introduced by one of the party's newer MPs, Luciana Berger, who used to be in the Labour Party but quit over the issue of anti-Semitism - something Ms Swinson accused Mr Corbyn of failing to ""root out"". Asked whether her party could support a Labour government in the event of a hung Parliament, Ms Swinson said: ""I am absolutely, categorically ruling out Lib Dem votes putting Jeremy Corbyn in No 10."" Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Where do the parties stand on Brexit? The Lib Dem leader said her party was ""the only party standing up to stop Brexit and build a brighter future for the UK"". She argued that stopping Brexit would deliver a Â£50bn ""Remain bonus"" for public services over the next five years The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexitaltogether if they win power at the next general election. If they do not win a majority at the election they would support another referendum. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, told the BBC many Remain supporters were ""uncomfortable"" with the Lib Dems' plan to effectively ""rub out"" the 2016 referendum result and believed EU membership had to be ""argued for and won"" in another public vote. This video can not be played Jo Swinson: ""We are the only party that will stop Brexit"" The party said the Â£50bn figure - the amount that it has calculated will be saved over the next five years by staying in the EU - is based on the UK economy being 1.9% larger in 2024-25. It reflects the extra tax income over the next five years and is based on a 0.4% average annual boost to GDP if the UK stays in the EU. Deputy leader Sir Ed Davey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Lib Dems ""actually think these are quite cautious figures"", adding that all the independent forecasters ""were clear that there will be a big boost if we stay"". Paul Johnson, from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was a reasonable calculation in line with their own forecasts, adding: ""We could expect the economy to be bigger if we were to remain and this assumes a relatively modest effect if anything, although obviously subject to a huge amount of uncertainty"". BBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the vast majority of forecasts do expect the economy would be bigger if the UK were to stay in the EU. But he said the size of that ""bonus"" cannot be predicted with any certainty, and Â£50bn was not a hugely significant amount in terms of overall government expenditure.

Channel 4 defends itself over Smuggled series,"In the first episode, British citizen Carolynne smuggled herself in a mobile home Channel 4 has defended itself over the broadcast of its new reality series Smuggled, 11 days after the deaths of 39 people in a lorry in Essex. The start of the series, which sets eight British citizens the task of entering the UK using illegal means, wasdropped from schedules last week. But it aired on Monday evening and the Home Office said it was ""insensitive and irresponsible"" to show it so soon. Channel 4 argued the show was ""a matter of urgent public interest"". The programme aimed to test the UK's border security by following the progress of eight people trying to smuggle themselves into Britain from various points in Europe without showing valid documentation. As the eight are all British citizens, who would be able to produce valid passports if challenged, they are not committing a criminal offence,the Home Office has confirmed.,external Among those featured in the first episode was a pensioner from Reading who hid inside a mobile home and successfully passed through French and English border controls. The show's producers say they found major weaknesses with border checks and UK audiences should be shown these flaws. Essex lorry deaths: What we know Five migrant boats head for England each week How migrants cross the Channel from Calais It had initially been scheduled for broadcast on 28 October but was pushed back by a week after the 39 people, later confirmed as Vietnamese, were discovered in a refrigerated lorry trailer in Grays, Essex, on 23 October. The family of one of those feared to be among the victims say they paid Â£30,000 to people smugglers. The bodies were discovered in the lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October A spokeswoman for the Home Office said ""broadcasting this programme so soon after the tragic incident at Grays is both insensitive and irresponsible"". ""Organised crime gangs have no respect for human life so it is reckless to provide a platform for the illegal activity that they facilitate,"" she said. ""Doing so can encourage them to exploit our border for profit, risking the lives of vulnerable, desperate people as they do so."" On social media, some viewers also criticised the broadcast. ""Congratulations on the most insensitive program [sic] of the year Channel 4,"" one person wrote on Twitter, while another asked: ""Poorly timed or just in poor taste, who knows?"" But others praised the show, including Channel 4 News broadcaster Krishnan Guru-Murthywho called it,external""fascinating"", saying: ""And it's making me think about the 39, and countless others. That's good."" Psychologist Jo Hemmingsadded,external: ""Perhaps it's more important than ever that they show it."" At the start of the episode, a message on the screen read: ""On October 23rd 2019, 39 people were found dead in the back of a lorry on an industrial estate in Essex. ""This series was filmed before these tragic events took place."" A spokesman for Channel 4 said:""This documentary series investigates concerns that the UK Border Force is failing to adequately secure the UK from clandestine entrants. ""In line with our remit as a public service broadcaster this series, filmed in the summer, investigated the capability of Border Force and demonstrated the porous nature of our border which is exploited by criminals. The initial broadcast was postponed following the tragic news of the deaths of 39 people, found in a lorry container in Essex. More than ever, following this awful tragedy, the findings of the films have become a matter of urgent public interest."" ""Filmed this summer, the programmes question the security of UK borders and give the viewing public a much broader insight into an important issue facing this country - which is part of our remit as a public service broadcaster. ""More than ever, following this awful tragedy, the shocking findings of the films have become a matter of urgent public interest."" And responding to accusations they are giving a platform for the work of smuggling gangs, a Channel 4 statement continued: ""All of the methods of entry into the UK tested in the programme are well-documented and publicised methods used by illegal entrants and refugees. ""The only surprise in the programme is just how easy it is to enter the UK undetected.""

"DIY alternative to smear test 'promising'Self-testing kits could help more women get checked for cervical cancer risk, researchers say.Health","A DIY home urine or swab test could potentially help more women discover whether they are at risk of cervical cancer, researchers say. The new method could be used as an alternative to the smear test and would not require a visit to the doctor. Scientists at Queen Mary University of London asked 600 women to provide self-collected samples for screening. Although larger trials are needed, the work has been called ""promising"" and a potential ""game-changer"" by charities. The findings, being presented at theNCRI cancer conference,externalin Glasgow, suggest the method is feasible and popular. However, larger trials may still be needed before the NHS could decide whether to offer it to patients, say experts. Even then, it would only be one option for women - as the researchers believe smear tests would continue in their current form. But the researchers say that in the future, some women could order the test kits online, use them at home and then send their sample by post to be analysed. This video can not be played Chloe Delevingne had a smear test live on the Victoria Derbyshire programme Screening aims to pick up early warning signs of cancer  - known as pre-cancers - that can be treated to prevent the disease. All women and people with a cervix aged 25 to 64 in the UK are invited forNHS cervical screening,,externalbut the number of women attending cervical screening in the UK has been falling. Around one in four UK women do not attend when invited, figures suggest. Time for 'smear test' to be rebranded? Experts have put the low uptake rates down to embarrassment, a lack of awareness or just putting it off. Dr Belinda Nedjai and colleagues have developed an alternative screening method that does not rely on smear tests. The S5 test measures chemical changes that are detectable in urine or self-collected vaginal fluid samples to gauge a woman's cancer risk. A high score suggests there is an increased risk of a pre-cancer lesion being present. In the study, the S5 test was good at distinguishing which women had pre-cancerous growths diagnosed following conventional screening. Dr Nedjai said the self-sampling was ""pretty accurate"", but was not as quite as effective as the UK's current smear testing programme. ""It will be soon. With improvement we'll get there,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Dr Nedjai said the S5 test needed to be tried on more than 10,000 women before it could be offered on the NHS. She predicted the at-home tests could be available via the health service in five years. Researchers say the test could also be used alongside conventional cervical screening to help improve detection and spare some women from unnecessary investigations. The NHS is currently moving to primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening of smears - testing for the presence of this virus in samples before looking for abnormal cell changes. Almost all cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV. Dr Manuel Rodriguez-Justo, from University College London, said: ""This is exciting research that shows it's possible to detect cervical pre-cancer that is at high risk of developing into invasive cancer in urine and vaginal samples collected by women in the comfort and privacy of their own homes. ""This has the potential to revolutionise the way a positive HPV test is followed up, as well as making it easier for women in countries with no cervical cancer screening programme to be tested."" Researchers have developed a way to identify pre-cancer lesions by analysing urine and vaginal samples Sophia Lowes, Cancer Research UK's health information manager, said: ""The results look promising for detecting women with advanced cell changes. But we need to know if this test picks up all changes and if it's as successful when testing a wider group of people."" Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said although more research was needed, DIY checks could be a ""game-changer"". ""For women who find the current methods of cervical screening difficult, including those with a physical disability or who have experienced trauma, it could mean they can access screening in a far more acceptable and accessible way."" ""It could mean those requiring treatment are identified faster and reduce the number of women having to go for potentially unnecessary investigations at colposcopy.""

Election clash over parties' Brexit promises,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""The Tories have failed on Brexit for three years"" Labour's promise to ""get Brexit sorted"" within six months of winning power has been dismissed as ""fairytale politics"" by the Conservatives in the first clash of the election campaign on the issue. In a speech in Essex, Jeremy Corbyn said his plan to get a better deal and then put it to the public in another referendum was ""clear and simple"". He said a deadline to hold the vote next summer was ""realistic and doable"". But the Tories said Labour's plan would result in ""paralysing uncertainty"". However, the Conservative commitment to negotiate a new free trade deal with the EU in just over a year is also coming under scrutiny. It took seven years for the EU to conclude a free trade deal with Canada, an agreement which many Brexiteers see as a template for the UK. Any deal would need to be agreed by all 27 remaining EU states before it could come into force. Where do the parties stand on Brexit? Could the NHS be ""up for sale"" to US companies? A really simple guide to the UK general election Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, said a majority Conservative government would ""absolutely not"" extend the transition period after the UK's departure from the EU - under Mr Johnson's deal it is due to end at the start of 2021. Pressed on whether this could ultimately lead to a no-deal exit - with the UK defaulting to World Trade Organisation rules - if no free trade deal could be agreed by that point, he pointed out that Mr Johnson had been able to secure major changes to the current withdrawal agreement in ""just 90 days"". Ex-Justice Secretary David Gauke, who lost the Tory whip after rebelling over Brexit, said it would be ""reckless"" to exit transition without a trade deal and MPs must get a vote before this happened.

The political parties are ramping up their election campaigning, ahead of the official start to the five-week campaign period at just after midnight on Wednesday. Brexit is set to be a crucial issue when voters go to the polls on 12 December, with Mr Johnson insisting the UK will leave in January if he wins power. The UK and US have both said they are eager to do a free trade deal after Brexit, and in August, President Donald Trump predicted that leaving the EU would be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". But in a speech in Harlow - a target seat for Labour - Mr Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of seeking to ""hijack Brexit to sell out the NHS"" to American firms in a future trade deal with the US. Labour is hoping its candidate Laura McAlpine will take the Conservative-held seat of Harlow The PM's strategy could see an extra Â£500m a week spent on buying medicines, he claimed, as well as leading to a ""race to the bottom"" on workers' rights and product standards. Mr Johnson has insisted the NHS would ""not be on the table"" in post-Brexit trade talks with the US. FACT CHECK: Labour's Â£500m a week NHS claim The BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said the Â£500m figure was a theoretical worst-case scenario in which the prices of all medicines used in the NHS were the same as the prices of those medicines in the US. However, he said in practice that was highly unlikely - although there was no question US pharmaceutical companies would lobby aggressively for greater access to the NHS, and the ability to set higher prices. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Mr Corbyn claimed Boris Johnson's EU exit deal will ""unleash Thatcherism on steroids"". ""Given the chance, they'll slash food standards to match those of the US where 'acceptable levels' of rat hairs in paprika and maggots in orange juice are allowed,"" he will claim. ""And they will put chlorinated chicken on the supermarket shelves."" If elected next month, Mr Corbyn said he could strike a ""sensible"" new deal with the EU within months ""based on terms we have already discussed with the EU - including membership of a customs union and absolute guarantees on workers rights. At the same time, a Labour government would plan for a new public vote in June or July. ""Labour's plan would get Brexit sorted so a Labour government can get on with delivering the real change Britain needs,"" he told activists. Boris Johnson said his cabinet could be ""proud"" of its record on Brexit ""Only a Labour government would put a decision in your hands... It cannot be left to the politicians...The Brexit crisis must be resolved but it must done democratically."" Mr Corbyn has refused to say whether he would back Leave or Remain, but said he would ""immediately carry out"" the public's decision so the country could ""move on"". Speaking at the same event, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said a Labour government would ""rip up"" Mr Johnson's deal with the EU, describing it as a ""trap door"" to a no-deal exit at the end of the transition period. He said reaching a new economic and security relationship with the EU was a ""massive task"" and there would be ""no safety net"" if the talks were not concluded next year. But Mr Johnson said another referendum would be a ""disastrous, clamorous"" waste of time. Addressing ministers in Downing Street at his final cabinet meeting before Parliament is dissolved for the election, he said his government ""could be proud"" of what it had achieved on Brexit, despite failing to meet his ""do-or-die"" deadline to leave on 31 October. ""We've achieved something people thought we really couldn't do - get a great new deal on Brexit from EU - they said it couldn't be done. ""The choice before country is really very clear - do you want to go forward with our agenda which is to get Brexit done and then get on with delivering all the wonderful things we want to do for this country... or do you want to waste 2020?"" And Mr Gove suggested Mr Corbyn was incapable of negotiating a new Brexit deal in the way Mr Johnson had done. ""It is a fairy tale if you imagine Jeremy Corbyn can get Brexit done. His policy on Brexit has been constructed by a terminally weak leader in order to paper over the cracks in his party."" And on a visit to a gymnasium in the Derbyshire seat of Bolsover, Nigel Farage said The Brexit Party was ""going after"" Labour MPs who he said had failed to deliver what people voted for in the 2016 referendum.

Turkey 'captures sister of dead IS leader in raid',"Turkish officials have released an image of the woman arrested in the raid The sister of former Islamic State group (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been captured in northern Syria, Turkish officials say. The 65-year-old, named as Rasmiya Awad, was detained in a raid on Monday near the town of Azaz, officials said. Turkish officials, cited by several media outlets, believe the arrest could yield valuable intelligence about IS. Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US special forces on his compound in north-west Syria last month. His death was hailed as a victory for US President Donald Trump, but critics argue that IS remains a security threat in Syria and elsewhere. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What we know about the US raid The meaning of Baghdadi's death for IS in Syria One Turkish official told Reuters news agency the arrest of Baghdadi's older sister might help shed light on ""the inner workings"" of IS. This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, hailed the arrest as ""another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations"".

Little is known about Baghdadi's sister and the BBC has not yet been able to independently verify the identity of the arrested woman. Baghdadi had several brothers and sisters,external, although it is not clear if they are all still alive, the New York Times reports. An aerial view of the site that was hit by helicopter gunfire during the US raid The arrest was reportedly made in an area of Aleppo province now under Turkey's control. Ms Awad was found in a trailer, where she was living with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children, a Turkish official told AP news agency, adding that she was being interrogated on suspicion of involvement with an extremist group. The official said Ms Awad could be an intelligence ""gold mine"". Experts say the town where Ms Awad was captured is a known smuggling route for IS families. But it is not clear how much useful intelligence Ms Awad could provide, or how much time she spent with Baghdadi. By Mina al-Lami, jihadist media analyst, BBC Monitoring It remains to be seen what useful intelligence Baghdadi's sister can offer, bearing in mind she might not be privy to information about the group's inner circle. But she may be able to shed light on smuggling routes and hideouts of some IS members and their families, given her and her family's own presence in an area that is hostile to IS - Azaz in northern Syria. Another Baghdadi relative - the militant's brother-in-law and personal courier Muhammad Ali Sajit - said in a recent interview he had given authorities information about Baghdadi's possible presence in Idlib, where the IS leader was eventually killed. The information he provided is also likely to be used to identify other senior figures in the IS leadership, especially its shadowy new ""caliph"", Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi. So far, IS supporters have not commented on the arrest of Baghdadi's sister - typical behaviour by the group's sympathisers who tend to avoid discussing matters detrimental to the group. President Trump announced his death at a press conference at the White House on 27 October. Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel during a US raid on his hideout in Idlib province, Mr Trump said. US President Donald Trump announced the death of Baghdadi at an extraordinary press conference Footage of the raid was later released by the US military. In grainy footage, helicopters were seen firing at gunmen on the ground as they flew towards a compound where Baghdadi was hiding. On landing, US special forces commandos blew holes in the walls of the compound and called on Baghdadi to surrender, the military said. But he fled into a tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children he had taken with him. This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it Mr Trump said DNA tests had been carried out to verify Baghdadi's identity, confirming his death. After the raid, the compound was destroyed in an air strike. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi has since been named as IS' new leader and ""caliph"". According to his associates,he spent them trying to find safety in an increasingly shrinking area in eastern Syria,external, as territory held by IS began falling, AP reports. For months, he kept a Yazidi teenage girl as a sex slave, taking her with him as he travelled with a core group of up to seven close associates. At one point, they moved to Dashisha, a border town in Syria within IS-held territory. The teenager stayed for four months at the home of Baghdadi's father-in-law, where Baghdadi would visit her frequently and rape her, the teen told AP. He would only move at night, wearing trainers and covering his face, always with around five security men, she said. During that period, he was a ""nervous wreck"", fearful of treason and infiltrations among the governors of the group's self-declared provinces, his brother-in-law, Mohamad Ali Sajit, told al-Arabiya TV last week. He sometimes dressed as a shepherd, and walked around with a suicide belt, even slept with one near him, and made his aides also carry belts; he never used a mobile phone, but his close aide did, Mr Sajit said. The stress aggravated the IS leader's diabetes, and he had to constantly monitor his blood sugar and take insulin. In the end, he left former IS areas completely, slipping into the north-western province of Idlib, held by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a militant group linked to al-Qaeda and an IS rival. He chose that location because it was the last territory outside of Syrian government control, US officials said.

"None of pledged starter homes built, says watchdogGovernment plans to build 200,000 affordable homes in England have come to nothing, the National Audit Office says.Business","A government plan to create 200,000 new homes in England for first-time buyers has resulted in no homes being built, the National Audit Office has found. Announced in 2014, ""starter homes"" were meant to be aimed at those under the age of 40 and sold at a 20% discount. But legislation to take the project forward was never passed. Labour called the policy a total failure, but the government said it had a ""great track record"" for house building. Former prime minister David Cameron committed to the scheme in the 2015 Conservative Party manifesto as a way of tackling the affordable housing crisis. The project was also supposed to support the wider growth and regeneration of local areas, and some town centres. The homes were meant to be built across the country by the end of the decade and more than Â£2bn was set aside for the first tranche of 60,000 dwellings. House price calculator: Where can I afford to rent or buy? Housing crisis 'affects 8.4 million' in England Flats out of fashion with first-time buyers According to the National Audit Office (NAO), between 2015-16 and 2017-18, the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) spent almost Â£174m on acquiring and preparing sites originally intended for building starter homes. These were in places such as Plymouth, Bury, Basildon, Stockport, Bridgwater, Cinderford and Bristol. But the spending watchdog said the sites were all now being used for housing more generally, only some of which was affordable. It said the scheme had faltered because the necessary legislation and planning guidance had never been put through Parliament, despite expectations it would happen in 2019. As a result, even new homes conforming to the intended specifications cannot be marketed as starter homes, which has made getting developers on board challenging. The NAO said the government also no longer had a budget dedicated to the starter homes project. Former Prime Minister David Cameron announced the starter homes scheme in 2014 Labour MP Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ""Despite setting aside over Â£2bn to build 60,000 new starter homes, none were built. ""Since 2010 many housing programmes announced with much fanfare have fallen away with money then recycled into the next announcement. ""The MHCLG needs to focus on delivery and not raise, and then dash, people's expectations."" John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary, said the Conservative Party  had wasted four years and spent millions of pounds. ""After nearly 10 years of Conservative failure on housing, the country needs a Labour government to fix the housing crisis."" But a housing ministry spokeswoman said house building was at its highest level for all but one of the last 30 years. ""We have a great track record... with 222,000 homes delivered last year, and 1.3 million in total since 2010, including over 430,000 affordable homes."" David O'Leary, policy director at Home Builders Federation, said that even though starter homes had not got off the ground, the scheme had not been a total failure. He said the engagement it had generated between local government, builders, mortgage lenders and valuers was positive. ""The difficulty in creating a workable set of rules demonstrates the importance of ensuring that proper consideration is given to the practical implementation of interventions and their market impacts as early as possible.""

Merseyside Police meet family over unsolved death,"Kevin Mcleod's family has long campaigned for his death to be investigated as a murder A team of six retired ""experienced"" detectives and two serving officers are reviewing the case of a man's death in the Highlands almost 23 years ago. Kevin Mcleod's body was found in Wick harbour on 9 February 1997. His family has long campaigned to have his death investigated as murder because of injuries found on his body. The team from Merseyside Police are looking at how police officers and Crown officials have handled of the case. The review, which has already started, is expected to take a minimum of nine months to complete. Police Scotland has said there were ""serious failings"" by a previous force in its handling of the case and asked Merseyside to carry out a review. Family hope for 1997 unsolved death breakthrough Independent review of 1997 unsolved death Apology over harbour death case failings Mr Mcleod's parents June and Hugh Mcleod and his uncle and aunt Allan and Yvonne Mcleod met officers from Merseyside Police for the first time on Tuesday. Crown officials also attended the meeting in Inverness. Allan Mcleod welcomed the involvement of the English force. He said there were ""countless unanswered questions"" relating to his nephew's case which we hoped Merseyside Police would uncover. He told BBC Scotland: ""It was a meaningful and positive meeting. ""They told us a team of six retired experienced detectives working with two senior officers are already reviewing the case."" Mr Mcleod said the family's hope was ""for the person who murdered Kevin to be brought to justice"". Kevin Mcleod's parents June and Hugh and uncle Allan believe the 24-year-old was murdered Merseyside Police has declined to comment. Mr Mcleod, an electrician from Wick, was last seen alive in the early hours of 8 February 1997 while on a night out with friends in the Caithness town. His body was recovered from the sea late the following morning. Mr Mcleod had sustained stomach injuries, a post-mortem examination revealed.  It prompted a procurator fiscal to instruct the former Northern Constabulary to treat his death as a potential murder inquiry. Police then discovered the 24-year-old had been involved in an altercation during his night out, but determined his injuries were not suspicious and described his death as a ""tragic accident"". They said Mr Mcleod had been injured either falling on to a bollard, on part of a berthed boat or a boat's fishing creels before he ended up in the water. A pathologist's report concluded he had died from drowning and the ""major abdominal injury"" was consistent with him falling on to an object such as the bollards found at Wick harbour. But Mr Mcleod's family believe he suffered the injuries during his murder. Mr Mcleod was 24 when he died In 1998, a fatal accident inquiry recorded an open verdict. But the inquiry's sheriff criticised elements of the initial police investigation. He concluded it had not been established the ""very serious abdominal injuries"" were the result of an assault, but this remained ""a possibility"". In 2017, Police Scotland, which replaced Northern Constabulary in 2013, apologised for ""serious failings"" on the part of the former force and said officers had missed ""the opportunity to gather vital evidence"". Last year, the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe QC, instructed an experienced prosecutor to review police handling of Mr Mcleod's death. This review remains ongoing. In July this year, Police Scotland asked Merseyside Police to carry out a separate ""detailed review"" of the case. A Crown Office spokesman said: ""The additional investigations requested of Merseyside Police in this case will be conducted under the direction of the Crown. ""The question of what further steps might be taken will be addressed upon completion of further work. ""The family will continue to be kept up to date at regular intervals on the progress of the review."" Kevin Mcleod: Timeline 7 February 1997:Kevin goes on a night out with friends. He is last seen alive in the early hours of the following day. 17:25, 8 February:Kevin's father reports him missing and police immediately begin inquiries to find him. 01:00, 9 February:A search by police, coastguard and a lifeboat is called off due to bad weather. Kevin's relatives continue their own search until 05:00. 11:05, 9 February:A local diver, asked to help with the earlier resumed police co-ordinated search, finds Kevin's body in the harbour. 10 February:Injuries are found on Kevin's stomach in a post-mortem examination and a procurator fiscal instructs Northern Constabulary to treat his death as a potential murder inquiry. 11 February:Police tell Kevin's family the injuries were likely caused by a fall on to a bollard, but the family are not happy with this conclusion. 28 July:A person Kevin had an altercation with earlier on his night out is found. Police are instructed to carry out a second inquiry into Kevin's death. More than 100 witnesses are interviewed to help trace Kevin's final moments. August:During the second inquiry, police say the injuries could have been consistent with a fall on to a berthed boat before Kevin went into the sea. 3 September 1998:A fatal accident inquiry records an open verdict on Kevin's death. April 2000:The net weave pattern on Caithness Creels, a type of fishing pot used locally, is suggested by police as the cause for diamond-shape bruising that was found on the 24-year-old's body. The following year Northern Constabulary ask an expert to review the pathological aspects of Kevin's death. 4 October 2001:The expert's report suggests Kevin had fallen on to creels on a boat berthed at the harbour. March 2002:Police share the expert's finding with Kevin's family. December 2007:The Police Complaints Commissioner for Scotland issues a critical report on Northern Constabulary's handling of complaints from Kevin's family. The report describes the force behaving with ""institutional arrogance"" and orders that its chief constable apologise to the family. December 2017:Police Scotland says there had been ""serious failings"" on the part of Northern Constabulary, and officers had missed ""the opportunity to gather vital evidence"". May 2018:The Lord Advocate instructs an experienced prosecutor to review police handling of the case. This review remains ongoing.

Does Help to Buy prop up housebuilders?,"The Help to Buy housing scheme, launched in 2013, is hailed by the government as one of its big successes. The Treasury says 494,108 English homes have been bought through the scheme, with the vast majority going to first-time buyers living outside London. Ministers and mortgage lenders alike say it lifts people into home ownership by getting them on the housing ladder. But critics say it merely subsidises housebuilders and pushes up the price of new homes. Similar schemes exist in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are two main forms: Help to Buy loans and Help to Buy Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). In the first version, the government lends up to 20% of the cost of a newly built property - or 40% within Greater London - so buyers need only a 5% deposit and a 75% mortgage to buy it. Those purchasing a new-build home are not charged interest for the first five years. Join our Affordable Living Facebook group here,external Five surprises about your housing costs How I bought a house without mum and dad The Help to Buy Isa was launched later, in December 2015, and is open to first-time buyers in the UK. Savers receive a 25% bonus from the government when they withdraw the money they have saved to buy their first property. The maximum purchase price is Â£250,000, or Â£450,000 in London. The maximum government bonus that someone can receive is Â£3,000, if they have saved Â£12,000. Savers can deposit up to Â£200 a month, although they can kick-start saving with a lump sum of Â£1,200. Chancellor Philip Hammond is certainly firmly behind the scheme, which was introduced by his predecessor, George Osborne. He has extended it to run until March 2023 and says the move will support ""half a million more home purchases"". He said: ""The government supports those who dream of owning their own home and wants to help them take the first step on to the property ladder."" Support also comes from the Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association. Its executive director, Kate Davies, said Help to Buy had become ""a cornerstone of the UK property market"" and provides ""essential support to the whole of the UK property sector"". She added: ""Although last year saw the highest number of first-time buyers since the financial crisis, millions of households are still waiting to get on the housing ladder and Help to Buy will continue to play a crucial role in helping some of these households into home ownership over the next four years."" The argument against the scheme has gained ground this week, with the news that one of the UK's biggest builders of houses,Persimmon, saw its annual profits top Â£1bn last year. A day earlier, the firm's share price fell 5% because of suggestions that its participation in Help to Buy was under government scrutiny. For opponents of the scheme, that just shows how dependent the firm has become on big injections of public cash. Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, told the BBC that profit on a house sold by Persimmon had trebled since Help to Buy was introduced, ""roughly from Â£20,000 to Â£60,000"". And property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that last year, half the number of homes Persimmon built were underpinned by support from Help to Buy. Mr Pryor said the scheme was brought in for legitimate reasons following the credit crunch, to restore confidence in the sector. But since then, it had become ""the crack cocaine of the building industry"", he said. ""When we are weaned off it, it is going to be painful,"" he added. Other big housebuilders, such as Barratt and Taylor Wimpey, are thought to have benefited to a similar extent. Well, it has arguably distorted the housing market by making it more advantageous to buy a new-build home than an existing one. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley in 2017 said the price gap between new homes and second-hand ones had set a new record. ""There has always been a small premium for new-build; people will pay extra for spanking-new kitchens and bathrooms. But since 2013, that premium has rocketed,"" it said. For Mark Dyason, managing director of specialist property broker Thistle Finance, Help to Buy could come to a sticky end when the scheme is finally wound up. He said: ""Help to Buy is in much the same vein as low [interest] rates since the global financial crisis. ""They have kept the economy going, but equally they have kicked the can down the road. ""The Help to Buy scheme is arguably a hollow victory, with the potential to cause all manner of problems, both for the buyers who have used it and the developers that have offered it.""

Kushila Stein, 45, from New Zealand, was rescued from the Aegean Sea, north of Crete, on Sunday. During her 37-hour ordeal Ms Stein reportedly rationed a ""handful of boiled lollies"" and wrapped herself in plastic bags for warmth. An experienced sailor, Ms Stein put a red bag on her head and used a mirror to attract attention, reports say. After an extensive search, the Greek Coast Guard found her 101km (55 nautical miles) north of Crete, Greece's largest island. Her motherWendy Stein told Stuff.co.nz,externalher daughter's training in sea survival ""might have saved her life"".

School parrot celebrates 70th birthday,"Sim arrived at the school in 1988 after the toy shop he was living in closed down A school parrot has celebrated its 70th birthday with a special party. The septuagenarian songbird named Sim, was sung happy birthday by the choir at the Rouge Bouillon School in St Helier, Jersey, and received a cake that was edible to both humans and birds. The brightly coloured Amazon parrot has been the school's pet since 1988. In 1991 Sim survived a fire which destroyed part of the building. Students help with his care, feeding him and cleaning his cage daily. Sim is a particularly long-lived member of his species, with most Amazon parrots not living much beyond 50. He was rehomed at the school after living in a toy shop which was forced to close. Sim was treated to a special cake and singing from the school choir One student said Sim was a great companion to spend time with if you were feeling lonely. Deputy head teacher Jess Doyle described the ageing parrot as having become a ""really big part of the school"" during her 30 years in education. She said: ""When we have new children arrive at the school who may not speak English, we take them to go see him and he makes them feel very welcome."" She added that there must be ""thousands of people"" across the island with fond memories of Sim. Ancient parrot was 1m tall and possibly carnivorous Talented Parrot.

Sweeping changes coming to the Brit Awards,"Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris took this year's Brit Award for best British single, for their summer banger One Kiss The Brit Awards have announced a major revamp for 2020, with fewer awards and an end to fan votes. Organisers promise ""more music"" as a result, with artists being given full creative control of their performances. Prizes like best British video and best international group have been cut, while the outstanding contribution award has been retired for 2020. Despite press reports earlier this year, gendered awards for best male and best female will remain. Brit Awards 'will review' male and female prizes Brits 2019: The real winners and losers Brit Awards 2019: The ceremony in pictures The changes come after several years of falling ratings. This year's ceremony, which saw performances from Pink, Dua Lipa and George Ezra, was watched by 4.1m people, down 400,000 from 2018. The decision to scrap some of the awards makes for a more streamlined show, but fans of BTS are already angry about the loss of best international group. Allow Twitter content?

The full list of categories is as follows (all British unless noted otherwise]. Male Solo Artist Female Solo Artist Best Group Best New Artist (previously British Breakthrough Act) Rising Star (previously the Critics' Choice Award) Song Of The Year (previously British Single) Mastercard Album Of The Year International Male Solo Artist International Female Solo Artist The biggest change, however, will be in the performances. The Brits say they will ""hand the stage to the artists booked to perform on the night without imposing any creative limitations"". The idea is to create more viral moments - like Kanye West's performance of All Night on a stage crammed with British rap talent, or Adele's simple but effective rendition of Someone Like You. Of course, the most surefire way to go viral is to fall off stage like Madonna in 2015, or one of Katy Perry's dancers (visually impaired by having a house for a head) two years later. But giving artists creative control could give ITV's censors a major headache. Earlier this year, Brits organisers stopped The 1975 from performing Love It If We Made It after they won best British group, due to lyrics about drug abuse. ""There were a number of complications,""said the band's manager Jamie Oborne,external, ""which included us not wanting to have the words changed and ITV not wanting Matthew shouting [swear words]."" Under the new system, the performance would presumably be allowed to go ahead. Madonna's perilous tumble is one of the most memorable Brit moments of recent years Katy Perry's dancer plummeted off the side of the stage in 2017 Winners on the night will receive the classic Lady Britannia Brit statuette, which returns after nearly a decade's rest. Recent years had seen a bespoke ""remix"" of the design, by artists such as Damien Hirst and Anish Kapoor. And fan votes have been scrapped altogether - meaning an end to boy and girl-bands dominating categories like best single. This year, all awards will be decided by a 1,200-strong ""official voting academy"", made up of experts from all areas of the music industry. That's not necessarily a positive move, however, as fan votes were often the only way for phenomenally successful acts like One Direction, Girls Aloud and Little Mix to gain recognition. Brits chairman David Joseph explained the changes, saying: ""We will be putting creativity, British culture and exceptional performances at the heart of the show to make Brits night a world class celebration. ""The awards should be a global platform for the artists of the year to create moments that live beyond the night itself. We are looking at everything to put on the best possible show."" The Brits launched in 1977 to mark the Queen's silver jubilee, but didn't return until 1982 - which means 2020 will be the 40th ceremony. Organisers say the event, at London's O2 arena next February, will mark the anniversary by paying ""tribute to to many unforgettable Brits moments that are now part of a rich and much loved heritage.""

Crown star Olivia Colman 'obsessed' with Queen,"This video can not be played Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as Elizabeth II Critics have mostly come out in force to praise the third series of The Crown, calling it a ""class act"", ""beautiful"", and ""confident"". Anita Singh's five-star Telegraph review said,external: ""The Crown remains, by far, the best soap opera"" on TV. Carol Midgley's four-star assessment in The Times highlighted the acting, including Olivia Colman's ""skill"" in playing Queen Elizabeth II. Colman deftly plays the monarch's ""vulnerabilities"", she added. The Mirror's Lewis Knight gave the drama five stars,external, describing it as ""a majestic return"". Writing in the Financial Times, Suzi Feay was effusive,externalabout how ""wonderful"" the Netflix drama is visually, making viewers ""feel as though we're peeping into the Royal apartments"". However, Feay also felt there were signs the show's writer Peter Morgan is finding it harder to dramatise something as long and complex as the history of the current Queen. Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Daniels play Margaret and her husband ""As the years trudge on, and the big national events are counted off, the storytelling shows signs of strain,"" Feay wrote. ""Peter Morgan's script is ever-efficient with a twist of elegance, but some scenes are reduced to the most banal of stock phrases."" The reviewers have had the benefit of watching season three in its entirety, which spans the years 1964-1977 and sees a raft of new actors - those taking over roles, or playing newly introduced characters.

"Crown star Olivia Colman 'obsessed' with QueenThe Oscar-winning actress plays the ""eternally fascinating"" monarch in the third season of The Crown.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Olivia Colman succeeds Claire Foy as Elizabeth II Critics have mostly come out in force to praise the third series of The Crown, calling it a ""class act"", ""beautiful"", and ""confident"". Anita Singh's five-star Telegraph review said,external: ""The Crown remains, by far, the best soap opera"" on TV. Carol Midgley's four-star assessment in The Times highlighted the acting, including Olivia Colman's ""skill"" in playing Queen Elizabeth II. Colman deftly plays the monarch's ""vulnerabilities"", she added. The Mirror's Lewis Knight gave the drama five stars,external, describing it as ""a majestic return"". Writing in the Financial Times, Suzi Feay was effusive,externalabout how ""wonderful"" the Netflix drama is visually, making viewers ""feel as though we're peeping into the Royal apartments"". However, Feay also felt there were signs the show's writer Peter Morgan is finding it harder to dramatise something as long and complex as the history of the current Queen. Helena Bonham Carter and Ben Daniels play Margaret and her husband ""As the years trudge on, and the big national events are counted off, the storytelling shows signs of strain,"" Feay wrote. ""Peter Morgan's script is ever-efficient with a twist of elegance, but some scenes are reduced to the most banal of stock phrases.""

Sir Lindsay Hoyle elected as Commons Speaker,"This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle was dragged to the chair after his election after four rounds of voting. Labour MP and deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected by MPs as the new Commons Speaker, after John Bercow stepped down. After winning the final round of voting against Chris Bryant, Sir Lindsay was dragged to the chair by MPs, where he pledged to be a ""neutral"" Speaker. He also paid tribute to his daughter, Natalie, who died in 2017, saying she would ""always be missed"". The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. Speakers must be politically impartial, which means Sir Lindsay will be required to resign from the Labour Party in order to carry out his role. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. Seven candidates were originally in the running to succeed Mr Bercow, including former minister and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and former Labour minister Meg Hillier. Who is the new Commons Speaker? John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? In the fourth and final round of voting, Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - received 325 votes to Labour MP Chris Bryant's 213. Sir Lindsay, who is the MP for his home constituency of Chorley, in Lancashire, told MPs that ""this House will change, but it will change for the better"" and he said he would be a ""transparent"" Speaker. He also thanked his staff and family and paid tribute to his daughter, saying: ""There is one person who is not here; my daughter Natalie. I wish she could have been here. She was everything to all of us."" Sir Lindsay's 28-year-old daughter Natalie Lewis-Hoyle was found dead at her home in Essex in December 2017. This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle promised to ensure all MPs were heard Paying tribute to the new Speaker, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was sure Sir Lindsay would ""stick up"" for backbenchers and show his ""signature kindness and reasonableness"" in the chair. ""Mr Speaker, in congratulating you on your election I observe that you have prevailed over an extremely strong field and that every other candidate earlier on spoke forcibly and well,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And Mr Speaker, over the years I have observed that you have many good qualities, and I'm sure you will stick up for backbenchers in the way that you have proposed, and I'm sure that you will adhere to a strict Newtonian concept of time in PMQs."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sir Lindsay he would need eyes in the back of his head in his new role. He said Sir Lindsay had taken the welfare of Commons staff and MPs ""very, very seriously"" and would continue to do so. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Sir Lindsay had ""always taken great care"" of MPs, and welcomed his pledge to take the welfare of Commons staff seriously. She also said she hoped he would continue the modernisation of Parliament. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds also congratulated Sir Lindsay, saying the Commons was ""looking for a breath of fresh air"". The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked.

Recalled US ambassador felt 'threatened' by Trump,"Marie Yovanovitch worked for the State Department for 33 years A recalled US ambassador at the centre of the Trump impeachment inquiry said she felt threatened by a cryptic remark the president made about her on a call. Ex-envoy to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch told Congress she was ""very concerned"" by President Donald Trump's comment in the phone call with Ukraine's leader. Mr Trump told his counterpart: ""Well, she's [Ms Yovanovitch] going to go through some things."" Democrats have just released the first transcripts from closed-door testimony. The Republican president is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his US political rival, Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden, who worked with a Ukrainian gas company. During the 25 July call with President Volodymyr Zelensky - a rough transcript of which has been released by the White House - the US president also described Ms Yovanovitch as ""bad news"". That call triggered the current congressional impeachment investigation that could seek to remove Mr Trump from office for alleged abuses of power. In her testimony from 11 October released on Monday, she said she had been ""shocked"" by what the president said. ""I didn't know what it meant,"" Ms Yovanovitch said. ""I was very concerned. I still am."" The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means The House Intelligence Committee released Ms Yovanovitch's testimony on Monday. The career diplomat said that when she sought advice from the US Ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, a Trump donor, he suggested Ms Yovanovitch tweet praise of the president. ""You need to go big or go home,"" Mr Sondland allegedly told her. Ms Yovanovitch testified that she did not think she could follow the advice. Ms Yovanovitch added that Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had begun efforts to discredit her in late 2018 as he effectively ran a shadow foreign policy on Ukraine. Mr Giuliani wanted to investigate Mr Biden and his son in order to find information ""that could be possibly damaging to a Presidential run"", the diplomat testified. Mr Giuliani also enlisted Ukraine's chief prosecutor, Yuriy Lutsenko, to spread ""falsehoods"" about her in order to ""hurt"" her ""in the US"", according to Ms Yovanovitch. She said she had been warned by Ukraine's justice minister that ""I really needed to watch my back"". Ms Yovanovitch left Ukraine in May, months ahead of her scheduled departure. She told US lawmakers that her boss rang her in April to say she must return to the US immediately. ""She said it was for my security, that this was for my well-being, people were concerned,"" Ms Yovanovitch told Congress. During her testimony she also recalled how Mr Giuliani had sought to secure a US tourist visa for another former Ukrainian chief prosecutor, Viktor Shokin - who had been refused such a visa by the state department on the basis of ""known corrupt activities"". Mr Shokin is the official whom Joe Biden, as well as representatives of other Western governments, attempted to have fired for alleged corruption. Republicans baselessly argue that Mr Biden called for his firing because of Mr Shokin's decision to investigate Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm for which Mr Biden Jr worked. It's unclear why Mr Giuliani pressed for Mr Shokin's visa to be granted. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? On Monday the House Intelligence Committee also released the transcript from last month's testimony by a former top adviser to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Michael McKinley told the inquiry that he had recommended a statement of support for Ms Yovanovitch after Mr Trump's call became public. But he says he was told Mr Pompeo had decided ""better not to... at this time"". Mr McKinley resigned from his post days before his congressional testimony last month. He told the lawmakers that he had stepped down over his concerns about ""the engagement of our missions to procure negative political information for domestic purposes"". ""The timing of my resignation was the result of two overriding concerns: the failure, in my view, of the state department to offer support to foreign service employees caught up in the impeachment inquiry; and, second, by what appears to be the utilisation of our ambassadors overseas to advance domestic political objectives,"" he added, according to the transcript. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher in Washington says the two transcripts provided new depth and detail to the concerns harboured by top-level US diplomats in Washington and Kiev about the White House's back-channel pressure on the Ukrainian government. Also on Monday, four US officials who were called to testify to Congress failed to show up as requested.

"Wife and lover guilty of farmer's murderWilliam Taylor's wife and her partner shared a ""venomous hatred"" for the farmer, prosecutors said.","Angela Taylor and Paul Cannon sent explicit text messages about killing her estranged husband William Taylor The estranged wife of a wealthy farmer has been found guilty of murdering him. Angela Taylor and her partner Paul Cannon shared ""a venomous hatred"" for William Taylor as he would not divorce her, St Albans Crown Court heard. The 69-year-old's skeletal remains were found waist-deep in mud by a passing fisherman near Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in February, eight months after he was reported missing. Taylor and Cannon were both convicted of murder and arson. The pair will be sentenced on Friday and Judge Michael Kay QC told them: ""There is only once sentence that can be passed and it will be a life sentence."" Gwyn Griffiths, 60, who was a colleague of Cannon and from Folkestone, Kent, was cleared of conspiracy to murder. Mr Taylor was reported missing by his lodger on 4 June 2018. Several days before he went missing his Land Rover was set on fire. DNA found in the torched car matched that of Cannon. William Taylor was reported missing by his lodger on 4 June Taylor, 53, and Cannon, 54, fantasised about killing Mr Taylor, who was known as Bill, in explicit messages sent to each other on WhatsApp, their trial heard. Messages read in court spoke about ""the best way"" to kill the farmer and hurt his family. They included references to pickaxes, chainsaws and barbed wire. Various scenarios were discussed in the messages and Taylor described them as ""a turn-on"". On the night Mr Taylor disappeared, Cannon sent a message which said: ""Just watching Kill Bill 2 lol."" Cannon told police officers: ""Messages between Angela and me related to no more than fantasy and banter of an extreme nature."" Angela Taylor said she had sent the messages ""out of frustration"" as Mr Taylor was ""getting on her nerves"". Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Price QC said: ""It will become apparent that he and she shared and encouraged in each other in a venomous hatred for William Taylor. They loathed him."" Experts told the court that it was impossible to determine a cause of death because Mr Taylor's body was so badly decomposed. The farmer was still wearing his boots and blue overalls when his remains were found. The defence argued Mr Taylor probably died after getting ""stuck in mud"" and might have gone to the area for a picnic. Forensic pathologist Dr Charlotte Randall said there was no sign of blunt force injuries, no gunshot or stab wounds and no evidence of toxic substances. But the court heard there was a ""possible fracture"" to the hyoid bone in the neck, which could have been due to compression. Farmer 'not murdered but got stuck in mud' Murder accused was 'celebrating at wedding' Wife 'shared violent fantasies on WhatsApp' Farmer 'got wife's lover the sack' Wife 'said she could have in-laws killed' Wife's lover's DNA 'found in murdered man's car' Farmer's wife 'fantasised about killing him' Wealthy farmer's wife 'plotted murder with lover' HM Courts Service English GCSE exams may be 'first of many' to move onscreen in 2025 - what will it mean for students?

Domestic abuse 'biggest child protection threat'Councils largely blame a 53% rise in cases in 10 years on domestic violence and substance abuse.Family & Education,"Domestic violence, family conflict and drink and drug abuse are the biggest drivers of the rise in child-protection cases in England, says the Local Government Association (LGA). The organisation representing English councils has surveyed the councillors in charge of children's services about the causes of a 53% rise in child-protection cases over the past decade. More than 80% identified domestic violence and substance misuse as being behind the increased numbers in their local authorities. An average of 88 children are taken into care each day and the LGA asked the lead councillors for children's services for their view of the most common causes. The behaviour of adults around children - in the form of domestic violence, drinking and drug taking - was the most frequent explanation for councils having to intervene to protect 18,000 more children than a decade ago. This was followed by factors such as poverty, housing problems and debt. Domestic violence killings reach five-year high School admissions to help domestic violence families Domestic abuse: 'Children are hidden victims' Figures published last week by the Department for Education showed 52,000 child-protection plans, identifying how to deal with children considered to be at risk, had been drawn up - a slight annual decline against a significant long-term increase. These figures also showed domestic violence to be the most common factor for so-called ""children in need"" - much more so than issues such as abuse, gangs, trafficking or anti-social behaviour. There are almost 400,000 ""children in need"" where there are concerns about their health or development and where they are at risk of being ""significantly impaired"" without extra support. After domestic violence, the most common underlying problems are mental health issues, emotional abuse, drug and alcohol abuse. Physical abuse, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation were all lower than the previous year. But numbers of serious cases investigating fears of children suffering or facing ""significant harm"" have continued to climb. There were more than 200,000 of these safeguarding inquiries - rising every year from 127,000 in 2012-13. The Local Government Association is warning of the financial pressures on councils. ""Funding pressures are coinciding with huge increases in demand for support because of problems like hardship and family conflict,"" said Judith Blake, chairwoman of the LGA's children and young people board.

"Turkey 'captures sister of dead IS leader in raid'A Turkish official says that Baghdadi's older sister could potentially be an ""intelligence gold mine"".Middle East","Turkish officials have released an image of the woman arrested in the raid The sister of former Islamic State group (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has been captured in northern Syria, Turkish officials say. The 65-year-old, named as Rasmiya Awad, was detained in a raid on Monday near the town of Azaz, officials said. Turkish officials, cited by several media outlets, believe the arrest could yield valuable intelligence about IS. Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US special forces on his compound in north-west Syria last month. His death was hailed as a victory for US President Donald Trump, but critics argue that IS remains a security threat in Syria and elsewhere. Who was Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? What we know about the US raid The meaning of Baghdadi's death for IS in Syria One Turkish official told Reuters news agency the arrest of Baghdadi's older sister might help shed light on ""the inner workings"" of IS. This video can not be played Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi killed himself during a raid by US commandos Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, hailed the arrest as ""another example of the success of our counter-terrorism operations"".

Little is known about Baghdadi's sister and the BBC has not yet been able to independently verify the identity of the arrested woman. Baghdadi had several brothers and sisters,external, although it is not clear if they are all still alive, the New York Times reports. An aerial view of the site that was hit by helicopter gunfire during the US raid The arrest was reportedly made in an area of Aleppo province now under Turkey's control. Ms Awad was found in a trailer, where she was living with her husband, daughter-in-law and five children, a Turkish official told AP news agency, adding that she was being interrogated on suspicion of involvement with an extremist group. The official said Ms Awad could be an intelligence ""gold mine"". Experts say the town where Ms Awad was captured is a known smuggling route for IS families. But it is not clear how much useful intelligence Ms Awad could provide, or how much time she spent with Baghdadi. By Mina al-Lami, jihadist media analyst, BBC Monitoring It remains to be seen what useful intelligence Baghdadi's sister can offer, bearing in mind she might not be privy to information about the group's inner circle. But she may be able to shed light on smuggling routes and hideouts of some IS members and their families, given her and her family's own presence in an area that is hostile to IS - Azaz in northern Syria. Another Baghdadi relative - the militant's brother-in-law and personal courier Muhammad Ali Sajit - said in a recent interview he had given authorities information about Baghdadi's possible presence in Idlib, where the IS leader was eventually killed. The information he provided is also likely to be used to identify other senior figures in the IS leadership, especially its shadowy new ""caliph"", Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi. So far, IS supporters have not commented on the arrest of Baghdadi's sister - typical behaviour by the group's sympathisers who tend to avoid discussing matters detrimental to the group. President Trump announced his death at a press conference at the White House on 27 October. Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after fleeing into a tunnel during a US raid on his hideout in Idlib province, Mr Trump said. US President Donald Trump announced the death of Baghdadi at an extraordinary press conference Footage of the raid was later released by the US military. In grainy footage, helicopters were seen firing at gunmen on the ground as they flew towards a compound where Baghdadi was hiding. On landing, US special forces commandos blew holes in the walls of the compound and called on Baghdadi to surrender, the military said. But he fled into a tunnel and detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and two children he had taken with him. This video can not be played The grainy footage shows troops closing in on the compound - and later an explosion destroying it Mr Trump said DNA tests had been carried out to verify Baghdadi's identity, confirming his death. After the raid, the compound was destroyed in an air strike. Abu Ibrahim al-Hashemi al-Qurashi has since been named as IS' new leader and ""caliph"". According to his associates,he spent them trying to find safety in an increasingly shrinking area in eastern Syria,external, as territory held by IS began falling, AP reports. For months, he kept a Yazidi teenage girl as a sex slave, taking her with him as he travelled with a core group of up to seven close associates. At one point, they moved to Dashisha, a border town in Syria within IS-held territory. The teenager stayed for four months at the home of Baghdadi's father-in-law, where Baghdadi would visit her frequently and rape her, the teen told AP. He would only move at night, wearing trainers and covering his face, always with around five security men, she said. During that period, he was a ""nervous wreck"", fearful of treason and infiltrations among the governors of the group's self-declared provinces, his brother-in-law, Mohamad Ali Sajit, told al-Arabiya TV last week. He sometimes dressed as a shepherd, and walked around with a suicide belt, even slept with one near him, and made his aides also carry belts; he never used a mobile phone, but his close aide did, Mr Sajit said. The stress aggravated the IS leader's diabetes, and he had to constantly monitor his blood sugar and take insulin. In the end, he left former IS areas completely, slipping into the north-western province of Idlib, held by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a militant group linked to al-Qaeda and an IS rival. He chose that location because it was the last territory outside of Syrian government control, US officials said.

US notifies UN of Paris climate accord withdrawalNotification begins the one-year process of withdrawing from the landmark climate agreement.,"This video can not be played Watch Trump explain why he is pulling the US out of Paris climate accord The US has begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, notifying the UN of its intention to leave, as other countries express regret and disappointment at the move. The notification begins a one-year process of exiting the global climate change accord, culminating the day after the 2020 US election. The US government says the deal puts an ""unfair economic burden"" on Americans. The agreement brought together 188 nations to combat climate change. There has been widespread international condemnation of the US move. The Paris accord, agreed in 2015, committed the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures below 2C,externalabove pre-industrial levels and attempting to limit them even more, to a 1.5C rise. The decision to withdraw - taken by President Donald Trump after he came to office in 2017 - made the US the world's sole non-signatory and prompted high-level efforts by the European Union to keep the agreement on track. However, hundreds of local governments, businesses and organisations in the US have joined the We Are Still In movement, pledging to cut emissions and move to renewable energy. The US issued its formal notification on the first day it was possible to do so,external. Mr Trump had made withdrawing from the agreement one of his election campaign pledges but UN rules had meant it was not possible for the US to start the withdrawal process until 4 November 2019. The withdrawal is still subject to the outcome of next year's US presidential election - if Mr Trump loses, the winner may decide to change course. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But scientists and environmentalists fear the effect the Trump administration will have on climate protections in the meantime. What is in the Paris climate agreement? Paris pullout: The worst is yet to come Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal A report issued in December 2018 by the Institute of International and European Affairs suggestedPresident Trump's decision to leave had done ""very real damage"",externalto the Paris agreement, creating ""moral and political cover for others to follow suit"". The decision by the US - one of the world's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases - drew condemnation from environmentalists and expressions of regret from world leaders. An official for France's presidential office said ""we regret this and this only makes the Franco-Chinese partnership on the climate and biodiversity more necessary."" French President Emmanuel Macron and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are due to meet in Beijing on Wednesday, where they are expected to sign a statement declaring the ""irreversibility of the Paris accord"", the official added. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he hoped the US could take more responsibility in what was a multilateral process instead of adding ""negative energy"". This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Meanwhile, a European Commission spokeswoman responded by saying the agreement was ""here to stay"". ""Its door remains open and we hope the US will join it again one day,"" she said. For Russia, which ratified the deal last month after a long delay, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was very hard to talk about a climate agreement without the US. US Democrats and environmentalists condemned the decision. Impacts 'accelerating' as leaders gather for talks Climate change: Are lifestyle changes the only answer? Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House,condemned Mr Trump's move as a ""disastrous decision that sells out our children's future"",external, while former vice-president and climate campaigner Al Gore derided those who would ""sacrifice the planet for their greed"". ""It is about the darkest moment in American diplomacy in a very, very long time and a huge blow to global efforts,"" Bill McKibben, leader of climate campaign group 350.org, told the BBC's Newsday programme. However, the move was welcomed by Republican congressman Gary Palmer, who tweeted: ""It is high time for the US to leave this overly regulative and burdensome agreement that doesn't really address climate change."" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday that the agreement had imposed an ""unfair economic burden"" on the United States. Instead, he said, the US would follow ""a realistic and pragmatic model"", using ""all energy sources and technologies cleanly and efficiently"". Mr Trump promised to turn the US into an energy superpower, and has attempted to sweep away a raft of pollution legislation to reduce the cost of producing gas, oil and coal. He has characterised former US President Barack Obamaâs environmental clean-up plans as a war on American energy. He has also suggested that the Paris Agreement gives China and other big polluters an unfair advantage over the US by allowing them to continue to increase emissions. Announcing his decision to withdraw in June 2017, Mr Trump said: ""I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or renegotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests."" He said the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost economic output and 6.5 million jobs but a US government report last year said that, on the contrary,unchecked climate change would cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars. This video can not be played Why is it so hot and is climate change to blame? Reports suggest the Trump administration has made no effort to renegotiate the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon dioxide, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect  on the atmosphere of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions. Countries agreed to: Keep global temperatures ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between 2050 and 2100 Review each country's contribution to cutting emissions every five years so they scale up to the challenge Enable rich countries to help poorer nations by providing ""climate finance"" to adapt to climate change and switch to renewable energy Why does keeping global warming to 1.5C matter?

"Sir Lindsay Hoyle elected as Commons SpeakerHe pledges to be a ""neutral"" Speaker and pays tribute to daughter, Natalie, who died in 2017.UK Politics","This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle was dragged to the chair after his election after four rounds of voting. Labour MP and deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected by MPs as the new Commons Speaker, after John Bercow stepped down. After winning the final round of voting against Chris Bryant, Sir Lindsay was dragged to the chair by MPs, where he pledged to be a ""neutral"" Speaker. He also paid tribute to his daughter, Natalie, who died in 2017, saying she would ""always be missed"". The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. Speakers must be politically impartial, which means Sir Lindsay will be required to resign from the Labour Party in order to carry out his role. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. Seven candidates were originally in the running to succeed Mr Bercow, including former minister and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and former Labour minister Meg Hillier. Who is the new Commons Speaker? John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? In the fourth and final round of voting, Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - received 325 votes to Labour MP Chris Bryant's 213. Sir Lindsay, who is the MP for his home constituency of Chorley, in Lancashire, told MPs that ""this House will change, but it will change for the better"" and he said he would be a ""transparent"" Speaker. He also thanked his staff and family and paid tribute to his daughter, saying: ""There is one person who is not here; my daughter Natalie. I wish she could have been here. She was everything to all of us."" Sir Lindsay's 28-year-old daughter Natalie Lewis-Hoyle was found dead at her home in Essex in December 2017. This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle promised to ensure all MPs were heard Paying tribute to the new Speaker, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was sure Sir Lindsay would ""stick up"" for backbenchers and show his ""signature kindness and reasonableness"" in the chair. ""Mr Speaker, in congratulating you on your election I observe that you have prevailed over an extremely strong field and that every other candidate earlier on spoke forcibly and well,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And Mr Speaker, over the years I have observed that you have many good qualities, and I'm sure you will stick up for backbenchers in the way that you have proposed, and I'm sure that you will adhere to a strict Newtonian concept of time in PMQs."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sir Lindsay he would need eyes in the back of his head in his new role. He said Sir Lindsay had taken the welfare of Commons staff and MPs ""very, very seriously"" and would continue to do so. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Sir Lindsay had ""always taken great care"" of MPs, and welcomed his pledge to take the welfare of Commons staff seriously. She also said she hoped he would continue the modernisation of Parliament. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds also congratulated Sir Lindsay, saying the Commons was ""looking for a breath of fresh air"". The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked.

"Cuadrilla hopes to overturn fracking suspensionThe energy company says it hopes to ""address concerns"" about fracking after a government moratorium.Business","Fracking at Cuadrilla Resources site in Lancashire in August caused a 2.9 magnitude earth tremor Energy company Cuadrilla has said it hopes to ""address concerns"" about fracking so that a moratorium announced by the government can be overturned. At the weekend, ministers called a halt to the practice following research from the Oil and Gas Authority. It raised concerns about the ability to predict fracking-linked earthquakes. But Cuadrilla, which was forced to suspend work at its Preston New Road site after a series of tremors, said it would continue to give regulators data. It said it hoped ""to address concerns so that the moratorium can be lifted"" and that the Bowland gas resource - which stretches across northern England - could be ""further appraised and developed"". Fracking halted after government pulls support On Monday, Business and Energy Secretary Andrea Leadsom confirmed the ""effective moratorium"" in a written statement to the House of Commons. She said it would be ""maintained until compelling new evidence is provided which addresses the concerns around the prediction and management of induced seismicity"". However, the government is under pressure to make the ban permanent, amid concerns ministers - who have previously been supportive of fracking - are using it as an election ploy. Fracking is a process in which liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture shale rock and release gas or oil trapped within it. Assessment by the British Geological Survey in 2013 suggested there were enough resources in the Bowland resource across northern England to potentially provide up to 50 years of current gas demand. Local communities and environmental groups have protested against fracking Others, however, have questioned these findings. Previously the government said shale development would provide opportunities for jobs and investment, and could play a ""key role"" in maintaining energy security. But the industry has faced fierce opposition from both communities and environmental groups, at a time when there is growing concern about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It is not impossible, however, that the current moratorium could be lifted. Fracking previously faced a moratorium during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government that was overturned after just one year.

"'Disturbing' lead levels in Canadian waterSome cities show lead levels ""similar"" to the notorious case of Flint, Michigan.","The amount of lead in the water supply of major Canadian cities exceeded safe levels in hundreds of thousands of homes, a major investigation has found. Some areas showed lead levels ""similar"" to those in the US city of Flint, Michigan, during its 2015 water crisis. Out of 12,000 samples taken from 2014 to 2018, one third exceeded the national safety guideline of 5 parts per billion (ppb). Canada has the third-largest per-capita fresh water reserve in the world. Lead contamination has been linked with low IQ in children, hypertension and heart disease. The year-long work was conducted by 120 journalists, from 10 media outlets and nine universities,in partnership with the Institute for Investigative Journalism.,external Investigators gathered the results of 12,000 tests carried out between 2014 and 2018 in 11 cities. While a third exceeded the safe limit of 5ppb, 18% were over the US limit of 15ppb. Among the areas studied were Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada (population 1.75m), and Oakville, an affluent part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Regina, the capital of the prairie province of Saskatchewan, and the city of Prince Rupert, in northern British Columbia, were also included.

"'Disturbing' lead levels in Canadian waterSome cities show lead levels ""similar"" to the notorious case of Flint, Michigan.US & Canada","The amount of lead in the water supply of major Canadian cities exceeded safe levels in hundreds of thousands of homes, a major investigation has found. Some areas showed lead levels ""similar"" to those in the US city of Flint, Michigan, during its 2015 water crisis. Out of 12,000 samples taken from 2014 to 2018, one third exceeded the national safety guideline of 5 parts per billion (ppb). Canada has the third-largest per-capita fresh water reserve in the world. Lead contamination has been linked with low IQ in children, hypertension and heart disease. The year-long work was conducted by 120 journalists, from 10 media outlets and nine universities,in partnership with the Institute for Investigative Journalism.,external Investigators gathered the results of 12,000 tests carried out between 2014 and 2018 in 11 cities. While a third exceeded the safe limit of 5ppb, 18% were over the US limit of 15ppb. Among the areas studied were Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada (population 1.75m), and Oakville, an affluent part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Regina, the capital of the prairie province of Saskatchewan, and the city of Prince Rupert, in northern British Columbia, were also included.

"Sir Lindsay Hoyle elected as Commons SpeakerHe pledges to be a ""neutral"" Speaker and pays tribute to daughter, Natalie, who died in 2017.","This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle was dragged to the chair after his election after four rounds of voting. Labour MP and deputy Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected by MPs as the new Commons Speaker, after John Bercow stepped down. After winning the final round of voting against Chris Bryant, Sir Lindsay was dragged to the chair by MPs, where he pledged to be a ""neutral"" Speaker. He also paid tribute to his daughter, Natalie, who died in 2017, saying she would ""always be missed"". The Speaker keeps order in Commons debates and calls MPs to speak. Speakers must be politically impartial, which means Sir Lindsay will be required to resign from the Labour Party in order to carry out his role. Mr Bercow stood down last week after an eventful and frequently controversial decade in the Speaker's chair. His resignation as MP for Buckingham was officially confirmed on Monday. Seven candidates were originally in the running to succeed Mr Bercow, including former minister and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman and former Labour minister Meg Hillier. Who is the new Commons Speaker? John Bercow bows out as Commons Speaker What's the role of a Speaker in Parliament? In the fourth and final round of voting, Sir Lindsay - who has been Mr Bercow's senior deputy for years - received 325 votes to Labour MP Chris Bryant's 213. Sir Lindsay, who is the MP for his home constituency of Chorley, in Lancashire, told MPs that ""this House will change, but it will change for the better"" and he said he would be a ""transparent"" Speaker. He also thanked his staff and family and paid tribute to his daughter, saying: ""There is one person who is not here; my daughter Natalie. I wish she could have been here. She was everything to all of us."" Sir Lindsay's 28-year-old daughter Natalie Lewis-Hoyle was found dead at her home in Essex in December 2017. This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle promised to ensure all MPs were heard Paying tribute to the new Speaker, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was sure Sir Lindsay would ""stick up"" for backbenchers and show his ""signature kindness and reasonableness"" in the chair. ""Mr Speaker, in congratulating you on your election I observe that you have prevailed over an extremely strong field and that every other candidate earlier on spoke forcibly and well,"" Mr Johnson said. ""And Mr Speaker, over the years I have observed that you have many good qualities, and I'm sure you will stick up for backbenchers in the way that you have proposed, and I'm sure that you will adhere to a strict Newtonian concept of time in PMQs."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Sir Lindsay he would need eyes in the back of his head in his new role. He said Sir Lindsay had taken the welfare of Commons staff and MPs ""very, very seriously"" and would continue to do so. Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Sir Lindsay had ""always taken great care"" of MPs, and welcomed his pledge to take the welfare of Commons staff seriously. She also said she hoped he would continue the modernisation of Parliament. DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds also congratulated Sir Lindsay, saying the Commons was ""looking for a breath of fresh air"". The role of the Speaker has come under increasing scrutiny over the past few years - and Mr Bercow has been both praised for boosting the influence of backbench MPs and criticised for stretching parliamentary rules. Some have also accused him of not being impartial when it comes to Brexit. The Speaker is responsible for choosing which amendments can be voted on -a power that has proved particularly significant in the Brexit process. He is also in charge of upholding parliamentary rules, and Mr Bercow twice angered some MPs by refusing to allow the government to hold another vote on an already rejected Brexit deal. The Speaker can also permit MPs to ask urgent questions whereby government ministers are summoned to the House of Commons over a time-sensitive or important matter. During his years in the role, Mr Bercow dramatically increased the number of urgent questions asked.

'Why I want to sue Asda over new contract',"Duncan Carson is taking advice from his union after rejecting the new terms Duncan Carson has just lost his job as a baker at an Asda store near Stoke, but he is preparing to put up a fight. He is among the Asda workers who have been sacked after refusing to sign up to new contracts, but he aims to take the supermarket to an employment tribunal. ""I think someone should stand up to them,"" he said. ""What is the point in having a contract if they can unilaterally change it?"" Asda gave its workers until midnight on Saturday to agree to new terms, which include unpaid breaks, changes to night shift payments and being called to work at shorter notice. The supermarket said 120,000 workers had agreed to the deal, and that fewer than 300 had yet to sign up to the new contract. But Mr Carson, who has worked for Asda for 13 years, said the new contract was ""unacceptable"". ""I have an appointment with my union officer on Thursday to start the process,"" he said. He usually works from 06:00 until noon as a baker, which he says suits him as he is used to working mornings. The new contract means he can be asked to work any hours from 05:00 until midnight. The move will destroy trust in the business, he says. While the new terms stipulate that Asda must give four weeks' notice of new shift patterns, ""what will stop them changing it again?"" he asks. Asda has extended its deadline to accept the new term by a week, meaning workers who return can do so on the new terms. Those who do not will remain sacked, however. ""We have been clear that we do not want anyone to leave us as a result of this necessary change and so we have written to the fewer than 300 colleagues who have not signed the contract to offer a little more time to sign up and continue to work with us, should they wish,"" the company said. It added that it had always been clear that it understood people had responsibilities outside of work and would ""always help them to balance these with their work life"". Asda workers are 'terrified for their jobs' Asda's contract changes are 'just not fair' Neil Derrick, GMB regional officer for Yorkshire and North Derbyshire, said his union would offer advice on what legal challenges his members can mount. ""We are working with every individual member with a view to lodging a claim,"" he said, which might be based on unfair dismissal, sex discrimination or potentially disability discrimination. Many Asda workers are women who are on part-time contracts to fit in with looking after family members, he added. ""This new contract completely turns that on its head,"" he said. However, Sarah Crowther, a barrister at Outer Temple Chambers, noted that other retailers had made similar contract changes and that they were perfectly legal. She said employees that refused to accept the changes had two potential ways to make a claim: unfair dismissal or indirect discrimination. ""Those with two years of qualifying employment could bring a claim for unfair dismissal. In that situation it would depend on whether the tribunal was satisfied that there was a good business reason and that procedurally everything had been done with adequate consultation,"" she told the BBC's Today Programme. Ms Crowther added that people ""disproportionately affected"" by the change such as ""those less able to accommodate the flexibility... might have a case, but then it would be open to an employer to justify that"". Last week, Leeds-based Asda said it was increasing its hourly pay rates. The supermarket said it would raise its basic rate for its hourly-paid retail employees to Â£9.18 an hour from 1 April next year, following an increase to Â£9 from 3 November. In London, which has an additional allowance to reflect the higher cost of living, basic pay will increase to Â£10.31 an hour. The retailer, owned by Walmart, acknowledged that the announcement for April pay rises had come earlier that usual.

Domestic abuse 'biggest child protection threat',"Domestic violence, family conflict and drink and drug abuse are the biggest drivers of the rise in child-protection cases in England, says the Local Government Association (LGA). The organisation representing English councils has surveyed the councillors in charge of children's services about the causes of a 53% rise in child-protection cases over the past decade. More than 80% identified domestic violence and substance misuse as being behind the increased numbers in their local authorities. An average of 88 children are taken into care each day and the LGA asked the lead councillors for children's services for their view of the most common causes. The behaviour of adults around children - in the form of domestic violence, drinking and drug taking - was the most frequent explanation for councils having to intervene to protect 18,000 more children than a decade ago. This was followed by factors such as poverty, housing problems and debt. Domestic violence killings reach five-year high School admissions to help domestic violence families Domestic abuse: 'Children are hidden victims' Figures published last week by the Department for Education showed 52,000 child-protection plans, identifying how to deal with children considered to be at risk, had been drawn up - a slight annual decline against a significant long-term increase. These figures also showed domestic violence to be the most common factor for so-called ""children in need"" - much more so than issues such as abuse, gangs, trafficking or anti-social behaviour. There are almost 400,000 ""children in need"" where there are concerns about their health or development and where they are at risk of being ""significantly impaired"" without extra support. After domestic violence, the most common underlying problems are mental health issues, emotional abuse, drug and alcohol abuse. Physical abuse, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation were all lower than the previous year. But numbers of serious cases investigating fears of children suffering or facing ""significant harm"" have continued to climb. There were more than 200,000 of these safeguarding inquiries - rising every year from 127,000 in 2012-13. The Local Government Association is warning of the financial pressures on councils. ""Funding pressures are coinciding with huge increases in demand for support because of problems like hardship and family conflict,"" said Judith Blake, chairwoman of the LGA's children and young people board.

Wife and lover guilty of farmer's murder,"Angela Taylor and Paul Cannon sent explicit text messages about killing her estranged husband William Taylor The estranged wife of a wealthy farmer has been found guilty of murdering him. Angela Taylor and her partner Paul Cannon shared ""a venomous hatred"" for William Taylor as he would not divorce her, St Albans Crown Court heard. The 69-year-old's skeletal remains were found waist-deep in mud by a passing fisherman near Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in February, eight months after he was reported missing. Taylor and Cannon were both convicted of murder and arson. The pair will be sentenced on Friday and Judge Michael Kay QC told them: ""There is only once sentence that can be passed and it will be a life sentence."" Gwyn Griffiths, 60, who was a colleague of Cannon and from Folkestone, Kent, was cleared of conspiracy to murder. Mr Taylor was reported missing by his lodger on 4 June 2018. Several days before he went missing his Land Rover was set on fire. DNA found in the torched car matched that of Cannon. William Taylor was reported missing by his lodger on 4 June Taylor, 53, and Cannon, 54, fantasised about killing Mr Taylor, who was known as Bill, in explicit messages sent to each other on WhatsApp, their trial heard. Messages read in court spoke about ""the best way"" to kill the farmer and hurt his family. They included references to pickaxes, chainsaws and barbed wire. Various scenarios were discussed in the messages and Taylor described them as ""a turn-on"". On the night Mr Taylor disappeared, Cannon sent a message which said: ""Just watching Kill Bill 2 lol."" Cannon told police officers: ""Messages between Angela and me related to no more than fantasy and banter of an extreme nature."" Angela Taylor said she had sent the messages ""out of frustration"" as Mr Taylor was ""getting on her nerves"". Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Price QC said: ""It will become apparent that he and she shared and encouraged in each other in a venomous hatred for William Taylor. They loathed him."" Experts told the court that it was impossible to determine a cause of death because Mr Taylor's body was so badly decomposed. The farmer was still wearing his boots and blue overalls when his remains were found. The defence argued Mr Taylor probably died after getting ""stuck in mud"" and might have gone to the area for a picnic. Forensic pathologist Dr Charlotte Randall said there was no sign of blunt force injuries, no gunshot or stab wounds and no evidence of toxic substances. But the court heard there was a ""possible fracture"" to the hyoid bone in the neck, which could have been due to compression.

'Disturbing' lead contamination in Canadian water,"The amount of lead in the water supply of major Canadian cities exceeded safe levels in hundreds of thousands of homes, a major investigation has found. Some areas showed lead levels ""similar"" to those in the US city of Flint, Michigan, during its 2015 water crisis. Out of 12,000 samples taken from 2014 to 2018, one third exceeded the national safety guideline of 5 parts per billion (ppb). Canada has the third-largest per-capita fresh water reserve in the world. Lead contamination has been linked with low IQ in children, hypertension and heart disease. The year-long work was conducted by 120 journalists, from 10 media outlets and nine universities,in partnership with the Institute for Investigative Journalism.,external Investigators gathered the results of 12,000 tests carried out between 2014 and 2018 in 11 cities. While a third exceeded the safe limit of 5ppb, 18% were over the US limit of 15ppb. Among the areas studied were Montreal, the second-largest city in Canada (population 1.75m), and Oakville, an affluent part of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Regina, the capital of the prairie province of Saskatchewan, and the city of Prince Rupert, in northern British Columbia, were also included. Finding a solution to Canada's Indigenous water crisis Is this the world's purest water? Results found in some cities were ""conspicuously similar to Flint,"",externalaccording to the Toronto Star, based on average lead levels found using comparable testing methods. Reporters also tested the drinking water in older homes in 32 cities across the country, taking samples from residents who volunteered. Out of 260 homes sampled, about 39% exceeded the current federal guideline. ""It's a little bit disturbing to see that there's that much,"" Andrew Keddietold the Associated Press, one of the media outlets participating in the investigation.,external Mr Keddie's water tested at 28ppb, more than five times the recommended limit. The biggest source of lead in Canada's drinking water is antiquated pipes and public service lines that connect people's homes to the main water supply.A government report from 2017 estimated that about 500,000 homes across the country were affected.,external Tests are done differently across the country, and sometimes are not done at all, the journalistic investigation revealed. ""I'm shocked, I'm disappointed, I'm angry,""MichÃ¨le PrÃ©vost, a Quebec engineering professor specialising in drinking water lead levels, told the Toronto Star,external, one of the media outlets involved in the investigation. ""The one thing that's really missing across Canada is transparency."" The story was first proposed by Toronto Star journalist Robert Cribb, who said his interest was piqued after testing the water in his own home several years ago and finding the lead levels high. ""This is a far, far bigger issue than any one journalist or one organisation can tackle,"" he told the BBC. ""It's an insidious problem that's buried in the ground from coast to coast to coast."" Leaders from the province of Quebec and the city of Montreal have vowed to take action. Quebec premier FranÃ§ois Legault promised to change how the province measures lead in drinking water, and will follow Health Canada's guidelines regarding the acceptable amount. The province's current limit is 10 ppb - twice as high as federal guidelines. Patti Sonntag, director of the Institute for Investigative Journalism at Concordia University, said the project revealed a ""patchwork"" of drinking water standards across the country. Canada has 20% of the world's freshwater supply ""There needs to be a discussion about whether there should be a minimum drinking water standard nationwide,"" she told the BBC. Canada is one of the few developed nations not to have such a standard. Instead, Health Canada has a recommended guideline, and it is mostly up to the provinces and municipalities to set their own regulations, the investigation revealed. The exception would be on indigenous reserves under the control of the federal government. There are currently57 long-term drinking water advisories affecting indigenous communities,externalacross the country, according to Indigenous Services Canada. In the US, where a water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2015 sparked congressional hearings and several lawsuits, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is supposed to notify citizens of the results of lead-testing on their drinking water, and much of the information is made public. ""None of that is true in Canada,"" Ms Sonntag said. US prosecutors drop charges in Flint water case Shocking scale of US drinking water crisis.

Man jailed for kicking and killing gull,"A driver witnessed Andrew Lee Jones kicking the gull before finding it dead A man has been jailed for kicking and killing a gull. A driver witnessed Andrew Lee Jones, 38, from Tonypandy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, kicking the bird before finding it dead in the town on 1 May. An RSPCA appeal resulted in CCTV showing the incident being provided by the council.Â Jones pleaded guilty to one offence under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and was sentenced to 12 weeks at Merthyr Magistrates' Court on Friday. RSPCA inspector Simon Evans thanked the witness for coming forward, adding: ""This horrific incident was also caught on CCTV where the defendant was seen kicking the bird and using his foot to direct it into a corner of the car park. ""The bird had sustained other injuries before this attack - however, a post-mortem examination found that it would have been the blunt trauma injuries from the defendant's kick that would have been the most likely cause of death. ""There is no excuse for this kind of deliberate cruelty."" Jones was also ordered to pay a victim surcharge of Â£115. Does the UK have a seagull problem?
