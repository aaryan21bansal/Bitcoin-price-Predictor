Three powerful earthquakes rattle New Zealand,"People wait on higher ground on Great Barrier Island amid the tsunami alert Three earthquakes, including one of the strongest ever to hit the region, struck off the coast of New Zealand on Friday, triggering tsunami warnings that have now been stood down. Thousands were evacuated from some coastal areas of the North Island after the third, 8.1-magnitude quake struck. There were reports of traffic gridlock as people tried to reach higher ground. The national tsunami warning was lifted at 15:43 (02:43 GMT), some 13 hours after the first quake. Some wave surges hit parts of the coast but, by Friday afternoon, authorities said the largest waves had passed. Residents were told they could return home but were warned to stay off beaches. This video can not be played New Zealand: ""What happens if there is another earthquake?"" The South Pacific archipelagos of New Caledonia and Vanuatu have been warned to prepare for dangerous waves. Their coasts could see wave surges as high as 3m (10ft), while parts of South America - including Peru, Ecuador and Chile - were warned they could see 1m waves reaching their coasts. The Hawaii-basedPacific Tsunami Warning Center said ""tsunami waves have been observed"",external, but as yet no damage had been reported. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern posted on Instagram: ""Hope everyone is ok out there."" The three earthquakes, all above 7.0 magnitude, came during the early hours of Friday. The last, at 8.1, struck at around 08:30 near the uninhabited Kermadec Islands, 1,000 km (621 miles) north-east of New Zealand. While earlier tsunami warnings had been called off, the third quake prompted the National Emergency Management Agency to send out a new alert and tsunami sirens sounded in some areas.

The agency told people near the coast in several areas to move immediately to high ground or get inland as far as possible. It said ""strong and unusual currents and unpredictable surges"" with tsunami activity continuing for several hours. Local media reported gridlock in towns such as Whangarei and Whakatane as people tried to flee their homes, schools and workplaces. In nearby Ohope town, resident Leslie Peake was quoted by the New Zealand Herald as saying the traffic was ""bumper to bumper"" with ""huge queues of people evacuating"". New Zealand's civil defence department advised people to walk or cycle to avoid getting caught in traffic Meanwhile local media posted footage of waves rolling into Tokomaru Bay.

Just last week, New Zealand marked the 10th anniversary of the 6.3 magnitude earthquake that destroyed parts of Christchurch in the south Island, killing 185 people. Tsunami warnings were also issued for Hawaii and American Samoa, but later stood down. Patrick Ti'a Reid, 37, was among those in American Samoa, situated some 3,300 km (2,000 miles) north-east of New Zealand, who had been told to evacuate to higher ground in an emergency bulletin. ""Alarms went off in our executive office building and we immediately took for higher ground,"" Mr Ti'a Reid, who works for the government in the US territory, told the BBC. He said thetsunami of 2009,external, which was triggered by an 8.1-magnitude earthquake, was ""very much vivid in many Samoans' minds"". Are you in the region?

EU legal action imminent over UK extensions,"The UK has now said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks on parcels as well as agri-foods The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said that legal action is imminent over the UK's move to unilaterally extend grace periods on Irish Sea border checks. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ told the Financial Times that ""infringement proceedings"" are being prepared. He said: ""We are currently preparing it and it would be really something coming to our table very soon."" The EU has two legal avenues open to it under the Brexit deals. Under the NI part of the Brexit deal, the Protocol, it can launch infringement proceedings which could lead to a case at the European Court of Justice It took this action at the time when the UK threatened to breach the NI deal through the Internal Market Bill. In that case the legal proceedings were overtaken by political agreement. The EU could also seek arbitration under the terms of the wider EU-UK trade deal. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? Earlier on Thursday, the UK government extended another of the Irish Sea border grace periods, this time for parcels. It came a day after the UK extended grace periods for checks on agri-foods,a move the EU said was illegal. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. The first of these periods was to expire at the end of March; the UK saysthey will be extended until October,external. All parcels entering Northern Ireland would have required customs declarations from 1 April. The logistics industry said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration. The UK has said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks The government says the grace period for business-to-business deliveries will be extended until 1 October. For all other deliveries, for example businesses to consumers, businesses will be given six months to prepare for new arrangements from the date those arrangements are announced. In a protest against the UK's unilateral changes, the European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote to ratify the EU-UK Brexit deal. EU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the UK's move amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" ofthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks. He said progress had been made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's moves could not be worse. But UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and ""eminently solvable"". Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market. The DUP leader accused the Irish government of ignoring unionist concerns over the NI Protocol. But her deputy first minister, Sinn FÃ©in's Vice-President Michelle O'Neill, accused the British government of ""acting in bad faith"" over the protocol. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the grace period extensions were aimed at helping consumers and businesses in Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU needed to adapt its timeframe to fit the supply chain requirements of supermarkets and businesses. ""If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time,"" he said during a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday. The Northern Ireland Protocolis the part of the Brexit deal aimed at ensuring there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Over 900 million tonnes of food wasted each year,"More than 900 million tonnes of food is thrown away every year, according to a global report. TheUN Environment Programme,external's Food Waste Index revealed that 17% of the food available to consumers - in shops, households and restaurants - goes directly into the bin. Some 60% of that waste is in the home. The lockdown appears to have had a surprising impact - at least in the UK - by reducing domestic food waste. TV cook, Bake Off winner and food writer Nadiya Hussain has joined the campaign against kitchen waste Sustainability charityWrap,external, the UN's partner organisation on this report, says people have been planning their shopping and their meals more carefully. And in an effort to build on that, well-known chefs have been enlisted to inspire less wasteful kitchen habits. The report has highlighted a global problem that is ""much bigger than previously estimated,"" Richard Swannell from Wrap told BBC News. ""The 923 million tonnes of food being wasted each year would fill 23 million 40-tonne trucks. Bumper-to-bumper, enough to circle the Earth seven times."" It is an issue previously considered to be a problem almost exclusive to richer countries - with consumers simply buying more than they could eat - but this research found ""substantial"" food waste ""everywhere it looked"". There are gaps in the findings that could reveal how the scale of the problem varies in low- and high-income countries. The report, for example, could not distinguish between ""involuntary"" and ""voluntary"" waste. ""We haven't looked deeper [at this issue] but in low-income countries, the cold chain is not fully assured because of lack of access to energy,"" Martina Otto from Unep told BBC News. The data to distinguish between the waste of edible food and inedible parts - like bones and shells - was only available for high-income countries. Lower-income countries, Ms Otto pointed out, were likely to be wasting much less edible food. There is likely to be far less voluntary food waste in low-income countries But the end result, she said, was that the world was ""just throwing away all the resources used to make that food"". Ahead of major global climate and biodiversity summits later this year, Unep executive director Inger Andersen is pushing for countries to commit to combatting waste - halving it by 2030. ""If we want to get serious about tackling climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste, businesses, governments and citizens around the world have to do their part to reduce food waste,"" she said. Richard Swannell pointed out: ""Wasted food is responsible for 8-10% of greenhouse gas emissions, so if food waste was a country, it would be the third-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases on the planet."" Plan your portions and buy the right amount: a mug should hold the right amount of uncooked rice for four adults, and you can measure a single portion of spaghetti using a 1p or Â£1 coin; Cool your fridge down: the average UK fridge temperature is almost 7Â°C. It should be lower than 5Â°C; Understand date labels: aÂ ""use by""Â date is about foodÂ safety. If the use by date has passed, youshould noteat or serve it, even if it looks and smells okay. If something is getting close to the use by date, you can freeze it.Â A ""best before""Â date is aboutÂ quality. In the UK, the average household could save Â£700 per year, according to Wrap research, by buying only the food they ate. Throwing away food can also mean that resources used to grow it have been wasted Where food waste is voluntary, the Covid-19 lockdown appears to have had the surprising effect of revealing precisely how it can be remedied. According to research by Wrap, planning, careful storage and batch-cooking during the lockdown reduced people's reported levels of food waste by 22% compared with 2019. We're worse with food waste than we think What do you do with 86 tonnes of celeriac? How safe are takeaways and supermarket deliveries? ""Being confined to our homes has resulted in an increase in behaviours such as batch cooking and meal planning,"" the charity said. ""But the latest insights suggest that food waste levels are likely to rise again as we emerge from lockdown."" In an effort to avoid that, well-known cooks and chefs have lent their names and social media profiles to the campaign against kitchen waste. British TV cook Nadiya Hussain is working with Wrap and offering tips and leftovers recipes via Instagram. And Italian restaurateur Massimo Bottura, chef patron of Modena eatery Osteria Francescana, which has three Michelin stars, has been appointed Unep goodwill ambassador ""in the fight against food waste and loss"". Throughout the lockdown in Italy, his family produced an online cooking show calledÂ Kitchen Quarantine, encouraging people to ""see the invisible potential"" in every ingredient. This video can not be played What's causing Britain's food waste? While millions of tonnes of food was thrown away, an estimated 690 million people were affected by hunger in 2019. That number is expected to rise sharply in the wake of the pandemic. Ms Andersen pointed out that tackling waste ""would cut greenhouse gas emissions, slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution, enhance the availability of food and thus reduce hunger and save money at a time of global recession"".

Stormont leaders at odds over UK-EU protocol row,"The UK has said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks DUP leader Arlene Foster has accused the Irish government of ""ignoring"" unionist concerns over the NI Protocol. It comes after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks. On Wednesday, Number 10 saidit would unilaterally extend grace periodsfor Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law. But Sinn FÃ©in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said it was the British government ""acting in bad faith"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and could be solved. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? The first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October. Earlier, Mr Coveney said progress was being made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's move could not be worse. But Mrs Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference that the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market. ""It was clear last week that the European Commission was not listening to what was going on in Northern Ireland, there was a need to act,"" she added. ""I have to say Simon Coveney should reflect on his comments, he's not listening to the unionist people of Northern Ireland, he's ignoring them, hoping we'll go away - well we'll not go away."" She said the British government had indicated a ""step-change"" in its approach to dealing with the protocol, but that the DUP would continue to press for an alternative to be drawn up. But Ms O'Neill, Stormont's Deputy First Minister and Mrs Foster's power-sharing partner, said the British government had shown it was ""not true to their word when it comes to negotiations"". ""In this case I believe they're on the wrong side of public opinion and international law,"" she added. ""The action was completely unnecessary, what the British government has done is another solo run."" She said she believed negotiations on resolving protocol issues should continue through the UK-EU joint committee, which is scheduled to meet again before the end of March. Simon Coveney said progress was being made over the Northern Ireland Protocol However, speaking during a visit to Middlesbrough, the prime minister said: ""We're taking some temporary technical measures to ensure there are no barriers in the Irish Sea, to make sure things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect. ""I'm sure that with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable."" Later, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was about ""doing the right thing for consumers and businesses"" in NI. ""Sadly the EU hasn't been able to work on a timeframe that works for the supply lines of, for example supermarkets, so we had to make a decision to ensure that we could see a continued flow of products and that supermarkets' supply lines could continue to flow,"" he said. ""If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time. The European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote on the EU-UK trade deal in protest at what the EU sees as the UK's unilateral changes. EU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday. Mr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar, who is Ireland's tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), said the UK's actions were neither the way a friend, nor ""a respectable, honourable country"", should behave. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saidthe EU's recent move to trigger Article 16showed ""very clearly that it remains within their remit to take unilateral action to protect the EU's single market"". ""Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK Government has the same power - to act unilaterally to protect the integrity of the UK internal market and trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. The EU reversed its Article 16 move within hours of taking the action, followingcondemnation from Belfast, London and Dublin. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ later described the move as a mistake which had been made in the ""intensity of the moment"" oftrying to secure Covid-19 vaccines,external. The move by the UK government to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks put Ireland in an uncomfortable position. Mr Coveney said Ireland was lobbying at the EU level to obtain easements on trade between GB and Northern Ireland. Other Irish MEPs have written to the European Commission calling for an extension. But there will be other member states who will be reluctant to offer any concessions if the UK is going to ride rough-shod over the process. So what could be the end game? The two sides will continue negotiating. The EU says it is looking at legal avenues open to it under both the withdrawal agreement and the wider UK-EU agreement. However, the UK may question what practical steps the EU will really take if grace periods are extended. The UK statement on Wednesday indicated the extra time gained by an extension of the grace period could be used to develop systems to ease trade between GB and NI in the long term. The UK was also at pains to say it is not walking away from the protocol, it is simply finding ways to implement it. On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the UK's move to extend grace periods amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" of the NI Protocol. He said the EU would respond in accordance with the ""legal means"" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal. Following a call on Wednesday evening between Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said ""official-level notification"" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week. Lord Frost had underlined the extension was needed for ""operational reasons"" and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith"", said a government spokesman. Further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from Britain to Northern Ireland. That is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations. The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

'I held my pregnancy bump to keep it from stabber',"This video can not be played 'We all thought my unborn child had passed away' On 3 March 2016, Natalie Queiroz shared a picture on social media of her rapidly growing baby bump. She was eight months pregnant and looking forward to the birth of her daughter and life with partner Babur ""Bobby"" Raja. Twenty-four hours later she was being flown by air ambulance to hospital. She had been stabbed more than 20 times, and paramedics feared for the lives of both her and her unborn child. Ahead of the fifth anniversary of the attack, I met Natalie at the scene - Trinity Hill in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. Her hands were shaking and she described being back as ""really, really tough"", adding: ""To think this could have been the final place I would have been [alive]."" Revisiting the scene has become part of how she has dealt with the trauma. Natalie, 45, remembers most of what happened vividly.  It was raining, she had her coat pulled up and was holding an umbrella as she walked towards the town centre. Her mind was on shopping. ""I just remember these footsteps running behind me,"" she said. She feared she was about to be mugged, but felt she was safe because she was such a short distance from the shops, and, as it was 15:00, there were plenty of people about. That's when her attacker jumped her from behind and began stabbing her. She desperately held on to her bump to try to protect her baby, but described the attack as ""incessant"". Two men intervened and tried to drag the attacker off her, incurring injuries themselves. Natalie didn't know who the knifeman was. Raja, her partner, had disguised his appearance and had a hood covering his face. She told me that she caught a glimpse and thought it was him, but then disregarded the idea. Babur Raja was disguised when he unleashed a stab attack on pregnant partner Natalie Queiroz As the others fought with Raja, Natalie tried to escape. Despite bleeding heavily she managed to get to her feet and stagger away. ""I was looking at the town centreâ¦ and I remember thinking 'I've just got to get there, because if I can get there, I can get help'."" Her wounds were too severe and she collapsed next to a wall and passed out. ""The two guys who'd been holding the attacker said they thought that I'd gone - they thought that that was it, that I had died."" Raja managed to fight off the other men and came at Natalie again just as she regained consciousness. ""I put my head down and he pulled up in front of me, and he crouched down and he began the attack again."" Natalie doesn't remember much of what happened next. A third rescuer, Callum Gibson, had run up Trinity Hill and joined the other men, John Mitchell and Anthony Smith, in finally stopping Raja's attack. West Midlands Police officers arrived to help, and closed nearby roads to allow an air ambulance to land. Natalie had suffered eleven chest wounds, her right lung had collapsed and she had also been stabbed in the liver and uterus. Paramedics stabilised her as she was taken to hospital. Natalie had regained consciousness again, but there seemed to be little hope for her child. ""To be honest, we all thought she'd passed away,"" she said. Natalie underwent lifesaving surgery and was put into an induced coma. It was only when she came round that she was given the news her daughter had survived and had been safely delivered by Caesarean section. ""To get that news, that she was alive, was almost incomprehensible."" In June 2016, Raja pleaded guilty at Birmingham Crown Court to attempted murder and was jailed for 18 years. During the hearing, at which Natalie was present, the court heard he attacked her after being forced to choose between his conservative Muslim mother's faith and the ""love of his life"". This, it was said, had ""tipped him over the edge"". Raja is serving an 18-year prison sentence A court order remains in place meaning that Natalie's daughter cannot be named. On Thursday, the family has been celebrating her fifth birthday. It will be impossible to keep the full details of the story from the little girl forever. As she grows up, Natalie is gradually explaining to her what happened, but she doesn't know everything yet. ""She's a funny little girl with a big heart... she knows that mummy got hurt the day she was born, she knows it was very serious, and that mummy went in a helicopter... she knows that because of what happened she had to be born that day."" Latest news from the West Midlands Stab attack mum meets fiancÃ© through charity work Natalie is amazingly upbeat despite what happened. She still suffers physically because of some of her wounds, but jokes that her breast implants saved her life. She has also visited Raja in prison despite being warned against it. She said it was a cathartic experience. ""I needed to face him and I needed to look him in the eye."" However he still wouldn't fully acknowledge what happened. He has also sent her letters in which he said he was ""proud"" of the way she had dealt with the attack. She sees this as an attempt at controlling behaviour. Natalie Queiroz is set to marry Simon Lyttle after the end of Covid restrictions I asked her whether she ever thought she would be able to achieve closure. ""Anyone who's been through a major trauma will say you never get over it, you learn to live with it and it becomes part of your life. I've dealt with it by all my fundraising and talking to young people about the reality of knife crimeâ¦ to me that's the best way of coming to terms with everything."" Natalie's positivity is clear in the work she's undertaken since the attack. She has already raised tens of thousands of pounds for Midlands Air Ambulance and is to walk the 140 miles between its three bases in four days as soon as it is possible. She also has something else to look forward to. Last year she got engaged to Simon Lyttle, a fellow fundraiser, and once lockdown is over they will be married.

US suspends tariffs on single malt Scotch whisky,"The US has agreed to suspend tariffs on UK goods including single malt whiskies that were imposed in retaliation over subsidies to the aircraft maker Airbus. Tariffs will also be lifted on UK cheese, cashmere and machinery. The duties will be suspended for four months while the two sides seek a long-term settlement. On 1 January, the UK dropped its own tariffs on some US goods, put in place over a related dispute about US subsidies to Boeing. It is the latest twist in a decades-old trade row that has seen the EU and the US target billions of dollars worth of each other's exports with taxes. The UK is part of the dispute as a former EU member. Airbus makes wings and other parts in the UK, but assembles its commercial aircraft in the EU. EU imposes tariffs on US goods in Boeing row US set to impose tariffs on $7.5bn of EU exports It has hit Scotch whisky producers particularly hard as the US is a key export market. Distilleries havereported Â£500m of lossessince 2019 due to the tariffs. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the trade truce, due to come into force on Monday, would boost British business. ""From Scotch whisky distillers to Stilton-makers, the US decision to suspend tariffs on some UK exports today will benefit businesses right across the UK,"" he tweeted. ""Fantastic news as we strengthen the UK-US trading relationship and work to build back better from the pandemic."" Brexit charges: Why is my online shopping more expensive? Post-Brexit trade: 'If you don't speak French, you're stuffed' Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? Simon Cotton, boss of Speyside-based textiles firm Johnston's of Elgin, says he's ""absolutely delighted"" the tariffs have been suspended. The company, which employs 850 people, has been taking a ""25% hit"" on every knitwear product it exports to the US - ""a significant cost"" at a time when Covid and Brexit also pose challenges. In Speyside many other businesses have felt the impact of the US tariffs, including whisky distilleries and shortbread makers. ""This has been a particularly difficult tax for the businesses here, so it's a huge relief for the region,"" says Mr Cotton. ""We're hoping this paves the way for a permanent removal of these tariffs."" Karen Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, called the suspension ""fabulous news"". ""The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky exports to the US has been doing real damage to Scotch whisky in the 16 months it has been in place, with exports to the US falling by 35%,"" she said. ""So today, everyone in our industry - from small companies to large - is breathing a sigh of relief."" For more than a decade, the EU and US accused each other of propping up their home aviation markets with tax breaks, research grants and other aid. But tensions flared in 2019, when former US president Donald Trump retaliated by putting tariffs on $7.5bn (Â£5.4bn) of EU goods, including UK products such as whisky. Last November, the EU hit back bytargeting $4bn of American goods with dutiesas punishment for US subsidies for Boeing. Since it left the EU, the UK has been lobbying Washington to drop the duties on its goods as it seeks a wide-ranging trade deal with the US. Talks with Washington abruptly broke off in January but resumed after Joe Biden became US president. Mr Biden's top trade nominee, Katherine Tai, has said she will make it a priority to resolve the row with the EU and Britain - although for now US tariffs continue to apply to EU goods. In a joint statement on Thursday, the UK and the US said that the suspension would ""ease the burden on industry and take a bold, joint step towards resolving the longest-running disputes at the World Trade Organization"". The two countries added that it would also allow time to focus on negotiating ""a balanced settlement to the disputes, and begin seriously addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China"". Airbus welcomed the removal of ""lose-lose tariffs"" and urged the UK and US governments to reach a long-term settlement. More than Â£500m-worth of whisky sales have been lost since October 2019, when the 25% tariff was introduced on single malt Scotch. Smaller distillers were hit hardest. The US is the biggest single-nation export market by value. President Trump's US Trade Representative reckoned it was a good source of political leverage in the 17-year trade dispute over aircraft manufacturing. Scottish cashmere sweaters were also targeted. In the political calculation of trade disputes, the US did not include Irish whiskey or Italian cashmere, giving them the opportunity to exploit the rift and grow market share. It was not until last autumn that the European Union and the UK won the right, at the World Trade Organisation, to hit back over Boeing subsidies by US governments. That levelled the field on which to negotiate a resolution. Donald Trump used trade tariffs as a bludgeon intended to protect American jobs, and although Joe Biden is not noted as an enthusiast for globalisation and free trade, this suspension of tariffs signals his administration is in the business of negotiated deals between partners. It acknowledges the trans-Atlantic partners should perhaps focus more on manufacturing competition from China. But there is work to be done: the EU, UK and US have not only the Boeing/Airbus dispute to resolve, but another one over steel and aluminium, which explains the 25% tariff currently on imported American whiskey. For Liz Truss and the UK government's attempts to secure post-Brexit trade deals, this is a significant step forward. It seems the Biden administration is not prioritising the European Union ahead of Britain. However, a UK-US free trade deal is a long way from here.

Tax cut for Scots home buyers will end 'as planned',"A holiday on stamp duty has been extended as part of the Westminster budget - but this will not apply in Scotland A tax cut for Scottish house buyers will end as planned on 1 April, despite an extension in the Westminster budget. The starting point for land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) was increased during the first lockdown. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the move had ""achieved"" its goal of supporting the recovery of the residential property market. The stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland will continue foranother three months. Last year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the tax break on house sales in England and Northern Ireland of up to Â£500,000 as part of his summer statement of measures to respond to the coronavirus crisis. Because housing and residential taxes are devolved to Holyrood, this meant there were calls for Ms Forbes to mirror the stamp duty cut in its Scottish equivalent, LBTT. How does the Westminster Budget affect Scots? Stamp duty holiday extended in England and NI What was set out in the Scottish budget? At the time, Ms Forbes said she had listened to calls and the threshold where the tax kicks in was raised from Â£145,000 to Â£250,000 - although this did not apply to second homes. She announced levels would return to normal at the end of the financial year when she set out theScottish budget in January., saying support would continue for first time buyers. Kate Forbes announced the Scottish budget in January On Wednesday, the chancellor said the tax break in England and Northern Ireland would continue until the end of June. After that, the nil rate band will be set at Â£250,000 - double its standard level - until the end of September. Mr Sunak told MPs the extra move was ""to smooth the transition back to normal - and we will only return to the usual level of Â£125,000 from October 1"". Ms Forbes told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland she intended to ""stick to the original plan"" and end the relief by April. She said: ""It was intended to support the recovery of the residential property market this financial year. ""That has been achieved - the nil rate band was already lower in Scotland and yet we've seen record high levels of transactions and house purchases, so it has achieved its purpose. ""But ultimately, when it comes to tax policy, I have choices and the number one ask from business was to extend the 100% relief for non-domestic rates - that's what I've done alongside freezing council tax to help households in need."" On the Westminster budget, Ms Forbes said ""storm clouds of austerity"" were on the horizon and that despite a number of positive measures including the extension of the furlough scheme, Mr Sunak was ""delaying a lot of the pain until next year"". Mr Sunak said the problems caused by coronavirus were ""not going to be dealt with overnight"" Mr Sunak told the programme that there was an increase of Â£400bn to Â£500bn by end of this Parliament in his public spending plans. He said: ""The damage coronavirus has done to our economy and public finances has been extraordinary and it's going to take time for us to fully recover from this. ""It's not going to be dealt with overnight and that's why we've set out a clear plan that begins to fix the problem and protect the things we care about, like public services and supporting small businesses and crucially supporting our recovery in the short term.""

Wales could open parts of economy before England,"The latest lockdown started in Wales just before Christmas There could be ""opportunities"" to open some of the economy earlier in Wales compared with England, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said he would not want to deny firms the chance to resume trading while he waits ""for somebody else to be in the position we have already arrived at"". He said coronavirus rates in Wales are ""significantly lower"" than in England. Under Welsh plans hairdressers and some shops may reopen on 15 March. That is earlier than England, which does not plan to open hairdressers and non-essential shops until 12 April. However the Welsh government has been criticised for not laying out a more detailed plan for exiting lockdown. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Third Covid wave is inevitable, says top doctor Does Wales have a roadmap out of lockdown? Speaking at the Welsh Affairs Select Committee at Westminster, Mr Drakeford said lifting lockdown restrictions would be ""broadly aligned"" across the whole of the UK and all governments would look to reopen parts of society ""as conditions allow"". He said Wales may be able to ""restore some economic activity earlier than the prime minister's roadmap currently suggests"". ""I wouldn't want to deny businesses in Wales the chance to get back trading because we were waiting for somebody else to be in the position we had already arrived at."" Mr Drakeford,who was speaking to the committee from self-isolationafter coming into contact with someone with Covid-19, also told the committee that his relationship with the prime minister was ""remote"". He said he had only met the prime minister ""once myself"". He said: ""The remoteness isn't just in that way, I'm afraid we rarely have a meeting of minds."" He told the committee that there were some areas where the UK government engagement with Welsh ministers had been ""good"", and there were some places where it ""falls far short of what would be properly expected"". Mr Drakeford said his ""anxiety"" about the lack of regular engagement between the Prime Minister and other parts of the United Kingdom it was that, without that architecture, ""the security of the United Kingdom becomes more difficult"". In response, Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb said Welsh Secretary Simon Hart had described an ""opening of doors"" within UK government to the devolved nations during the pandemic but that this was ""not reciprocated."" Mr Drakeford said he ""wouldn't accept that characterisation"". ""When the UK government is discussing matters in which there are devolved responsibilities at stake, then to greater or lesser extents we get invited to participate in those meetings."" Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, said the first minister should urgently provide a roadmap for reopening businesses, instead of a ""drip, drip of information"" in committees. ""Thousands of livelihoods are on the line so if we can act to save Welsh jobs then Labour ministers should do so,"" he said. What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

Covid jab 'set for even faster delivery rate',"All areas of the UK are moving into the next vaccination phase, to prioritise those aged over 40 A large rise in Covid vaccine supplies means more jabs should be delivered than ever before from next week, Wales' chief pharmacist has said. Andrew Evans has revealed that more than 30,000 doses a day could be administered across the country. Figures suggest one million people are likely to have had at least a first vaccine dose within the coming days. A total of942,017 people in Wales have been given a first jab, while 124,781 have now been given the full course. The four UK nations are aiming tovaccinate all adults by the end of July. Ramping up of deliveries to Wales follows a slowdown during the past fortnight, largely caused by an planned reduction in the Oxford-AstraZeneca supply. Mr Evans, the Welsh government's chief pharmaceutical officer, said supply increases would allow Wales to ""continue to lead"" other UK nations on vaccine roll out, with teams focused on ""keeping it that way"". The acceleration, he said, could also lead to more vaccination centres being opened and, along with GP surgeries, an increasing number of pharmacies being used. If the momentum continues, Mr Evans said he was confident the milestone of offering a first jab to priority groups five to nine could be met by mid-April. He suggested about 20,000 first doses and 10,000 second doses could be offered each day from next week. ""There's capacity within our programme to go as fast as supplies allow,"" he said. ""It's been low for the last couple of weeks but it's significantly higher this week - between 150,000 to 160,000 doses - next week we could be back up to in excess of 200,000 - a capacity we know the NHS vaccination programme here has. ""We've already been building the vaccination infrastructure with at least 500 locations used at any one time and the increasing availability of the AstraZeneca means more flexibility and allow us to use it in more places."" Almost 4% of the population in Wales has been given a second vaccine dose - higher than any other UK nation - and Mr Evans suggested the NHS here could continue to ""lead the pack"". On the issue of whether booster vaccines will be needed, he said there were plans being made for ""various scenarios"". ""We don't yet know how long the duration of protection the two doses will give. If booster doses are needed later in the year or next year then we will have a plan to deliver those,"" he said. Speaking later to BBC Radio Wales, he added that ""very very few people"" were refusing the vaccine. ""Our uptake rate is in excess of 90% for the older groups, in excess of 85% has we come down through those cohorts. There is very little vaccine hesitancy,"" he said. Responding to the increase in pace of delivering jabs, Tracy Meredith, head of mass vaccination at Cardiff and Vale Health board, said ""get ready for the boom"". The health board has plans to open an even bigger mass vaccination centre, although the location is not yet known. ""We're looking at an addition, looking at something bigger, big in scale, a big space. That's a good position to be in,"" she added. There's a quiet efficiency about the process at the mass vaccination centre in Splott, Cardiff. As people arrive, with their all-important appointment cards in hand - they are guided immediately to a booth, where one of about 20 vaccinators is waiting. The centre has capacity to inoculate 20 people every 10 minutes, compared to four people every 15 minutes in the early days. Which means, subject to supply, 1,320 people can get a Covid jab here every day. Student nurses are part of the effort, having been trained to give the vaccine. Beth Reed-Gibbs said she was ""absolutely loving"" being part of the team that offers hope of a way out of the pandemic. ""People getting the vaccine are mainly excited, some were a bit anxious for the first dose but now they know there's nothing to worry about."" Barbera Phythian, another student nurse vaccinator, shares that excitement: ""Some people I've given the vaccine to have been shielding for a year. ""So they are anxious about seeing people for the first time. But it's honestly a relief for them and they are really grateful to us, which is an amazing feeling."" This week, ahead of schedule, the centre has also been giving a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine to health and care workers. They include Kim Nash, an essential worker for Cardiff's children's services, who has had her appointment sooner than she was expecting. ""I was originally booked in for April, so it's great that so many people are coming through... it means extra security for me and my family."" Although ministers have insisted the vaccination effort is not a ""race between nations"" but rather a ""race against the virus"" Mr Evans said the relative speed of roll out here was ""a great thing"" for public protection. ""If we're leading the pack we're leading the race against the virus. If we're ahead against everyone else we must be ahead against the virus - that will mean more people protected and that's a great thing for people here,"" he added. He also welcomed research this week that suggested just a first dose of either of the Covid vaccines available in the UKoffers significant protection against serious illness, especially in older people. Nurse Carys Williams, who ensures the flow of people through the vaccination centres remains smooth, knows more than most how crucial this effort is, having been a nurse in intensive care during the first Covid wave. Age not job priority in Covid jab's second phase How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? All adults in Wales to be offered jab by 31 July ""Before being a supervisor here I was a nurse at critical care at UHW in Cardiff. I did that for 32 years, but unfortunately after the first wave I felt that I needed to change,"" she said. ""It was heart-breaking to be honest, it really was. I felt that I just needed to get away after that long and I didn't feel I could give anymore. ""I feel every jab I give I think we're making a contribution to lessening the pressure on the NHS and getting us to some kind of normality hopefully, pretty soon.""

Nurses' union anger over 'pitiful' 1% NHS pay rise,"The government can expect a ""backlash"" if it goes ahead with a proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England next year, a nursing union has warned. The health department has made the recommendation in asubmission,externalto the independent panel that advises on NHS salaries. The Royal College of Nursing called the suggested rise ""pitiful"" and said nurses should be getting 12.5% more. NHS staff have been excluded from a pay freeze for most public sector workers. The NHS Pay Review Body is due to recommend salary levels for health service staff before early May, before ministers then make a final decision. In its submission, the health department said awarding NHS staff a ""headline"" pay increase of more than 1% ""would require re-prioritisation"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Low-paid public sector workers to get Â£250 pay rise NHS staff vote for 6.5% pay deal Health department officials said the Covid pandemic had placed a ""huge strain"" on NHS finances, whilst the economic outlook ""remains uncertain"". They added that this increase was still above the CPI rate of inflation, whilst some staff would see a higher rise under apreviously agreed three-year deal. Some 1.3 million public sector workers will see a pay freeze next year, while those earning less than Â£24,000 guaranteed a pay rise of at least Â£250. The PM and his fiancee Carrie Symonds outside 10 Downing Street joining in clap for carers in May Speaking on BBC's Question Time, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he was sure the pay round ""has been discussed and established at the right level"". ""No one is doubting that the NHS hasn't been absolutely first class in this pandemic. What I am suggesting is that the whole economy has been under pressure,"" he added. But Labour said a 1% increase for NHS staff was ""the ultimate kick in teeth to our NHS heroes who have done so much to keep us safe over the past year"". The party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said staff ""deserve a fair pay rise,"" adding the proposal was ""an absolute insult"". NHS pay in England has been out of the news since 2018 when a three year deal was agreed and welcomed by unions. But the issue is firmly back on the agenda with a new deal needed for the upcoming financial year. This is just the start of the process. The government has made its submission to the NHS Pay Review Body. But the fact that ministers think a 1% pay rise is reasonable has angered health unions. They see it as scant reward for the huge efforts of staff during the pandemic. Government sources say that inflation is so low that 1% still represents a real terms increase and that public finances are constrained. This is shaping up to be a tense few months with pay added to the many difficult issues facing the NHS. RCN Chief Executive Dame Donna Kinnair said the government was ""dangerously out of touch with nursing staff, NHS workers and the public"". ""Nursing staff would feel they are being punished and made to pay for the cost of the pandemic. It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff. ""With the time remaining before the Pay Review Body recommendation, the government can expect a backlash from a million NHS workers. Taxpayers are supportive of a significant and fair pay rise for NHS workers - this year of all years."" One nurse, Carmel O'Boyle, said she was ""disgusted"". ""We just want something that reflects the work that we do. We want a fair wage and I don't think the government understands at all what the nursing workforce does,"" she said. ""I understand it is a very difficult year for the whole world... but this is a political decision,"" she added. The British Medical Association (BMA) said the recommendation was ""a kick in the teeth"". Its chair of council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, accused the government of a ""total dereliction"" of its ""moral duty and obligation to a workforce that is keeping the NHS on its feet and patients alive"". He said: ""Throughout the pandemic, doctors have cared for more critically ill patients than was ever thought possible and worked round the clock despite suffering from extreme stress and exhaustion. ""The government should demonstrate that it recognises the contribution of a workforce that has literally kept this country alive for the past 10 months."" A government spokesperson said they would ""consider carefully"" the recommendations made by the NHS Pay Review Body when it reports in the spring. The government ""will continue to provide pay rises for NHS workers"", despite the wider freeze on pay in the rest of the public sector, the spokesperson said. They added multi-year pay deals had delivered a pay rise of over 12% for newly qualified nurses, and will increase junior doctors' pay scales by 8.2%. Pay awards for approximately 45% of the public sector - including the armed forces, the police, teachers, the senior civil service and the NHS - are decided by government ministers based on the recommendation of eight Pay Review Bodies Pay Review Bodies are independent, non-departmental public bodies who issue annual reports based on remits set by ministers Pay for NHS staff was exempted from the public sector pay ""pause"" announced by the chancellor for 2021-22 If you are an NHS worker, what are your views about your pay?

Foster and O'Neill upbeat on NI's Covid-19 progress,"Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill give a positive update on the coronavirus pandemic NI's rate of transmission has dropped to between 0.65 and 0.75, says first minister Nearly 600,000 people have had their first Covid jab in NI, adds Arlene Foster On Tuesday the executive set out its plan for easing Northern Ireland's lockdown Three more Covid-19-related deaths reported on Thursday take NI's total to 2,066 That's all from us today, thanks for your company. To keep up to date, find all the latest onthe BBC News NI website. Until the next one, stay safe. Our political reporter Jayne McCormack and business reporter Richard Morgan will join Jordan Kenny to answer your questions on the NI Executive's lockdown exit plan live during tonight's Coronavirus Catch-up. Tune in at 19:00 GMT onthe BBC News NI website, iPlayer and BBC News NIFacebook page,external. Health Minister Robin Swann appears to have ruled out the idea of Covid-19 vaccine certification for people to get special access to pubs or restaurants in Northern Ireland. Mr Swann said it was ""not something that sits comfortably"" with him. He said talks were taking place at a UK-wide level about possible certification for international travel. But that was something that would need to be considered across the UK and Ireland, he added. Read morehere. There were almost 2,000 excess deaths in Northern Ireland from the start of the pandemic until the end of 2020. Excess deaths indicate the number of deaths above what would normally be expected. According to the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra), the number of excess deaths from 1 March to 31 December 2020 was 1,958. The agency recorded a very similar number of Covid deaths in the same period - 1,903. This increase in mortality represents a 15.4% hike above expected deaths. Read morehere. Asked whether the first and deputy first ministers were ""singing off the same hymn sheet"" on the lockdown exit plan, Mrs Foster says: ""This was a strategy that we landed on after long deliberations. NI has been in lockdown since 26 December ""We don't have a single party government in Northern Ireland, so it shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that different parties take different emphasis in relation to how we go forward. ""I hope that we can accelerate the plan, I've made no secret about that, so let's see where we are on 16 March so that we can move forward."" Michelle O'Neill says that with ""continued effort and support"" from the public, ""we will get to the point very quickly where we are able to announce what does the first stage in lifting restrictions look like"". ""The next staging post is 16 March and we are very much using the period in between these four-week views to point what will be coming down the track. ""Not to give any false hope, things do look good and let's hope that we can make some progress on the 16 March review date."" Arlene Foster says the NI Executive hopes to have ""a definitive answer next week"" in terms of P1 to P3s and nursery pupils reverting back to remote learning for a week from 22 March. She adds that it's a ""collective hope"" that they won't have to go back to remote learning and can stay in school. ""It is important that we can give that clarity next week so that parents and teachers can plan,"" she adds. Arlene Foster says that the fact that Northern Ireland will be finished its vaccination programme before the Republic of Ireland ""does bring headaches"". ""If you are interacting with people who have been vaccinated, it becomes less effective because the virus learns that,"" she says. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill asks ""why do loyalist paramilitary groups still exist more than 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement?"" She is speaking afterthe Loyalist Communities Council wrote to the prime minister to withdraw its support for the Good Friday Agreement. She says loyalist paramilitary groups are still carrying out ""racketeering, extortion, holding communities to ransom"". Ms O'Neill adds: ""The question has to be asked 23 years after the peace accord why they are still in existence?"" She says they should be told ""to leave the stage"". Arlene Foster criticises Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney, saying he should reflect on his suggestion that the Republic of Ireland needs a partner it ""can do business with"". ""He's not listening to the unionist people of Northern Ireland, the entirety of the unionist people of NI,"" she says. ""He's ignoring them and thinking they'll go away, but we'll not go away. ""We need to be listened to in relation to our very deep concerns about trade diversion, so he needs to reflect on his words."" On Wednesday,the UK said it would unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law. Mr Coveney said he preferred ""engagement"", but the UK government was driving the EU towards legal action. The floor is now open for questions. Asked about the extension of the grace period for the import of goods, Arlene Foster says the UK government has ""a commitment to ensure the internal market of the UK works and clearly it's not working at present, so they've taken actions to deal with some of those issues"". The first minister adds that it was ""quite clear to me, having attended the joint committee last week, that the European Commission was simply not listening to what was going on in Northern Ireland"". She says there was ""a need to act"" as the grace periods come to an end at the end of the month. She quotes the chief veterinary officer who said if the UK hadn't taken action, it would have led to up to 36,000 checks at the port of Larne. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says she believes the UK government is ""on the wrong side of public opinion"". She is talking after the UK said it would unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law. Ms O'Neill says the action was ""completely unnecessary"". It's the deputy first minister's turn to speak and she begins by also extending her sympathies to the family of former DUP MLA Jimmy Spratt. Michelle O'Neill says she always had a good working relationship with Mr Spratt. She describes him as ""a character"". She also passes on her condolences to the families of those whose relatives have died as a result of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. Arlene Foster says ""our early focus will be on education, the family and outdoor activities as we start out on the road back to normality"". She welcomes that the current health indicators are positive and adds that we have ""the benefit of the warmer seasons with us as well"". ""The journey over this last year have been so very difficult for so many of us, but literally and figuratively, the brighter days are within our grasp,"" adds the first minister. Northern Ireland's R-number is now between 0.65 and 0.75, the first minister says. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Mrs Foster says we are ""now at the point where we can begin to lift the burden [of restrictions]"". She says the number of people who will have their first Covid jab in NI will today pass 600,000, which is another ""significant"" milestone, and next week the executive will assess the impact of the return to school of some children. The first minister welcomes the fact that vaccine programme is ""significantly ahead of schedule"" and the programme is accelerating. ""By the end of this month, the SSE Arena will have the capacity to provide 40,000 vaccines per week,"" she says. The proportion of new hospital admissions for those aged 80 or over has reduced from approximately 40% to around 20%, suggesting the vaccine roll out is having ""a real impact on protecting older people"", she adds.  Opening the press conference, First Minister Arlene Foster is emotional as she pays tribute to her former colleague, the former DUP MLA Jimmy Spratt. ""As devolution returned to Northern Ireland, Jimmy sat beside me, Jimmy like me believed in building a shared future,"" she says. ""He wanted everyone to feel at home in Northern Ireland. ""He wanted to make devolution work and he never shied away from the challenge of making Northern Ireland move in the right direction. ""I will miss him and his quiet, determined support. ""But it was comforting for me that the comments from all the other parties reflected Jimmy's qualities and the contribution he made to politics here.""

UK extends Brexit checks grace period for parcels,"The UK has now said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks on parcels as well as agri-foods The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said that legal action is imminent over the UK's move to unilaterally extend grace periods on Irish Sea border checks. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ told the Financial Times that ""infringement proceedings"" are being prepared. He said: ""We are currently preparing it and it would be really something coming to our table very soon."" The EU has two legal avenues open to it under the Brexit deals. Under the NI part of the Brexit deal, the Protocol, it can launch infringement proceedings which could lead to a case at the European Court of Justice It took this action at the time when the UK threatened to breach the NI deal through the Internal Market Bill. In that case the legal proceedings were overtaken by political agreement. The EU could also seek arbitration under the terms of the wider EU-UK trade deal. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? Earlier on Thursday, the UK government extended another of the Irish Sea border grace periods, this time for parcels. It came a day after the UK extended grace periods for checks on agri-foods,a move the EU said was illegal. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. The first of these periods was to expire at the end of March; the UK saysthey will be extended until October,external. All parcels entering Northern Ireland would have required customs declarations from 1 April. The logistics industry said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration. The UK has said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks The government says the grace period for business-to-business deliveries will be extended until 1 October. For all other deliveries, for example businesses to consumers, businesses will be given six months to prepare for new arrangements from the date those arrangements are announced. In a protest against the UK's unilateral changes, the European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote to ratify the EU-UK Brexit deal. EU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the UK's move amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" ofthe Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks. He said progress had been made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's moves could not be worse. But UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and ""eminently solvable"". Arlene Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market. The DUP leader accused the Irish government of ignoring unionist concerns over the NI Protocol. But her deputy first minister, Sinn FÃ©in's Vice-President Michelle O'Neill, accused the British government of ""acting in bad faith"" over the protocol. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the grace period extensions were aimed at helping consumers and businesses in Northern Ireland, suggesting the EU needed to adapt its timeframe to fit the supply chain requirements of supermarkets and businesses. ""If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time,"" he said during a visit to Northern Ireland on Thursday. The Northern Ireland Protocolis the part of the Brexit deal aimed at ensuring there will be no hard border on the island of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Loyalist group withdraws support for peace deal,"Anti-Irish Sea border graffiti has appeared in parts of Northern Ireland A group which includes representatives of loyalist paramilitaries has written to the prime minister to withdraw its support for the Good Friday Agreement. The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) said it was temporarily withdrawing its backing because of concerns about theNorthern Ireland Protocol. The protocol means NI remains in the EU single market for goods, so products from GB undergo EU import procedures. Unionists say it damages trade and threatens NI's place in the UK. In the letter,first reported by the Irish News,external, LCC chairman David Campbell said the group's leadership is ""determined that unionist opposition to the protocol should be peaceful and democratic"". He added that the prime minister should not ""underestimate the strength of feeling on this issue right across the unionist family"". Mr Campbell said the LCC's support for the Good Friday Agreement would be withdrawn ""until our rights under the Agreement are restored and the protocol amended to ensure unfettered access for goods, services and citizens throughout the United Kingdom"". He told the BBC's Newsnight programme that Boris Johnson has ""reneged on the clear promises he made to the people of NI that there would be unfettered access"". ""So we are asking him and holding him to account and through this letter showing him that it is not just rhetoric from our parliamentary spokespersons that he has to be mindful of, but the strong grassroots anger that is palpable throughout the ground in Northern Ireland,"" he added. The prime minister's official spokesperson said he was ""fully committed to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement"" Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen, I don't know which groups you're talking about but what I can say is we're taking some temporary technical measures to insure that there are no barriers in the Irish Sea or to make sure that things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect. ""But obviously these are matters for continuing intensive discussions with our friends."" Earlier, responding to the letter, the prime minister's official spokesperson said he was ""fully committed to the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement"". The official said the government was ""determined"" to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, and it was ""simply looking to make some changes that have arisen as part of the protocol"". The LCC represents groups including the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA) - loyalist paramilitary groups responsible for the murders of hundreds of people. David Campbell is the chairman of the Loyalist Communities Council The Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was signed in 1998 and marked the effective end of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. It established a devolved power-sharing administration, and created new institutions for cross-border cooperation and structures for improved relations between the British and Irish governments. It was approved by referendums in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in 1998 and was subsequently incorporated into British and Irish constitutional law and other areas of legislation. The LCC letter states: ""If you or the EU is not prepared to honour the entirety of the agreement then you will be responsible for the permanent destruction of the agreement."" The letter was published shortly afterthe EU said on Wednesday that a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks as part of the NI Protocolwould be a breach of international law. Chief Constable Simon Byrne said the PSNI is currently assessing the letter, but he does not foresee any immediate threat of loyalist disorder or violence. He was speaking at a meeting of the Northern Ireland Policing Board in Belfast. The chief constable described it as ""a political move"". ""It is best dealt with by politiciansâ¦ but as we sit here we do not see any immediate change in emotion or potential for disorder or violence coming from within the loyalist community,"" he added. Representatives of the LCC recently held talks with officials from the Northern Ireland Office to warn them of growing tensions around the Brexit protocol, but Mr Byrne said the PSNI had not met the LCC nor would they. One person I spoke to last night described the move as a form of passive resistance by loyalist paramilitaries to the protocol. I do not see it as a being a step closer to any street protest or violent actions. Indeed the letter states opposition to border arrangements should be peaceful and democratic. What it captures though is continuing discontent and anger within a section of the community. But in terms of consequences I am not sure withdrawing support for the Good Friday Agreement amounts to much in practical terms. The DUP didn't back the agreement either. Obviously loyalist prisoners were released on the basis of the agreement. It was, though, not conditional on support for the agreement, but rather an individual not engaging in future violence. In FebruaryNorthern Ireland's major unionist parties said they were supporting a legal bidto challenge the Protocol. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) have said they are supporting judicial review proceedings. In response to the letter, Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said Boris Johnson faced a decision over whether he would ""give more oxygen to the normalisation of treating illegal organisations like any other stakeholder in society"". This video can not be played The Good Friday Agreement: A brief guide DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that unionist confidence and support for the Good Friday Agreement ""is diminishing rapidly"". He said: ""People have lost confidence because they believe that no one is listening to the concerns of unionists. ""I am not in any way, nor is my party, advocating that there should be the threat of violence or anything like it for any reason, there can be no justification for anyone doing that. ""The LCC statement makes clear that their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol will be peaceful and democratic."" Farry criticises DUP over meeting with loyalists Unionist parties to join NI Protocol legal bid Loyalist paramilitary groups 'have 12,500 members' The LCC was set up in 2015 by Mr Campbell, a former chairman of the Ulster Unionist Party, and Jonathan Powell, chief of staff to former Prime Minister Tony Blair, as a means to help bring an end to loyalist paramilitarism. It is not a proscribed organisation and is said to represent a range of individuals and views from the wider Protestant, unionist and loyalist communities. In late February the DUP leadership held talks with the organisation to discuss opposition to the protocol. It came shortly after Mr Campbell was criticised after saying loyalists would ""fight physically"" to maintain ""freedoms"" within the UK. In January, the LCC also met top civil servants from the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) to express anger at the Irish Sea border arrangements. It is not the first time loyalist groups have withdrawn their support for the Good Friday Agreement. In 2001 the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) - a cover name often used by the UDA when it claimed responsibility for sectarian murders - withdrew its support for the deal. In October 2015 the UDA ""recommitted"" to the principles of the Agreement, along with the UVF and the Red Hand Commando.

How well does the Oxford jab work?,"People under the age of 40 are to be offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK as a precaution, after a review of all the latest evidence by vaccine advisers and safety experts. The UK's medicine regulator - the MHRA - says the benefits of the vaccine still outweigh the risks for the vast majority of people. Under 40s to be offered alternative to AZ vaccine The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) - the body which advises the government - has now recommended that ""adults aged 18- 39 years with no underlying health conditions are offered an alternative to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, if available, and if it does not cause delays in having the vaccine"". Data from the MHRA suggests there's a very small - but slightly higher than normal - incidence of a rare type of clot in younger adult age groups, particularly when the risk of being infected with coronavirus is very low, as it is now. The risk of a clot is roughly one in 100,000 for people in their 40s, and rises to one in 60,000 for people in their 30s. Based on the current data, the following is advised: Anyone who experiences clotting after a first dose of the vaccine should not receive a second dose People with a history of blood disorders (at risk of clotting) should only have the AstraZeneca when the benefits outweigh the risks Pregnant women should talk to their GPs about the benefits and risks The MHRA looked into UK cases of rare blood clots in people who had recently received the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. It found 242 cases of clotting cases and 49 deaths after an estimated 28.5 million AstraZeneca vaccines doses were administered across the UK up to 28 April. The MHRA said about four people in a million would normally be expected to develop this particular kind of blood clot - though the fact they are so rare makes the usual rate hard to estimate. And the regulator said it had not been proven that the jab had caused the clots. Its head, Dr June Raine, said while the link was ""firming up"", more evidence would be needed. The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh the risks of the virus - hospitalisation and death - for the vast majority of people, she said. But for younger age groups it was more ""finely balanced"". 'Encouraging' antibody boost after both Covid jabs The MHRA study looked at people who had developed clots associated with a low level of platelets after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. Among these clots is a type called a Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CSVT). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in large veins in the head - stopping blood from draining out of the brain. As a result, blood cells may break and leak into brain tissue - ultimately leading to a stroke. The clot can occur naturally and are more common, but still very rare, in younger women. The MHRA says anyone who has these symptoms four or more days after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should seek prompt medical advice: A severe or persistent headache Blurred vision Chest pain Shortness of breath Swollen legs Persistent abdominal pain Unusual skin bruising Pinpoint spots (not including the injection site) Covid infection itself can make clots more likely, stresses the MHRA. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said clottingshould be listed as a very rare vaccine side effect. After a study looking at 86 such cases in the EU, the EMA concluded the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risk and that there was no definite causal link. Nevertheless,Denmarkhas stopped its AstraZeneca rollout completely - andGermany,Spain, Italy andIrelandhave suspended use of the vaccine in people under 60. France is recommending it only be given to those aged 55 or over, whileAustraliasays people aged under 50 should get the Pfizer jab instead. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to contain genetic material shared by the coronavirus - although it can't cause the illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus. How do we know Covid vaccines are safe? How do the Covid vaccines compare? Experts are studying all of the current coronavirus vaccines to check how well they work against new, mutated variants of the virus. The government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines appear to beeffective against the Kent variantwhich is dominant in the UK. There is less evidence about protection against other variants, such as those identified in Brazil and South Africa. However astudy of around 2,000 peoplesuggests, while the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine may offer more limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. it should still protect against severe disease.

LiveLiveUK cases down as WHO warns about Europe Covid rise10 minutes ago,"Coronavirus case rates are falling among all age groups in England, Public Health England says But a ""promising"" six-week decline in Covid cases in Europe has been disrupted by a rise in infections, the World Health Organization says ""We are seeing a resurgence in central and eastern Europe,"" says Hans Kluge, the WHO regional director for Europe. New cases are also rising in several western European countries, Kluge adds, saying Europe needs to expand supply and access to vaccines Germany is changing its stance on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing over-65s to receive the jab, Chancellor Angela Merkel says Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers have been setting out how coronavirus restrictions will be eased The NI Executive will next week assess the impact of the return to school of some children Italy has reportedly blocked the export of AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine ordered by Australia Edited by James Clarke and Rob Corp We are closing our live page for the day now. Here's a reminder of some of our main stories today. Today's writers were Doug Faulkner, Georgina Rannard, Jo Couzens and Lauren Turner. Today's editors were James Clarke and Rob Corp. There have been more than 4.2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 124,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. If you want to find out what the figures are like where you live, you can use our postcode-lookup featurehere. There's much more information too about cases in the UK and the progress of the vaccine rollout. The government can expect a ""backlash"" if it goes ahead with a proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England next year, a nursing union has warned. The Department of Health made the recommendation in a submission to the independent panel that advises on NHS salaries. The Royal College of Nursing's chief executive and general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said it was ""pitiful and bitterly disappointing"". âNursing staff would feel they are being punished and made to pay for the cost of the pandemic,"" she said. ""It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff. Nursing deserves a 12.5% increase. Our members will be making sure the Pay Review Body understands their reality and how the award would be received.â The NHS Pay Review Body is due to recommend salary levels for health service staff before early May, and ministers will then make a final decision.

Laura Whitmore has presented Love Island since last year UK fans of Love Island have something to look forward to as ITV confirms theseventh series of the show will return to screensthis summer. The reality show did not air last summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the broadcaster has not announced any further details, such as the location of the villa. Previous summer series have taken place in Mallorca, butreports this week,externalsuggested ITV has identified the island of Jersey as a possible back-up. Since the series has been off air, ITV2 has been broadcasting international editions of the series in its place to fill the air time, such as Love Island Australia. The Queen and other members of the UK royal family have turned their attention to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic for a Commonwealth programme being broadcast this weekend. In a recorded message, the Queen will pay tribute to the way communities across the ""family of nations"" have ""come together"" in response to the pandemic. The Prince of Wales has recorded a message addressing ""the universal devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic"", and celebrating critical work to combat climate change. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have also taken part. Buckingham Palace says Sunday's programme will celebrate ""Her Majesty's lifetime commitment to the Commonwealth"". It will be broadcast on the BBC and comes hours before an interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex airs in the US. If you're just joining us this evening, here's a round-up of what has been happening in the UK so far today. France warns that restrictions, currently in place in Nice, may be extended nationwide Surge testing will be deployed in
targeted areas of north-west London and north-east England where the South
African variant of coronavirus has been found. Additional testing and genomic sequencing will be
rolled out in the North Wembley area of the capital and theTS19 postcode area in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, according to the Department of Health. Stockton Council is opening an additional centre to help test more people from Friday. A spokesman said the South African variant is ""more infectious"" than other variants and cases need to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Positive cases will be sequenced
for genomic data to help increase understanding of Covid variants and
their spread. People living within the targeted areas
are ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 test when offered,
whether they are showing symptoms or not. It comes
as official Test and Trace figures revealed that a total of 68,738 people
tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 24 February. This is down 19% on the previous week
and is the lowest number since the week to September 30. Wales' First MinisterMark Drakeford is self-isolatingafter coming into contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. A Welsh government spokesperson says it is ""a precaution"". People are required to self-isolate for 10 days if asked to do so by contact tracers under government guidelines. Drakeford gave evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee of MPs remotely earlier this afternoon.  A care worker put 22 vulnerable people at risk bycarrying out home visits in Cardiff while she was suspected of having Covid-19, a tribunal has heard. A Care Standards hearing was told Samantha Gould made the visits in June after a GP had told her to isolate and get a test. Appealing against an 18-month suspension imposed last month, Gould has said she had ""a verbal negative"" result before the visits for Cardiff care company 1st Grade Care. The care worker told the tribunal she ""kept her distance"" and ""had an apron, gloves and mask"" during the visits. Judge Faridah Eden has dismissed her appeal, saying there is ""strong evidence that [Gould] put the public at risk"" and ""knowingly broke rules which were intended to protect the vulnerable people she was working with"". Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Scientists have identified 16
cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. Public Health England has
designated it as a ""variant under investigation"", meaning it is on its watch
list but not one PHE is immediately concerned about. It does have a mutation in
common with the South Africa and Brazil variants, however. That genetic change, E484K, may
help the virus evade immune attack. It's not unexpected that
variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses
mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive. Read more.

Dr Carsten Watzl tellsBBC World News: ""Given the data that came out of Scotland and England it's been proven that it is effective and there is no question about the safety of this vaccine."" About one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are ready to go into people's arms, he adds. A shipment of AstraZeneca doses arrived in Australia last month Italy is blocking a shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to Australia under European Union rules on vaccine exports, according to Italian media reports. It is the first ban under the scheme designed to protect vaccine supplies in the bloc. The order of 250,000 doses has been produced in an AstraZeneca factory in Anagni, near Rome, and the company has requested permission to ship the vials to Australia. With the support of the European Commission, the Italian government is refusing to allow the doses to leave. The EU and AstraZeneca have been embroiled in a large row over shortfalls in the company's delivery of doses to the bloc. AstraZeneca has blamed issues at its production plants in Europe. Australia started its rollout last week using the Pfizer jab and it is scheduled to start jabs with AstraZeneca doses on Friday. The World Health Organization has criticised the EU's scheme saying it is part of a ""worrying trend"" that could jeopardise global vaccine supply chains. Read more on the story.  A little while ago we brought you the latest UK coronavirus figures - which were 6,573 new cases and 242 further deaths. But how have things changed since this time last week? Well, Thursday 25 February saw 9,985 new positive cases reported and 323 deaths, of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. Today is the 10th consecutive day where the number of new cases has been under 10,000. The Stormont executiveagreed a five-step planfor easing the Covid-19 lockdown earlier this week. Unlike plans announced in England and Scotland, Northern Ireland's blueprint does not include a timetable. Progression will depend on certain public health criteria being met.  The executive must review its coronavirus restrictions regularly, with the next due on 16 March. The Executive Office says the plan -Moving Forward: The Executive's Pathway Out Of Restrictions,external- is a ""gradual easing of the current restrictions"". However it does not include specific detail on how the executive will measure when it is safe to reopen certain sectors. Northern Ireland's first minister says we are ""now at the point where we can begin to lift the burden [of restrictions]"". Speaking at a coronavirus press conference, Arlene Foster says the NI executive will next week assess the impact of the return to school of some children. She welcomes the fact the vaccine programme is ""significantly ahead of schedule"" and is accelerating. ""By the end of this month, the SSE Arena will have the capacity to provide 40,000 vaccines per month,"" she says. The proportion of new hospital admissions for those aged 80 or over has reduced from approximately 40% to about 20%, suggesting the vaccine rollout is having ""a real impact on protecting older people"", she adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin made the false claim while promoting Russian vaccines Russian President Vladimir Putin has wrongly claimed the death of a vaccine recipient has suspended innoculations using the Pfizer jab in parts of Europe. ""In some European
countries, Pfizer inoculations were stopped because there were lethal outcomes
there,"" Putin told a gathering of youth activists that was broadcast
live on Russian state TV channel Rossiya 24. He made the comment
after praising Russia's own vaccines as the ""safest and most
effective"" in the world. Putin appeared to be
referring to the false allegation in a video shared on social media that claimed Pfizer was halting production of
its vaccine after 23 people died in Norway. But as afact-check by the news agency Reuters,externalpointed out, Pfizer actually announced in mid-January that it was temporarily reducing
production at its facility in Puurs, Belgium, for a week as part of a plan to
increase vaccine output in the long term. In aprevious fact-check,external, the agency reported the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health had found no evidence to suggest the vaccine
was to blame for the deaths of 13 elderly recipients. Vaccine take-up in London among people aged 80 and older continues to lag behind other regions of England, the latest NHS figure show. An estimated 83.2% of people in this age group in the capital have had their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to NHS England, while uptake in other regions is thought to be at least 95%. Some 93.8% of residents of older adult care homes in England eligible to have their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine had received a jab by 28 February. But the equivalent figure for care home staff is 72.9%, while in London care homes that drops to 57.9% for eligible staff. There have been 6,573 new cases of coronavirus reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. It brings the total number of positive tests to 4,201,358. A further 242 deaths have been reported, of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths, under that measure, is now 124,025. Three men have beenarrested after ""box-loads"" of lateral flow tests meant for schools were stolenfrom a lorry. Police say all the Covid-19 tests have been retrieved since they were taken from Harlow Business Park in Essex in the early hours of Tuesday. A 31-year-old man from Canvey and a 27-year-old man from Newham have been arrested on suspicion of theft. A 37-year-old from Dagenham was arrested for the same offence, as well as on suspicion of drug driving. Ch Supt Stuart Hooper, from Essex Police, says he is ""thrilled"" the force has been able to recover the tests ""so those in need are able to keep themselves and others safe at this difficult time"".

"Covid-recovery tax rises fair, says Sunak","This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says it will take ""the work of many years, decades and governments"" to pay back Covid debt Chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected claims his plans to claw back the cost of coronavirus support will hit the poorest hardest. Mr Sunak extended furlough until September in Wednesday's Budget and set out measures to protect business as the UK emerges from lockdown. But he also announced major changes to tax - including a freeze on personal allowances. That means a million more people will start paying income tax. But Mr Sunak insisted no-one's take-home pay would be lowered and the threshold freeze would hit those on higher incomes more. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Sunak 'not levelling with people' on spending cuts Funding for Tory-held towns 'looks fishy' - Starmer Which taxes are rising to pay for coronavirus? The chancellor also plans to cut about Â£4bn from the budgets of government departments - leading to opposition warnings about a fresh round of spending cuts. The Treasury says the cut is due to a forecast of lower inflation but the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the reduction ""would still cause pain"". IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances."" Spending on the NHS, schools and defence is protected, which means the Â£4bn cut will ""fall entirely"" on local government and other areas, Mr Johnson said. ""Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the Autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today looks more like Scrooge Sunak cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly Â£50bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020,"" he added.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Mr Sunak's tax threshold freeze means about 1.3 million people will start paying income tax for the first time - and about 10% of adults will be dragged into the 40% top rate. Mr Sunak told the BBC the freeze was a ""progressive"" move which would ensure the people that earned the most paid the most adding ""it is a fair way to do what we need to do"". He said: ""People's current take home pay won't be affected by this policy but it does mean the incremental benefits they would have experienced had the thresholds continued to rise with inflation won't be there."" During his Budget, Mr Sunak announced that a weekly Â£20 increase in universal credit - introduced last year to help those hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic - would end in September. Two left-leaning think tanks, The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation, said the move would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s. Universal credit and income tax - as well as strains on government departments - are all going to cause issues for the government. But social care is a real Achilles Heel. It's no good saying it's a problem all governments have failed to deal with. We have had a Conservative government for a long time now. Most can agree, behind the scenes in government, it is time for a change. Some in Westminster are also asking if raising corporation tax in 2023 points to an election that year. One cabinet minister told me on Wednesday ""no comment"" when I asked if the 25% corporation tax would ever come into force. They are going to have to raise an awful lot of money somehow, but it's hard to see where the economy will be in 2023, let alone in a few months' time. Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that ""low-income families could be seeing a very difficult time in the future"". She also expressed concern that the government would be ""planning to switch off its increase in social security right at the time when we anticipate a peak in unemployment"". ""That is not a sensible approach to take,"" she added. This video can not be played Budget 2021: Who is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe? Mr Sunak says the total package of measures to support the economy - including those previously announced - amounted to Â£407bn. But he warned that this unprecedented spending could not continue. His other big money raising move was to increase the tax on company profits from 19% to 25%, although it will not kick in until 2023 and smaller firms will be exempted. Confederation of British Industry director-general Tony Danker said the rise in corporation tax would ""cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK"". The government's own watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the overall tax burden on the UK would hit 35% of national income by 2025-26, the highest level since the 1960s. Mr Sunak told the BBC it was ""important we get our borrowing under control"" - and the UK would still have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 group of industrialised economies. His has also faced criticism for failing to mention social care - an area where an existing funding crisis has been made more acute by the pandemic. In 2019, Boris Johnson said he had ready a plan to fix social care but asked why it was not included in the Budget, Mr Sunak said the government was trying to find a ""cross-party solution"". He said it was important to ""build consensus"" on the long-term future of social care but added that ""right now our focus is the pandemic"". Labour said ministers had not contacted them concerning any such plan.

Three UK terror plots foiled since pandemic began,"Counter-terror police said they have made 185 arrests across more than 800 live investigations during the coronavirus pandemic Three terror attacks have been prevented in the UK since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to security services. Arrests for terrorism-related activity fell by 34% in 2020, the lowest level in nine years, Home Office data showed. But the number of terror plots stopped has risen to 28 since March 2017, counter terror police said. The foreign secretary said young people had been recruited to terror groups in ""worrying"" numbers during lockdown. Dominic Raab told the House of Commons there had been a recent rise in the volume of terror-related content online. ""We can see a worrying rise in the proportion of children and teenagers that are now being arrested for terrorism offences,"" he added. The UK's senior national coordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing warned that these organisations ""have not stopped planning attacks or radicalising vulnerable people online"". Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had made 185 arrests across more than 800 live investigations during the pandemic - ""stopping three possible terror attacks in the process"". How do terrorism threat levels work? What we know about disrupted UK terror plots How Britain has been kept safe for a decade He said as lockdown eases, ""there will be greater opportunity for terrorists to operate"". ""We want the public to join the police, security staff and retail workers in a collective community effort tominimise the chance of attack,external,"" he added. In February, the UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded from""severe"" to ""substantial"", which means an attack is still likely. Mr Haydon also warned of a ""worrying trend"" of children under the age of 18 being arrested for terrorism-related activities. This age group was the only one that saw an increase - rising from 11 to 17 in total, Home Office data showed. ""That is a total of 10% of all arrests, which has risen from just 4% in the previous 12 months,"" said Mr Haydon. Police have launched awebsite and helpline,externalto offer advice and support for families to prevent young people becoming involved in terrorism, he said.

'An admin error cost me my business',"This video can not be played ""I feel like I have just thrown 10 years away,"" says businesswoman A mobile hairdresser said it was ""really distressing"" having to close her business due to an ""admin error"". Julie Price, from Flintshire, said she failed to qualify for theSelf-Employed Income Support Scheme,external(SEISS) during the pandemic after accidentally failing to submit her 2018-2019 tax return. She had to get a new job as an estate agent after taking family ""handouts"". HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which runs the SEISS, said it would speak to Mrs Price ""to clarify the situation"". The SEISS is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. 2.7 million people have been helped by it and thechancellor announced an extension of it in the Budgeton Wednesday. Mrs Price has been a business owner for 10 years and said she filled the return in online but did not press ""submit"" to complete the process. Despite being able to prove that she had paid the tax that was due, she said HMRC would still not allow her to receive the support. ""Had we not had family that stepped in and helped us I dread to think where we would be,"" said the 42-year-old. ""We were lucky with that, but on another side we'd always lived very comfortably and very well and to all of a sudden have no income whatsoever, it was a massive shock and very upsetting and caused us lots of sleepless nights and stress."" Mrs Price said she has paid her taxes for 10 years and feels like he has been told ""sorry, tough luck"" Mrs Price said she paid her taxes as a self-employed hairdresser ""on time every year for 10 years"" but because of an ""admin error"" she had effectively been told ""sorry, tough luck"". She added: ""I got to that point where it was getting that I was asking for handouts off my parents a lot and I didn't know how this was going to go on for."" Getting an estate agency job has given her ""security"" again, but she said closing her business was painful.

Funding for Tory-held towns looks fishy - Starmer,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Allocations from Towns Fund ""looks fishy"" Labour's leader has accused ministers of favouring Conservative areas for funding under a Â£1bn scheme to boost struggling towns in England. Sir Keir Starmer said regeneration money for 45 towns announced at the Budget ""looks fishy"" because the large majority are represented by Tory MPs. He called for criteria for the allocations, made under the Towns Fund, to be published. But Boris Johnson said the funding process was ""completely impartial"". The prime minister added that it was ""just a basic electoral fact"" that more towns now have a Conservative MP after the December 2019 general election. Chancellor announces Â£1bn for 45 areas of England How were the Towns Fund winners chosen? Why are some bits of the UK doing better than others? On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced Â£1bn for 45 towns under the Towns Fund scheme, which aims to help struggling areas. They are among a total of 101 towns that arescheduled to share funding,externalfrom the scheme, following a selection process that ended in September 2019. The towns received varying amounts under the scheme, with a number receiving at or close to the Â£25m maximum normally allowed. Speaking on Thursday, Sir Keir said 40 out of the 45 towns had a Tory MP, adding: ""Lots of people would scratch their head and say, 'what is going on here?'"" He said the funding announcement ""feels like pork-barrel politics"" - a term used to describe when politicians get funding for their area in return for voters' support. ""This should be going where it's really needed, and the government needs to publish the criteria for this,"" he told reporters. ""If you end up with a list of 45 areas where the funding's going in, and by co-incidence 40 of them are where there's a Conservative MP, I think most people are saying 'what's going on here, this looks fishy.'"" Bolton has been given Â£22.9m under the Towns Fund scheme Analysis by Peter Barnes, the BBC's head of political research There are 45 towns named but as some cover multiple constituencies, I've counted 56 constituencies that benefit. Forty-seven are Conservative constituencies - including 14 gained from Labour at the 2019 election plus quite a few more recent Conservative gains, while nine are Labour constituencies. Fifty-three of the constituencies voted ""leave"" at the EU referendum. Three voted ""remain"". In a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and ""remain"" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking. Mr Johnson defended the process used to allocate funding to towns, on a visit to Teesside to promotethe government's freeports scheme,also aimed at boosting neglected areas. ""One of the functions of the election clearly is that there are a lot of Conservative-represented towns. I think it's just a basic electoral fact,"" he said. ""I've asked about this, and I'm told that the criteria are entirely objective and they look at all sorts of data, poverty, employment and so on. ""We want to unite and level up across the whole country, we want to do it in a completely impartial way, so that's what we'll continue to do."" He added that if some areas ""feel that they've missed out"", the government will look at their case too. Jake Berry, who represents Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, and chairs the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, said Labour had ""let down"" voters in its former so-called 'Red Wall' seats. ""I doubt telling those same voters that the Conservatives are now fighting and delivering for them is going to win them back,"" he added. The government has previously come under fire from MPs and the UK's spending watchdog over how the 101 towns were selected for the scheme. Ministers picked the towns from a pool of 541 places, which had been ranked by officials based on local need and growth potential. They chose all 40 towns classed by officials as ""high-priority,"" then selected a further 60 places from the low and medium priority categories. But theCommons Public Accounts Committee saidit was ""not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others"". In a report, it added that justifications offered by ministers for picking some areas over others were ""vague and based on sweeping assumptions"".

BTS named world's best-selling artists of 2020,"BTS are a global K-pop phenomenon. Pop group BTS have been named the best-selling artists of 2020 by the IFPI, the organisation that represents the global recorded music industry. The accolade caps a stellar year for the Korean boyband, who released two chart-topping albums in 2020 - Map of the Soul: 7 and Be. The boyband beat Taylor Swift, who took the crown last year, into second place. They are the first non-Western act to win, and the first whose songs are not predominantly sung in English. The award is calculated according to an artist or group's worldwide sales, downloads and streams, covering their whole body of work. Drake came third, with The Weeknd fourth and Billie Eilish at number five. South Korea lets BTS postpone military service What do the critics make of the new BTS album? BTS members to become multi-millionaires BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, were formed in 2013 and consists of seven members - Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook - who come from all over South Korea. They've subsequently become standard-bearers for the K-pop scene, selling millions of records and concert tickets, while racking up billions of streams. The group was the brainchild of veteran writer and producer Bang Shi Hyuk, who formerly worked at the K-pop entertainment giant JYP, then formed Big Hit Entertainment and put BTS together around group leader, RM. Last year, he floated Big Hit Entertainment on the Korean stock market - resulting in the band members receiving a $108 million (Â£77 million) windfall. It more than made up for their inability to tour amid the Covid pandemic. The gap in their schedule also allowed BTS to record their second album of the year, which they billed as a ""letter of hope"" to fans. BTS performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York last year The record contained Dynamite - their first single to be recorded entirely in English, which topped the US charts in August, after breaking one-day streaming records in the US. Dynamite also earned BTS a Grammy nomination in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category, alongside stars like Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift. Frances Moore, chief executive of IFPI, said: ""BTS are a global phenomenon. They have had another outstanding year... and [are] continually finding creative and engaging ways to share their story with the world. ""They truly show the power that music has to bring joy and happiness to people the world over. ""We would like to congratulate RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V and Jung Kook and we are excited to see what they have in store next.""

Three UK terror plots foiled since pandemic beganPolice are warning that terrorists have not stopped planning attacks or radicalising people online.,"Counter-terror police said they have made 185 arrests across more than 800 live investigations during the coronavirus pandemic Three terror attacks have been prevented in the UK since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to security services. Arrests for terrorism-related activity fell by 34% in 2020, the lowest level in nine years, Home Office data showed. But the number of terror plots stopped has risen to 28 since March 2017, counter terror police said. The foreign secretary said young people had been recruited to terror groups in ""worrying"" numbers during lockdown. Dominic Raab told the House of Commons there had been a recent rise in the volume of terror-related content online. ""We can see a worrying rise in the proportion of children and teenagers that are now being arrested for terrorism offences,"" he added. The UK's senior national coordinator for Counter Terrorism Policing warned that these organisations ""have not stopped planning attacks or radicalising vulnerable people online"". Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said officers had made 185 arrests across more than 800 live investigations during the pandemic - ""stopping three possible terror attacks in the process"". How do terrorism threat levels work? What we know about disrupted UK terror plots How Britain has been kept safe for a decade He said as lockdown eases, ""there will be greater opportunity for terrorists to operate"". ""We want the public to join the police, security staff and retail workers in a collective community effort tominimise the chance of attack,external,"" he added. In February, the UK's terrorism threat level was downgraded from""severe"" to ""substantial"", which means an attack is still likely. Mr Haydon also warned of a ""worrying trend"" of children under the age of 18 being arrested for terrorism-related activities. This age group was the only one that saw an increase - rising from 11 to 17 in total, Home Office data showed. ""That is a total of 10% of all arrests, which has risen from just 4% in the previous 12 months,"" said Mr Haydon. Police have launched awebsite and helpline,externalto offer advice and support for families to prevent young people becoming involved in terrorism, he said.

Meghan bullying claims probed,"Buckingham Palace says it will investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff, adding that it was ""very concerned"" by the allegations. It follows a report in the Times newspaper that Meghan faced a bullying complaint when she was a working royal. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"". The palace said it ""does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment"". It will speak to the members of staff involved ""to see if lessons can be learned"", a statement added. According to the story in the Times,,externalthe complaint was made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace. A leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff. In a statement, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said: ""We are clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times following claims made by former staff of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. ""Accordingly, our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article. Members of staff involved at the time, including those who have left the Household, will be invited to participate to see if lessons can be learned. ""The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace."" The Meghan and Harry story Royal Family tree and line of succession Why Meghan gets compared to Princess Diana An earlier statement issued by Meghan's spokesman said: ""The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. ""She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good."" On one thing everyone is agreed: the interview that Meghan has given Oprah Winfrey - that will be broadcast in the US on Sunday - is concentrating minds. Palace staff have for some time itched to get their side of the story out; some feel that they went out of their way to help Meghan after the wedding only to be treated rudely or later dismissed as uncaring or worse. Team Sussex were braced for the story. ""It's a fairly extensive list of things that has been pulled together,"" one source told the BBC. ""The timing is not coincidental."" Meghan's side do not dispute the existence or content of the email; and it is pretty strong stuff. It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding. The duchess' people have pushed back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue. But now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously. Whatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. Harry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press. Last month,it was announced the couple would not returnas working members of the Royal Family. Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will air in the US on Sunday It comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March. In the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March. CBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.

There have been more than 4.2 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 124,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus.

There's much more information too about cases in the UK and the progress of the vaccine rollout. The government can expect a ""backlash"" if it goes ahead with a proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England next year, a nursing union has warned. The Department of Health made the recommendation in a submission to the independent panel that advises on NHS salaries. The Royal College of Nursing's chief executive and general secretary Dame Donna Kinnair said it was ""pitiful and bitterly disappointing"". âNursing staff would feel they are being punished and made to pay for the cost of the pandemic,"" she said. ""It is a political decision to underfund and undervalue nursing staff. Nursing deserves a 12.5% increase. Our members will be making sure the Pay Review Body understands their reality and how the award would be received.â The NHS Pay Review Body is due to recommend salary levels for health service staff before early May, and ministers will then make a final decision.

In a recorded message, the Queen will pay tribute to the way communities across the ""family of nations"" have ""come together"" in response to the pandemic. The Prince of Wales has recorded a message addressing ""the universal devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic"", and celebrating critical work to combat climate change. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have also taken part. Buckingham Palace says Sunday's programme will celebrate ""Her Majesty's lifetime commitment to the Commonwealth"". It will be broadcast on the BBC and comes hours before an interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex airs in the US. If you're just joining us this evening, here's a round-up of what has been happening in the UK so far today. France warns that restrictions, currently in place in Nice, may be extended nationwide Surge testing will be deployed in
targeted areas of north-west London and north-east England where the South
African variant of coronavirus has been found. Additional testing and genomic sequencing will be
rolled out in the North Wembley area of the capital and theTS19 postcode area in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, according to the Department of Health. Stockton Council is opening an additional centre to help test more people from Friday. A spokesman said the South African variant is ""more infectious"" than other variants and cases need to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Positive cases will be sequenced
for genomic data to help increase understanding of Covid variants and
their spread. People living within the targeted areas
are ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 test when offered,
whether they are showing symptoms or not. It comes
as official Test and Trace figures revealed that a total of 68,738 people
tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 24 February. This is down 19% on the previous week
and is the lowest number since the week to September 30. Wales' First MinisterMark Drakeford is self-isolatingafter coming into contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. A Welsh government spokesperson says it is ""a precaution"". People are required to self-isolate for 10 days if asked to do so by contact tracers under government guidelines. Drakeford gave evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee of MPs remotely earlier this afternoon.  A care worker put 22 vulnerable people at risk bycarrying out home visits in Cardiff while she was suspected of having Covid-19, a tribunal has heard. A Care Standards hearing was told Samantha Gould made the visits in June after a GP had told her to isolate and get a test. Appealing against an 18-month suspension imposed last month, Gould has said she had ""a verbal negative"" result before the visits for Cardiff care company 1st Grade Care. The care worker told the tribunal she ""kept her distance"" and ""had an apron, gloves and mask"" during the visits. Judge Faridah Eden has dismissed her appeal, saying there is ""strong evidence that [Gould] put the public at risk"" and ""knowingly broke rules which were intended to protect the vulnerable people she was working with"". Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Scientists have identified 16
cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. Public Health England has
designated it as a ""variant under investigation"", meaning it is on its watch
list but not one PHE is immediately concerned about. It does have a mutation in
common with the South Africa and Brazil variants, however. That genetic change, E484K, may
help the virus evade immune attack. It's not unexpected that
variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses
mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive. Read more. This video can not be played Germany's AstraZeneca vaccine decision welcomed Germany's decision to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use inthe over-65shas been welcomed by the German Society for Immunology. Dr Carsten Watzl tellsBBC World News: ""Given the data that came out of Scotland and England it's been proven that it is effective and there is no question about the safety of this vaccine."" About one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are ready to go into people's arms, he adds. A shipment of AstraZeneca doses arrived in Australia last month Italy is blocking a shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to Australia under European Union rules on vaccine exports, according to Italian media reports. It is the first ban under the scheme designed to protect vaccine supplies in the bloc. The order of 250,000 doses has been produced in an AstraZeneca factory in Anagni, near Rome, and the company has requested permission to ship the vials to Australia. With the support of the European Commission, the Italian government is refusing to allow the doses to leave. The EU and AstraZeneca have been embroiled in a large row over shortfalls in the company's delivery of doses to the bloc. AstraZeneca has blamed issues at its production plants in Europe. Australia started its rollout last week using the Pfizer jab and it is scheduled to start jabs with AstraZeneca doses on Friday. The World Health Organization has criticised the EU's scheme saying it is part of a ""worrying trend"" that could jeopardise global vaccine supply chains. Read more on the story.  A little while ago we brought you the latest UK coronavirus figures - which were 6,573 new cases and 242 further deaths. But how have things changed since this time last week? Well, Thursday 25 February saw 9,985 new positive cases reported and 323 deaths, of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. Today is the 10th consecutive day where the number of new cases has been under 10,000. The Stormont executiveagreed a five-step planfor easing the Covid-19 lockdown earlier this week. Unlike plans announced in England and Scotland, Northern Ireland's blueprint does not include a timetable. Progression will depend on certain public health criteria being met.  The executive must review its coronavirus restrictions regularly, with the next due on 16 March. The Executive Office says the plan -Moving Forward: The Executive's Pathway Out Of Restrictions,external- is a ""gradual easing of the current restrictions"". However it does not include specific detail on how the executive will measure when it is safe to reopen certain sectors. Northern Ireland's first minister says we are ""now at the point where we can begin to lift the burden [of restrictions]"". Speaking at a coronavirus press conference, Arlene Foster says the NI executive will next week assess the impact of the return to school of some children. She welcomes the fact the vaccine programme is ""significantly ahead of schedule"" and is accelerating. ""By the end of this month, the SSE Arena will have the capacity to provide 40,000 vaccines per month,"" she says. The proportion of new hospital admissions for those aged 80 or over has reduced from approximately 40% to about 20%, suggesting the vaccine rollout is having ""a real impact on protecting older people"", she adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin made the false claim while promoting Russian vaccines Russian President Vladimir Putin has wrongly claimed the death of a vaccine recipient has suspended innoculations using the Pfizer jab in parts of Europe. ""In some European
countries, Pfizer inoculations were stopped because there were lethal outcomes
there,"" Putin told a gathering of youth activists that was broadcast
live on Russian state TV channel Rossiya 24. He made the comment
after praising Russia's own vaccines as the ""safest and most
effective"" in the world. Putin appeared to be
referring to the false allegation in a video shared on social media that claimed Pfizer was halting production of
its vaccine after 23 people died in Norway. But as afact-check by the news agency Reuters,externalpointed out, Pfizer actually announced in mid-January that it was temporarily reducing
production at its facility in Puurs, Belgium, for a week as part of a plan to
increase vaccine output in the long term. In aprevious fact-check,external, the agency reported the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health had found no evidence to suggest the vaccine
was to blame for the deaths of 13 elderly recipients. Vaccine take-up in London among people aged 80 and older continues to lag behind other regions of England, the latest NHS figure show. An estimated 83.2% of people in this age group in the capital have had their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to NHS England, while uptake in other regions is thought to be at least 95%. Some 93.8% of residents of older adult care homes in England eligible to have their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine had received a jab by 28 February. But the equivalent figure for care home staff is 72.9%, while in London care homes that drops to 57.9% for eligible staff. There have been 6,573 new cases of coronavirus reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. It brings the total number of positive tests to 4,201,358. A further 242 deaths have been reported, of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths, under that measure, is now 124,025. Three men have beenarrested after ""box-loads"" of lateral flow tests meant for schools were stolenfrom a lorry. Police say all the Covid-19 tests have been retrieved since they were taken from Harlow Business Park in Essex in the early hours of Tuesday. A 31-year-old man from Canvey and a 27-year-old man from Newham have been arrested on suspicion of theft. A 37-year-old from Dagenham was arrested for the same offence, as well as on suspicion of drug driving. Ch Supt Stuart Hooper, from Essex Police, says he is ""thrilled"" the force has been able to recover the tests ""so those in need are able to keep themselves and others safe at this difficult time"".

What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI?,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Brexit: How Northern Ireland is different,"The practical and economic consequences of Brexit will become real when the transition period ends at 23:00 GMT on Thursday. But because of special arrangements for Northern Ireland, it will have a different experience from the rest of the UK. People born in Northern Ireland have the right to Irish as well as British citizenship. Those who exercise that right will retain their EU citizenship, something not available to people elsewhere in the UK who may have only British citizenship. The consequences of this range from the mundane to the profound. People travelling on Irish passports will be able to use EU/EEA lanes and e-gates at airports. Those with British passports will not. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI Brexit and Northern Ireland - the year in review More fundamentally people with Irish passports keep their right to freedom of movement within the EU. That means they can live, work and study in an EU country without a visa and with no time limit. These rights extend to their spouses and dependent children. TheEU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier explained this during a speech in Belfastin 2020. ""Whilst Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, people born and raised here that choose to be Irish citizens will still be EU citizens,"" he said. ""This means they can continue to move and reside freely within the EU."" The UK will no longer be participating in Erasmus, the EU student exchange scheme. Instead, the UK government is setting up its own scheme, known as Turing. However,students at Northern Ireland's universities will still be able to take part in Erasmusdue to funding and administrative assistance from the Irish government. Ireland's Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said: ""The government of Ireland made a very solemn commitment to Northern Ireland that, even after Brexit, we would make sure that there were still ways for us to co-operate and collaborate in relation to higher education."" Funding will be available to all full-time students attending third level institutions in Northern Ireland. It will not be limited to those with an Irish passport, so British passport holders will also qualify. The town of Warrenpoint in County Down is home to the second largest port in Northern Ireland Businesses across the UK will still be able to sell their goods to the EU without tariffs being imposed. This is due to thetrade dealreached between the EU and UK on Christmas Eve. But businesses in GB will face a range of new non-tariff trade barriers such as paperwork, certifications and checks on goods as they enter the EU. Northern Ireland will not face these non-tariff barriers as it will effectively remain within the EU's single market for goods. This is a consequence of theNI Protocol, a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. As an example, a lorry load of Northern Ireland meat products could board a ferry at Dublin port and disembark at a French port with no new paperwork or checks. However, if a similar load was travelling from Scotland to France it would need to be accompanied by new export health certificates and the authorities would need advance notice of its arrival. It would have to go to a border control post where the load may be physically examined. There is a significant flipside to this: new trade barriers within the UK. That lorry load of Scottish meat could be driven to Cardiff or London without any new checks or controls. But when entering Northern Ireland it is as if it is entering the EU. So it will need to undergo all the same bureaucracy and checking as when it was entering a French port. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"EU 'can't trust' UK in post-Brexit talksIreland's foreign minister says the EU is being driven towards legal action by the UK, but Boris Johnson says problems are âeminently solvableâ.Northern Ireland","The UK has said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks DUP leader Arlene Foster has accused the Irish government of ""ignoring"" unionist concerns over the NI Protocol. It comes after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks. On Wednesday, Number 10 saidit would unilaterally extend grace periodsfor Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law. But Sinn FÃ©in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said it was the British government ""acting in bad faith"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and could be solved. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? The first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October. Earlier, Mr Coveney said progress was being made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's move could not be worse. But Mrs Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference that the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market. ""It was clear last week that the European Commission was not listening to what was going on in Northern Ireland, there was a need to act,"" she added. ""I have to say Simon Coveney should reflect on his comments, he's not listening to the unionist people of Northern Ireland, he's ignoring them, hoping we'll go away - well we'll not go away."" She said the British government had indicated a ""step-change"" in its approach to dealing with the protocol, but that the DUP would continue to press for an alternative to be drawn up. But Ms O'Neill, Stormont's Deputy First Minister and Mrs Foster's power-sharing partner, said the British government had shown it was ""not true to their word when it comes to negotiations"". ""In this case I believe they're on the wrong side of public opinion and international law,"" she added. ""The action was completely unnecessary, what the British government has done is another solo run."" She said she believed negotiations on resolving protocol issues should continue through the UK-EU joint committee, which is scheduled to meet again before the end of March. Simon Coveney said progress was being made over the Northern Ireland Protocol However, speaking during a visit to Middlesbrough, the prime minister said: ""We're taking some temporary technical measures to ensure there are no barriers in the Irish Sea, to make sure things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect. ""I'm sure that with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable."" Later, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was about ""doing the right thing for consumers and businesses"" in NI. ""Sadly the EU hasn't been able to work on a timeframe that works for the supply lines of, for example supermarkets, so we had to make a decision to ensure that we could see a continued flow of products and that supermarkets' supply lines could continue to flow,"" he said. ""If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time. The European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote on the EU-UK trade deal in protest at what the EU sees as the UK's unilateral changes. EU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday. Mr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar, who is Ireland's tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), said the UK's actions were neither the way a friend, nor ""a respectable, honourable country"", should behave. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saidthe EU's recent move to trigger Article 16showed ""very clearly that it remains within their remit to take unilateral action to protect the EU's single market"". ""Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK Government has the same power - to act unilaterally to protect the integrity of the UK internal market and trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. The EU reversed its Article 16 move within hours of taking the action, followingcondemnation from Belfast, London and Dublin. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ later described the move as a mistake which had been made in the ""intensity of the moment"" oftrying to secure Covid-19 vaccines,external. The move by the UK government to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks put Ireland in an uncomfortable position. Mr Coveney said Ireland was lobbying at the EU level to obtain easements on trade between GB and Northern Ireland. Other Irish MEPs have written to the European Commission calling for an extension. But there will be other member states who will be reluctant to offer any concessions if the UK is going to ride rough-shod over the process. So what could be the end game? The two sides will continue negotiating. The EU says it is looking at legal avenues open to it under both the withdrawal agreement and the wider UK-EU agreement. However, the UK may question what practical steps the EU will really take if grace periods are extended. The UK statement on Wednesday indicated the extra time gained by an extension of the grace period could be used to develop systems to ease trade between GB and NI in the long term. The UK was also at pains to say it is not walking away from the protocol, it is simply finding ways to implement it. On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the UK's move to extend grace periods amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" of the NI Protocol. He said the EU would respond in accordance with the ""legal means"" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal. Following a call on Wednesday evening between Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said ""official-level notification"" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week. Lord Frost had underlined the extension was needed for ""operational reasons"" and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith"", said a government spokesman. Further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from Britain to Northern Ireland. That is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations. The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"Funding for Tory-held towns looks fishy - StarmerBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson defends allocations from the Towns Fund as ""completely impartial"".","This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Allocations from Towns Fund ""looks fishy"" Labour's leader has accused ministers of favouring Conservative areas for funding under a Â£1bn scheme to boost struggling towns in England. Sir Keir Starmer said regeneration money for 45 towns announced at the Budget ""looks fishy"" because the large majority are represented by Tory MPs. He called for criteria for the allocations, made under the Towns Fund, to be published. But Boris Johnson said the funding process was ""completely impartial"". The prime minister added that it was ""just a basic electoral fact"" that more towns now have a Conservative MP after the December 2019 general election. Chancellor announces Â£1bn for 45 areas of England How were the Towns Fund winners chosen? Why are some bits of the UK doing better than others? On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced Â£1bn for 45 towns under the Towns Fund scheme, which aims to help struggling areas. They are among a total of 101 towns that arescheduled to share funding,externalfrom the scheme, following a selection process that ended in September 2019. The towns received varying amounts under the scheme, with a number receiving at or close to the Â£25m maximum normally allowed. Speaking on Thursday, Sir Keir said 40 out of the 45 towns had a Tory MP, adding: ""Lots of people would scratch their head and say, 'what is going on here?'"" He said the funding announcement ""feels like pork-barrel politics"" - a term used to describe when politicians get funding for their area in return for voters' support. ""This should be going where it's really needed, and the government needs to publish the criteria for this,"" he told reporters. ""If you end up with a list of 45 areas where the funding's going in, and by co-incidence 40 of them are where there's a Conservative MP, I think most people are saying 'what's going on here, this looks fishy.'"" Bolton has been given Â£22.9m under the Towns Fund scheme Analysis by Peter Barnes, the BBC's head of political research There are 45 towns named but as some cover multiple constituencies, I've counted 56 constituencies that benefit. Forty-seven are Conservative constituencies - including 14 gained from Labour at the 2019 election plus quite a few more recent Conservative gains, while nine are Labour constituencies. Fifty-three of the constituencies voted ""leave"" at the EU referendum. Three voted ""remain"". In a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and ""remain"" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking. Mr Johnson defended the process used to allocate funding to towns, on a visit to Teesside to promotethe government's freeports scheme,also aimed at boosting neglected areas. ""One of the functions of the election clearly is that there are a lot of Conservative-represented towns. I think it's just a basic electoral fact,"" he said. ""I've asked about this, and I'm told that the criteria are entirely objective and they look at all sorts of data, poverty, employment and so on. ""We want to unite and level up across the whole country, we want to do it in a completely impartial way, so that's what we'll continue to do."" He added that if some areas ""feel that they've missed out"", the government will look at their case too. Jake Berry, who represents Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire, and chairs the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, said Labour had ""let down"" voters in its former so-called 'Red Wall' seats. ""I doubt telling those same voters that the Conservatives are now fighting and delivering for them is going to win them back,"" he added. The government has previously come under fire from MPs and the UK's spending watchdog over how the 101 towns were selected for the scheme. Ministers picked the towns from a pool of 541 places, which had been ranked by officials based on local need and growth potential. They chose all 40 towns classed by officials as ""high-priority,"" then selected a further 60 places from the low and medium priority categories. But theCommons Public Accounts Committee saidit was ""not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others"". In a report, it added that justifications offered by ministers for picking some areas over others were ""vague and based on sweeping assumptions"". A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the selection process was ""comprehensive, robust and fair"". ""Proposals are assessed by officials - not ministers - in the order they are submitted and offers are based solely on the strength of the proposals assessed by officials at the department,"" they added.

Germany approves AstraZeneca jab for over-65s,"Germany's vaccine commission has approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in people aged over 65. The country previously approved it for under-65s only, citing insufficient data on its effects on older people. That led to public scepticism about its effectiveness, with some Germans spurning it and leaving many doses unused. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said recent studies had now provided enough data to approve it for all ages. Announcing the commission's decision on Thursday, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the move was ""good news for older people who are waiting for an injection"". ""The new data also shows that the vaccine is even more effective when the first and second jabs are administered 12 weeks apart,"" the minister said, adding that the law would be updated to incorporate the new recommendations. Mrs Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany would follow the UK example of stretching the interval between vaccine doses in order to offer as many people as possible an initial shot. France approves AstraZeneca vaccine for over-65s What's behind France's AstraZeneca turnaround? Oxford vaccine does protect older people, Europe told Various studies have shown the AstraZeneca vaccine is highly effective among the elderly. Belgium says it will also approve the vaccine for older people, following France earlier this week. About 5% of Germans have so far received a first vaccine shot. The EU's medical regulator approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups in January. But the rollout was met by some public scepticism after regulators in countries including France, Belgium and Italy recommended that it should not be used for people over 65. Like Germany, they citied insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. In January French President Emmanuel Macron said the jab was ""quasi-ineffective"" for older age groups - a suggestion strongly refuted by the UK government and British medical regulators. The debate came amid an acrimonious dispute between AstraZeneca and the EU over vaccine supplies to member states. Since then, stocks of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab have gone unused in several European countries, slowing vaccination efforts. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared Meanwhile the UK - which approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab for all age groups - has offered a first dose of a vaccine to 20.7 million people, almost a third of its population. Last week Carsten Watzl, head of the German Society for Immunology, urged his country to change its mind on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. In an interview with the BBC, he predicted regulators would have to reverse their decision to not recommend the jab for older people and suggested Mrs Merkel should take the vaccine live on TV to prove it is safe. Separately, Mrs Merkel said she had agreed to a phased easing of restrictions with leaders of Germany's federal states but added that there was the option of an ""emergency brake"" if case numbers got out of control. ""We are at the threshold of a new phase of the pandemic that we can go into not carelessly but still with justified hope,"" Mrs Merkel said. From Monday up to five people from two households will be allowed to meet, with children under 14 exempt. Some shops will reopen provided that regional case numbers are below 50 per 100,00 people. If cases rise over 50 per 100,000 then customers will have to book slots to visit shops. If cases rise to over 100 per 100,000 over three days in a row then restrictions will be reimposed. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme since December. UK health officials say it provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages. Covid vaccines cut risk of serious illness by 80% No one who received the vaccine in trials was admitted to hospital or became seriously ill with Covid-19. The vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between four and 12 weeks after the first.

Tax cut for Scots home buyers will end 'as planned'The stamp duty holiday on house purchases was extended in the Westminster budget but will end in Scotland.Scotland,"A holiday on stamp duty has been extended as part of the Westminster budget - but this will not apply in Scotland A tax cut for Scottish house buyers will end as planned on 1 April, despite an extension in the Westminster budget. The starting point for land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) was increased during the first lockdown. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the move had ""achieved"" its goal of supporting the recovery of the residential property market. The stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland will continue foranother three months. Last year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the tax break on house sales in England and Northern Ireland of up to Â£500,000 as part of his summer statement of measures to respond to the coronavirus crisis. Because housing and residential taxes are devolved to Holyrood, this meant there were calls for Ms Forbes to mirror the stamp duty cut in its Scottish equivalent, LBTT. How does the Westminster Budget affect Scots? Stamp duty holiday extended in England and NI What was set out in the Scottish budget? At the time, Ms Forbes said she had listened to calls and the threshold where the tax kicks in was raised from Â£145,000 to Â£250,000 - although this did not apply to second homes. She announced levels would return to normal at the end of the financial year when she set out theScottish budget in January., saying support would continue for first time buyers. Kate Forbes announced the Scottish budget in January On Wednesday, the chancellor said the tax break in England and Northern Ireland would continue until the end of June. After that, the nil rate band will be set at Â£250,000 - double its standard level - until the end of September. Mr Sunak told MPs the extra move was ""to smooth the transition back to normal - and we will only return to the usual level of Â£125,000 from October 1"". Ms Forbes told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland she intended to ""stick to the original plan"" and end the relief by April. She said: ""It was intended to support the recovery of the residential property market this financial year. ""That has been achieved - the nil rate band was already lower in Scotland and yet we've seen record high levels of transactions and house purchases, so it has achieved its purpose. ""But ultimately, when it comes to tax policy, I have choices and the number one ask from business was to extend the 100% relief for non-domestic rates - that's what I've done alongside freezing council tax to help households in need."" On the Westminster budget, Ms Forbes said ""storm clouds of austerity"" were on the horizon and that despite a number of positive measures including the extension of the furlough scheme, Mr Sunak was ""delaying a lot of the pain until next year"". Mr Sunak said the problems caused by coronavirus were ""not going to be dealt with overnight"" Mr Sunak told the programme that there was an increase of Â£400bn to Â£500bn by end of this Parliament in his public spending plans. He said: ""The damage coronavirus has done to our economy and public finances has been extraordinary and it's going to take time for us to fully recover from this. ""It's not going to be dealt with overnight and that's why we've set out a clear plan that begins to fix the problem and protect the things we care about, like public services and supporting small businesses and crucially supporting our recovery in the short term.""

US suspends tariffs on single malt Scotch whiskyTariffs on UK cheese and cashmere will also be lifted as the two countries try to resolve an old trade row.BusinessComments,"The US has agreed to suspend tariffs on UK goods including single malt whiskies that were imposed in retaliation over subsidies to the aircraft maker Airbus. Tariffs will also be lifted on UK cheese, cashmere and machinery. The duties will be suspended for four months while the two sides seek a long-term settlement. On 1 January, the UK dropped its own tariffs on some US goods, put in place over a related dispute about US subsidies to Boeing. It is the latest twist in a decades-old trade row that has seen the EU and the US target billions of dollars worth of each other's exports with taxes. The UK is part of the dispute as a former EU member. Airbus makes wings and other parts in the UK, but assembles its commercial aircraft in the EU. EU imposes tariffs on US goods in Boeing row US set to impose tariffs on $7.5bn of EU exports It has hit Scotch whisky producers particularly hard as the US is a key export market. Distilleries havereported Â£500m of lossessince 2019 due to the tariffs. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the trade truce, due to come into force on Monday, would boost British business.

The company, which employs 850 people, has been taking a ""25% hit"" on every knitwear product it exports to the US - ""a significant cost"" at a time when Covid and Brexit also pose challenges. In Speyside many other businesses have felt the impact of the US tariffs, including whisky distilleries and shortbread makers. ""This has been a particularly difficult tax for the businesses here, so it's a huge relief for the region,"" says Mr Cotton. ""We're hoping this paves the way for a permanent removal of these tariffs."" Karen Betts, head of the Scotch Whisky Association, called the suspension ""fabulous news"". ""The tariff on single malt Scotch whisky exports to the US has been doing real damage to Scotch whisky in the 16 months it has been in place, with exports to the US falling by 35%,"" she said. ""So today, everyone in our industry - from small companies to large - is breathing a sigh of relief."" For more than a decade, the EU and US accused each other of propping up their home aviation markets with tax breaks, research grants and other aid. But tensions flared in 2019, when former US president Donald Trump retaliated by putting tariffs on $7.5bn (Â£5.4bn) of EU goods, including UK products such as whisky. Last November, the EU hit back bytargeting $4bn of American goods with dutiesas punishment for US subsidies for Boeing. Since it left the EU, the UK has been lobbying Washington to drop the duties on its goods as it seeks a wide-ranging trade deal with the US. Talks with Washington abruptly broke off in January but resumed after Joe Biden became US president. Mr Biden's top trade nominee, Katherine Tai, has said she will make it a priority to resolve the row with the EU and Britain - although for now US tariffs continue to apply to EU goods. In a joint statement on Thursday, the UK and the US said that the suspension would ""ease the burden on industry and take a bold, joint step towards resolving the longest-running disputes at the World Trade Organization"". The two countries added that it would also allow time to focus on negotiating ""a balanced settlement to the disputes, and begin seriously addressing the challenges posed by new entrants to the civil aviation market from non-market economies, such as China"". Airbus welcomed the removal of ""lose-lose tariffs"" and urged the UK and US governments to reach a long-term settlement. More than Â£500m-worth of whisky sales have been lost since October 2019, when the 25% tariff was introduced on single malt Scotch. Smaller distillers were hit hardest. The US is the biggest single-nation export market by value. President Trump's US Trade Representative reckoned it was a good source of political leverage in the 17-year trade dispute over aircraft manufacturing. Scottish cashmere sweaters were also targeted. In the political calculation of trade disputes, the US did not include Irish whiskey or Italian cashmere, giving them the opportunity to exploit the rift and grow market share. It was not until last autumn that the European Union and the UK won the right, at the World Trade Organisation, to hit back over Boeing subsidies by US governments. That levelled the field on which to negotiate a resolution. Donald Trump used trade tariffs as a bludgeon intended to protect American jobs, and although Joe Biden is not noted as an enthusiast for globalisation and free trade, this suspension of tariffs signals his administration is in the business of negotiated deals between partners. It acknowledges the trans-Atlantic partners should perhaps focus more on manufacturing competition from China. But there is work to be done: the EU, UK and US have not only the Boeing/Airbus dispute to resolve, but another one over steel and aluminium, which explains the 25% tariff currently on imported American whiskey. For Liz Truss and the UK government's attempts to secure post-Brexit trade deals, this is a significant step forward. It seems the Biden administration is not prioritising the European Union ahead of Britain. However, a UK-US free trade deal is a long way from here.

Harry and Meghan not returning,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added. Harry and Meghan released a photo on Sunday to announce they are expecting their second child The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Their son Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 The announcement comes days after the couple revealedthey are expecting their second child. They are due totalk about their decision to step away from the monarchyin a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month. Since stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals withstreaming giants NetflixandSpotify. The duchess recentlywon a High Court privacy battleagainst the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

"'An admin error cost me my business'Julie Price says she accidentally failed to submit a tax return, so did not get Covid support.Wales","This video can not be played ""I feel like I have just thrown 10 years away,"" says businesswoman A mobile hairdresser said it was ""really distressing"" having to close her business due to an ""admin error"". Julie Price, from Flintshire, said she failed to qualify for theSelf-Employed Income Support Scheme,external(SEISS) during the pandemic after accidentally failing to submit her 2018-2019 tax return. She had to get a new job as an estate agent after taking family ""handouts"". HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), which runs the SEISS, said it would speak to Mrs Price ""to clarify the situation"". The SEISS is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. 2.7 million people have been helped by it and thechancellor announced an extension of it in the Budgeton Wednesday. Mrs Price has been a business owner for 10 years and said she filled the return in online but did not press ""submit"" to complete the process. Despite being able to prove that she had paid the tax that was due, she said HMRC would still not allow her to receive the support. ""Had we not had family that stepped in and helped us I dread to think where we would be,"" said the 42-year-old. ""We were lucky with that, but on another side we'd always lived very comfortably and very well and to all of a sudden have no income whatsoever, it was a massive shock and very upsetting and caused us lots of sleepless nights and stress."" Mrs Price said she has paid her taxes for 10 years and feels like he has been told ""sorry, tough luck"" Mrs Price said she paid her taxes as a self-employed hairdresser ""on time every year for 10 years"" but because of an ""admin error"" she had effectively been told ""sorry, tough luck"". She added: ""I got to that point where it was getting that I was asking for handouts off my parents a lot and I didn't know how this was going to go on for."" Getting an estate agency job has given her ""security"" again, but she said closing her business was painful. ""It has caused me great distress and upset to actually lose something that I've spent 10 years building.

Apple investigated over 'unfair' App Store claims,"Fortnite and Apple have been locked in legal battle since August The UK's Competition and Markets Authority has launched an investigation into whether Apple's terms for app developers are anti-competitive. It follows a series of complaints, including a high-profile one from Epic Games, the developer of Fortnite. Some developers are unhappy that they are forced to distribute apps to iPhones and iPads via the App Store, and the commission Apple takes. Apple said its terms were ""fair and equal"". The investigation will consider whether Apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices and look at whether it imposes unfair terms on developers. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: ""Millions of us use apps every day to check the weather, play a game or order a takeaway. So complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice - potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps - warrant careful scrutiny."" In response, Apple said: ""We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish. The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place - applied fairly and equally to all developers - to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent. ""We look forward to working with the UK Competition and Markets Authority to explain how our guidelines for privacy, security and content have made the App Store a trusted marketplace for both consumers and developers."" Fortnite-maker sues Apple and Google in UK Apple fires back in Fortnite App Store battle Epic Games has launched a legal action against Apple and Google in the US, after both removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores. The row centred on the up to 30% cut both the tech giants take when people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store, as well as the difficulty in launching a mobile app without submitting to both companies' app store rules. In August Epic bypassed the Apple and Google stores to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, directly from it, resulting in an immediate ban from both stores. The row has attracted the attention of both regulators and politicians. Arizona's state House of Representatives passed a law this week which prohibits Apple and Google, and any other app store exceeding one million downloads, from demanding developers based in the state exclusively use its app stores. The law also covers users living in the state, but it is not yet clear how it will affect companies headquartered in other states but conducting sales in Arizona. It will now be handed to the state Senate for approval. In Europe, Apple is facing two investigations into whether it has broken competition rules, one of which relates to its app store policies.

Germany to approve AstraZeneca jab for over-65s,"Germany's vaccine commission has approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in people aged over 65. The country previously approved it for under-65s only, citing insufficient data on its effects on older people. That led to public scepticism about its effectiveness, with some Germans spurning it and leaving many doses unused. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said recent studies had now provided enough data to approve it for all ages. Announcing the commission's decision on Thursday, Health Minister Jens Spahn said the move was ""good news for older people who are waiting for an injection"". ""The new data also shows that the vaccine is even more effective when the first and second jabs are administered 12 weeks apart,"" the minister said, adding that the law would be updated to incorporate the new recommendations. Mrs Merkel said on Wednesday that Germany would follow the UK example of stretching the interval between vaccine doses in order to offer as many people as possible an initial shot. France approves AstraZeneca vaccine for over-65s What's behind France's AstraZeneca turnaround? Oxford vaccine does protect older people, Europe told Various studies have shown the AstraZeneca vaccine is highly effective among the elderly. Belgium says it will also approve the vaccine for older people, following France earlier this week. About 5% of Germans have so far received a first vaccine shot. The EU's medical regulator approved the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for all age groups in January. But the rollout was met by some public scepticism after regulators in countries including France, Belgium and Italy recommended that it should not be used for people over 65. Like Germany, they citied insufficient data on its efficacy for older people. In January French President Emmanuel Macron said the jab was ""quasi-ineffective"" for older age groups - a suggestion strongly refuted by the UK government and British medical regulators. The debate came amid an acrimonious dispute between AstraZeneca and the EU over vaccine supplies to member states. Since then, stocks of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab have gone unused in several European countries, slowing vaccination efforts. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared Meanwhile the UK - which approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab for all age groups - has offered a first dose of a vaccine to 20.7 million people, almost a third of its population. Last week Carsten Watzl, head of the German Society for Immunology, urged his country to change its mind on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. In an interview with the BBC, he predicted regulators would have to reverse their decision to not recommend the jab for older people and suggested Mrs Merkel should take the vaccine live on TV to prove it is safe. Separately, Mrs Merkel said she had agreed to a phased easing of restrictions with leaders of Germany's federal states but added that there was the option of an ""emergency brake"" if case numbers got out of control. ""We are at the threshold of a new phase of the pandemic that we can go into not carelessly but still with justified hope,"" Mrs Merkel said. From Monday up to five people from two households will be allowed to meet, with children under 14 exempt. Some shops will reopen provided that regional case numbers are below 50 per 100,00 people. If cases rise over 50 per 100,000 then customers will have to book slots to visit shops. If cases rise to over 100 per 100,000 over three days in a row then restrictions will be reimposed. The UK has been using the vaccine made by AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, in its mass immunisation programme since December. UK health officials say it provides ""high levels of protection"" for all ages. Covid vaccines cut risk of serious illness by 80% No one who received the vaccine in trials was admitted to hospital or became seriously ill with Covid-19. The vaccine is given via two injections to the arm, the second between four and 12 weeks after the first.

EU 'can't trust' UK in post-Brexit talks,"The UK has said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks DUP leader Arlene Foster has accused the Irish government of ""ignoring"" unionist concerns over the NI Protocol. It comes after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks. On Wednesday, Number 10 saidit would unilaterally extend grace periodsfor Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law. But Sinn FÃ©in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said it was the British government ""acting in bad faith"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and could be solved. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? The first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October. Earlier, Mr Coveney said progress was being made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's move could not be worse. But Mrs Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference that the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market. ""It was clear last week that the European Commission was not listening to what was going on in Northern Ireland, there was a need to act,"" she added. ""I have to say Simon Coveney should reflect on his comments, he's not listening to the unionist people of Northern Ireland, he's ignoring them, hoping we'll go away - well we'll not go away."" She said the British government had indicated a ""step-change"" in its approach to dealing with the protocol, but that the DUP would continue to press for an alternative to be drawn up. But Ms O'Neill, Stormont's Deputy First Minister and Mrs Foster's power-sharing partner, said the British government had shown it was ""not true to their word when it comes to negotiations"". ""In this case I believe they're on the wrong side of public opinion and international law,"" she added. ""The action was completely unnecessary, what the British government has done is another solo run."" She said she believed negotiations on resolving protocol issues should continue through the UK-EU joint committee, which is scheduled to meet again before the end of March. Simon Coveney said progress was being made over the Northern Ireland Protocol However, speaking during a visit to Middlesbrough, the prime minister said: ""We're taking some temporary technical measures to ensure there are no barriers in the Irish Sea, to make sure things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect. ""I'm sure that with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable."" Later, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was about ""doing the right thing for consumers and businesses"" in NI. ""Sadly the EU hasn't been able to work on a timeframe that works for the supply lines of, for example supermarkets, so we had to make a decision to ensure that we could see a continued flow of products and that supermarkets' supply lines could continue to flow,"" he said. ""If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time. The European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote on the EU-UK trade deal in protest at what the EU sees as the UK's unilateral changes. EU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday. Mr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar, who is Ireland's tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), said the UK's actions were neither the way a friend, nor ""a respectable, honourable country"", should behave. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saidthe EU's recent move to trigger Article 16showed ""very clearly that it remains within their remit to take unilateral action to protect the EU's single market"". ""Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK Government has the same power - to act unilaterally to protect the integrity of the UK internal market and trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. The EU reversed its Article 16 move within hours of taking the action, followingcondemnation from Belfast, London and Dublin. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ later described the move as a mistake which had been made in the ""intensity of the moment"" oftrying to secure Covid-19 vaccines,external. The move by the UK government to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks put Ireland in an uncomfortable position. Mr Coveney said Ireland was lobbying at the EU level to obtain easements on trade between GB and Northern Ireland. Other Irish MEPs have written to the European Commission calling for an extension. But there will be other member states who will be reluctant to offer any concessions if the UK is going to ride rough-shod over the process. So what could be the end game? The two sides will continue negotiating. The EU says it is looking at legal avenues open to it under both the withdrawal agreement and the wider UK-EU agreement. However, the UK may question what practical steps the EU will really take if grace periods are extended. The UK statement on Wednesday indicated the extra time gained by an extension of the grace period could be used to develop systems to ease trade between GB and NI in the long term. The UK was also at pains to say it is not walking away from the protocol, it is simply finding ways to implement it. On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the UK's move to extend grace periods amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" of the NI Protocol. He said the EU would respond in accordance with the ""legal means"" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal. Following a call on Wednesday evening between Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said ""official-level notification"" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week. Lord Frost had underlined the extension was needed for ""operational reasons"" and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith"", said a government spokesman. Further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from Britain to Northern Ireland. That is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations. The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.

Tax cut for homebuyers in Scotland to end,"A holiday on stamp duty has been extended as part of the Westminster budget - but this will not apply in Scotland A tax cut for Scottish house buyers will end as planned on 1 April, despite an extension in the Westminster budget. The starting point for land and buildings transaction tax (LBTT) was increased during the first lockdown. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes said the move had ""achieved"" its goal of supporting the recovery of the residential property market. The stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland will continue foranother three months. Last year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the tax break on house sales in England and Northern Ireland of up to Â£500,000 as part of his summer statement of measures to respond to the coronavirus crisis. Because housing and residential taxes are devolved to Holyrood, this meant there were calls for Ms Forbes to mirror the stamp duty cut in its Scottish equivalent, LBTT. How does the Westminster Budget affect Scots? Stamp duty holiday extended in England and NI What was set out in the Scottish budget? At the time, Ms Forbes said she had listened to calls and the threshold where the tax kicks in was raised from Â£145,000 to Â£250,000 - although this did not apply to second homes. She announced levels would return to normal at the end of the financial year when she set out theScottish budget in January., saying support would continue for first time buyers. Kate Forbes announced the Scottish budget in January On Wednesday, the chancellor said the tax break in England and Northern Ireland would continue until the end of June. After that, the nil rate band will be set at Â£250,000 - double its standard level - until the end of September. Mr Sunak told MPs the extra move was ""to smooth the transition back to normal - and we will only return to the usual level of Â£125,000 from October 1"". Ms Forbes told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland she intended to ""stick to the original plan"" and end the relief by April. She said: ""It was intended to support the recovery of the residential property market this financial year. ""That has been achieved - the nil rate band was already lower in Scotland and yet we've seen record high levels of transactions and house purchases, so it has achieved its purpose. ""But ultimately, when it comes to tax policy, I have choices and the number one ask from business was to extend the 100% relief for non-domestic rates - that's what I've done alongside freezing council tax to help households in need."" On the Westminster budget, Ms Forbes said ""storm clouds of austerity"" were on the horizon and that despite a number of positive measures including the extension of the furlough scheme, Mr Sunak was ""delaying a lot of the pain until next year"". Mr Sunak said the problems caused by coronavirus were ""not going to be dealt with overnight"" Mr Sunak told the programme that there was an increase of Â£400bn to Â£500bn by end of this Parliament in his public spending plans. He said: ""The damage coronavirus has done to our economy and public finances has been extraordinary and it's going to take time for us to fully recover from this. ""It's not going to be dealt with overnight and that's why we've set out a clear plan that begins to fix the problem and protect the things we care about, like public services and supporting small businesses and crucially supporting our recovery in the short term.""

Amazon till-less grocery store opens in London,"This video can not be played WATCH: BBC's Emma Simpson visited Amazon's new till-less shop Amazon has opened a till-less grocery store in London - its first ""just walk out"" shop outside the US. Visitors to Amazon Fresh scan a smartphone app when entering and are automatically billed as they leave. The store stocks hundreds of own-brand items as well as third-party products, and also serves as a place to collect and return goods bought online. Campaigners have raised privacy concerns but one retail expert said the opening marked a ""watershed moment"". ""Having a physical presence will enable Amazon to address some of its weaknesses, like the mounting cost of deliveries and returns,"" said Natalie Berg, an analyst with NBK Retail. Much of the technology involved is located in the ceiling But she said she did not believe it would pose a threat to the major chains in the near term. ""Supermarkets have had a few years now to prepare and test their own checkout-free shopping concepts."" Amazon's approach, however, promises a more ""frictionless"" experience than other retailers. Visitors only have to place an item in a bag or otherwise carry it out to be charged by the store, which is located at the street entrance of a shopping centre in the borough of Ealing. By contrast,retailers including Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury'srequire consumers to scan items into a smartphone or other device. The US firm is so confident of its tech that it says shoppers are not under any obligation to check all the items were accounted for. ""When you're finished, you're free to walk out,"" said Matt Birch, director of Amazon Fresh Stores and an ex-Sainsbury's executive. Visitors can buy a bag or use their own, and are emailed a copy of their receipt after leaving The technology involved was pioneered at the firm's similar Amazon Go stores in the States, which opened to the public in 2018. However, recent advancements mean the system can now cope with customers selecting from different bouquets of flowers, magazines and greetings cards - it could not distinguish accurately enough between one choice and another before. It involves the use of hundreds of cameras and depth-sensors, and software developed using deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques. However, it does not involve facial recognition. Amazon tracks each customer as they move around the shop Instead, users must identify themselves on arrival by scanning a barcode displayed within their account on the standard Amazon Shopping app. One civil liberties group has raised concerns. ""[It] offers a dystopian, total-surveillance shopping experience,"" said Silkie Carlo, from Big Brother Watch. ""Amazon's intense tracking of shoppers will create larger personal data footprints than any other retailer. Customers deserve to know how and by whom these records and analytics could be used."" The company has said it will only associate information collected in-store with a customer's Amazon account for up to 30 days, and has furtherdetails about how it uses the data on its privacy site,external. Amazon said it had sourced many of its own-brand groceries - including milk and eggs - from UK suppliers itself. In addition, it has launched an ""Our Selection"" sub-brand for ""premium"" products including desserts. Other items come from Morrisons and Booths, supermarkets with whom its has pre-existing ties. The store also contains a booth where orders can be delivered from its online store. And customers can return goods by scanning a code without having to repackage or relabel the item. ""Hand the product over and we'll do the rest for you,"" said Mr Birch, adding he plans further stores on some of London other high streets as well as its city centre. Marks & Spencer announced in November it was expanding use of its ""scan, pay and go"" service to all its UK grocery stores The Ealing store's customer area covers about 2,500 sq foot (232 sq m) in total, which is much smaller than a typical supermarket. Amazon also operates seven Whole Foods Market supermarkets in the UK. And there have been persistent rumours that it might try to expand further in the sector by buying one of the larger chains. However, the company is also offering to sell itsJust Walk Out technology,externalas a service that can be installed in other companies' stores. And ultimately it might decide there is more money to be made pitching this to the established supermarkets than challenging them head-on with bigger stores of its own. Amazon has barely made a dent in the overall UK grocery market, but it's clearly got big ambitions for food. It's been ramping up its online service, with free same-day deliveries for Prime members, putting pressure on rivals. The traditional supermarkets have been improving their technology over the past few years and the pandemic has accelerated the changes. Sainsbury's, for instance, has had a huge take-up in its SmartShop system where shoppers can pick up a handset and scan items as they go. Amazon technology removes checkouts and friction altogether. Users must scan a QR barcode on their smartphone as they enter Moving into bricks and mortar is another milestone for Amazon. Its new range of own-branded products is also eye-catching. When it comes to convenience stores, being able to grab and go could prove very popular. But location is key. And most of the best convenience-store sites in densely populated, urban districts have already been taken. This launch won't pose a big, immediate, threat to the big established grocers but they know only too well that Amazon has the potential to be a hugely disruptive force and has already forced them to up their game.

Ryan Thomas quits acting after 'losing the bug',"Ryan Thomas has appeared in Coronation Street and Neighbours, as well as winning Celebrity Big Brother Former Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas has announced he is quitting acting, after having ""really lost the bug for it"". Thomas starred as Jason Grimshaw in the Weatherfield-based soap from 2000 to 2016, before popping up in the Australian soap Neighbours. More recently he was crowned as 2018's Celebrity Big Brother winner. Speaking to theMancs On The Mic,externalpodcast, Ryan admitted he had become tired of being rejected for roles. ""It's so hard for me,"" he said. ""I started off acting, I started off in that game and I really lost the bug for it. ""I feel the reason for losing the bug is rejection and going to auditions and not getting them."" Ryan Thomas wins Celebrity Big Brother Roxanne Pallett: 'I apologise to Ryan' Speaking to his brothers and podcast hosts, Adam Thomas - the former Waterloo Road and Emmerdale actor - and Love Island personality Scott Thomas, he added that receiving ""negative comments"" from trolls online had also influenced his decision. ""I've never had that before because social media wasn't around,"" he continued. ""I never got it in Corrie because I never had social media when I was in Corrie. If I did, it was at the end but I was so established there that people saw me as fixtures and fittings, so I never really got that sort of negative criticism. ""It happens in all aspects but I just found it really, really hard to deal with at first. I always think, 'Oh, it'll [the desire to act] come back at some point and maybe it will, and it's still something that I have in my locker if I want to explore it again. Right now I'm really happy with the direction I'm going."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Jason Grimshaw became a suspect in the latter's murder, and ultimately left for Thailand. In 2018, Thomas appeared as Rafael Humphreys in Neighbours' Hit & Run special. Later that year, Thomas's Celebrity Big Brother housemate Roxanne Pallett publicly apologised to him, saying she had ""overreacted"" when he ""punched"" her on the show. She said: ""I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation."" Last year, the three brothers confronted the issue of their absent father in an ITV documentary. Thomas recently revealed on social media he is now doing food deliveries for Adam's restaurant, near Stockport. The 36-year-old went on to say that making regular trips home to Manchester to also see his daughter Scarlett - whose mother is his ex-girlfriend and former Corrie colleague Tina O'Brien - had ""put a strain"" on his relationship with his fiancÃ©e and former TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh. Thomas and Mecklenburgh live in Essex with their baby son Roman. ""There is that trying to find a mix of making both work, and working out where you're going to end,"" he said. ""I think eventually I'd like to be in Manchester with both my kids, but at the moment it's having that help at hand in London, it's just easier, but I think eventually I would love to be back where I started, with all my brothers and all our kids.

'Scrooge Sunak not levelling with people' on cuts,"Campaign groups say half a million people risk being dragged into poverty Public spending cuts in Rishi Sunak's Budget mean the chancellor ""isn't really levelling with people"", the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has warned. The Treasury said the cuts, worth Â£4bn, were ""a purely mechanical change"", but Paul Johnson of the IFS said they were set to cause more pain. At the same time, big tax rises were ""screeching U-turns"", Mr Johnson said. ""Santa Sunak"" was now looking more like ""Scrooge Sunak"", he added. Meanwhile, ""pressure will mount"" on Mr Sunak not to cut universal credit by Â£20 a week after September, Mr Johnson said. He said that going for such a ""cliff-edge reduction"" was ""remarkable"". In his post-Budget analysis, Mr Johnson highlighted freezes in income tax allowances and rises in corporation tax. The corporation tax rise to 25% would take the UK ""well up the international league table"" for revenues, he said, but it was ""50-50 at best"" whether it would actually happen without additional concessions. ""This was, of course, a tale of two Budgets,"" said Mr Johnson in response to Mr Sunak's economic plans. ""By the end of the forecast period, we are looking at a fiscal tightening of over Â£30bn relative to previous plans. ""Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today, looks more like Scrooge Sunak, cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly Â£50bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020."" Budget tax changes fair, says Sunak Ten ways the Budget will affect you Are you receiving universal credit?  Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

You can also get in touch in the following ways: WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803 Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Upload pictures or video Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The income tax allowance freezes were set to raise about Â£9bn, while the corporation tax changes could see revenues rise by more than Â£17bn by 2025, Mr Johnson said. He was sceptical that the plans to cut a further Â£4bn from public spending could be delivered, saying they would cause ""additional pain"" if they went ahead. ""Now these are not firm plans, but they are the basis for the future public finance estimates. They are a very shaky basis,"" Mr Johnson said. ""This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances."" The 24 hours after a Budget can be a perilous time for a chancellor. They can be undone even on the back of relatively small tax rises, let alone the biggest ones in more than a quarter of a century. The ""post-match"" analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies can condemn a Budget in the history books. The chancellor has a massive challenge and a tumultuous uncertain backdrop, but he has the benefit of a solid majority, unlike his recent predecessors. So it is with some relief that Number 11 will have seen the analysis of the respected institute and others such as the Resolution Foundation. They point to plenty of gaps. The plans imply further cuts to unprotected public spending. That includes social care spending within local authorities, for example. There is some doubt that the hike in corporation tax will really yield Â£17bn a year. Difficulties here, or in the post-pandemic recovery in general, will lead to further spending squeezes and tax rises. However, it is not really possible to assert that unequivocally. The chancellor has not constrained himself to meet borrowing targets as part of a set of rules. He outlined some principles around borrowing only to invest. But if he were facing pressure to increase taxes further in the year before an election, for example, it is equally plausible that higher-than-expected borrowing would take the strain. The world is too uncertain to be wearing fiscal straitjackets. And every time it has been required, on more than a dozen occasions, the chancellor has extended spending on rescue support schemes. That has set up an expectation about, for instance, the new expiry of the Â£20 uplift to Universal Credit in October (now extended by six months). As Paul Johnson of the IFS puts it: ""He has given us a sense of where he wants to go [on fixing the public finances], but he still has a lot of work to do and his spending plans in particular don't look deliverable, at least not without considerable pain."" That argument will be settled in the run-up to a Spending Review. If anything, the medium-term pressures on public services will be higher, reflecting issues such as big NHS waiting lists. For now, the Budget has achieved its two strategic aims: borrowing more now to extend immediate crisis support, then post-dating a huge cheque, paid for mainly by big business, to cover part of the bill. Most of the other parts in these plans can move and, if necessary, dramatically so. Mr Johnson also criticised Mr Sunak's universal credit changes. ""It is, by the way, remarkable that while the chancellor felt the need for a gradual phase out of furlough, business rates support, stamp duty reductions and VAT reductions, he is still set on a cliff-edge reduction in [universal credit] such that incomes of some of the poorest families will fall by over Â£80 between one month and the next. ""Whatever the case for cutting generosity into the longer term, if you're going to do so, the case for doing it gradually rather than all at once looks unanswerable."" In a BBC interview, the chancellor rejected suggestions that he should have tapered the ending of the Â£20-a-week universal credit increase in order to minimise its effect on families. ""We have extended it generously and in full, but it's important to remember that it's one of many things that we're doing to support people,"" Mr Sunak said. These included increases in the National Living Wage and offering help with council tax payments, he added. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says it will take ""the work of many years, decades and governments"" to pay back Covid debt Earlier, the government came under fire from campaigners for doing too little in the Budget to address inequality. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation said the cut in universal credit would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s. It would also pull half a million people into poverty, just as unemployment was expected to peak. Mr Sunak's decision to spend even larger sums to support the economic recovery now and put off raising taxes until later was broadly welcomed in the Resolution Foundation's analysis of the Budget. But it noted that while GDP is set to grow this year by 4%, that might not feed through to better living standards, with wages by the middle of the decade set to remain Â£1,200 a year - or 4.3% - below where they would have been without the coronavirus pandemic. Austerity would drag on for some, it added, with day-to-day spending on government departments such as transport and local government set to fall in real terms next year and remain almost a quarter lower than a decade ago. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, said the universal credit changes meant single recipients of it would see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week, just as the furlough scheme is ended and unemployment was expected to rise to its peak, the foundation said. It predicted that would pull half a million people into poverty, including 200,000 children, adding that the Budget was silent on helping 700,000 households who have fallen behind on rent because of the pandemic and are now at risk of eviction. Responding to the Resolution Foundation's analysis, Mr Sunak told the BBC that it had hailed his decision to freeze income tax thresholds as a ""progressive measure"" and ""a fair way to do what we need to do"".

Texas ending mask rules is 'Neanderthal thinking'President Biden criticises moves to relax Covid restrictions in the southern state and Mississippi.,"This video can not be played President Biden: End of Texas mask mandate is ""Neanderthal thinking"" President Joe Biden has criticised the lifting of mask requirements in the states of Texas and Mississippi, calling it ""Neanderthal thinking"". ""I think it's a big mistake,"" he said. Masks, social distancing and other measures were still important, despite the role vaccines were playing in containing the pandemic, he said. Texas and Mississippi will also allow all businesses to open at full capacity. Other states have announced a relaxation of some rules. The US has recorded 28.7 million infections and 519,000 deaths related to Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Biden calls 500,000 death toll a heartbreaking milestone Imagining what 500,000 lost lives look like Covid-19 variants pose 'real threat' to vaccine progress, CDC warns Some 78 million vaccine doses have been administered but Mr Biden said this was not a reason to end public health measures. ""The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime everything's fine, take off your mask, forget it,"" Mr Biden said. ""It still matters."" Senior health officials in his administration have warned about the continued spread of the virus - and highly contagious variants of it - hampering the progress of the country's vaccination programme. ""Now is not the time to release all restrictions,"" Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said.

""It is clear from the recoveries, the vaccinations, the reduced hospitalisations, and the safe practices that Texans are using, that state mandates are no longer needed. We must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for Texans."" Individual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel. About 35 states required face coverings to be worn in public places, although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy.

EU 'can't trust' UK in post-Brexit talksIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney says the EU is being driven towards legal action by the UK.,"The UK has said it will unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks DUP leader Arlene Foster has accused the Irish government of ""ignoring"" unionist concerns over the NI Protocol. It comes after Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the EU could not trust the UK in post-Brexit talks. On Wednesday, Number 10 saidit would unilaterally extend grace periodsfor Irish Sea border checks, a move the EU said was a breach of international law. But Sinn FÃ©in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said it was the British government ""acting in bad faith"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the problems were technical and could be solved. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. What are Brexit border controls between GB and NI? The first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October. Earlier, Mr Coveney said progress was being made on the protocol and the timing of the UK's move could not be worse. But Mrs Foster, Northern Ireland's first minister, told a news conference that the British government had a commitment to protect the UK's internal market. ""It was clear last week that the European Commission was not listening to what was going on in Northern Ireland, there was a need to act,"" she added. ""I have to say Simon Coveney should reflect on his comments, he's not listening to the unionist people of Northern Ireland, he's ignoring them, hoping we'll go away - well we'll not go away."" She said the British government had indicated a ""step-change"" in its approach to dealing with the protocol, but that the DUP would continue to press for an alternative to be drawn up. But Ms O'Neill, Stormont's Deputy First Minister and Mrs Foster's power-sharing partner, said the British government had shown it was ""not true to their word when it comes to negotiations"". ""In this case I believe they're on the wrong side of public opinion and international law,"" she added. ""The action was completely unnecessary, what the British government has done is another solo run."" She said she believed negotiations on resolving protocol issues should continue through the UK-EU joint committee, which is scheduled to meet again before the end of March. Simon Coveney said progress was being made over the Northern Ireland Protocol However, speaking during a visit to Middlesbrough, the prime minister said: ""We're taking some temporary technical measures to ensure there are no barriers in the Irish Sea, to make sure things flow freely from GB to NI and that's what you'd expect. ""I'm sure that with a bit of goodwill and common sense all these technical problems are eminently solvable."" Later, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said it was about ""doing the right thing for consumers and businesses"" in NI. ""Sadly the EU hasn't been able to work on a timeframe that works for the supply lines of, for example supermarkets, so we had to make a decision to ensure that we could see a continued flow of products and that supermarkets' supply lines could continue to flow,"" he said. ""If we'd have left it any longer we'd have had a risk for businesses and livelihoods of people in just a few weeks time. The European Parliament has declined to set a date for its vote on the EU-UK trade deal in protest at what the EU sees as the UK's unilateral changes. EU parliament group chiefs had been expected to set a date this month for its vote at a meeting on Thursday. Mr Coveney's party leader Leo Varadkar, who is Ireland's tÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister), said the UK's actions were neither the way a friend, nor ""a respectable, honourable country"", should behave. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saidthe EU's recent move to trigger Article 16showed ""very clearly that it remains within their remit to take unilateral action to protect the EU's single market"". ""Under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the UK Government has the same power - to act unilaterally to protect the integrity of the UK internal market and trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. The EU reversed its Article 16 move within hours of taking the action, followingcondemnation from Belfast, London and Dublin. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ later described the move as a mistake which had been made in the ""intensity of the moment"" oftrying to secure Covid-19 vaccines,external. The move by the UK government to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks put Ireland in an uncomfortable position. Mr Coveney said Ireland was lobbying at the EU level to obtain easements on trade between GB and Northern Ireland. Other Irish MEPs have written to the European Commission calling for an extension. But there will be other member states who will be reluctant to offer any concessions if the UK is going to ride rough-shod over the process. So what could be the end game? The two sides will continue negotiating. The EU says it is looking at legal avenues open to it under both the withdrawal agreement and the wider UK-EU agreement. However, the UK may question what practical steps the EU will really take if grace periods are extended. The UK statement on Wednesday indicated the extra time gained by an extension of the grace period could be used to develop systems to ease trade between GB and NI in the long term. The UK was also at pains to say it is not walking away from the protocol, it is simply finding ways to implement it. On Wednesday, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the UK's move to extend grace periods amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" of the NI Protocol. He said the EU would respond in accordance with the ""legal means"" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal. Following a call on Wednesday evening between Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said ""official-level notification"" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week. Lord Frost had underlined the extension was needed for ""operational reasons"" and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith"", said a government spokesman. Further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from Britain to Northern Ireland. That is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations. The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Sunak plans 'mean that inequality will worsen',"Campaign groups say half a million people risk being dragged into poverty Public spending cuts in Rishi Sunak's Budget mean the chancellor ""isn't really levelling with people"", the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has warned. The Treasury said the cuts, worth Â£4bn, were ""a purely mechanical change"", but Paul Johnson of the IFS said they were set to cause more pain. At the same time, big tax rises were ""screeching U-turns"", Mr Johnson said. ""Santa Sunak"" was now looking more like ""Scrooge Sunak"", he added. Meanwhile, ""pressure will mount"" on Mr Sunak not to cut universal credit by Â£20 a week after September, Mr Johnson said. He said that going for such a ""cliff-edge reduction"" was ""remarkable"". In his post-Budget analysis, Mr Johnson highlighted freezes in income tax allowances and rises in corporation tax. The corporation tax rise to 25% would take the UK ""well up the international league table"" for revenues, he said, but it was ""50-50 at best"" whether it would actually happen without additional concessions. ""This was, of course, a tale of two Budgets,"" said Mr Johnson in response to Mr Sunak's economic plans. ""By the end of the forecast period, we are looking at a fiscal tightening of over Â£30bn relative to previous plans. ""Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today, looks more like Scrooge Sunak, cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly Â£50bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020."" Budget tax changes fair, says Sunak Ten ways the Budget will affect you Are you receiving universal credit?  Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

You can also get in touch in the following ways: WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803 Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Upload pictures or video Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy The income tax allowance freezes were set to raise about Â£9bn, while the corporation tax changes could see revenues rise by more than Â£17bn by 2025, Mr Johnson said. He was sceptical that the plans to cut a further Â£4bn from public spending could be delivered, saying they would cause ""additional pain"" if they went ahead. ""Now these are not firm plans, but they are the basis for the future public finance estimates. They are a very shaky basis,"" Mr Johnson said. ""This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances."" The 24 hours after a Budget can be a perilous time for a chancellor. They can be undone even on the back of relatively small tax rises, let alone the biggest ones in more than a quarter of a century. The ""post-match"" analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies can condemn a Budget in the history books. The chancellor has a massive challenge and a tumultuous uncertain backdrop, but he has the benefit of a solid majority, unlike his recent predecessors. So it is with some relief that Number 11 will have seen the analysis of the respected institute and others such as the Resolution Foundation. They point to plenty of gaps. The plans imply further cuts to unprotected public spending. That includes social care spending within local authorities, for example. There is some doubt that the hike in corporation tax will really yield Â£17bn a year. Difficulties here, or in the post-pandemic recovery in general, will lead to further spending squeezes and tax rises. However, it is not really possible to assert that unequivocally. The chancellor has not constrained himself to meet borrowing targets as part of a set of rules. He outlined some principles around borrowing only to invest. But if he were facing pressure to increase taxes further in the year before an election, for example, it is equally plausible that higher-than-expected borrowing would take the strain. The world is too uncertain to be wearing fiscal straitjackets. And every time it has been required, on more than a dozen occasions, the chancellor has extended spending on rescue support schemes. That has set up an expectation about, for instance, the new expiry of the Â£20 uplift to Universal Credit in October (now extended by six months). As Paul Johnson of the IFS puts it: ""He has given us a sense of where he wants to go [on fixing the public finances], but he still has a lot of work to do and his spending plans in particular don't look deliverable, at least not without considerable pain."" That argument will be settled in the run-up to a Spending Review. If anything, the medium-term pressures on public services will be higher, reflecting issues such as big NHS waiting lists. For now, the Budget has achieved its two strategic aims: borrowing more now to extend immediate crisis support, then post-dating a huge cheque, paid for mainly by big business, to cover part of the bill. Most of the other parts in these plans can move and, if necessary, dramatically so. Mr Johnson also criticised Mr Sunak's universal credit changes. ""It is, by the way, remarkable that while the chancellor felt the need for a gradual phase out of furlough, business rates support, stamp duty reductions and VAT reductions, he is still set on a cliff-edge reduction in [universal credit] such that incomes of some of the poorest families will fall by over Â£80 between one month and the next. ""Whatever the case for cutting generosity into the longer term, if you're going to do so, the case for doing it gradually rather than all at once looks unanswerable."" In a BBC interview, the chancellor rejected suggestions that he should have tapered the ending of the Â£20-a-week universal credit increase in order to minimise its effect on families. ""We have extended it generously and in full, but it's important to remember that it's one of many things that we're doing to support people,"" Mr Sunak said. These included increases in the National Living Wage and offering help with council tax payments, he added. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says it will take ""the work of many years, decades and governments"" to pay back Covid debt Earlier, the government came under fire from campaigners for doing too little in the Budget to address inequality. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation said the cut in universal credit would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s. It would also pull half a million people into poverty, just as unemployment was expected to peak. Mr Sunak's decision to spend even larger sums to support the economic recovery now and put off raising taxes until later was broadly welcomed in the Resolution Foundation's analysis of the Budget. But it noted that while GDP is set to grow this year by 4%, that might not feed through to better living standards, with wages by the middle of the decade set to remain Â£1,200 a year - or 4.3% - below where they would have been without the coronavirus pandemic. Austerity would drag on for some, it added, with day-to-day spending on government departments such as transport and local government set to fall in real terms next year and remain almost a quarter lower than a decade ago. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, said the universal credit changes meant single recipients of it would see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week, just as the furlough scheme is ended and unemployment was expected to rise to its peak, the foundation said. It predicted that would pull half a million people into poverty, including 200,000 children, adding that the Budget was silent on helping 700,000 households who have fallen behind on rent because of the pandemic and are now at risk of eviction. Responding to the Resolution Foundation's analysis, Mr Sunak told the BBC that it had hailed his decision to freeze income tax thresholds as a ""progressive measure"" and ""a fair way to do what we need to do"".

"'I should be celebrating but I'm finding it hard'There's more support for many in the Budget, but for some it still falls short.","Freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij says she is relieved to be receiving more help but knows many others aren't Across the UK a lot of people breathed a sigh of relief when Rishi Sunak announced his Budget on Wednesday. Furlough was extended. There was more money for businesses scrambling to stay afloat. And for people relying on universal credit, the extra Â£20 added last year will stay for now. But for people like freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij the chancellor's announcements prompted mixed emotions. ""I'm in limbo. I feel I should celebrating but I'm finding it hard to,"" she says. This time last year Ester wasn't eligible for a self-employed income support grant because she had only just started her business. She is now, following the Budget, finally able to claim some support. But she's ""absolutely furious"" that so many others are still falling through the net. She was also relieved to hear from Rishi Sunak that the Universal Credit top-up would stay for another six months. ""It's welcome news that it wasn't taken away. Without that Â£20 I wouldn't be able to cover my rent. It's the difference between a roof over my head and not,"" she says. But it feels like ""the bare minimum"" you could expect, not as much as she would have hoped for, she says, ""quite bittersweet"". Alan and Becky McEwan are grateful for the extension to furlough For Alan and Becky McEwan on the other hand the Budget news was ""a massive relief"". Becky runs a cake company, which is going well, but Alan manages a restaurant in Stirling and has been on furlough for much of last year. ""The 80% furlough has been a godsend for us,"" says Alan. ""What the government has done for us, we're really grateful for it."" He's had to shield while he waited for a cancerous tumour to be removed in January, then picked up Covid while in hospital undergoing treatment. Alan loves working in hospitality, and he hopes to be back by the time the restaurant reopens, but it's a huge help knowing that furlough has been extended until September in case he still isn't strong enough, or if the roadmap out of lockdown is delayed. ""It takes the worry off doesn't it? It's a massive strain off our shoulders."" Oliver Holt is hoping Rishi Sunak's drive for more apprenticeships will benefit him Oliver Holt in Thornton, Blackpool, hopes what he heard in the Budget will be good news for him. The 20-year-old is about to leave college with a level 3 certificate in mechanics and has been applying for apprenticeships, but so far without luck. Rishi Sunak announced a boost in funding for employers that take on apprentices, raising the support from Â£2,000 per young person taken on to Â£3,000. ""It's a great idea,"" Oliver says. ""It should mean you'll see a rise in garages taking on apprentices."" ""I'm super-keen, I'm nearly at the end of my course at college and wondering what might be available and when. ""I'm hoping something will come from this. I've applied for so many different ones and every time I've either had an email or they don't get back to me at all. ""I'm finding it really difficult at the moment to be honest."" For Louise King it was a budget of two halves. She owns a hairdressing salon, Wilderness Hair, in Liverpool, that turned to making shampoo when it couldn't open. ""We really welcomed the roadmap out of lockdown, the restart grants for Â£18,000,"" she says. And she agrees spending more on apprentices is a good idea, although it only applies to new apprentices and she already has two. ""But what we are really disappointed about is our industry is not getting the VAT cut like the hospitality industry,"" she says. Hairdressers had lobbied for the same treatment as bars and restaurants. ""We are still paying the full 20%. It's quite upsetting that our voice is not being heard,"" Louise says. ""If I'm being honest it's a mixed bag of emotions,"" she says ""There's still a rocky road ahead."" Tabi Marsh would have liked the chancellor to have given small businesses like hers more breathing space ""Business rates was more of a shocker than we'd expected it to be,"" says Tabi Marsh, owner of gift shop and cafe Papilio in Thornbury. Before the Budget the idea of having to pay full business rates again, was making Tabi wonder whether the business would have to close. Then she heard Scotland was extending its business rates holiday for a whole year, and she got her hopes up that the chancellor might do the same for England. Instead she's got three more months rate-free, then at the start of July has to start paying them again, although at a much reduced rate. ""It's a shame they're not following Scotland's lead,"" she says. The extension of furlough is a help and she's expecting a re-opening grant of around Â£12,000 to help retrain staff and restock the cafe. But she knows it will take some time for trade to return to normal, meanwhile minimum wage rises and Brexit mean costs have gone up. She's not sure yet whether Rishi Sunak's additional measures will be enough. ""It could be worse, but it could also be a lot better."" ""It has bought us the time to get open,"" she says. ""We will be one of the businesses that have to look again in six or nine months to see how quickly trade has rebounded.""

Previous summer series have taken place in Mallorca, butreports this week,externalsuggested ITV has identified the island of Jersey as a possible back-up. Since the series has been off air, ITV2 has been broadcasting international editions of the series in its place to fill the air time, such as Love Island Australia. The Queen and other members of the UK royal family have turned their attention to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic for a Commonwealth programme being broadcast this weekend. In a recorded message, the Queen will pay tribute to the way communities across the ""family of nations"" have ""come together"" in response to the pandemic. The Prince of Wales has recorded a message addressing ""the universal devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic"", and celebrating critical work to combat climate change.

It will be broadcast on the BBC and comes hours before an interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex airs in the US. If you're just joining us this evening, here's a round-up of what has been happening in the UK so far today. France warns that restrictions, currently in place in Nice, may be extended nationwide Surge testing will be deployed in
targeted areas of north-west London and north-east England where the South
African variant of coronavirus has been found. Additional testing and genomic sequencing will be
rolled out in the North Wembley area of the capital and theTS19 postcode area in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, according to the Department of Health. Stockton Council is opening an additional centre to help test more people from Friday. A spokesman said the South African variant is ""more infectious"" than other variants and cases need to be identified ""as quickly as possible"". Positive cases will be sequenced
for genomic data to help increase understanding of Covid variants and
their spread. People living within the targeted areas
are ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid-19 test when offered,
whether they are showing symptoms or not. It comes
as official Test and Trace figures revealed that a total of 68,738 people
tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to 24 February. This is down 19% on the previous week
and is the lowest number since the week to September 30. Wales' First MinisterMark Drakeford is self-isolatingafter coming into contact with someone who had tested positive for Covid-19. A Welsh government spokesperson says it is ""a precaution"". People are required to self-isolate for 10 days if asked to do so by contact tracers under government guidelines. Drakeford gave evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee of MPs remotely earlier this afternoon.  A care worker put 22 vulnerable people at risk bycarrying out home visits in Cardiff while she was suspected of having Covid-19, a tribunal has heard. A Care Standards hearing was told Samantha Gould made the visits in June after a GP had told her to isolate and get a test. Appealing against an 18-month suspension imposed last month, Gould has said she had ""a verbal negative"" result before the visits for Cardiff care company 1st Grade Care. The care worker told the tribunal she ""kept her distance"" and ""had an apron, gloves and mask"" during the visits. Judge Faridah Eden has dismissed her appeal, saying there is ""strong evidence that [Gould] put the public at risk"" and ""knowingly broke rules which were intended to protect the vulnerable people she was working with"". Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Scientists have identified 16
cases of another new variant of coronavirus in the UK. Public Health England has
designated it as a ""variant under investigation"", meaning it is on its watch
list but not one PHE is immediately concerned about. It does have a mutation in
common with the South Africa and Brazil variants, however. That genetic change, E484K, may
help the virus evade immune attack. It's not unexpected that
variants are appearing or that they will continue to change - all viruses
mutate as they make new copies of themselves to spread and thrive. Read more. This video can not be played Germany's AstraZeneca vaccine decision welcomed Germany's decision to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use inthe over-65shas been welcomed by the German Society for Immunology. Dr Carsten Watzl tellsBBC World News: ""Given the data that came out of Scotland and England it's been proven that it is effective and there is no question about the safety of this vaccine."" About one million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are ready to go into people's arms, he adds. A shipment of AstraZeneca doses arrived in Australia last month Italy is blocking a shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to Australia under European Union rules on vaccine exports, according to Italian media reports. It is the first ban under the scheme designed to protect vaccine supplies in the bloc. The order of 250,000 doses has been produced in an AstraZeneca factory in Anagni, near Rome, and the company has requested permission to ship the vials to Australia. With the support of the European Commission, the Italian government is refusing to allow the doses to leave. The EU and AstraZeneca have been embroiled in a large row over shortfalls in the company's delivery of doses to the bloc. AstraZeneca has blamed issues at its production plants in Europe. Australia started its rollout last week using the Pfizer jab and it is scheduled to start jabs with AstraZeneca doses on Friday. The World Health Organization has criticised the EU's scheme saying it is part of a ""worrying trend"" that could jeopardise global vaccine supply chains. Read more on the story.  A little while ago we brought you the latest UK coronavirus figures - which were 6,573 new cases and 242 further deaths. But how have things changed since this time last week? Well, Thursday 25 February saw 9,985 new positive cases reported and 323 deaths, of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. Today is the 10th consecutive day where the number of new cases has been under 10,000. The Stormont executiveagreed a five-step planfor easing the Covid-19 lockdown earlier this week. Unlike plans announced in England and Scotland, Northern Ireland's blueprint does not include a timetable. Progression will depend on certain public health criteria being met.  The executive must review its coronavirus restrictions regularly, with the next due on 16 March. The Executive Office says the plan -Moving Forward: The Executive's Pathway Out Of Restrictions,external- is a ""gradual easing of the current restrictions"". However it does not include specific detail on how the executive will measure when it is safe to reopen certain sectors. Northern Ireland's first minister says we are ""now at the point where we can begin to lift the burden [of restrictions]"". Speaking at a coronavirus press conference, Arlene Foster says the NI executive will next week assess the impact of the return to school of some children. She welcomes the fact the vaccine programme is ""significantly ahead of schedule"" and is accelerating. ""By the end of this month, the SSE Arena will have the capacity to provide 40,000 vaccines per month,"" she says. The proportion of new hospital admissions for those aged 80 or over has reduced from approximately 40% to about 20%, suggesting the vaccine rollout is having ""a real impact on protecting older people"", she adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin made the false claim while promoting Russian vaccines Russian President Vladimir Putin has wrongly claimed the death of a vaccine recipient has suspended innoculations using the Pfizer jab in parts of Europe. ""In some European
countries, Pfizer inoculations were stopped because there were lethal outcomes
there,"" Putin told a gathering of youth activists that was broadcast
live on Russian state TV channel Rossiya 24. He made the comment
after praising Russia's own vaccines as the ""safest and most
effective"" in the world. Putin appeared to be
referring to the false allegation in a video shared on social media that claimed Pfizer was halting production of
its vaccine after 23 people died in Norway. But as afact-check by the news agency Reuters,externalpointed out, Pfizer actually announced in mid-January that it was temporarily reducing
production at its facility in Puurs, Belgium, for a week as part of a plan to
increase vaccine output in the long term. In aprevious fact-check,external, the agency reported the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health had found no evidence to suggest the vaccine
was to blame for the deaths of 13 elderly recipients. Vaccine take-up in London among people aged 80 and older continues to lag behind other regions of England, the latest NHS figure show. An estimated 83.2% of people in this age group in the capital have had their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to NHS England, while uptake in other regions is thought to be at least 95%. Some 93.8% of residents of older adult care homes in England eligible to have their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine had received a jab by 28 February. But the equivalent figure for care home staff is 72.9%, while in London care homes that drops to 57.9% for eligible staff. There have been 6,573 new cases of coronavirus reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. It brings the total number of positive tests to 4,201,358. A further 242 deaths have been reported, of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths, under that measure, is now 124,025. Three men have beenarrested after ""box-loads"" of lateral flow tests meant for schools were stolenfrom a lorry. Police say all the Covid-19 tests have been retrieved since they were taken from Harlow Business Park in Essex in the early hours of Tuesday. A 31-year-old man from Canvey and a 27-year-old man from Newham have been arrested on suspicion of theft. A 37-year-old from Dagenham was arrested for the same offence, as well as on suspicion of drug driving. Ch Supt Stuart Hooper, from Essex Police, says he is ""thrilled"" the force has been able to recover the tests ""so those in need are able to keep themselves and others safe at this difficult time"".

'I should be celebrating but I'm finding it hard',"Freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij says she is relieved to be receiving more help but knows many others aren't Across the UK a lot of people breathed a sigh of relief when Rishi Sunak announced his Budget on Wednesday. Furlough was extended. There was more money for businesses scrambling to stay afloat. And for people relying on universal credit, the extra Â£20 added last year will stay for now. But for people like freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij the chancellor's announcements prompted mixed emotions. ""I'm in limbo. I feel I should celebrating but I'm finding it hard to,"" she says. This time last year Ester wasn't eligible for a self-employed income support grant because she had only just started her business. She is now, following the Budget, finally able to claim some support. But she's ""absolutely furious"" that so many others are still falling through the net. She was also relieved to hear from Rishi Sunak that the Universal Credit top-up would stay for another six months. ""It's welcome news that it wasn't taken away. Without that Â£20 I wouldn't be able to cover my rent. It's the difference between a roof over my head and not,"" she says. But it feels like ""the bare minimum"" you could expect, not as much as she would have hoped for, she says, ""quite bittersweet"". Alan and Becky McEwan are grateful for the extension to furlough For Alan and Becky McEwan on the other hand the Budget news was ""a massive relief"". Becky runs a cake company, which is going well, but Alan manages a restaurant in Stirling and has been on furlough for much of last year. ""The 80% furlough has been a godsend for us,"" says Alan. ""What the government has done for us, we're really grateful for it."" He's had to shield while he waited for a cancerous tumour to be removed in January, then picked up Covid while in hospital undergoing treatment. Alan loves working in hospitality, and he hopes to be back by the time the restaurant reopens, but it's a huge help knowing that furlough has been extended until September in case he still isn't strong enough, or if the roadmap out of lockdown is delayed. ""It takes the worry off doesn't it? It's a massive strain off our shoulders."" Oliver Holt is hoping Rishi Sunak's drive for more apprenticeships will benefit him Oliver Holt in Thornton, Blackpool, hopes what he heard in the Budget will be good news for him. The 20-year-old is about to leave college with a level 3 certificate in mechanics and has been applying for apprenticeships, but so far without luck. Rishi Sunak announced a boost in funding for employers that take on apprentices, raising the support from Â£2,000 per young person taken on to Â£3,000. ""It's a great idea,"" Oliver says. ""It should mean you'll see a rise in garages taking on apprentices."" ""I'm super-keen, I'm nearly at the end of my course at college and wondering what might be available and when. ""I'm hoping something will come from this. I've applied for so many different ones and every time I've either had an email or they don't get back to me at all. ""I'm finding it really difficult at the moment to be honest."" For Louise King it was a budget of two halves. She owns a hairdressing salon, Wilderness Hair, in Liverpool, that turned to making shampoo when it couldn't open. ""We really welcomed the roadmap out of lockdown, the restart grants for Â£18,000,"" she says. And she agrees spending more on apprentices is a good idea, although it only applies to new apprentices and she already has two. ""But what we are really disappointed about is our industry is not getting the VAT cut like the hospitality industry,"" she says. Hairdressers had lobbied for the same treatment as bars and restaurants. ""We are still paying the full 20%. It's quite upsetting that our voice is not being heard,"" Louise says. ""If I'm being honest it's a mixed bag of emotions,"" she says ""There's still a rocky road ahead."" Tabi Marsh would have liked the chancellor to have given small businesses like hers more breathing space ""Business rates was more of a shocker than we'd expected it to be,"" says Tabi Marsh, owner of gift shop and cafe Papilio in Thornbury. Before the Budget the idea of having to pay full business rates again, was making Tabi wonder whether the business would have to close. Then she heard Scotland was extending its business rates holiday for a whole year, and she got her hopes up that the chancellor might do the same for England. Instead she's got three more months rate-free, then at the start of July has to start paying them again, although at a much reduced rate. ""It's a shame they're not following Scotland's lead,"" she says. The extension of furlough is a help and she's expecting a re-opening grant of around Â£12,000 to help retrain staff and restock the cafe. But she knows it will take some time for trade to return to normal, meanwhile minimum wage rises and Brexit mean costs have gone up. She's not sure yet whether Rishi Sunak's additional measures will be enough. ""It could be worse, but it could also be a lot better."" ""It has bought us the time to get open,"" she says. ""We will be one of the businesses that have to look again in six or nine months to see how quickly trade has rebounded.""

Texas ending mask rules is 'Neanderthal thinking',"This video can not be played President Biden: End of Texas mask mandate is ""Neanderthal thinking"" President Joe Biden has criticised the lifting of mask requirements in the states of Texas and Mississippi, calling it ""Neanderthal thinking"". ""I think it's a big mistake,"" he said. Masks, social distancing and other measures were still important, despite the role vaccines were playing in containing the pandemic, he said. Texas and Mississippi will also allow all businesses to open at full capacity. Other states have announced a relaxation of some rules. The US has recorded 28.7 million infections and 519,000 deaths related to Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Biden calls 500,000 death toll a heartbreaking milestone Imagining what 500,000 lost lives look like Covid-19 variants pose 'real threat' to vaccine progress, CDC warns Some 78 million vaccine doses have been administered but Mr Biden said this was not a reason to end public health measures. ""The last thing we need is Neanderthal thinking that in the meantime everything's fine, take off your mask, forget it,"" Mr Biden said. ""It still matters."" Senior health officials in his administration have warned about the continued spread of the virus - and highly contagious variants of it - hampering the progress of the country's vaccination programme. ""Now is not the time to release all restrictions,"" Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said. ""The next month or two is really pivotal in terms of how this pandemic goes."" Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves, a Republican, reacted to Mr Biden's comments with a terse tweet. ""Mississippians don't need handlers,""Mr Reeves wrote in the tweet,external. ""As numbers drop, they can assess their choices and listen to experts. I guess I just think we should trust Americans, not insult them."" A spokesperson for Texas Governor Greg Abbott said he was ""clear in telling Texans that Covid hasn't ended"". This video can not be played Business owners react to Texas reopening But the spokesperson told Politico that ""Texas now has the tools and knowledge to combat Covid while also allowing Texans and small businesses to make their own decisions"". ""It is clear from the recoveries, the vaccinations, the reduced hospitalisations, and the safe practices that Texans are using, that state mandates are no longer needed. We must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for Texans."" Individual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel. About 35 states required face coverings to be worn in public places, although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy. The governor ofTexason Tuesday issued an executive order, effective from 10 March, that rescinds most coronavirus measures. Mississippiended its mask mandate on Wednesday. Michiganis to ease capacity limits on restaurants, and on public and residential gatherings. South Carolinahas removed limits on large gatherings, while capacity limits on restaurants inMassachusettswere removed. Some cities have also acted.Chicagohas reopened public schools andSan Franciscoannounced the easing of rules on museums, cinemas, gyms and indoor dining. Patients in hospital with Covid continue to fall, from a peak of 131,000 on 12 January to 46,000 in the first week of March. Deaths per day over the same period have fallen from 4,400 to 1,300 The US has recorded 28.7 million infections and 519,000 deaths related to Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. The confirmed infections figure is nearly double that of second-highest India (11 million) and Brazil (10.5 million) But the US ranks ninth in terms of deaths per 100,000 population, behind countries such as the UK and Italy At least 90,000 more Americans are expected to have died with the virus by 1 June, an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projection says.

A shipment of AstraZeneca doses arrived in Australia last month Italy is blocking a shipment of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to Australia under European Union rules on vaccine exports, according to Italian media reports. It is the first ban under the scheme designed to protect vaccine supplies in the bloc. The order of 250,000 doses has been produced in an AstraZeneca factory in Anagni, near Rome, and the company has requested permission to ship the vials to Australia. With the support of the European Commission, the Italian government is refusing to allow the doses to leave. The EU and AstraZeneca have been embroiled in a large row over shortfalls in the company's delivery of doses to the bloc. AstraZeneca has blamed issues at its production plants in Europe. Australia started its rollout last week using the Pfizer jab and it is scheduled to start jabs with AstraZeneca doses on Friday. The World Health Organization has criticised the EU's scheme saying it is part of a ""worrying trend"" that could jeopardise global vaccine supply chains. Read more on the story.  A little while ago we brought you the latest UK coronavirus figures - which were 6,573 new cases and 242 further deaths. But how have things changed since this time last week? Well, Thursday 25 February saw 9,985 new positive cases reported and 323 deaths, of people who had a positive test within the previous 28 days. Today is the 10th consecutive day where the number of new cases has been under 10,000. The Stormont executiveagreed a five-step planfor easing the Covid-19 lockdown earlier this week. Unlike plans announced in England and Scotland, Northern Ireland's blueprint does not include a timetable. Progression will depend on certain public health criteria being met.  The executive must review its coronavirus restrictions regularly, with the next due on 16 March. The Executive Office says the plan -Moving Forward: The Executive's Pathway Out Of Restrictions,external- is a ""gradual easing of the current restrictions"". However it does not include specific detail on how the executive will measure when it is safe to reopen certain sectors. Northern Ireland's first minister says we are ""now at the point where we can begin to lift the burden [of restrictions]"". Speaking at a coronavirus press conference, Arlene Foster says the NI executive will next week assess the impact of the return to school of some children. She welcomes the fact the vaccine programme is ""significantly ahead of schedule"" and is accelerating. ""By the end of this month, the SSE Arena will have the capacity to provide 40,000 vaccines per month,"" she says. The proportion of new hospital admissions for those aged 80 or over has reduced from approximately 40% to about 20%, suggesting the vaccine rollout is having ""a real impact on protecting older people"", she adds. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin made the false claim while promoting Russian vaccines Russian President Vladimir Putin has wrongly claimed the death of a vaccine recipient has suspended innoculations using the Pfizer jab in parts of Europe. ""In some European
countries, Pfizer inoculations were stopped because there were lethal outcomes
there,"" Putin told a gathering of youth activists that was broadcast
live on Russian state TV channel Rossiya 24. He made the comment
after praising Russia's own vaccines as the ""safest and most
effective"" in the world. Putin appeared to be
referring to the false allegation in a video shared on social media that claimed Pfizer was halting production of
its vaccine after 23 people died in Norway. But as afact-check by the news agency Reuters,externalpointed out, Pfizer actually announced in mid-January that it was temporarily reducing
production at its facility in Puurs, Belgium, for a week as part of a plan to
increase vaccine output in the long term. In aprevious fact-check,external, the agency reported the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health had found no evidence to suggest the vaccine
was to blame for the deaths of 13 elderly recipients. Vaccine take-up in London among people aged 80 and older continues to lag behind other regions of England, the latest NHS figure show. An estimated 83.2% of people in this age group in the capital have had their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, according to NHS England, while uptake in other regions is thought to be at least 95%. Some 93.8% of residents of older adult care homes in England eligible to have their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine had received a jab by 28 February. But the equivalent figure for care home staff is 72.9%, while in London care homes that drops to 57.9% for eligible staff. There have been 6,573 new cases of coronavirus reported in the UK, according to the latest government figures. It brings the total number of positive tests to 4,201,358. A further 242 deaths have been reported, of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The total number of deaths, under that measure, is now 124,025. Three men have beenarrested after ""box-loads"" of lateral flow tests meant for schools were stolenfrom a lorry. Police say all the Covid-19 tests have been retrieved since they were taken from Harlow Business Park in Essex in the early hours of Tuesday. A 31-year-old man from Canvey and a 27-year-old man from Newham have been arrested on suspicion of theft. A 37-year-old from Dagenham was arrested for the same offence, as well as on suspicion of drug driving. Ch Supt Stuart Hooper, from Essex Police, says he is ""thrilled"" the force has been able to recover the tests ""so those in need are able to keep themselves and others safe at this difficult time"".

Amazon till-less grocery store opens in LondonThe shop will stock hundreds of new own-brand items including locally-sourced milk and desserts.,"This video can not be played WATCH: BBC's Emma Simpson visited Amazon's new till-less shop Amazon has opened a till-less grocery store in London - its first ""just walk out"" shop outside the US. Visitors to Amazon Fresh scan a smartphone app when entering and are automatically billed as they leave. The store stocks hundreds of own-brand items as well as third-party products, and also serves as a place to collect and return goods bought online. Campaigners have raised privacy concerns but one retail expert said the opening marked a ""watershed moment"". ""Having a physical presence will enable Amazon to address some of its weaknesses, like the mounting cost of deliveries and returns,"" said Natalie Berg, an analyst with NBK Retail. Much of the technology involved is located in the ceiling But she said she did not believe it would pose a threat to the major chains in the near term. ""Supermarkets have had a few years now to prepare and test their own checkout-free shopping concepts."" Amazon's approach, however, promises a more ""frictionless"" experience than other retailers. Visitors only have to place an item in a bag or otherwise carry it out to be charged by the store, which is located at the street entrance of a shopping centre in the borough of Ealing. By contrast,retailers including Marks and Spencer, Tesco and Sainsbury'srequire consumers to scan items into a smartphone or other device. The US firm is so confident of its tech that it says shoppers are not under any obligation to check all the items were accounted for. ""When you're finished, you're free to walk out,"" said Matt Birch, director of Amazon Fresh Stores and an ex-Sainsbury's executive. Visitors can buy a bag or use their own, and are emailed a copy of their receipt after leaving The technology involved was pioneered at the firm's similar Amazon Go stores in the States, which opened to the public in 2018. However, recent advancements mean the system can now cope with customers selecting from different bouquets of flowers, magazines and greetings cards - it could not distinguish accurately enough between one choice and another before. It involves the use of hundreds of cameras and depth-sensors, and software developed using deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques. However, it does not involve facial recognition. Amazon tracks each customer as they move around the shop Instead, users must identify themselves on arrival by scanning a barcode displayed within their account on the standard Amazon Shopping app. One civil liberties group has raised concerns. ""[It] offers a dystopian, total-surveillance shopping experience,"" said Silkie Carlo, from Big Brother Watch. ""Amazon's intense tracking of shoppers will create larger personal data footprints than any other retailer. Customers deserve to know how and by whom these records and analytics could be used."" The company has said it will only associate information collected in-store with a customer's Amazon account for up to 30 days, and has furtherdetails about how it uses the data on its privacy site,external. Amazon said it had sourced many of its own-brand groceries - including milk and eggs - from UK suppliers itself. In addition, it has launched an ""Our Selection"" sub-brand for ""premium"" products including desserts. Other items come from Morrisons and Booths, supermarkets with whom its has pre-existing ties. The store also contains a booth where orders can be delivered from its online store. And customers can return goods by scanning a code without having to repackage or relabel the item. ""Hand the product over and we'll do the rest for you,"" said Mr Birch, adding he plans further stores on some of London other high streets as well as its city centre. Marks & Spencer announced in November it was expanding use of its ""scan, pay and go"" service to all its UK grocery stores The Ealing store's customer area covers about 2,500 sq foot (232 sq m) in total, which is much smaller than a typical supermarket. Amazon also operates seven Whole Foods Market supermarkets in the UK. And there have been persistent rumours that it might try to expand further in the sector by buying one of the larger chains. However, the company is also offering to sell itsJust Walk Out technology,externalas a service that can be installed in other companies' stores. And ultimately it might decide there is more money to be made pitching this to the established supermarkets than challenging them head-on with bigger stores of its own. Amazon has barely made a dent in the overall UK grocery market, but it's clearly got big ambitions for food. It's been ramping up its online service, with free same-day deliveries for Prime members, putting pressure on rivals. The traditional supermarkets have been improving their technology over the past few years and the pandemic has accelerated the changes. Sainsbury's, for instance, has had a huge take-up in its SmartShop system where shoppers can pick up a handset and scan items as they go. Amazon technology removes checkouts and friction altogether. Users must scan a QR barcode on their smartphone as they enter Moving into bricks and mortar is another milestone for Amazon. Its new range of own-branded products is also eye-catching. When it comes to convenience stores, being able to grab and go could prove very popular. But location is key. And most of the best convenience-store sites in densely populated, urban districts have already been taken. This launch won't pose a big, immediate, threat to the big established grocers but they know only too well that Amazon has the potential to be a hugely disruptive force and has already forced them to up their game.

"'I should be celebrating but I'm finding it hard'There's more support for many in the Budget, but for some it still falls short.Business","Freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij says she is relieved to be receiving more help but knows many others aren't Across the UK a lot of people breathed a sigh of relief when Rishi Sunak announced his Budget on Wednesday. Furlough was extended. There was more money for businesses scrambling to stay afloat. And for people relying on universal credit, the extra Â£20 added last year will stay for now. But for people like freelance camerawoman Ester de Roij the chancellor's announcements prompted mixed emotions. ""I'm in limbo. I feel I should celebrating but I'm finding it hard to,"" she says. This time last year Ester wasn't eligible for a self-employed income support grant because she had only just started her business. She is now, following the Budget, finally able to claim some support. But she's ""absolutely furious"" that so many others are still falling through the net. She was also relieved to hear from Rishi Sunak that the Universal Credit top-up would stay for another six months. ""It's welcome news that it wasn't taken away. Without that Â£20 I wouldn't be able to cover my rent. It's the difference between a roof over my head and not,"" she says. But it feels like ""the bare minimum"" you could expect, not as much as she would have hoped for, she says, ""quite bittersweet"". Alan and Becky McEwan are grateful for the extension to furlough For Alan and Becky McEwan on the other hand the Budget news was ""a massive relief"". Becky runs a cake company, which is going well, but Alan manages a restaurant in Stirling and has been on furlough for much of last year. ""The 80% furlough has been a godsend for us,"" says Alan. ""What the government has done for us, we're really grateful for it."" He's had to shield while he waited for a cancerous tumour to be removed in January, then picked up Covid while in hospital undergoing treatment. Alan loves working in hospitality, and he hopes to be back by the time the restaurant reopens, but it's a huge help knowing that furlough has been extended until September in case he still isn't strong enough, or if the roadmap out of lockdown is delayed. ""It takes the worry off doesn't it? It's a massive strain off our shoulders."" Oliver Holt is hoping Rishi Sunak's drive for more apprenticeships will benefit him Oliver Holt in Thornton, Blackpool, hopes what he heard in the Budget will be good news for him. The 20-year-old is about to leave college with a level 3 certificate in mechanics and has been applying for apprenticeships, but so far without luck. Rishi Sunak announced a boost in funding for employers that take on apprentices, raising the support from Â£2,000 per young person taken on to Â£3,000. ""It's a great idea,"" Oliver says. ""It should mean you'll see a rise in garages taking on apprentices."" ""I'm super-keen, I'm nearly at the end of my course at college and wondering what might be available and when. ""I'm hoping something will come from this. I've applied for so many different ones and every time I've either had an email or they don't get back to me at all. ""I'm finding it really difficult at the moment to be honest."" For Louise King it was a budget of two halves. She owns a hairdressing salon, Wilderness Hair, in Liverpool, that turned to making shampoo when it couldn't open. ""We really welcomed the roadmap out of lockdown, the restart grants for Â£18,000,"" she says. And she agrees spending more on apprentices is a good idea, although it only applies to new apprentices and she already has two. ""But what we are really disappointed about is our industry is not getting the VAT cut like the hospitality industry,"" she says. Hairdressers had lobbied for the same treatment as bars and restaurants. ""We are still paying the full 20%. It's quite upsetting that our voice is not being heard,"" Louise says. ""If I'm being honest it's a mixed bag of emotions,"" she says ""There's still a rocky road ahead."" Tabi Marsh would have liked the chancellor to have given small businesses like hers more breathing space ""Business rates was more of a shocker than we'd expected it to be,"" says Tabi Marsh, owner of gift shop and cafe Papilio in Thornbury. Before the Budget the idea of having to pay full business rates again, was making Tabi wonder whether the business would have to close. Then she heard Scotland was extending its business rates holiday for a whole year, and she got her hopes up that the chancellor might do the same for England. Instead she's got three more months rate-free, then at the start of July has to start paying them again, although at a much reduced rate. ""It's a shame they're not following Scotland's lead,"" she says. The extension of furlough is a help and she's expecting a re-opening grant of around Â£12,000 to help retrain staff and restock the cafe. But she knows it will take some time for trade to return to normal, meanwhile minimum wage rises and Brexit mean costs have gone up. She's not sure yet whether Rishi Sunak's additional measures will be enough. ""It could be worse, but it could also be a lot better."" ""It has bought us the time to get open,"" she says. ""We will be one of the businesses that have to look again in six or nine months to see how quickly trade has rebounded.""

Reddit chief: I was late to spot GameStop mania,"Reddit boss Steve Huffman has told BBC News he supported the aims of controversial sub-Reddit WallStreetBets. A long-time fan of the group, he said he had been slow in spotting its effect on GameStop's huge share-price spike in January. ""I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again"", he said. GameStop's share price ended up reaching nearly $500 (Â£350) before falling. WallStreetBets had been hyping up the computer-game retailer's shares. The idea was if enough Reddit users bought GameStop shares, they could drive up the price, hurting hedge funds who had bet against the company. Some claimed the group had collectively manipulated the market. But Reddit decided to leave it up. ""We were... trying to keep WallStreetBets online,"" Mr Huffman said. When the media talks about the big social-media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - Reddit is often ignored. But as hedge funds learned during the GameStop share-price spike - ignore it at your peril. Reddit likes to think of itself as different. At its heart, it certainly feels more alternative. Its system of upvoting content mean ideas either fly or die. It's not called the front page of the internet for nothing. Mr Huffman has also had to deal with another big story this year  - conspiracy theories peddled by Donald Trump about electoral fraud. ""What do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country?"" Mr Huffman said. An influential sub-Reddit called TheDonald was instrumental in hyping up Mr Trump across the internet. Reddit banned it last year. Mr Huffman told BBC News it was the most difficult moderation decision he had had to make. Huffman is one of handful of men in Silicon Valley - along with Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - that make huge decisions on what we can and can't see on the internet. This video can not be played Watch: WallStreetBets is Reddit boss's ""guilty pleasure"" The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. When did you first come across WallStreetBets? So I've known about WallStreetBets for years. WallStreetBets is, in fact, one of my guilty pleasures on Reddit. How much was the group about having a laugh? A lot of it, as I think it's the cornerstone to a lot of friendship and human experience. At the end of the day, this community is fun and it's funny. And obviously, there's some cohesion there, talking about the trades. When did you start realising WallStreetBets was having an impact on GameStop's share price? So I think I was actually a little late to this, because I've been on WallStreetBets for a while. And they've been talking about GameStop for a while. And so on WallStreetBets, there's often a couple of stocks or companies or positions that have their attention. And so over the years, it's been Tesla. It's been Virgin Galactic. It's been Blackberry. It's been different things. And so, in my mind, I'm just browsing Reddit and OK, yeah, GameStop's got their infatuation right now. So I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again. And so it was, I think, really at the the take off of the mania when I was like: ""OK, this is a bigger one."" This video can not be played Watch: What's been going on at GameStop? Then there was that crazy period where the GameStop share price went from $20 to $400. What was going through your mind at that point? You know, I love reading business stories. I love reading books about investors and their successes and failures. So it's just a topic I'm interested in. I just thought it was a fascinating story. And it's such a smart thing to do. And I, personally, have found it a fair thing to do. So you were always supportive, like ideologically, of what the group was doing? Yes, because I think if you've got one transaction where one group has taken an extreme position and then another group can see that opportunity that maybe they've overextended themselves. Obviously, there's a lot of risk there. But I think everybody goes in that situation aware of that risk. The shares at one point got almost up to $500 a share. At that point, was there any pressure on you to maybe lock down WallStreetBets? We faced that question, like that literal question: ""Should you do something?"" But our motivation, or what we were trying to do in that situation, was actually the opposite - to keep WallStreetBets online. So you decided: ""This needs to stay up""? The question of should it go down or not was a very fast conversation. And we were, you know, confident that that community was well moderated and well within our content policy. Are you proud of what WallStreetBets managed to achieve? I am always, I think, proud when people do amazing things. And so I think maybe pride isn't even the right word. I think I'm happy or encouraged when humans come together to do something incredible. Do you think that it was a David-and-Goliath story? Oh, absolutely, because, you know, institutional investors have so much. There's so many more resources in terms of knowledge, relationships, the ability to execute large trades. No individual could have done this. Although hedge funds wage war on each other all the time, we never see it. And so to see a group of individuals kind of band together against some really well resourced institutions, I think that's an intriguing story from any angle. Some people lost a lot of money. Do you feel any responsibility? I think any trade, not just risky ones like WallStreetBets, has risk. But it also has opportunity. I think there are two things that are really important. One is that individuals have that opportunity. I don't think we as a society should be so paternal to say that, well: ""This group is smart enough to make these decisions - but this group, you know, we should keep them out,"" because you're not just protecting them from risk, you're eliminating their participation in the gains. Did the Capitol Hill riots make you reappraise the inherent goodness of the free internet? I'd be lying if I say that thought hadn't crossed my mind. But we've seen, I think, on Reddit, the power of people to do, I think, the right thing generally. One of the ways we look at Reddit, one of our duties, is to make sure the volume of any particular viewpoint is in proportion to the number of people who actually have it. And so that is to say we don't want a small number of loud people to have control beyond their numbers. And I think on Reddit we've gotten pretty good at that. I suppose you're wrestling with two things here. You don't want to get involved in censoring or overly censoring people? We feel, I think, there's an enormous responsibility for getting that balance right. And, you know, we are learning, I think, along with everybody else, we do our very best because it's not just the right thing to do for our business - it's the right thing to do for our users. And I think it's the right thing to do generally. And, for example, the QAnon conspiracy theory, we saw that on Reddit and banned it three years ago, long before it metastasized online and in the real world. Do you think you should have done more on TheDonald? That's one of the criticisms of Reddit that comes up a few times. Look, TheDonald was a series of hard decisions. And there's never a hard decision that I don't, upon reflection, wish we had made faster. But I think there's a matter of reality here - the principle of free speech was designed specifically to protect political speech. And so we went through a crisis not just at Reddit but in the United States and, I think, around the world of what do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country. That's a real conflict. And so I think there's no way around that conflict. Is that the most difficult decision that you've had to make? I think it might be, yes, because the other ones were more matters of getting the words right. Other policy changes we've made over the years around, you know, violence or harassment or bullying or involuntary sexualisation, we always knew what our gut told us - what the right thing was. And so those were sometimes complicated because we had to figure out how to get there and how to kind of balance all of our values. But we always knew where we wanted to go. I think with political speech, and in this particular moment, it was particularly challenging given the context of, like, the United States and the president of the United States being almost in conflict with each other. Fake news, conspiracy theories, how do you stay on top of it? Misinformation is another word for propaganda. And propaganda is as old as politics. This is not a new problem. And so, we've faced this problem in different forms over pretty much our entire existence. And so the solution, that we've seen, ultimately lies within people. It lies within a free press. It lies within access to information. It lies within people being allowed to have good judgements and societal pressure to to be truthful, to behave well, all of these things. Finally, there are some pretty niche sub-Reddits. What are the oddest ones you've come across? Oh, my goodness. BreadStapledToTrees is probably the weirdest one that I'm comfortable saying in an interview. And it's as the name implies. It's literally pictures of bread stapled to trees. There's another, I think, favourite around the office, CatStandingUp, which is just pictures of cats standing up. But that one is very strictly moderated. So every comment within every post in that community has to be the single word ""Cat"".

Palace probes claims Meghan bullied staff,"Buckingham Palace says it will investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff, adding that it was ""very concerned"" by the allegations. It follows a report in the Times newspaper that Meghan faced a bullying complaint when she was a working royal. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"". The palace said it ""does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment"". It will speak to the members of staff involved ""to see if lessons can be learned"", a statement added. According to the story in the Times,,externalthe complaint was made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace. A leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff. In a statement, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said: ""We are clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times following claims made by former staff of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. ""Accordingly, our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article. Members of staff involved at the time, including those who have left the Household, will be invited to participate to see if lessons can be learned. ""The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace."" The Meghan and Harry story Royal Family tree and line of succession Why Meghan gets compared to Princess Diana An earlier statement issued by Meghan's spokesman said: ""The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. ""She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good."" On one thing everyone is agreed: the interview that Meghan has given Oprah Winfrey - that will be broadcast in the US on Sunday - is concentrating minds. Palace staff have for some time itched to get their side of the story out; some feel that they went out of their way to help Meghan after the wedding only to be treated rudely or later dismissed as uncaring or worse. Team Sussex were braced for the story. ""It's a fairly extensive list of things that has been pulled together,"" one source told the BBC. ""The timing is not coincidental."" Meghan's side do not dispute the existence or content of the email; and it is pretty strong stuff. It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding. The duchess' people have pushed back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue. But now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously. Whatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. Harry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press. Last month,it was announced the couple would not returnas working members of the Royal Family. Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will air in the US on Sunday It comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March. In the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March. CBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.

Harry and Meghan not returning as royals,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not return as working members of the Royal Family, Buckingham Palace has said. The Queen confirmed the couple would not ""continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service"". A statement from the palace added Prince Harry and Meghan ""remain much loved members of the family"". The couple said ""service is universal"" and offered to continue supporting the organisations they have represented. Theduke and duchess said last Januarythey would step back as ""senior"" royals and work to become financially independent. The couple, who now live in California, formally stepped down in March, with aplan to review the arrangements after 12 months. The confirmation means Prince Harry and Meghan will return their honorary military appointments and royal patronages, which will be redistributed to working members of the Royal Family. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together 'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Under the arrangement agreed last year, the couple gave up using the HRH titles. But Harry retains the title of prince, having been born one. Their departure follows conversations between Harry and members of the Royal Family. A statement from Buckingham Palace said: ""The Queen has written confirming that in stepping away from the work of the Royal Family it is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service. ""While all are saddened by their decision, the Duke and Duchess remain much loved members of the family."" A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said: ""As evidenced by their work over the past year, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain committed to their duty and service to the UK and around the world, and have offered their continued support to the organisations they have represented regardless of official role."" They added: ""We can all live a life of service. Service is universal."" This could have been a formality - the end of the review period was coming up, it's very clear what the Sussexes' direction of travel is and equally clear that the patronages and appointments can't really be held on to from California. Thanks for your service, goodbye. But instead the duelling statements - and their bizarre timing, withthe Duke of Edinburgh in hospital- look as if there is a fair amount of bitterness remaining. The statement from the palace lays down the Queen's philosophy; as far as she is concerned the couple have left the life of public service. That's why the honorary commands and patronages have to go. You can't do half in-half out. Not so fast, the couple shoot back. They remain, they say, ""committed to duty and service"" - and ""service"", far from being a matter of titles and roles, ""is universal"". There is more than a flash of anger in their words. Like all good family arguments it blows up at a sticky moment - Harry's grandfather the Duke of Edinburgh is in hospital.  So why now? One source says the story was all over the place already and would have been in the papers by the weekend. The suggestion: that one party is stampeding the other. As to the meat of the announcement, the loss of the Captain Generalcy of the Royal Marines will sting. Harry's military life has defined him. ""Don't cock it up,"" Prince Philip told his grandson on the day he passed on the honorary command of the Marines. To yield it up now must be a heavy blow. Several of the duke and duchess's former patronages have thanked the couple for their support following the announcement. The Queen's Commonwealth Trust - which was founded in 2018, with Harry and Meghan appointed president and vice-president respectively - said it was ""very lucky"" to have had their ""keen support and encouragement"" in its formative years. ""We are glad that they remain in our circle of supporters,"" the trust said in a statement. The Association of Commonwealth Universities said Meghan had been ""a passionate advocate for our mission to build a better world through higher education"" since she took over the role of patron from the Queen in January 2019. And the National Theatre, another of Meghan's patronages, said the duchess had ""championed"" its work with communities and young people across the UK to make theatre accessible to all. This video can not be played Harry's friend JJ Chalmers said family was the prince's ''number one priority'' Meanwhile, the Rugby Football League thanked Harry ""for his time, care and commitment"" in supporting the organisation at all levels - from the children's game to the England teams. The Rugby Football Union also thanked the duke for his work as patron and vice patron, adding that it had ""greatly valued his contribution to promoting and supporting the game"". However, the Invictus Games Foundation, which runs an international sporting event for injured servicemen and women, said Harry would remain a patron for the organisation. The duke remained ""fully committed"" to the games, which he founded, it said in a statement. ""His military service and experience, combined with his genuine compassion and understanding for those who serve their countries, has raised awareness of wounded, injured and sick service personnel and the role they continue to play in society,"" the statement added. Harry will also continue to work with veterans' charity Walking With The Wounded as its expedition patron. Smart Works, a charity which helps women with clothes and coaching to get into work, and animal welfare charity Mayhew also said Meghan would remain a private patron. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's military, Commonwealth and charitable association roles will be handed back to the Queen. For Harry, those are: Captain General, the Royal Marines Honorary Air Commandant, RAF Honington Commodore-in-Chief, Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Rugby Football Union Patron, the Rugby Football League And for Meghan: Vice-President, The Queen's Commonwealth Trust Patron, the Royal National Theatre Patron, the Association of Commonwealth Universities Broadcaster and Royal Marines veteran JJ Chalmers, who is a friend of Prince Harry, said the duke's family remained ""his number one priority"" and suggested a desire to have ""an element of control"" was behind his decision to step back as a senior royal. ""So much of his life, particularly the way that it faces into the media, is out of his control... and any individual wants to try and take control of that,"" he told the BBC. ""I will continue to have the utmost respect for the service that he has given so far and I'm hopeful and optimistic that he will continue to serve in a greater purpose,"" he added. Harry and Meghan released a photo on Sunday to announce they are expecting their second child The couple married at Windsor Castle in May 2018 Their son Archie was born on 6 May, 2019 The announcement comes days after the couple revealedthey are expecting their second child. They are due totalk about their decision to step away from the monarchyin a TV interview with Oprah Winfrey next month. Since stepping back from royal duties, they have also signed deals withstreaming giants NetflixandSpotify. The duchess recentlywon a High Court privacy battleagainst the Mail on Sunday over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father. Earlier this month, Harry alsosuccessfully sued the publisher of the Mail on Sunday for libel, over false claims he ""turned his back"" on the Royal Marines after stepping down as a senior royal.

UK tax burden to 'hit highest levels since 1960s',"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says it will take ""the work of many years, decades and governments"" to pay back Covid debt Chancellor Rishi Sunak has rejected claims his plans to claw back the cost of coronavirus support will hit the poorest hardest. Mr Sunak extended furlough until September in Wednesday's Budget and set out measures to protect business as the UK emerges from lockdown. But he also announced major changes to tax - including a freeze on personal allowances. That means a million more people will start paying income tax. But Mr Sunak insisted no-one's take-home pay would be lowered and the threshold freeze would hit those on higher incomes more. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Sunak 'not levelling with people' on spending cuts Funding for Tory-held towns 'looks fishy' - Starmer Which taxes are rising to pay for coronavirus? The chancellor also plans to cut about Â£4bn from the budgets of government departments - leading to opposition warnings about a fresh round of spending cuts. The Treasury says the cut is due to a forecast of lower inflation but the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank said the reduction ""would still cause pain"". IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances."" Spending on the NHS, schools and defence is protected, which means the Â£4bn cut will ""fall entirely"" on local government and other areas, Mr Johnson said. ""Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the Autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today looks more like Scrooge Sunak cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly Â£50bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020,"" he added.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external OrUpload your pictures/video here Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Mr Sunak's tax threshold freeze means about 1.3 million people will start paying income tax for the first time - and about 10% of adults will be dragged into the 40% top rate. Mr Sunak told the BBC the freeze was a ""progressive"" move which would ensure the people that earned the most paid the most adding ""it is a fair way to do what we need to do"". He said: ""People's current take home pay won't be affected by this policy but it does mean the incremental benefits they would have experienced had the thresholds continued to rise with inflation won't be there."" During his Budget, Mr Sunak announced that a weekly Â£20 increase in universal credit - introduced last year to help those hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic - would end in September. Two left-leaning think tanks, The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation, said the move would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s. Universal credit and income tax - as well as strains on government departments - are all going to cause issues for the government. But social care is a real Achilles Heel. It's no good saying it's a problem all governments have failed to deal with. We have had a Conservative government for a long time now. Most can agree, behind the scenes in government, it is time for a change. Some in Westminster are also asking if raising corporation tax in 2023 points to an election that year. One cabinet minister told me on Wednesday ""no comment"" when I asked if the 25% corporation tax would ever come into force. They are going to have to raise an awful lot of money somehow, but it's hard to see where the economy will be in 2023, let alone in a few months' time. Labour's shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds warned that ""low-income families could be seeing a very difficult time in the future"". She also expressed concern that the government would be ""planning to switch off its increase in social security right at the time when we anticipate a peak in unemployment"". ""That is not a sensible approach to take,"" she added. This video can not be played Budget 2021: Who is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe? Mr Sunak says the total package of measures to support the economy - including those previously announced - amounted to Â£407bn. But he warned that this unprecedented spending could not continue. His other big money raising move was to increase the tax on company profits from 19% to 25%, although it will not kick in until 2023 and smaller firms will be exempted. Confederation of British Industry director-general Tony Danker said the rise in corporation tax would ""cause a sharp intake of breath for many businesses and sends a worrying signal to those planning to invest in the UK"". The government's own watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, said the overall tax burden on the UK would hit 35% of national income by 2025-26, the highest level since the 1960s. Mr Sunak told the BBC it was ""important we get our borrowing under control"" - and the UK would still have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G7 group of industrialised economies. His has also faced criticism for failing to mention social care - an area where an existing funding crisis has been made more acute by the pandemic. In 2019, Boris Johnson said he had ready a plan to fix social care but asked why it was not included in the Budget, Mr Sunak said the government was trying to find a ""cross-party solution"". He said it was important to ""build consensus"" on the long-term future of social care but added that ""right now our focus is the pandemic"". Labour said ministers had not contacted them concerning any such plan.

Key Budget points at-a-glance,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled the contents of his Budget in the House of Commons.

Hikes to stop 'irresponsible' debt,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of thefurlough schemewill limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, includingtax breaks designed to encourage business investment. However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers."" The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around Â£180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is Â£60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget affects your finances Business rates holiday extended to June Furlough to be extended until September Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of Â£354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will alsofreeze the amount of money employees earnbefore paying income tax at Â£12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at Â£50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years.

"Inequality set to rise, say campaigners","Campaign groups say half a million people risk being dragged into poverty Public spending cuts in Rishi Sunak's Budget mean the chancellor ""isn't really levelling with people"", the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has warned. The Treasury said the cuts, worth Â£4bn, were ""a purely mechanical change"", but Paul Johnson of the IFS said they were set to cause more pain. At the same time, big tax rises were ""screeching U-turns"", Mr Johnson said. ""Santa Sunak"" was now looking more like ""Scrooge Sunak"", he added. Meanwhile, ""pressure will mount"" on Mr Sunak not to cut universal credit by Â£20 a week after September, Mr Johnson said. He said that going for such a ""cliff-edge reduction"" was ""remarkable"". In his post-Budget analysis, Mr Johnson highlighted freezes in income tax allowances and rises in corporation tax. The corporation tax rise to 25% would take the UK ""well up the international league table"" for revenues, he said, but it was ""50-50 at best"" whether it would actually happen without additional concessions. ""This was, of course, a tale of two Budgets,"" said Mr Johnson in response to Mr Sunak's economic plans. ""By the end of the forecast period, we are looking at a fiscal tightening of over Â£30bn relative to previous plans. ""Take account of the cuts to planned spending announced in the autumn and Santa Sunak, purveyor of billions today, looks more like Scrooge Sunak, cutting spending and raising taxes to the tune of nearly Â£50bn relative to his pre-pandemic plans of March 2020.""

He was sceptical that the plans to cut a further Â£4bn from public spending could be delivered, saying they would cause ""additional pain"" if they went ahead. ""Now these are not firm plans, but they are the basis for the future public finance estimates. They are a very shaky basis,"" Mr Johnson said. ""This isn't just a mechanical change and presenting it as such means the chancellor isn't really levelling with people about the choices the government is making to repair the public finances."" The 24 hours after a Budget can be a perilous time for a chancellor. They can be undone even on the back of relatively small tax rises, let alone the biggest ones in more than a quarter of a century. The ""post-match"" analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies can condemn a Budget in the history books. The chancellor has a massive challenge and a tumultuous uncertain backdrop, but he has the benefit of a solid majority, unlike his recent predecessors. So it is with some relief that Number 11 will have seen the analysis of the respected institute and others such as the Resolution Foundation. They point to plenty of gaps. The plans imply further cuts to unprotected public spending. That includes social care spending within local authorities, for example. There is some doubt that the hike in corporation tax will really yield Â£17bn a year. Difficulties here, or in the post-pandemic recovery in general, will lead to further spending squeezes and tax rises. However, it is not really possible to assert that unequivocally. The chancellor has not constrained himself to meet borrowing targets as part of a set of rules. He outlined some principles around borrowing only to invest. But if he were facing pressure to increase taxes further in the year before an election, for example, it is equally plausible that higher-than-expected borrowing would take the strain. The world is too uncertain to be wearing fiscal straitjackets. And every time it has been required, on more than a dozen occasions, the chancellor has extended spending on rescue support schemes. That has set up an expectation about, for instance, the new expiry of the Â£20 uplift to Universal Credit in October (now extended by six months). As Paul Johnson of the IFS puts it: ""He has given us a sense of where he wants to go [on fixing the public finances], but he still has a lot of work to do and his spending plans in particular don't look deliverable, at least not without considerable pain."" That argument will be settled in the run-up to a Spending Review. If anything, the medium-term pressures on public services will be higher, reflecting issues such as big NHS waiting lists. For now, the Budget has achieved its two strategic aims: borrowing more now to extend immediate crisis support, then post-dating a huge cheque, paid for mainly by big business, to cover part of the bill. Most of the other parts in these plans can move and, if necessary, dramatically so. Mr Johnson also criticised Mr Sunak's universal credit changes. ""It is, by the way, remarkable that while the chancellor felt the need for a gradual phase out of furlough, business rates support, stamp duty reductions and VAT reductions, he is still set on a cliff-edge reduction in [universal credit] such that incomes of some of the poorest families will fall by over Â£80 between one month and the next. ""Whatever the case for cutting generosity into the longer term, if you're going to do so, the case for doing it gradually rather than all at once looks unanswerable."" In a BBC interview, the chancellor rejected suggestions that he should have tapered the ending of the Â£20-a-week universal credit increase in order to minimise its effect on families. ""We have extended it generously and in full, but it's important to remember that it's one of many things that we're doing to support people,"" Mr Sunak said. These included increases in the National Living Wage and offering help with council tax payments, he added. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says it will take ""the work of many years, decades and governments"" to pay back Covid debt Earlier, the government came under fire from campaigners for doing too little in the Budget to address inequality. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Resolution Foundation said the cut in universal credit would bring the incomes of benefit recipients down to levels not seen since the early 1990s. It would also pull half a million people into poverty, just as unemployment was expected to peak. Mr Sunak's decision to spend even larger sums to support the economic recovery now and put off raising taxes until later was broadly welcomed in the Resolution Foundation's analysis of the Budget. But it noted that while GDP is set to grow this year by 4%, that might not feed through to better living standards, with wages by the middle of the decade set to remain Â£1,200 a year - or 4.3% - below where they would have been without the coronavirus pandemic. Austerity would drag on for some, it added, with day-to-day spending on government departments such as transport and local government set to fall in real terms next year and remain almost a quarter lower than a decade ago. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, said the universal credit changes meant single recipients of it would see their incomes cut by Â£20 a week, just as the furlough scheme is ended and unemployment was expected to rise to its peak, the foundation said. It predicted that would pull half a million people into poverty, including 200,000 children, adding that the Budget was silent on helping 700,000 households who have fallen behind on rent because of the pandemic and are now at risk of eviction. Responding to the Resolution Foundation's analysis, Mr Sunak told the BBC that it had hailed his decision to freeze income tax thresholds as a ""progressive measure"" and ""a fair way to do what we need to do"".

Out-of-work young 'face being scarred by Covid',"The report warns the problem young people face is Wales' ""biggest economic challenge in living memory"" Young people should be guaranteed work or training to avoid becoming ""scarred"" by Covid-19, an inquiry has found. Welsh ministers should take action to stop a ""monumental spike in youth unemployment"", a report by the Senedd's cross-party economy committee has said. Overcoming it is a major part of the recovering from the ""biggest economic challenge in living memory"". The Welsh Government said its priority was for Wales to be ""more prosperous, but also fairer and greener"". In December,Wales had the highest rise in unemployment in the UK- despite that, the Welsh rate of unemployment stood at 4.4% last month,lower than the UK rate of 5.1%. The report calls for a skills-led recovery and a campaign to make sure young people are paid a living wage Outlining a range of strategies to tackle the problem, the report - Long-Term Recovery from Covid-19 - calls for a skills-led recovery, with special support for the hardest-hit sectors and a campaign to pay thereal living wage,external. One chapter deals specifically with young people, stating they were more likely to be furloughed during the first wave of coronavirus than other age groups. It also details how the rate of 18 to 24-year-olds in Wales claiming unemployment benefits rose ""considerably"" in 2020. Depriving young people of work experience during shutdowns could be ""locked into their earning potential"" for the rest of their lives, the report said. ""Without the right support for skills, training and work experience, there is a very real risk of a scarred 'Covid generation'."" Ministers should ""urgently"" look at a setting up a youth opportunity guarantee for 16 to 24-year-olds, it urged. A similar scheme in Scotland already offers one or two years in work or training. Unemployment in Wales rises again amid pandemic Pandemic job hunt putting young lives 'on pause' Long-term unemployment could be 'similar to 1990s' Jonathon Dawes, 18, from Rhyl, said he thought it was the right step to get young people on the employment ladder. ""If it wasn't for the pandemic I would be tennis coaching, but at the moment I am at home. ""In my scenario my work has been delayed, but so many more young people have had their career pathways put to one side and this would be a fantastic way to get them back on track."" Sixteen-year-old Lloyd Mann from Abergavenny said he wanted to see how the scheme panned out. ""It's the perfect thing to start filling in the gaps. A government scheme that offers security will put a lot of young people at ease. ""The pandemic has definitely made me reconsider going to university. If it wasn't for the pandemic I'd be aiming to get some kind of part-time job and my education would be less effective. Although uni has been my main goal for sometime, the scheme has made me think about other options."" Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd Helen Mary Jones, who sits on the committee, said: ""In the past, we've seen what amounts to a lost generation - if you look back to the 1980s, we had young people who were out of work for two years. Those people are coming up to retirement age now and their lives are still affected by that economic shock all those years ago. ""So we want to make sure that that doesn't happen to this generation of young people, and we want the government to invest in ensuring that they get over this economic hump."" She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers: ""It's very much about working with employers in the private sector, enabling them to bring young people on board, which perhaps they couldn't afford to do on their own and supporting them to do that."" Dr Sioned Pearce said Wales could look to international structures for a solution Dr Sioned Pearce from the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research and Data (WISERD) at Cardiff University said young people have been hard hit and the Welsh government needed to get out of the ""employability narrative"" that is about getting a young person into work without thought about factors such as the nature of the work and the pay. She said: ""In the UK as a whole, young people were two-and-a-half times more likely to be working in a sector that was shut down before the lockdown and in Wales that was three times more likely. ""So that's a really concerning picture, particularly when you take into account the long-term scarring effects of youth unemployment, even for short periods, not just on future earnings but on mental health, physical health relationships, and so on."" She said the situation has ""exacerbated issues of precarity"" for young people - with under-25s more likely to work with zero hour contracts, having to work part-time, or on low incomes. ""There is also the issue of deprivation in Wales which is longstanding. Wales receives a higher amount of European structural funding because of its high levels of deprivation - young people living in rural or valleys levels of Wales may find it particularly difficult, especially then with the coming withdrawal of EU funding post-Brexit."" She said Wales could look to examples in places such as Scotland and Sweden and ""challenge that work-first imperative and keeping the principle of no-one left behind in mind"". A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We don't want anyone to be left behind. ""Our Covid commitment will create opportunities to retrain and upskill in new and high-growth areas and ensure support is on hand for anyone needing it, including helping young people to enter the labour market for the first time. ""We have set out a clear and ethical vision for the future that supports everyone in Wales."" Have you found it hard to find work in the pandemic?

"Covid deaths set to cut state pension costsForecasts suggests inheritance tax receipts will also rise, partly due to over-65s dying of CovidBusiness","The amount the government has to spend on state pensions will fall by Â£1.5bn by 2022, partly because of over-65s dying of Covid, forecasts suggest. The government will also receive an extra Â£0.9bn from inheritance tax, partly due to Covid-related deaths. The figures have been published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's fiscal watchdog. It said it had ""revised up our assumption for excess deaths this year and next relative to November"". More than 144,000 deaths involving Covid-19 have occurred in the UK since the start of the pandemic, figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show. The majority of coronavirus deaths have been among people aged over 65, many of whom will have been receiving the state pension. The OBR estimates spending on the state pension will fall by Â£600m in 2020-21 and Â£900m in 2021-22 compared with forecasts made before the pandemic. The watchdog said the forecast for lower state pension spending was partly because of the weaker outlook for average earnings growth, which lowers the effect of the yearly triple lock uprating. But it added that excess deaths due to the pandemic have also reduced the number of people receiving pensions. ""With virus-related deaths rising sharply again in recent months, we have revised up the number of excess pensioner-age deaths in 2020-21 from 90,000 in our November forecast to around 100,000 in this one,""the OBR said in its Economic And Fiscal Outlook,external, which is published alongside the Budget. It has increased its forecast because: ""Higher virus-related deaths in the current wave of the virus have outweighed the effect of lockdown reducing deaths from other causes, particularly from influenza and other respiratory diseases"". Meanwhile the Treasury predicted that inheritance tax receipts will increase from Â£5.1bn in 2019-20 to Â£6bn in 2021-22, before falling to Â£5.8bn the following year. The rise in inheritance tax receipts is partly due to the freeze of inheritance tax thresholds until April 2026 announced in the Budget and the growth in the value of estates, but higher Covid-19 deaths will also contribute, the OBR said.

Palace to investigate claims Meghan bullied staff,"Buckingham Palace says it will investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff, adding that it was ""very concerned"" by the allegations. It follows a report in the Times newspaper that Meghan faced a bullying complaint when she was a working royal. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"". The palace said it ""does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment"". It will speak to the members of staff involved ""to see if lessons can be learned"", a statement added. According to the story in the Times,,externalthe complaint was made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace. A leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff. In a statement, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said: ""We are clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times following claims made by former staff of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. ""Accordingly, our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article. Members of staff involved at the time, including those who have left the Household, will be invited to participate to see if lessons can be learned. ""The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace."" The Meghan and Harry story Royal Family tree and line of succession Why Meghan gets compared to Princess Diana An earlier statement issued by Meghan's spokesman said: ""The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. ""She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good."" On one thing everyone is agreed: the interview that Meghan has given Oprah Winfrey - that will be broadcast in the US on Sunday - is concentrating minds. Palace staff have for some time itched to get their side of the story out; some feel that they went out of their way to help Meghan after the wedding only to be treated rudely or later dismissed as uncaring or worse. Team Sussex were braced for the story. ""It's a fairly extensive list of things that has been pulled together,"" one source told the BBC. ""The timing is not coincidental."" Meghan's side do not dispute the existence or content of the email; and it is pretty strong stuff. It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding. The duchess' people have pushed back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue. But now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously. Whatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. Harry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press. Last month,it was announced the couple would not returnas working members of the Royal Family. Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will air in the US on Sunday It comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March. In the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March. CBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.

You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home. Calculate how much LBTT you will have to pay,external In Wales the current standard rates forLand Transaction Tax,external(LTT) are: Â£0-Â£225,000 = 0% Â£225, 001-Â£400,000 = 6% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 7.5% Â£750,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m + = 12% Purchasers usually have to pay the higher rate of LTT if they: buy a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and already own one or more other properties The higher rates of LTT are: Â£0-Â£180,000 = 4% Â£180,001-Â£250,000 = 7.5% Â£250,001-Â£400,000 = 9% Â£400,001-Â£750,000 = 11.5% Â£750,0001-Â£1,500,000 14% Â£1.5m + = 16% Calculate how much LTT you will have to pay,external You have 14 days to pay stamp duty from the date of completion in England and Northern Ireland. In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

Google promises to drop personalised ad trackingThe tech giant says it will not develop workarounds once it abandons third-party tracking cookies.,"Google has promised not to develop any new way of tracking individual users for adverts once it phases out its current method. The tech giant is one of the world's largest advertising sellers and also owns the world's most popular web browser, Chrome. But it is following other browser providers by eliminating third-party tracking cookies. That move is already being looked at by the UK's competition authority. The Competition and Markets Authority said in January that Google's plan to remove the cookies - which would effectively share less information with advertisers -could have a ""significant impact"" on the advertising market and news websites. One group of marketers opposed to the idea claims that Google will gain an advantage by eliminating such cookies, because it has other ways of obtaining personal information from users. Cookies temporarily store small amounts of information about what a user is doing on a website and are an important part of the modern internet. For example, they can ""remember"" things, such as what is in an online shopping basket or whether a user is logged in. But a third-party tracking cookie can be used to ""follow"" a user from site to site, so a website can ""know"" that you were shopping around for a type of product - like clothes or shoes - and advertise those things to you elsewhere. Those are the type that Google is phasing out, following the lead of some major competitor web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari, which already block them by default. Some critics had been concerned that Google's plan to stop these cookies would prevent its rivals from building useful catalogues of ad targeting information - but that Google itself might still be able to do so. The company appeared to tackle that idea directly in its new announcement. ""Today, we're making explicit that once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build [alternative] identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products,"" the company said in a blog post. 'Spy pixels in emails have become endemic' UK plans tailored set of rules for each tech giant It said the knock-on effect was that other providers could end up offering ""a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not"" (although Firefox and Safari already block the offending cookies by default). ""We don't believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren't a sustainable long-term investment,"" Google said. But that portrayal has been challenged by industry group Marketers for an Open Web, who argue Google will have an unfair advantage. Director James Rosewell said Google hasn't promised to stop personalised marketing, or gathering of data, inside its own products - which would involve changing its product terms and conditions. Regulators still need to ensure competition, through legislation, he said, or ""advertisers will have little choice as to where they spend their money"". And there are fewer privacy advantages for the average user, he argued. ""You have one large trillion-dollar company that effectively, through an unfair contract... tracks you more of the time, the only difference is you're going to be logged in, and part of their walled garden."" ""How does that make people more private, or more secure, versus something that doesn't have directly identifiable information -  their name, their email address - it just uses a random string of characters?"" The shift away from cookies has been prompted by years of tightening regulation and increased consumer awareness. But stopping the use of tracking cookies does not prevent all personalised tracking, as the industry has come up with creative solutions to generate personalised data. So-called ""fingerprinting"", for example, tries to use a huge range of details about your device - the type of phone or computer, browser version, language, IP address, or even what fonts you have installed - to identify the machine. The advertiser might not know the person's name, but it can still ""follow"" that unique fingerprint around the web. Google, which will continue to sell ads, argues that it and other companies need to come up with a solution that ""delivers results"" for advertisers. It now says that people should not have to be tracked invasively in order to ""get the benefits"" of targeted advertising. One way of doing so, Google said in its blog post, was to ""hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests"", so that an individual person's browsing history would be difficult to figure out.

"Chancellor announces Â£1bn for 45 areas of EnglandThe list of places in England receiving funds is dominated by the north west, Yorkshire and Midlands.","Workington is one of 45 towns to receive part of the Â£1bn funding Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced Â£1bn towards 45 areas of England as part of his Budget. The list of places receiving money from theTowns Fund,externalis dominated by the north west, Yorkshire and the Midlands. The government said the money would help to ""level up"" towns and aid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said there was ""just no logic to where that money goes other than through a political ends"". Mr Sunak told the House of Commons the deals would be ""from Castleford to Clay Cross, Rochdale to Rowley Regis and Whitby to Wolverhampton"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget will affect you Darlington 'Treasury North' Budget move welcomed Workington in Cumbria will receive Â£23m, which the local council said would support projects including a sports village and innovation centre. Mike Johnson, Conservative deputy leader of Allerdale Borough Council, called it ""absolutely fantastic news"" and said the authority would work to ""bring these projects to life and make the town an even better place to live, work and visit"". Great Yarmouth will receive about Â£20m in funding from the deal Peter Barnes, the BBC's head of political research There are 45 towns named but as some cover multiple constituencies, I've counted 56 constituencies that benefit. Forty-seven are Conservative constituencies - including 14 gained from Labour at the 2019 election plus quite a few more recent Conservative gains, while nine are Labour constituencies. Fifty-three of the constituencies voted ""leave"" at the EU referendum. Three voted ""remain"". In a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and ""remain"" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking. The plans that the Norfolk seaside town of Great Yarmouth has for its Â£20m include job creation, supporting new homes and ""to tap into and grow a thriving arts and cultural scene"". Chairman of the town deal board, Henry Cator, said the ""ambition [was] to realise a vibrant and inclusive coastal economy"". Meanwhile, Lincolnshire has five towns, as well as Lincoln, in the list to receive funding. Jo Walker, assistant director for growth at City of Lincoln Council, said the Â£19m it was due to receive would ""help make a significant difference in the city as we come out of lockdown and begin our recovery from the pandemic"". But Mr Reynolds, the Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, used the example of Greater Manchester and called decisions for where funds would go ""inexplicable"". He said: ""A government serious about levelling up would look at things like council funding. It would look at the funding of the health service to address health inequalities in post-industrial areas. ""Instead what we seem to get are these pots from the chancellor dependent on giving money to backbench Conservative MPs, and I find that so frustrating and a misuse of public money."" Challenged on the allocations at a Downing Street news briefing, Mr Sunak said that ""if you looked at all the things"" the government was doing it was ""benefitting people in every corner of the country"".
