We'll be back from Sunday morning UK time but, as always, we'll continue to bring you any major developments on the BBC News website. We hope you are keeping safe and well, wherever you are. Here's what happened today. You've been kept up-to-date today by: Jim Todd, Deirdre Finnerty, David Walker, Kathryn Snowdon, Kevin Ponniah, George Wright, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Shamaan Freeman-Powell, Saj Chowdhury, Ben Collins, Neil Johnston and Paul Gribben  Equatorial Guinea has also received the tea A batch of herbal tea has been dispatched from Madagascar, off the coast of East Africa, all the way to Guinea-Bissau in West Africa after the Madagascan president touted it as a powerful remedy against Covid-19. (There is no scientific evidence for the claim.) The drink, which has been coined Covid-Organics, is derived from artemisia - a plant with proven use in malaria treatment - and other indigenous herbs. Equatorial Guinea has also received a batch of the tea after Madagascan leader Andry Rajoelina promoted it as a potential treatment. The World Health Organization says its effects have not been tested. In Madagascar itself, the national medical academy has also cast doubt on the product. It said it had the potential to damage people's health as its ""scientific evidence had not been established"". English conspiracy theorist David Icke has had his official channel deleted from YouTube after violating its policies by posting misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic. ""YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. The Google-owned video service acted after Facebook decided to take down Mr Icke'sofficial page. His YouTube channel had more than 900,000 subscribers at the time it was removed. The last clip Mr Icke posted - about his Facebook ban - had about 120,000 views. Some are demanding New York ease lockdown measures New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has pushed back against demands to re-open his state, saying he needs more information about the spread of the virus. Around half of states in the US have now partially eased lockdown restrictions but Mr Cuomo said a lot more information was needed before opening up his state, which is the hardest hit in the country. ""Even when you are in uncharted waters, it doesn't mean youproceed blindly,"" Mr Cuomo said. ""Use information to determine action - not emotions, not politics, not what people think or feel, but what we know in terms of facts."" He also released the preliminary results of a survey which tested 15,000 people across the state for antibodies to see if they had previously had the virus. The results showed that 12.3% had been infected. A previous test with a smaller cohort suggested that one in five New York City residents had contracted it.

Members of a Nottingham Forest girls team are using trampolines and even their pets to maintain their fitness in their back gardens. ""My favourite drills are running drills and shooting drills but I've got to be really careful because my dad's got a greenhouse,"" says 12-year-old Sophie. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The death toll figures have
become a sad daily ritual and on Wednesday the number jumped â not because
there was a sudden increase in deaths but because for the first time the official
daily figures included deaths outside of hospitals. Although we had been getting a
separate publication from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) once a week
looking at coronavirus deaths outside of hospitals, in places like care homes, these were not included in
the headline figure. Now the daily total (today's was 621) tells you
about the deaths of anyone who tested positive for coronavirus. So this is a larger group than just deaths in hospitals, but still doesnât include all
deaths in the community settings because not everyone who dies of coronavirus
will have had a test. As testing is expanded to more
and more people, the death figures should get closer to the true reality. Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC These can be lonely times - especially if you're separated from your family. Alienor Duron, 22, started the project 1lettre1sourire (one letter one smile) encouraging people to write to isolated people in retirement homes in France, Canada, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg. ""A letter is something you can touch, keep and read again, and put on your wall or bedside table - not like an email that's going to be deleted after a while,"" she says. Handwritten notes in Chinese that say ""we love you and are thinking of you"" Meanwhile, in New York, volunteer movement Heart of Dinner is providing boxes of hot food, along with handwritten notes that say ""we love you and are thinking of you"" to elderly Asian-Americans in care homes. Founders Yin Chang and Moonlynn Tsai say they came up with the idea after they experienced racism and saw other Asian-Americans being harassed. ""A lot of the seniors in Chinatown are
immigrants - many are unable to
communicate in English. We want
them to know they're still a part of the community,"" says Chang. You canread more about ways people are helping others during the pandemic here. At the UK daily briefing on Saturday, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced that 105,937 tests were ""carried outâ"" on Friday - surpassing a  self-imposed government target of 100,000 tests a day. However, the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC that this figure also includes home testing kits sent out, so the government has for a second day only reached the target using that metric. Testing totals now include home-testing kits sent out to individuals as well as satellite kits - which are batches of tests sent out to care homes and other settings. They are counted when they are dispatched, rather than when they are used and processed. A week ago these home-testing kits made little difference to the overall figure as only a few thousand a day were being sent out, but they now seem to account for about a third overall.

Here, his grandson Benjie looks at more than 120,000 birthday cards from around the world Medication widely prescribed to treat high blood pressure does not make patients more susceptible to coronavirus infection, three major studies have found. The research primarily focused on angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs). The findings are good news for millions of people who take the drugs. Rumours have been circulating that the medication could increase the risk of Covid-19 infection. ""We saw no difference in the likelihood of a positive test with ACE inhibitors and with angiotensin receptor blockers,"" Harmony Reynolds of New York University's Grossman School of Medicine, who led a study involving about 12,600 people, told the AFP news agency. In the UK, the NHS advises that people keep taking blood pressure medicines as usual. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent Czech Foreign Minister Tomas Petricek has laid out in a blog post how heintends to allow Czechs to travel again without restrictions. From July, he would like the borders to be fully opened to fourneighbouring countries: Austria, Germany, Poland and Slovakia. He also envisages unrestricted travel in July to countries that have dealt with the pandemic well. The Czech Republic's ban on free movement, imposed to curb coronavirus, was lifted last month. At present Czechs are in theory free to travel to any country in the world - if they can get there. But they must present either a recent negative Covid-19 certificate or do 14 days of quarantine on their return. Even so, the foreign ministry is still advising against all but essential travel. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter Testing for antibodies has already started around the world, but it is not yet known whether having the virus guarantees immunity. During the UK government's daily news briefing earlier, a member of the public asked
about what we know when it comes to immunity from the virus. At the moment, the World Health
Organization (WHO) says there isnât yet good evidence that suggests having the virus once
protects you from getting it again. When the WHO say ""no good evidence"", they mean this hasnât been properly studied yet. Weâd expect that having the
illness would grant you some immunity, at least for a period of time. But the question
is how much and for how long? Will a mild case now protect you if youâre
exposed to a bigger dose of the virus later? Lots of people are in the
process of trying to answer these questions. Countries including South
Korea, Germany, Italy and the UK are beginning to test samples of their
populations for antibodies. This could provide more
information about whether (and for how long) the disease gives immunity to
those who have recovered. We brought you the news earlier that Italy recorded just 192 deathsin the past 24 hours - the lowest daily rise since 14 March. France has now reported similarly low figures. The national death toll in hospital and care homes has increased by 166, to a total of 24,760. It's a significant drop from the 218 deaths recorded on Friday. There are still close to 26,000 people in hospital with Covid-19 in France but that figure has been going down for more than two weeks. Earlier today, France extended a health emergency by two months, allowing the government to prolong anti-virus measures. The country plans to ease its lockdown from 11 May. Reality Check Visits to parks have almost returned to normal levels after dropping by more than 50% in the first few weeks of lockdown. Trips to parks were down just 10% on the last Sunday in April, compared with the start of the year,according to data from Google.,external Several parks, including Brockwell Park in South London,briefly closed at the start of Aprilamid social distancing concerns. But Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has since said that people ""need parks"" and councils must keep them open. Trips to supermarkets and workplaces are still down significantly compared with the start of the year. More than 65,000 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in the US, but some experts fear the real figure could be much higher. New data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that total deaths in seven hard-hit states were almost 50% higher than normal during the period 8 March to 11 April. Researchers fear as many as 9,000 additional deaths,externalin the country could be attributed to the virus. The US has by far the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in the world but fewer relative to population than some European countries. Spain has started easing its lockdown Here's a round-up of some key coronavirus developments from across the globe: Reality Check All of society will be expected to play a part when the UK launches
a national contact tracing phone app in the coming weeks, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said
this afternoon. Contact tracing involves tracking down anyone with
whom virus sufferers have been in prolonged contact with, to potentially ask them to self-isolate. The UK is planning to roll out its contact tracing app and phone team by the middle of May. The method is already being used elsewhere in Hong
Kong, Singapore and Germany. In Australia, more than four million people have downloaded a tracking app. Contact tracing will start to form a key part of the UK governmentâs strategy in the coming months. Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said the results of contact tracing would help us start to see where the lines of
transmission are. Read more here about what the public will be asked to do.  Helier CheungBBC News, Washington DC Believe it or not, your personal musings right now could be valuable to historians of the future. Archivists are urging people to keep diaries in written, audio, or video format because the coronavirus pandemic is a major event that historians will want to study in the years to come. The Mass Observation Project,externalis calling on volunteers to âhelp us create a record of the pandemicâ, whileWright State University,externalin the US says diaries ""can also be extremely useful, therapeutic tools for the diary author as wellâ. ""Although many of us think history is about politicians and royalty, actually history is about everybody,"" says Rob Perks, director of National Life Stories at the British Library. And if that's too remote for you, there's also a more immediate benefit: Jacinda Ardern has asked New Zealanders to keep diaries about their own movements to try and help officials with contact tracing.

It is hoped the specially trained dogs could be used in public places, like airports, as part of the ongoing fight against the spread of the virus on the French island. The trial is one of several experiments being undertaken in countries including the UK and the USA. Mark LowenBBC News, Rome After a week where Italyâs daily death toll fell as low as 260, todayâs official figure of 474 deaths in the past 24 hours seemed alarming. The number seemed incomprehensible - especially given there are now just over 1500 patients in intensive care, down from a high of more than 4,000. But then the explanation: 280 were previously unrecorded deaths from the northern region of Lombardy in April. So the one-day death toll across the country in the past 24 hours is in fact 192, continuing the downward trajectory. It is the lowest daily rise since 14 March. The number is still high and Italy remains the country with the second-highest number of deaths overall. But the figures are moving in the right direction and it seems Italy is gradually overcoming this killer. Â© 2025 BBC.

Two arrests over NHS worker's stab murder,"David Gomoh graduated with a marketing degree from Southbank University Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of murdering an NHS worker who was stabbed to death days after his father died with coronavirus. David Gomoh, 24, was attacked seconds after leaving his home in Newham, east London, on 26 April. Police said Mr Gomoh's family were ""going through unimaginable torment"". A 19-year-old man arrested in Stratford on Friday and a 16-year-old boy detained in Telford, Shropshire, on Saturday, remain in custody. Mr Gomoh, whose mother is a nurse, was attacked on Freemasons Road, close to the junction with Kerry Close, at about 22:25 BST. The Southbank University graduate worked for the NHS helping to supply staff with essential equipment. Police have appealed for information about this silver Dodge Caliber Police said Mr Gomoh was killed just days before the funeral of his father, who died after contracting Covid-19. Det Insp Tony Kirk said: ""David's family are going through unimaginable torment. ""Within days his mother has seen the death of her husband and son - his sister has lost her father and brother. Both are now heartbroken."" He added: ""David and his mother, who have done so much to help the community, now need the public to come forward and tell us what they know."" Police urged anyone with information about a stolen silver Dodge Caliber which was abandoned at about 22:30 in Lincoln Road, to come forward. Officers said the car, which had a temporary wheel on the front passenger side, was stolen in Dagenham on 16 April and was on cloned plates when it was recovered.

Tributes paid to top lawyer found dead at home,"Tributes have been paid to the QC and civil rights activist Derek Ogg who has died at the age of 65. His career spanned work as a Crown prosecutor and latterly as a defence advocate. Mr Ogg campaigned for the 2018 law which automatically pardoned gay and bisexual men convicted of sexual offences that are no longer illegal. Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Ogg was a ""brilliant advocate and a truly lovely man"". In a Twitter post, the first minister added: ""It was always a pleasure for me to hear from him on issues he felt strongly about, and I will miss his wisdom and good sense."" Gordon Jackson QC, dean of Faculty of Advocates, said: ""All of us who knew Derek Ogg are deeply saddened by his passing. ""He was a marvellous advocate but more than that he was a fierce campaigner for his beliefs both on a personal and professional level. He will be greatly missed by everyone at the faculty."" Police Scotland said Mr Ogg was found by officers in his Glasgow home on Friday evening and there ""would appear to be no suspicious circumstances"" surrounding his death. Mr Ogg, co-founder of the Scottish Aids Monitor group which helped to spread information about Aids, speaking to Princess Diana in the late 1980s When Nicola Sturgeonoffered an unequivocal apology to gay menconvicted of sexual offences at Holyood in 2017, Mr Ogg was in the gallery watching. Speaking on Radio Scotland that day, he said was a ""wonderful day"". He added: ""It's Scotland at peace with itself and it is a reconciliation between the people in Scotland who are alive and the families of gay people who are dead, who were prosecuted, convicted, simply because of the gender of the person they loved or fancied. ""You can't underestimate the scars that leaves on people. I've never been convicted of such an offence but the fact is that the law was there and could have been used, I could have been arrested. ""I was at the very beginning of my legal career - my career would have been destroyed. An apology, together with the pardons bill, is appropriate."" Fellow QC Tony Graham, stable director of Optimum Advocates, of which Mr Ogg was a member, said: ""There was far more to Derek than his time in wig and gown. ""Whilst Derek was one of most well-read individuals one could encounter, he was also a man who was full of fun, compassion and ready to assist anyone - colleague or not - in any way he could. ""He provided an ear to those who needed his wisdom, could put a smile on the face of the sullen, inspire a laugh from those engrossed in sadness, and create a conversation in even the solemnest of rooms. Often, he did all of these things in a self-deprecating way."" He added: ""We have lost not just a committed and talented colleague, but a loyal and generous friend. Glasgow High Court will be an unfortunately quieter place without Derek as he leaves a void uneasy to fill.""

"Officer who 'struck and kicked boy' suspendedThe police watchdog is investigating after social media footage ""caused significant public concern"".Birmingham & Black Country","This video can not be played IOPC investigates officer's 'excessive force' A police officer has been suspended after allegedly using ""unnecessary force"" when detaining a teenage boy. Footage shared widely on social media shows a West Midlands Police officer appearing to ""strike and kick"" the 15-year-old, the police watchdog said. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is investigating the ""altercation"" in an alleyway in Newtown, Birmingham, on 21 April. The force said the officer, who has not been identified, has been suspended. In a statement, the force said the boy ""had been seen acting suspiciously"" and was told he would be searched under the Misuse of Drugs Act. The watchdog said it understood the boy's mother had made a formal complaint about the officer's actions. The IOPC said: ""Footage of the incident has been shared on social media that shows a police officer involved in an altercation with the boy, who he is seen to strike and kick."" The officer allegedly used excessive force against another member of the public in a separate incident, the watchdog said. Regional director Derrick Campbell said: ""We are aware that the footage circulated on social and other media has caused significant public concern. ""We will be carefully examining the circumstances of the incident and the officer's use of force."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct has confirmed it is investigating West Midlands Police said: ""We have suspended one of our officers following two complaints received about his conduct. ""A complaint was received after the officer stopped a teenager on 21 April in Melbourne Avenue, Newtown. ""In the ensuing incident it is alleged that the officer used unnecessary force in striking and kicking the young person."" The force said the second complaint relates to an incident on 20 April in Frederick Road, Aston, where two officers stopped a man they suspected was on a stolen bicycle.

Are more people breaking lockdown?,"Restrictions on daily life in many parts of the UK - to try to curb the spread of coronavirus - have been eased in recent weeks. Employers in England can bring staff back to the workplace and people can use public transport for non-essential journeys (while wearing face coverings). Many pubs, shops and restaurants have reopened, while most of those who have been shielding are no longer advised to stay at home. There are places where the easing of lockdown measures has been halted - Leicester and Greater Manchester, for example. But, overall, how have people in the UK responded? More people have started visiting their workplaces and going to non-grocery shops, according to Google mobility data. But these visits are still about a third lower than pre-lockdown in February. Visits to recreational sites such as parks and beaches have increased, with people making the most of the warmer weather. Trips apparently fell during the recent wet weather in late July, after a rise at the start of England's school summer holidays - even though most children have not been into school since March. The late May Bank Holiday also saw a spike in recreational trips, as people flocked to beaches, followed by another spike a month later when the good weather saw thousands head to coastal areas like Bournemouth and Poole. While more people are returning to the workplace, these trips are still well below February levels. In London, in the week to 25 July, workplace visits were down by about 45% compared with January. Cardiff has a similar rate, while in Edinburgh levels are still down by more than half and in Belfast by about 40%. After the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, workplace visits fell by 75% according to the data, which tracks the mobile phones of people with their location history turned on. While supermarkets stayed open throughout the pandemic, ''non-essential'' shops had to close, which was bad news for the embattled UK High Street. After falling sharply, sales of non-food items started to recover in May, and have bounced back further since shops were allowed to reopen in June. While many shops continued to sell goods online, the surge in online sales didn't cancel out the decline of in-store purchases, with total non-food sales down 15.9% in June compared with pre-lockdown levels. For department stores, online sales more than doubled in June, but overall sales fell more than 5% compared with February. By contrast, stores selling household goods bucked the trend with a slight overall sales increase, boosted by the home improvements boom. Just under one in five workers (18.5%) in the UK were on furlough in the first half of July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This included nearly two-thirds of those in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which is still greatly affected by the restrictions. More than nine million jobs have been covered bythe furlough schemesince March. It pays up to 80% of the salary of those placed on leave (up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month) because of the coronavirus pandemic. From 4 July, pubs, restaurants and hotels in England could reopen. This prompted about 15% of all workers in accommodation and food services to return to their jobs in the first half of the month, the highest proportion of any sector. Bookings are creeping back up again now that restaurants and other food venues are allowed to reopen. However, they are still down by more than a third compared with last year, according to figures from booking service OpenTable. Some restaurants have introduced a bookings-only policy to help manage capacity under social distancing rules, but some have complained thatcustomers are not showing up. In the five days to 19 July, 52% of UK adults surveyed by the ONS said they would feel comfortable eating at a restaurant, up from 47% the week before. But restaurant visits may increase under the government's''eat out to help out''August discount scheme, which is designed to help boost confidence in dining out. The 2.2 million people in England classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have been told they can stop shielding, but they are advised to take extra care outside the home. The level of commitment to shielding fell slightly by June 24-30, as the lockdown started to ease for other groups. But over half of those shielding in England were still following the guidance ''completely'' - 58%, down from 63% in May. Almost nine out of 10 people shielding reported having no visitors except for care reasons in May. By the end of June it was 77%. A higher proportion of women (62%) than men (54%) followed shielding advice to the letter, according to the ONS Police handed out more than 18,000 fixed penalty notices in England and Wales between 27 March and 20 July. These peaked around the Easter Bank Holiday and were mainly for breaking restriction of movement rules. In Scotland, more than 3,000 were handed out over the same period. Since restrictions have started to ease, the number of fines has fallen sharply. Across Scotland, England and Wales, Cumbria and North Yorkshire handed out the highest proportion of fines, and Staffordshire and West Midlands the least. In England, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport on 15 June, and in many enclosed public spaces on 24 July. Between 15 June and 20 July, 32 people in England and Wales were fined for not wearing a face covering on public transport, while just one person was fined for not obeying quarantine rules after returning from abroad. As the long-term financial effects of the pandemic start to take hold, it appears some employers are putting hiring plans on ice. About half as many online job adverts were posted during 17-24 July as the 2019 average, ONS analysis of job website Adzuna suggests. The number of available jobs plummeted in some areas, with vacancies in the charity and voluntary sector falling by more than 85%, and management and consulting jobs down about 78%. But availability in some sectors has almost returned to last year's levels. Health and social care vacancies are at about 93% of their 2019 level, rising to 98% for jobs in facilities and maintenance. In the spring, lower levels of travelling made a difference to the environment, with air pollution dropping compared with last year. Average readings of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main pollutants from vehicles, were lower throughout lockdown than on equivalent days of the week in 2019. But the gap narrowed after restrictions started to ease in May, and most people were able to travel further afield. At some points in June and July, readings were as high or higher than the equivalent day last year. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Olympic silver medal rower Polly Swann has joined the fight against Covid-19 as a junior doctor while training for the Tokyo games, which have been postponed until next year. The 31-year-old started working as a junior doctor in a Scottish hospital last week, having already completed her medical degree at Edinburgh University. Read more below. Silver medallist Polly Swann will be working in a Scottish hospital for the next three months. Speaking at the daily UK briefing, Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, suggests that the nation has passed the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak but stresses that we ""have a lot of work still to do"". She says people must still keep in mindthe five tests to be reachedbefore lockdown measures can be adjusted. The Scottish government this week announced it was expanding testing for Covid-19 within care homes and the latest figures show an increase of 121 suspected cases on the previous day. In all, there have been 3,466 cases of suspected Covid-19 cases in Scotland's care homes since the start of the outbreak, with 429 (40%) of homes having at least one resident with a suspected case in the last 14 days. A total of 568 (52%) of adult care homes have notified the Care Inspectorate of at least one case since the start of the epidemic - and 384 of those have reported more than one case. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick is heading up today's UK briefing. He says 1,129,907 tests for coronavirus have been carried out. There were 105,937 tests carried out on Friday.

A:We will give as much sector-specific advice as we can about things like PPE. The building industry is pretty good at that and it is a very safe industry generally. So they will have a lot of kit themselves. What we need to do is add to that. If they are outdoors, risk is quite low, but we will try to get sector-specific advice UK wide.

Â£76m pledged to help abuse victims in lockdown,"There is evidence of rising violence during the lockdown (picture posed by model) The government has pledged to spend Â£76m to support vulnerable people who are ""trapped in a nightmare"" at home during the coronavirus lockdown. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the new funding would help vulnerable children and victims of domestic violence and modern slavery. He also announced the launch of a taskforce which will aim to support rough sleepers after the lockdown. More than 105,000 coronavirus tests were provided on Friday. The total number of reported coronavirus-related deaths in the UK now stands at 28,131 - an increase of 621 on Friday's figure. The funding package will help community-based services that work with victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence and modern slavery, as well as vulnerable children, in England and Wales. This includes the recruitment of additional counsellors for victims of sexual violence. It will also go towards the provision of safe accommodation for survivors of domestic abuse and their children, and further support for vulnerable children, in England. JK Rowling donates Â£1m to two charities Lockdown exit must consider rise in abuse - May 'I'm in coronavirus lockdown with my abuser' There has beena ""surge"" in violence in the weeks since the lockdownwas introduced, a report by MPs said. It found there has been a rise in killings, while the number of calls to the National Domestic Abuse helpline run by Refuge are up 50% after three weeks. Speaking during the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Jenrick said: ""For some in our society these [lockdown] measures involve sacrifices that none of us would wish anyone to bear."" He stressed that victims will not be breaking the law if they need to seek help outside the home during lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Chief executive Sandra Horley said the previous housing requirements ""risked women having to make an unthinkable decision -  to stay with an abusive partner or risk homelessness"". She added that the package ""will help to plug some of the gaps left by a decade of austerity cuts"". Sally Field, chairwoman of Woman's Trust, said she welcomed the announcement ""somewhat cautiously"" because it is not clear how charities will access the funds. Women were being turned away from refuges even before the lockdown, she added, and the sector needs ""long-term sustainable funding"" in order to provide safe accommodation. She added that she expects an ""exponential increase in calls for help"" after lockdown because victims are unable to reach out for help while they are at home. Mr Jenrick said that, as a father of three girls, he ""cannot even imagine women and young children being put in this situation"" Mr Jenrick also said that 90% of rough sleepers known to councils have been offered accommodation and that the government is ""determined that as few people as possible return to life on the streets"" after the outbreak. Dame Louise Casey, who is already leading a review of rough sleeping, is to oversee an effort to ensure rough sleepers have safe accommodation while self-isolating, and to work with councils on the provision of long-term support. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, said he was ""delighted"" to see ministers ""seize the opportunity"" to make sure those helped during the pandemic do not return to rough sleeping. ""We look forward to working closely with the task force to provide as many people as possible with a home of their own,"" he said. Earlier, Harry Potter author JK Rowlingannounced she is donating Â£500,000 to Crisisand Â£500,000 to Refuge, which supports victims of domestic abuse. JK Rowling said too many people were losing loved ones The Â£76m funding pledge comes days afterMPs debated the Domestic Abuse Bill in Parliament. The bill brings in new protections for victims and proposes the first government definition of domestic abuse in England and Wales, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. On Tuesday, the government announced it would spend Â£3.1 million on services supporting children who witness ""appalling abuse"" at home during the coronavirus lockdown. But Labour said this fell ""woefully short"" of what was needed and proposed amendments to the bill that would see 10% of theÂ£750 million charity support package announced last monthring-fenced in a fast-track fund for domestic abuse charities. MPs also said the bill must do more to ensure that there is adequate accommodation for victims who flee their homes. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the government to house them in vacant hotel rooms during the lockdown until decent alternatives could be found. During Saturday's briefing, Mr Jenrick said the government will ""work with refuges to make this option available to them"" where necessary.

MPs also said the bill must do more to ensure that there is adequate accommodation for victims who flee their homes. Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called on the government to house them in vacant hotel rooms during the lockdown until decent alternatives could be found. During Saturday's briefing, Mr Jenrick said the government will ""work with refuges to make this option available to them"" where necessary.

"Are more people breaking lockdown?After six weeks of the restrictions, many aspects of everyday life have been transformed.Explainers","Restrictions on daily life in many parts of the UK - to try to curb the spread of coronavirus - have been eased in recent weeks. Employers in England can bring staff back to the workplace and people can use public transport for non-essential journeys (while wearing face coverings). Many pubs, shops and restaurants have reopened, while most of those who have been shielding are no longer advised to stay at home. There are places where the easing of lockdown measures has been halted - Leicester and Greater Manchester, for example. But, overall, how have people in the UK responded? More people have started visiting their workplaces and going to non-grocery shops, according to Google mobility data. But these visits are still about a third lower than pre-lockdown in February. Visits to recreational sites such as parks and beaches have increased, with people making the most of the warmer weather. Trips apparently fell during the recent wet weather in late July, after a rise at the start of England's school summer holidays - even though most children have not been into school since March. The late May Bank Holiday also saw a spike in recreational trips, as people flocked to beaches, followed by another spike a month later when the good weather saw thousands head to coastal areas like Bournemouth and Poole. While more people are returning to the workplace, these trips are still well below February levels. In London, in the week to 25 July, workplace visits were down by about 45% compared with January. Cardiff has a similar rate, while in Edinburgh levels are still down by more than half and in Belfast by about 40%. After the lockdown was imposed on 23 March, workplace visits fell by 75% according to the data, which tracks the mobile phones of people with their location history turned on. While supermarkets stayed open throughout the pandemic, ''non-essential'' shops had to close, which was bad news for the embattled UK High Street. After falling sharply, sales of non-food items started to recover in May, and have bounced back further since shops were allowed to reopen in June. While many shops continued to sell goods online, the surge in online sales didn't cancel out the decline of in-store purchases, with total non-food sales down 15.9% in June compared with pre-lockdown levels. For department stores, online sales more than doubled in June, but overall sales fell more than 5% compared with February. By contrast, stores selling household goods bucked the trend with a slight overall sales increase, boosted by the home improvements boom. Just under one in five workers (18.5%) in the UK were on furlough in the first half of July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This included nearly two-thirds of those in the arts, entertainment and recreation sector, which is still greatly affected by the restrictions. More than nine million jobs have been covered bythe furlough schemesince March. It pays up to 80% of the salary of those placed on leave (up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month) because of the coronavirus pandemic. From 4 July, pubs, restaurants and hotels in England could reopen. This prompted about 15% of all workers in accommodation and food services to return to their jobs in the first half of the month, the highest proportion of any sector. Bookings are creeping back up again now that restaurants and other food venues are allowed to reopen. However, they are still down by more than a third compared with last year, according to figures from booking service OpenTable. Some restaurants have introduced a bookings-only policy to help manage capacity under social distancing rules, but some have complained thatcustomers are not showing up. In the five days to 19 July, 52% of UK adults surveyed by the ONS said they would feel comfortable eating at a restaurant, up from 47% the week before. But restaurant visits may increase under the government's''eat out to help out''August discount scheme, which is designed to help boost confidence in dining out. The 2.2 million people in England classed as clinically extremely vulnerable have been told they can stop shielding, but they are advised to take extra care outside the home. The level of commitment to shielding fell slightly by June 24-30, as the lockdown started to ease for other groups. But over half of those shielding in England were still following the guidance ''completely'' - 58%, down from 63% in May. Almost nine out of 10 people shielding reported having no visitors except for care reasons in May. By the end of June it was 77%. A higher proportion of women (62%) than men (54%) followed shielding advice to the letter, according to the ONS Police handed out more than 18,000 fixed penalty notices in England and Wales between 27 March and 20 July. These peaked around the Easter Bank Holiday and were mainly for breaking restriction of movement rules. In Scotland, more than 3,000 were handed out over the same period. Since restrictions have started to ease, the number of fines has fallen sharply. Across Scotland, England and Wales, Cumbria and North Yorkshire handed out the highest proportion of fines, and Staffordshire and West Midlands the least. In England, wearing a face covering became compulsory on public transport on 15 June, and in many enclosed public spaces on 24 July. Between 15 June and 20 July, 32 people in England and Wales were fined for not wearing a face covering on public transport, while just one person was fined for not obeying quarantine rules after returning from abroad. As the long-term financial effects of the pandemic start to take hold, it appears some employers are putting hiring plans on ice. About half as many online job adverts were posted during 17-24 July as the 2019 average, ONS analysis of job website Adzuna suggests. The number of available jobs plummeted in some areas, with vacancies in the charity and voluntary sector falling by more than 85%, and management and consulting jobs down about 78%. But availability in some sectors has almost returned to last year's levels. Health and social care vacancies are at about 93% of their 2019 level, rising to 98% for jobs in facilities and maintenance. In the spring, lower levels of travelling made a difference to the environment, with air pollution dropping compared with last year. Average readings of nitrogen dioxide, one of the main pollutants from vehicles, were lower throughout lockdown than on equivalent days of the week in 2019. But the gap narrowed after restrictions started to ease in May, and most people were able to travel further afield. At some points in June and July, readings were as high or higher than the equivalent day last year. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them?

Why biggest challenge is yet to come on testing,"The government has hit its testing target, providing more than 120,000 coronavirus tests in a day by the end of April. A herculean effort was needed - three mega-labs to process tests, an online booking portal, a network of drive-thru testing centres, a home-testing service and the military deployed to run 70 mobile testing units. The government has been accused of being a little creative with its counting by including home-testing kits sent out to individuals and batches delivered to care homes, but not yet returned. Some of those may never be completed. But even if you were to discount those, the government has still achieved an eight-fold increase on where we were a month ago. It is certainly an impressive feat. However, there are still serious questions to ask about the government's approach to testing. In the early days of the pandemic, the government was quick to boast about its testing capacity. The ability to carry out 1,000 tests was quickly increased to 3,000. But as the outbreak spread, it quickly became clear the testing system was going to be overwhelmed. Public Health England and health officials in the rest of the UK relied on eight small labs and their own testers. That policy remained in place for weeks before the government entered into serious discussions with hospitals, universities and the private sector to increase testing capacity. This video can not be played Testing will ""help us to unlock the lockdown"", Matt Hancock says Should that have been done sooner? Many think so. Part of the problem was that the official approach until the middle of March was to let the virus spread in a controlled way. That meant there was little incentive to expand testing much beyond hospital patients. Containing local outbreaks, the reasoning behind the World Health Organization's ""test, test, test"" mantra, did not seem a top priority. Many believe the delay has proved costly. If there had been more testing available to care homes, for example, more lives might have been saved. This video can not be played Test and trace ""wasn't likely to add a huge amount given the resources"" - Prof Chris Whitty (24 April) Until mid-April tests were stopped once a care home passed five positive cases. And staff not showing symptoms were unable to get a test until late April despite concerns care workers were unwittingly causing outbreaks because they were infected but not showing symptoms, or transmitting the virus before falling ill. When asked at a daily briefing recently whether that had cost lives, it was telling that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab could only say lessons would be learned. Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, believes the UK, and others in Europe as well as the US for that matter, were ""complacent"" about the destruction that infectious disease outbreaks could bring, having escaped major outbreaks of Sars, Mers and Ebola. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents health service leaders, believes the target has certainly had a ""galvanising"" effect. But he says the obsession with the 100,000 figure could be a ""red herring"" and instead may have led to ""testing for testing's sake"". It is noticeable that in the past week, eligibility for testing has quickly expanded from hospital patients, care home residents and key staff to all over-65s and anyone who needs to leave home for work in England. And yet care homes are still saying they are struggling to get staff and residents tested and NHS staff have reported being unable to book tests because the slots have already been taken. Meanwhile, the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, which represents laboratory staff, has questioned the use of unregulated volunteers to carry out swab tests - if it is not done properly it can affect the accuracy of the test. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Prof Allyson Pollock, an expert in public health from Newcastle University, says the effort has been undermined by ""enormous"" underfunding of public health in recent years. Certainly, the UK has had to run to catch up. South Korea, which has managed to contain the virus to such an extent that on Thursday it reported it had seen no new domestic infections, had more than 200 labs ready to carry out tests from the start. It undoubtedly benefited from its experience in fighting the Mers and Sars outbreaks over the past two decades. Germany, another country with which the UK is often compared unfavourably, also had an in-built advantage in that it had a well-established biomedical engineering industry, which meant it was not as hard hit by the global shortage of testing chemicals and kit that other countries were. But there are plenty of other countries from Italy to Lithuania that have consistently out-tested the UK. Prof Pollock also believes there has been a ""lack of coherence"" to the approach taken to testing with no over-arching strategy to underpin it. In particular, she is concerned the UK may be ill-prepared for the next phase of the fight against coronavirus. The ultimate goal will be to provide testing to anyone who needs it in the whole population so local outbreaks can be contained once lockdown restrictions begin to be eased. But for containment to work that will need tests to be turned around quickly - it can still take 72 hours from start to finish for some - and then a quick and effective way of tracing people with whom infected individuals have been in close contact. The government points to the contact tracing app in development and the ""army"" of 18,000 tracers that are being recruited. But as yet it is unclear how these will knit together with the testing system. Local authorities, where many of these contact tracers are expected to be sourced from, have already expressed frustration at not being properly involved. If the testing and tracing regime is not effective, any easing of lockdown is bound to fail. The target for 100,000 tests may have passed, but the biggest challenge is yet to come.

Queues build as city tips start to reopen,"Drivers were already queuing before opening time Queues built up outside tips in Manchester as they reopened for the first time since lockdown. Cars were lined up before 07:30 BST, half an hour before some recycling centres were due to open for the first time in six weeks. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has urged councils to reopen tips ""as soon as possible"". Greater Manchester is one of the first places to do so, with restrictions and social distancing measures in place. But the region's mayor Andy Burnham said ""this is not a return to normal"", adding: ""We would ask the public to limit their journeys and only travel to a household waste and recycling centre if it is absolutely essential."" Greater Manchester is one of the first places to reopen tips Only vehicles with number plates ending in even numbers were allowed in to a waste centre on Reliance Street, to control the number of visitors, and some people were turned away. Centres were only accepting bagged general waste and Greater Manchester residents need to show proof of address to use the sites, which are limiting the number of cars allowed in. Mr Jenrick previously said reopening tips in a staged manner was ""sensible"". ""The longer we delay it, the longer those queues are going to be when the waste sites reopen."" However, some councils have expressed concernover reopening sites due to the need for social distancing measures. Councillor David Renard, from the Local Government Association, warned police would be required to manage ""inevitable"" queues. He said permit systems and longer opening hours could be considered and reopenings would be decided locally on risk assessments. Figures show fly-tipping has risen by 300% in rural communities since the closure of nearly all tips in March, while the number of DIY projects had increased as people were stuck at home.

"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds name baby sonCarrie Symonds says she ""couldn't be happier"" with their baby boy Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson.","Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds have named their baby boy Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson. The names are a tribute to their grandfathers and two doctors who treated Mr Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus, Ms Symonds wrote in an Instagram post. She posted a picture of herself with the baby,who was born on Wednesday. And she thanked staff at University College London Hospital, adding: ""I couldn't be happier. My heart is full."" The birth came just weeks after Mr Johnson was discharged from intensive care at another London hospital following treatment for coronavirus. Ms Symonds wrote on Saturday that their son shares his first name with the prime minister's grandfather, and the first of his middle names, Lawrie, with her own. Who is Carrie Symonds? Politicians and leaders congratulate PM on baby Meet the babies of Downing Street Wilfred Johnson was Mr Johnson's paternal grandfather. BBC One's Who Do You Think You Are found in 2008 that he was originally born Osman Wilfred Kemal - but his Turkish surname was changed during World War One. Carrie Symonds thanked NHS staff following the birth of her son in a post on Instagram Ms Symonds added that their son's other middle name, Nicholas, is a tribute to ""Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart - the two doctors that saved Boris' life last month"". The decision to pay tribute to the medics is ""an insight into just how serious things were for the prime minister"" after contracting the virus, said BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. Mr Johnsonsaid after he was discharged that it ""could have gone either way"". Dr Nick Price and Prof Nick Hart offered their ""warm congratulations"" to the PM and Ms Symonds. They said in a statement: ""We are honoured and humbled to have been recognised in this way, and we give our thanks to the incredible team of professionals who we work with at Guy's and St Thomas' and who ensure every patient receives the best care. ""We wish the new family every health and happiness."" Boris Johnson arriving back in Downing Street after the birth Mr Johnson was understood to be present throughout the birth on Wednesday, but later returned to Downing Street to lead the response to the pandemic. He is expected to take a ""short period"" of paternity leave at some point later this year, Downing Street has said. The newborn isonly the third baby born to a serving prime minister in living memory. Jonathan Blake added that the family will live in the flat above No 11 Downing Street, ""so we might see more of the little one in the weeks and months ahead"".

The company is operating a significantly reduced service, in line with increased border controls and a lower demand for travel triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. Just four services are running each day between London and Paris, and London and Brussels, according to timetables published on the company's website. PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel?

The names are a tribute to their grandfathers and two doctors who treated Mr Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus, Ms Symonds wrote in an Instagram post. She posted a picture of herself with the baby,who was born on Wednesday. And she thanked staff at University College London Hospital, adding: ""I couldn't be happier. My heart is full."" The birth came just weeks after Mr Johnson was discharged from intensive care at another London hospital following treatment for coronavirus.

US authorises Ebola drug for coronavirus treatmentThe Food and Drug Administration authorises emergency use of the experimental anti-viral drug.US & Canada,"Experts warn remdesivir shouldn't be seen as a ""magic bullet"" The US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised emergency use of the Ebola drug remdesivir for treating the coronavirus. The authorisation means the anti-viral drug can now be used on people who are hospitalised with severe Covid-19. A recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten the recovery time for people who were seriously ill. However, it did not significantly improve survival rates. Experts have warned the drug - which was originally developed to treat Ebola, and is produced by Gilead pharmaceutical company in California - should not be seen as a ""magic bullet"" for coronavirus. The drug interferes with the virus's genome, disrupting its ability to replicate. What is the most promising coronavirus drug? Drug has 'clear-cut' power to fight coronavirus During a meeting with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said the FDA authorisation was an important first step. The company would donate 1.5 million vials of the drug, he said. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn also said at the meeting: ""It's the first authorised therapy for Covid-19, so we're really proud to be part of it."" Emergency FDA authorisation is not the same as formal approval, which requires a higher level of review. The drug did not cure Ebola, and Gilead says on its website: ""Remdesivir is an experimental medicine that does not have established safety or efficacy for the treatment of any condition."" Gilead also warns of possible serious side-effects. However, President Trump has been a vocal supporter of remdesivir as a potential treatment for the coronavirus. In its clinical trial, whose full results are yet to be released, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11. The trials involved 1,063 people at hospitals around the world - including the US, France, Italy, the UK, China and South Korea. Some patients were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment. Dr Anthony Fauci who runs NIAID, said that remdesivir had ""a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery"". However, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - the trials did not give any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus. As much remains uncertain about the treatment regime, Gilead suggests a 10-day dosing duration for patients on ventilators and five days for patients who are not.

AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health The FDA's jurisdiction does not stretch overseas so the authorisation only applies to US. Experts also stressed that the emergency use is not the same as full approval. Gilead says it is currently using up existing stocks,externalof the drug, and the supply is limited. The US government will co-ordinate distribution of remdesivir to hospitals in US cities most heavily impacted by Covid-19. So it is not clear how much of the drug could be distributed worldwide, nor at what price. Gilead says it is donating 1.5 million individual doses of remdesivir, which ""equates to more than 140,000 treatment courses that will be provided at no cost"". The emergency distribution in the US is included in that. But worldwide there are more than three million confirmed cases, in 185 countries. Coronavirus: Tracking the global outbreak Gilead says it is striving to expand production rapidly, with global partners. The company aims to produce at least 500,000 treatment courses by October, 1 million treatment courses by December 2020 and millions more in 2021, if required. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a US body which studies drug prices,estimated the cost of a 10-day course of remdesivir,externalat $10 (Â£8), but suggested a cost-effective price could be as much as $4,500, based on the clinical trials. Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said the move ""shows the importance of exploring the use of existing therapeutics when new pathogens emerge"". ""This is an important step in options available to clinicians to treat those hospitalised with Covid-19.

Damien Chazelle's Netflix debut: Hit or miss? âââââ,"The Eddy is an indie jazz club on the rundown outskirts of Paris, co-owned by Elliot (AndrÃ© Holland) and Farid (Tahar Rahim). They are good friends. Elliot used to be a famous American jazz pianist. Farid didn't, which is why he's in charge of the business side, while his cooler-than-thou colleague looks after the music. They have a house band. It is on the cusp of a record deal with a prestigious label. But they're not quite at it. Particularly singer Maja (Joanna Kulig), who is struggling to get over an affair with Elliot, who in turn is struggling to get over his own personal issues, which are the cause for him stepping out of the limelight. AndrÃ© Holland, who stars as Elliot Udo and is seen here with Maja (played by Joanna Kulig), said he was interested in the history of black artists leaving America and coming to Paris to make music Farid doesn't have any such cares, he has two lovely children and a stocking-wearing wife, Amira (LeÃ¯la Bekhti). But he too has struggles. That's how it is with jazz. Money is his problem. The Eddy isn't going steady. Amira (LeÃ¯la Bekhti) being held by her husband Farid (Tahar Rahim), who co-owns The Eddy with Elliot Udo (AndrÃ© Holland) Nor is Elliot. He's broken up with Maja and split up with his wife, who stayed in America (we meet her, he was right to move continents). The last thing he needs is their bolshy 16-year-old daughter coming to stay and giving him a hard time. But when your lucks outâ¦ Julie (Amandla Stenberg) duly arrives with a bad attitude and a big suitcase, which is a lot to squeeze onto a mis-firing Vespa. By the time they arrive at Elliot's apartment she's mouthed-off at some dodgy types driving a sedan, poked her nose into her dad's love-life, and demanded a cigarette with all the grace of President Trump at a press conference. And this, we find out, is her good side. Feisty Julie (Amandla Stenberg) comes over from the US to see her father Elliot (AndrÃ© Holland) with an excess of issues It's not all woe, though. We are thankful for the music, the songs Maja's singing, thankful for all the joy they're bringing. Not to Elliot, obviously. He's too wrapped up in his own world, until he gets too wrapped up in Farid's, which he discovers is an uncouth underworld populated by gangsters who think The Bird is a girlfriend, not one of the greatest saxophonists of all time. At least he's got the The Eddy, his gritty subterranean jazz joint, a million metaphorical miles from the grand mainstream arts institutions of the 1st arrondissement. Its edgy, multi-cultural clientele is there to escape from the grim realities of their daily life, which disappear from view the moment they see the band play. They've come to be taken away by them. As you will be if you like jazz. Real-life trumpeter Ludovic Louis played the part of Ludo in the drama, where jazz was ""at the heart of"" how The Eddy was filmed The musical numbers aren't so much allowed time to breathe, but to luxuriate in a warm bath of televisual love followed by a lengthy manicure. I've seen spoilt children less indulged. Large chunks of each of the eight one-hour-plus episodes are devoted to the house band performing, jamming, rehearsing, riffing. It is the source of energy around which all else revolves: imagine Roddy Doyle's The Commitments (sans comedy) meeting French police procedural Spiral, and you'll have a sense of the vibe. This is not to suggest that The Eddy is a prog-rock length epic music promo, but to recognise jazz is not only the star of the show, but also its basis. The concept for the series started with a meeting in 2013 between exec producer Alan Poul (Six Feet Under) and lyricist and record producer Glen Ballard (Alanis Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill), who had written a bunch of jazz songs and assembled a band to perform them (two members of which are in the tv series). Glen Ballard (in the centre with two of the band members) wrote the songs, and has also worked with Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson and Alanis Morissette The narrative came second, which is rarely a good thing in a drama. There is so much that is right with The Eddy: The Cinema VÃ©ritÃ© handheld camerawork instigated by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land), who directed the first two episodes. Tahar Rahim and award-winning director Damien Chazelle sharing a joke on the set of The Eddy Both director Damien Chazelle and actor Emma Stone picked up Oscars for La La Land The excellent casting (there's a standout performance from Adil Dehbi as The Eddy's bar-hand with ambitions), the multilingual script, the honest depiction of contemporary life on the edgelands of Paris, the cinematography, the actors's performances, the musicians for goodness sake. They're all great. Julie (Amandla Stenberg) sharing a tender moment with Sim, superbly played by Adil Dehbi But the story isn't. It is plodding at best: an all-too predictable sequence of events with as many twists and turns as a Roman road. Quite how this came to be is difficult to fathom. The series was written by the multi-award-winning Jack Thorne, a very talented man with a string of critical and commercial hits to his name (Harry Potter And The Cursed Child, Skins, This is England, His Dark Materials). There's nothing technically wrong with the script, which is refreshingly bold in the way it interweaves languages - sometimes mid speech. The problem is the plot, which would barely sustain a cheap-and-cheerless 1980's TV drama, let alone this oceanic-sized Netflix series which is becalmed on a sea of two-dimensional clichÃ©s: a heroin addicted bassist (called Jude leading to the immortal line ""hey, Jude""), a stroppy daughter, a wrong'un brother, snobby in-laws, a bitchy ex-wife, a cash-strapped club. The Eddy needs an eddy. Maybe there's a grand plan afoot, and seasons two, three and four are already in the works, and the glacial speed of the story thus far will seem like the smartest set-up in the history of television. Maybe. But even the most committed improv jazz player knows there comes a point when freestyling has to resolve into something more concrete otherwise everybody falls asleep. That won't happen in The Eddy if you like the music, but if you don't you might well find yourself nodding off to the sound of the double bass.

Crashes involving cyclists in North Yorkshire have risen as more people take to their bikes during the lockdown, police say. The number of collisions with cyclists has gone up from 20% to 27%, compared to the same period last year. North Yorkshire Police said the rise coincided with an increase in excessive traffic speeds. The force has urged both cyclists and drivers to take extra care on the roads. Sgt Kirsten Aldridge said: âWeâve seen a lot more cyclists using our roads recently, from young families and novices to experienced riders. The number of collisions involving cyclists has also sadly risen during this time. âBut if drivers and cyclists remember to share the road and stick to the rules this weekend, their risk of being involved in a serious crash can be significantly reduced.â One of Birmingham Womenâs and Children's NHS Trust's senior staff has died with coronavirus. Mark Piggot was responsible for leading capital projects and programmes for the trust. Mr Piggot was a devoted husband and father to his two sons. His wife Julie said: ""Mark was a great family man, a loving husband and fantastic dad to our sons Daniel and Alex. ""Weâre devastated to have to say goodbye to him.""

According to a company source,senior leaders have warned""cuts could be as high as 8,000, but efforts to mitigate the impact are ongoing"". It had announced plans to save Â£750m but now ""needs to take further action"". The aviation industry has been badly hit by the pandemic with many flights across the world currently suspended. As far as raising money goes, this method of generating donations takes some beating! Retired police dog handler Stuart Hazard had his eyebrows shaved off by his two sons in order to raise money. And live on Facebook, no less! Good effort! Bin crews in the East Riding of Yorkshire have had tributes paid to them for their work during the coronavirus crisis lockdown. The local council also thanked residents,externalfor putting their bins out before 07:00 in order to support staff complete their rounds in recent weeks. A surprise socially-distanced birthday party was held for William Cope to help him toast his 100th birthday. Mr Cope, from Yeovil, was presented with a specially baked cake and a local band performed in his honour. Neighbours turned out to applaud him and local police also took part by driving through with their blue lights on. The celebration was arranged by Somerset Community Council who were tipped off about Mr Cope's milestone day. Mr Cope said: ""Thank you very much for coming out today - I didn't realise so many people would be here, it's a very big surprise indeed."" Liverpool comedian John Bishop has sent a video message of appreciation to the city's NHS workers. However, his choice of venue in which to film his message might surprise you! Try to withhold yoursnortsof laughter. Naomi Grimley, BBC News UK ministers continue to insist their policies are âscience-led"" but the evidence on coronavirus is still evolving. There's been some suggestion the UK's two metres apart rule could be relaxed in order to get more people back to work in offices and factories. The World Health Organization recommends 1m (3.2ft) between people and is sticking to its view the disease is mainly transmitted through droplets, from sneezing and coughing, rather than lingering airborne. But the BBC understands some of the government's scientific advisers remain wary about relaxing the two-metre rule - arguing that two seconds spent 1m apart is as dangerous as spending one minute 2m apart. Another suggestion being mooted within government is that commuters may be asked to take their own temperature before travelling. However, many experts argue this wouldnât stop asymptomatic carriers of Covid-19 slipping through the net. Queues have built up outside tips in Greater Manchesteras they reopened for the first time since lockdown. Cars were lined up before 07:30 BST, half an hour before some recycling centres were due to open for the first time in six weeks. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick has urged councils to reopen tips ""as soon as possible"". Greater Manchester is one of the first places to do so, with restrictions and social distancing measures in place.  Villagers missing their monthly market have come up with a unique way of continuing to do business. Ruddington Village Market, in Nottinghamshire,will be broadcast live on Instagramthis month. The market plans to have live pub tours, bouquet demonstrations and tips on cutting your own hair. Organiser Mark Pinks said businesses would have 10-minute slots for demonstrations. Meanwhile, business owner Alex Preston said it would help sellers keep in touch with customers. A further 370 people have died with coronavirus in England, bringing the total number of reported deaths to 20,853. The figures published by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number for the most deaths - then just those in hospitals - occurring on a single day, when 864 people died. The latest UK-wide figures - which now include deaths in care homes and in the community - will be published later. Coronavirus tests being carried out in Gateshead arebeing sent hundreds of miles away for processing. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital announced in April it had established one of the biggest NHS coronavirus testing units in the country. But swabs taken at a drive-in testing site in the car park of nearby Ikea are being sent 240 miles to Milton Keynes. The Department for Health said the two laboratories processed samples from separate categories of people. The government has pledged Â£30m to keep trams and metro trains running for key workers for 12 more weeks. But Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said the money was not enough. Services like Manchester's Metrolink have lost millions of pounds in revenue because of the coronavirus lockdown. The funding is splitbetween that service, the Tyne and Wear Metro,  Sheffield Supertram, Midlands Metro and Nottingham Express Transit systems. Transport Secretary Grantâ¯ Shapps said protecting key transport was ""vital"". Kidderminster Lions Girls Under-9s have got together to thank key workers as the coronavirus pandemic continues.

"Damien Chazelle's Netflix debut: Hit or miss? âââââExcellent casting and music, but the narrative is plodding with an all-too predictable sequence of events.","The Eddy is an indie jazz club on the rundown outskirts of Paris, co-owned by Elliot (AndrÃ© Holland) and Farid (Tahar Rahim). They are good friends. Elliot used to be a famous American jazz pianist. Farid didn't, which is why he's in charge of the business side, while his cooler-than-thou colleague looks after the music. They have a house band. It is on the cusp of a record deal with a prestigious label. But they're not quite at it. Particularly singer Maja (Joanna Kulig), who is struggling to get over an affair with Elliot, who in turn is struggling to get over his own personal issues, which are the cause for him stepping out of the limelight. AndrÃ© Holland, who stars as Elliot Udo and is seen here with Maja (played by Joanna Kulig), said he was interested in the history of black artists leaving America and coming to Paris to make music Farid doesn't have any such cares, he has two lovely children and a stocking-wearing wife, Amira (LeÃ¯la Bekhti). But he too has struggles. That's how it is with jazz. Money is his problem. The Eddy isn't going steady. Amira (LeÃ¯la Bekhti) being held by her husband Farid (Tahar Rahim), who co-owns The Eddy with Elliot Udo (AndrÃ© Holland) Nor is Elliot. He's broken up with Maja and split up with his wife, who stayed in America (we meet her, he was right to move continents). The last thing he needs is their bolshy 16-year-old daughter coming to stay and giving him a hard time. But when your lucks outâ¦ Julie (Amandla Stenberg) duly arrives with a bad attitude and a big suitcase, which is a lot to squeeze onto a mis-firing Vespa. By the time they arrive at Elliot's apartment she's mouthed-off at some dodgy types driving a sedan, poked her nose into her dad's love-life, and demanded a cigarette with all the grace of President Trump at a press conference. And this, we find out, is her good side. Feisty Julie (Amandla Stenberg) comes over from the US to see her father Elliot (AndrÃ© Holland) with an excess of issues It's not all woe, though. We are thankful for the music, the songs Maja's singing, thankful for all the joy they're bringing. Not to Elliot, obviously. He's too wrapped up in his own world, until he gets too wrapped up in Farid's, which he discovers is an uncouth underworld populated by gangsters who think The Bird is a girlfriend, not one of the greatest saxophonists of all time. At least he's got the The Eddy, his gritty subterranean jazz joint, a million metaphorical miles from the grand mainstream arts institutions of the 1st arrondissement. Its edgy, multi-cultural clientele is there to escape from the grim realities of their daily life, which disappear from view the moment they see the band play. They've come to be taken away by them. As you will be if you like jazz. Real-life trumpeter Ludovic Louis played the part of Ludo in the drama, where jazz was ""at the heart of"" how The Eddy was filmed The musical numbers aren't so much allowed time to breathe, but to luxuriate in a warm bath of televisual love followed by a lengthy manicure. I've seen spoilt children less indulged. Large chunks of each of the eight one-hour-plus episodes are devoted to the house band performing, jamming, rehearsing, riffing. It is the source of energy around which all else revolves: imagine Roddy Doyle's The Commitments (sans comedy) meeting French police procedural Spiral, and you'll have a sense of the vibe. This is not to suggest that The Eddy is a prog-rock length epic music promo, but to recognise jazz is not only the star of the show, but also its basis. The concept for the series started with a meeting in 2013 between exec producer Alan Poul (Six Feet Under) and lyricist and record producer Glen Ballard (Alanis Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill), who had written a bunch of jazz songs and assembled a band to perform them (two members of which are in the tv series). Glen Ballard (in the centre with two of the band members) wrote the songs, and has also worked with Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson and Alanis Morissette The narrative came second, which is rarely a good thing in a drama. There is so much that is right with The Eddy: The Cinema VÃ©ritÃ© handheld camerawork instigated by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land), who directed the first two episodes. Tahar Rahim and award-winning director Damien Chazelle sharing a joke on the set of The Eddy Both director Damien Chazelle and actor Emma Stone picked up Oscars for La La Land The excellent casting (there's a standout performance from Adil Dehbi as The Eddy's bar-hand with ambitions), the multilingual script, the honest depiction of contemporary life on the edgelands of Paris, the cinematography, the actors's performances, the musicians for goodness sake. They're all great. Julie (Amandla Stenberg) sharing a tender moment with Sim, superbly played by Adil Dehbi But the story isn't. It is plodding at best: an all-too predictable sequence of events with as many twists and turns as a Roman road. Quite how this came to be is difficult to fathom. The series was written by the multi-award-winning Jack Thorne, a very talented man with a string of critical and commercial hits to his name (Harry Potter And The Cursed Child, Skins, This is England, His Dark Materials). There's nothing technically wrong with the script, which is refreshingly bold in the way it interweaves languages - sometimes mid speech. The problem is the plot, which would barely sustain a cheap-and-cheerless 1980's TV drama, let alone this oceanic-sized Netflix series which is becalmed on a sea of two-dimensional clichÃ©s: a heroin addicted bassist (called Jude leading to the immortal line ""hey, Jude""), a stroppy daughter, a wrong'un brother, snobby in-laws, a bitchy ex-wife, a cash-strapped club. The Eddy needs an eddy. Maybe there's a grand plan afoot, and seasons two, three and four are already in the works, and the glacial speed of the story thus far will seem like the smartest set-up in the history of television. Maybe. But even the most committed improv jazz player knows there comes a point when freestyling has to resolve into something more concrete otherwise everybody falls asleep. That won't happen in The Eddy if you like the music, but if you don't you might well find yourself nodding off to the sound of the double bass.

"Why biggest challenge is yet to come on testingThe 100,000-a-day target may have been met, but there are still lots of questions about the strategy.Health","The government has hit its testing target, providing more than 120,000 coronavirus tests in a day by the end of April. A herculean effort was needed - three mega-labs to process tests, an online booking portal, a network of drive-thru testing centres, a home-testing service and the military deployed to run 70 mobile testing units. The government has been accused of being a little creative with its counting by including home-testing kits sent out to individuals and batches delivered to care homes, but not yet returned. Some of those may never be completed. But even if you were to discount those, the government has still achieved an eight-fold increase on where we were a month ago. It is certainly an impressive feat. However, there are still serious questions to ask about the government's approach to testing. In the early days of the pandemic, the government was quick to boast about its testing capacity. The ability to carry out 1,000 tests was quickly increased to 3,000. But as the outbreak spread, it quickly became clear the testing system was going to be overwhelmed. Public Health England and health officials in the rest of the UK relied on eight small labs and their own testers. That policy remained in place for weeks before the government entered into serious discussions with hospitals, universities and the private sector to increase testing capacity. This video can not be played Testing will ""help us to unlock the lockdown"", Matt Hancock says Should that have been done sooner? Many think so. Part of the problem was that the official approach until the middle of March was to let the virus spread in a controlled way. That meant there was little incentive to expand testing much beyond hospital patients. Containing local outbreaks, the reasoning behind the World Health Organization's ""test, test, test"" mantra, did not seem a top priority. Many believe the delay has proved costly. If there had been more testing available to care homes, for example, more lives might have been saved. This video can not be played Test and trace ""wasn't likely to add a huge amount given the resources"" - Prof Chris Whitty (24 April) Until mid-April tests were stopped once a care home passed five positive cases. And staff not showing symptoms were unable to get a test until late April despite concerns care workers were unwittingly causing outbreaks because they were infected but not showing symptoms, or transmitting the virus before falling ill. When asked at a daily briefing recently whether that had cost lives, it was telling that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab could only say lessons would be learned. Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, believes the UK, and others in Europe as well as the US for that matter, were ""complacent"" about the destruction that infectious disease outbreaks could bring, having escaped major outbreaks of Sars, Mers and Ebola. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents health service leaders, believes the target has certainly had a ""galvanising"" effect. But he says the obsession with the 100,000 figure could be a ""red herring"" and instead may have led to ""testing for testing's sake"". It is noticeable that in the past week, eligibility for testing has quickly expanded from hospital patients, care home residents and key staff to all over-65s and anyone who needs to leave home for work in England. And yet care homes are still saying they are struggling to get staff and residents tested and NHS staff have reported being unable to book tests because the slots have already been taken. Meanwhile, the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, which represents laboratory staff, has questioned the use of unregulated volunteers to carry out swab tests - if it is not done properly it can affect the accuracy of the test. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise IMMUNITY:Can you catch the virus twice? HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Prof Allyson Pollock, an expert in public health from Newcastle University, says the effort has been undermined by ""enormous"" underfunding of public health in recent years. Certainly, the UK has had to run to catch up. South Korea, which has managed to contain the virus to such an extent that on Thursday it reported it had seen no new domestic infections, had more than 200 labs ready to carry out tests from the start. It undoubtedly benefited from its experience in fighting the Mers and Sars outbreaks over the past two decades. Germany, another country with which the UK is often compared unfavourably, also had an in-built advantage in that it had a well-established biomedical engineering industry, which meant it was not as hard hit by the global shortage of testing chemicals and kit that other countries were. But there are plenty of other countries from Italy to Lithuania that have consistently out-tested the UK. Prof Pollock also believes there has been a ""lack of coherence"" to the approach taken to testing with no over-arching strategy to underpin it. In particular, she is concerned the UK may be ill-prepared for the next phase of the fight against coronavirus. The ultimate goal will be to provide testing to anyone who needs it in the whole population so local outbreaks can be contained once lockdown restrictions begin to be eased. But for containment to work that will need tests to be turned around quickly - it can still take 72 hours from start to finish for some - and then a quick and effective way of tracing people with whom infected individuals have been in close contact. The government points to the contact tracing app in development and the ""army"" of 18,000 tracers that are being recruited. But as yet it is unclear how these will knit together with the testing system. Local authorities, where many of these contact tracers are expected to be sourced from, have already expressed frustration at not being properly involved. If the testing and tracing regime is not effective, any easing of lockdown is bound to fail. The target for 100,000 tests may have passed, but the biggest challenge is yet to come.

Silver medallist Polly Swann will be working in a Scottish hospital for the next three months. Speaking at the daily UK briefing, Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, suggests that the nation has passed the peak of the Covid-19 outbreak but stresses that we ""have a lot of work still to do"". She says people must still keep in mindthe five tests to be reachedbefore lockdown measures can be adjusted. The Scottish government this week announced it was expanding testing for Covid-19 within care homes and the latest figures show an increase of 121 suspected cases on the previous day. In all, there have been 3,466 cases of suspected Covid-19 cases in Scotland's care homes since the start of the outbreak, with 429 (40%) of homes having at least one resident with a suspected case in the last 14 days. A total of 568 (52%) of adult care homes have notified the Care Inspectorate of at least one case since the start of the epidemic - and 384 of those have reported more than one case. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick is heading up today's UK briefing. He says 1,129,907 tests for coronavirus have been carried out. There were 105,937 tests carried out on Friday. Data shows 182,260 people have tested positive - of those testing positive across all settings, 28,131 have now died, which is an increase of 621 fatalities since yesterday.

Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, is on BBC Radio Scotland's Off The Ball for the sixth successive Saturday, answering questions from listeners: Q:Do we know if and when face masks will be distributed to suppliers to enable the construction industry to get up and running safely again? A:We will give as much sector-specific advice as we can about things like PPE. The building industry is pretty good at that and it is a very safe industry generally. So they will have a lot of kit themselves. What we need to do is add to that. If they are outdoors, risk is quite low, but we will try to get sector-specific advice UK wide. Q:My wedding is due in July with more than 80 guests, should I cancel it? A:Yes, you should. I'd love to be wrong, but I can't see a way of 80 people being allowed in the same room by July. It might be a small wedding instead and postpone a larger gathering until later. Q:I am a dad separated from my 17-year-old daughter by divorce. She is in Perth and I am in Kilmarnock. Can I visit her? A:Not yet. That might come if we expand the ""bubble"" with whom families can have contact.

The rail company said the rule for travellers through the Channel Tunnel to wear face coverings is in line with guidelines from the French and Belgian governments. A statement said any type of face covering is allowed ""as long as it effectively covers your nose and mouth"". All
residents and staff in care homes where someone has coronavirus will be tested,
the Welsh Government has said. Testing
had previously been limited to those with symptoms, and people moving into a care home. The
Welsh Conservatives welcomed the âu-turnâ and called for testing to be expanded
to include all care home residents and staff. The
Welsh Government said the âlatest evidenceâ prompted the change in policy. Repeat
tests will be done a week later and neighbouring care homes may also be tested. Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the coronavirus outbreak response at Public Health Wales, said: âWe seem to have passed the peak and flattened the curve of new cases of Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) in Wales, which appears to be an indication of the effectiveness of lockdown measures. ""We are currently working with Welsh Government to determine the best approach for when the lockdown is eventually eased. âIn the meantime, social distancing rules remain in effect. ""The message has not changed - anyone can get coronavirus, anyone can spread it. ""Stay home, protect the NHS, and save lives."" Public Health Wales has announced the deaths of another 44 people with coronavirus, taking its total to 969. There were another 183 confirmed cases, taking the total to 10,155 although the actual figure will be higher because not everyone is being tested.

âCovid wealth divideâ could widen as lockdown measures are eased, according to
a health data analyst. Jamie
Jenkins, former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics,
says a""comprehensive testing system will be needed if inequality is to be kept to a minimum"". Data
published yesterday suggestedpeople living in Wales' most deprived areas are more
likely to die of coronavirus than those in more affluent places. The
Welsh Government has published a series of questions it will consider before
easing any lockdown measures. One
is âdoes it have a positive impact on equality?â Public Health Wales has announced the deaths of another 44 people with coronavirus, taking its total to 969.

Families considering fostering or adoption are being urged to press ahead with their plans despite the coronavirus pandemic. According to Elin Lewis Jones, the head of Conwy council's fostering department, the recruitment process must continue in order to meet future demand. The process of assessing families can take months and the council is concerned applications might take longer to process during this period. The National Adoption Service has also said it remains open and encourages anyone considering making an application to continue with the process.   A total of170
extra nurses have been trained to work in critical care units,externalin north Wales during the pandemic,
according to Bangor University. It said the âreinforcementsâ have
completed a course more than ""doubling the numbers available to work in intensive
care unitsâ (ICU) at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd in Bodelwyddan
and Wrexham Maelor Hospital. The volunteers have been drawn from
existing staff with similar skills. Naomi
Jenkins, from the university's School of Health Sciences, said: âSome
of them felt they should come back because theyâve worked in ICU before and
some have just wanted to do it.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
