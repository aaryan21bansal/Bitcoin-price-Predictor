Trump brings forward Mattis departure,"Patrick Shanahan (pictured) will take over from General James Mattis, who resigned on Friday US President Donald Trump has forced Defence Secretary James Mattis to leave his post early, appointing an acting successor to take over in the new year. Gen Mattis, 68, strongly hinted at policy differences with Mr Trump when he resigned on Friday. He offered to stay in the job until February but will now leave on 1 January after Mr Trump reportedly balked at media coverage of his exit. Deputy Defence Secretary Patrick Shanahan, 56, will take over the role. Mr Trump has lauded his achievements and described him as ""very talented"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Shanahan, a former executive at the aerospace giant Boeing, joined the Pentagon in July 2017 after Mr Trump nominated him. He was reportedly a vocal supporter of the president's plan to establish a sixth branch of the armed forces, known as the ""space force"". Originally from Washington state, Mr Shanahan studied mechanical engineering and business at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined Boeing as an engineer in 1986. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington James Mattis strongly hinted at policy differences with President Trump when he resigned Donald Trump had initially framed James Mattis's departure as a ""retirement"" but his resignation letter - full of implied criticism of the president's foreign policy - showed that was not the case. The president seldom handles rebukes kindly, so it became increasingly unlikely the former general would be allowed his requested two-month departure timeframe. On Sunday morning, the hammer came down - as is the new norm - via a presidential tweet. White House revolving door: Who's gone? Macron 'deeply regrets' Trump's Syria plan Mr Mattis's replacement, Deputy Secretary Patrick Shanahan, spent most of his career working for Boeing. Having a former executive of a major defence contractor running the Pentagon, even on a temporary basis, is unusual, to say the least. It's a job usually held by politicians with military oversight experience. Meanwhile, the president appears to be trying to douse the fire that started this personnel crisis. He also tweeted on Sunday that the US withdrawal from Syria - abruptly announced last week - would be ""slow and highly coordinated"". Given the Mattis news, that may not be enough to calm the nerves of allies and assuage the anger of US foreign policy hands. It is, however, a start. Gen Mattis resigned shortly afterPresident Trump announced his decision to withdraw all US troops from Syria. While not mentioning it in his resignation letter directly, the general previously warned that it would be a ""strategic blunder"". In his letter, he also said the president had the right to appoint someone ""whose views are better aligned with yours"". Trump's Syria troop removal prompts questions Trump's foreign policy worries allies But shortly after announcing Mr Shanahan's appointment on Sunday, Mr Trump moved to calm widespread concerns over the pullout which he initially said would be ""rapid"". Mr Trump said on Twitter that he had spoken with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey about ""our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow and highly coordinated withdrawal of US troops from the area"". Mr Erdogan's office said the two leaders had agreed to ""ensure coordination between their countries' military, diplomatic and other officials to avoid a power vacuum which could result following any abuse of the withdrawal and transition phase in Syria"". Kurdish forces in Syria, which Turkey regards as a threat, have been successfully fighting the Islamic State group with US support. They now fear Turkey will use America's withdrawal to launch a new campaign against them. After Mattis, Trump's foreign policy worries allies The White House revolving door: Who's gone?

US shutdown could stretch into new year,"The National Archives building in Washington has been shut down by the dispute A partial US government shutdown over budget spending could continue right up to the opening of the next Congress on 3 January, a Trump aide has said. The shutdown began at midnight Friday after opposition Democrats resisted President Donald Trump's demand for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. Mr Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, suggested Democrats were ""beholden"" to their left wing. A Democratic senator said his party opposed any funding for the wall. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week ""That's correct,"" Sen Jeff Merkley told an ABC news interviewer when asked if his party was not going to approve any money for the Trump administration's project. ""None."" Earlier, the party offered a sum of $1.3bn for border security. Mr Trump himself took to Twitter on Sunday to defend his plans for the border with Mexico. Allow Twitter content?

""It's very possible that this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mr Trump's acting chief of staff told ABC. ""This is what Washington looks like when you have a president who refuses to sort of go along to get along."" This video can not be played Testy exchanges between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office In a separate interview for Fox News, he said he was waiting to hear from Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer about a new Republican offer, without specifying the sum. Speaking to ABC's This Week programme, Sen Merkley said a ""30-foot concrete wall"" and ""30-foot steel spikes"" were ""not the smart way"". His Republican Party controls both chambers of the outgoing Congress and the budget was indeed passed by the House on Thursday by 217 votes to 185. However, he needs to find 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate, where the Republicans currently have 51, so he needs to enlist the support of Democrats there. Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00 GMT Saturday). Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. The current Congress reassembles on Thursday after the Christmas holiday. On 3 January, new members of Congress will be sworn in, having been elected in November's mid-term elections. From that point, Democrats will enjoy a majority in the House of Representatives. Mr Trump has said the shutdown could last a ""very long time"".

Japan emperor gives emotional farewell,"Emperor Akihito delivers his last birthday address alongside his wife Empress Michiko More than 80,000 people have paid their respects to Japan's Emperor Akihito as he gave his final birthday address before his abdication in April. The emperor, 85, said he took ""deep comfort"" that his reign had passed without Japan again engaging in war. He became emotional as he thanked the people of Japan and his wife Empress Michiko for their support. Akihito is the first living monarch to relinquish the Chrysanthemum throne in nearly 200 years. The emperor, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, will be succeeded in April by his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito. His three-decade reign is known as the ""Heisei"" era, which means ""achieving peace"" in Japanese. Japan princess 'insecure' over new role Will prince be a 'fresh breeze' for Japan? Ten things about Japan's emperor During his brief address, Emperor Akihito also offered condolences and sympathy to Japanese who had lost family members or suffered damage - a reference to the earthquakes, severe storms and heatwaves that have hit the country over the past year. More than 80,000 people attended Emperor Akihito's final birthday appearance Although his position is ceremonial and he has no political power, Akihito has spent much of his reign spreading awareness of Japan's actions during World War Two under the rule of his father, Emperor Hirohito. He has expressed regret over Japan's military actions in both China and the Korean peninsula, and has also visited several Pacific battlefields to honour the dead, actions that have brought him into conflict with right-wing groups at home. Ahead of his birthday he told reporters: ""It is important not to forget that countless lives were lost in World War Two... and to pass on this history accurately to those born after the war.""

'Halfwit' attacks Banksy's latest mural,"This video can not be played Gary Owen messaged Banksy in August to paint a mural in Port Talbot Banksy's latest artwork was attacked as a ""drunk halfwit"" tried to damage the mural on a garage wall in south Wales. A security guard chased the culprit away on Saturday as he tried to pull down the newly-fitted plastic screen that protects the Port Talbot graffiti. Police were called and the local community fears the artwork may become a target for ""some idiot who wants to make a name for themselves."" Extra security guards have been drafted in to protect 'Season's Greetings'. ""Some drunk halfwit has tried to pull the fencing down and the protection glazing at the Banksy artwork,"" Gary Owen posted on the local Facebook page he runs. Just who is Banksy? The world's most famous 'vandal' ""This art is for Port Talbot, Neath and surrounding areas. We do not want it wrecked."" The Facebook post saying the Banksy artwork was attacked has been shared hundreds of times Hollywood actor Michael Sheen has helped pay for the protective sheet Screen star Michael Sheen is from the area and wants to help protect Port Talbot's Banksy The mural was not damaged and police ultimately did not attend the incident at about 22:30 GMT on Saturday - just hours after half of the artwork in Taibach was covered by a protective plastic screen. Hollywood actor Michael Sheen contributed towards the cost of the screen and the local movie star is also helping pay for the security. ""It's amazing and such an honour that Banksy chose to come and paint his latest piece in Port Talbot."" added Mr Owen, the man who messaged Banksy in August to ask if he would paint a piece in Port Talbot. ""We should be treasuring this privilege and it's very sad that some people want to spoil it for everyone and give Port Talbot a bad name. ""I do fear it'll become a target for some idiot who wants to make a name for themselves - and that's sad."" Volunteers protecting the mural say at least 2,000 people have visited it The image appears on two sides of a garage in Taibach and depicts a child enjoying snow falling - the other side reveals it is a fire emitting ash. A local businessman covered one side of the work with a temporary protective plastic sheet on Saturday afternoon - and on Sunday the other side will be covered. A more permanent solution is expected to be installed in the new year. Volunteers working to protect the elusive artist's latest mural said at least2,000 visitors have turned up to see it over the first two days. It appeared on Ian Lewis' breeze block garage on a lane behind Caradog Street in Taibach on Tuesday. Traffic wardens have been drafted in by the local council to control traffic.

UNiDAYS founder denies harassment claims,"Josh Rathour has been celebrated for his entrepreneurship. The chief executive of popular student discount site UNiDAYS has strongly denied claims made against him in an anonymous online petition. More than 750 people have signed a letter accusing Josh Rathour, who set up the company in 2011, of sexual harassment and bullying. The allegations were made on Organise, a campaign website that hosted a petition against the boss of Ted Baker. A spokesperson for Mr Rathour said he ""would welcome any investigation"". A statement from UNiDAYS said the company would be conducting an investigation in the new year ""to establish the facts"". The firm, which offers money off clothes, gadgets, music, transport and food has grown into a global brand. The site, and accompanying app, both marketed at ""Generation Z,"" boasts 10 million members. Its many partners include Adidas, Asos, Microsoft, Nike and Topshop. UNiDAYS was founded, and is based, in Nottingham The petition, which was published on Saturday, claims inappropriate behaviour at UNiDAYS was ""rife and wholly unchecked"". It also alleges that some staff were made to sign so-called ""gagging orders"" - effectively banning them from disclosing their grievances. UNiDAYS' human resources team, it adds, ""wilfully ignored reports of harassment"". A spokesperson for Mr Rathour said he was ""confident any investigation will not find any truth in the allegations about his behaviour at work"". The spokesperson added that the culture at UNiDAYS was inclusive and respectful and that half the line managers were female. A source close to the firm claimed none of the allegations detailed in the petition had officially been put to the company. Mr Rathour, 36, has been celebrated for his entrepreneurship. His firm, which is headquartered in Nottingham, has offices in London, New York and Sydney, and employs more than 250 people worldwide. In 2015, UNiDAYS was crowned Digital Business of the Year. Organise founder Nat Whalley says former UNiDAYS employees were inspired by a Ted Baker petition Allegations of harassment at the company had appeared on the workplace review site Glassdoor, but have since been removed. Nat Whalley, the founder of Organise which is hosting the current petition, said it was started by a group of former UNiDAYS employees. She says they were inspired by a similar petition against Ray Kelvin, the founder of Ted Baker, calling for an end to ""forced hugging"" and a culture of harassment.

German 'fake news' reporter may be chargedDer Spiegel is to file a criminal complaint against its rogue reporter Claas Relotius.,"The German reporter Claas Relotius, accused by top news magazine Der Spiegel of faking stories, could now face embezzlement charges. Der Spiegel says it is filing a criminal complaint alleging he solicited donations for Syrian orphans from readers with any proceeds going to his personal account. Der Spiegel said last week that Relotius admitted faking some stories. The reporter, 33, has yet to comment on the embezzlement allegations. In the latest development,Der Spiegel reports (in German),externalthat it received messages from readers saying Relotius had used a private email account to ask for donations to help Syrian orphans in Turkey. The money should be sent to his personal bank account, the magazine quotes readers as saying. The publication says it is not yet clear what sort of response he received - how much money was collected or where it ended up. Der Spiegel is gathering evidence to pass on to prosecutors. IGN sacks writer amid plagiarism controversy ABC boss quits over political interference claims Relotius' appeal for donations was linked toan article he wrote about two Syrian street-children, a brother and sister, in Turkey - parts of which Der Spiegel says were faked. A Turkish photographer who accompanied Relotius on the story said the reporter had made up some aspects of the boy's life and heavily fictionalised others. The photographer suspects that the sister may not have existed at all. The American ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has also intervened, writing to Der Spiegel's editor to demand an independent investigation and accusing the publication of institutional bias against the US. Like many publications, Der Spiegel has carried stories critical of President Donald Trump. One of the Relotius stories at issue centred on the US-Mexican border. Der Spiegel said its investigation revealed that he had fabricated information about seeing a hand-painted sign in a town in Minnesota that read: ""Mexicans Keep Out."" False information appeared in other stories including one about inmates at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay and another about the US NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Relotius, who has been sacked, told the magazine he regretted his actions and was deeply ashamed. According to Der Spiegel, he admitted deceiving readers in some 14 stories. But he says many of the 60 articles he has written for the magazine are accurate. The Hamburg-based publication described the revelations as ""a low point in Der Spiegel's 70-year history"".

Deadly tsunami triggered by volcano,"This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water At least 222 people have been killed and 843 injured after a tsunami hit coastal towns on Indonesia's Sunda Strait, government officials say. There was no warning of the giant waves which struck at night, destroying hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees. It is thought undersea landslides from the Anak Krakatau volcano caused them. President Joko Widodo has expressed his sorrow for the victims and urged people to be patient. Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. The Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Sumatra, connects the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean. The disaster management agency has warned people to stay away from the coastline due to fears of another tsunami. Saturday's tsunami struck at about 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT), during a local holiday. It hit several popular tourist destinations including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort in the west of Java island. As it happened: Indonesia tsunami Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing. Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage. Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit In a tearful Instagram video, singer Riefian Fajarsyah said the band's bassist and road manager had died, and  three other band members and his own wife were missing. Survivors' stories Red Cross official Kathy Mueller told the BBC: ""There is debris littering the ground, crushed cars, crushed motorcycles, we're seeing buildings that are collapsed."" It appears that the main road into Pandeglang has been badly damaged, making it difficult for rescuers to reach the area, she added. Eyewitness Asep Perangkat said cars and containers had been dragged about 10 metres (32 feet). Anak Krakatoa has erupted a number of times in recent months: this image was taken in July ""Buildings on the edge of [Carita] beach were destroyed, trees and electricity poles fell to the ground,"" he told AFP news agency. Officials say more than 160 people were killed in Pandeglang - a popular tourist district on Java known for its beaches and national park. Meanwhile, 48 were reported dead in South Lampung on Sumatra, and deaths were also reported in Serang district and Tanggamus on Sumatra. Officials fear the death toll could rise further. So far, no foreign nationals have been reported dead, officials say. By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent It is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate large waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water. Except, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide. It is not clear at this stage whether part of the flank of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in sediment under the water surface. The latter at this stage appears to be the emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed and waves propagate outwards. Read on Anak Krakatau has seen increased activity in recent months. Indonesia's geological agency says the volcano erupted for two minutes and 12 seconds on Friday, creating an ash cloud that rose 400 metres above the mountain. It recommended that no-one be allowed within 2km (1.2 miles) of the crater. A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August After the tsunami struck, there was confusion over what had actually happened, with Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho initially reporting it as a tidal surge. He later apologised for his mistake, saying there had been confusion because there was no earthquake. High seas as a result of the full moon might have contributed to the strength of the waves, the disaster management agency said. The proximity of the volcano to the coast gave authorities very little time to act, Professor David Rothery from The Open University told AFP news agency. ""Tsunami warning buoys are positioned to warn of tsunamis originated by earthquakes at underwater tectonic plate boundaries,"" he said. ""Even if there had been such a buoy right next to Anak Krakatau, this is so close to the affected shorelines that warning time would have been minimal given the high speeds at which tsunami waves travel."" The child who came back from the dead after tsunami How reliable are tsunami warning systems? Adding to the anxiety on Sunday, a tsunami warning went off by mistake, causing widespread panic as people scrambled to reach shelters. A technical error is suspected. Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim.

A town smashed to pulp in minutes Indian Ocean tsunami: Then and now On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia. However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent. Anak Krakatau (Child of Krakatau) is a new island that emerged in 1927 from Krakatoa volcano. In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history: Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people Thousands more were killed by hot ash The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year The volcanic island virtually disappeared Rescue operation after tsunami New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E 'Where do I go?': Fear and anxiety as people flee Hollywood fire Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy Politics Essential: Get the latest news and analysis delivered to your inbox every weekday Delivering brand-new miracles in 1970s East End Watch the latest series of Call the Midwife on iPlayer now Mark-Anthony Turnage shares the soundtrack of his life Once called 'Britainâs hippest composer', he's tackled topics from drug abuse to football in his work Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the bread factory he used to work in, and sees how they make 1.4 million loaves a week What's behind the global surrogacy boom?

Fears of new tsunami as volcano seethes,"This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water Coastal residents near Indonesia's Anak Krakatau volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami. On Saturday, giant waves crashed into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java, killing at least 281 people and injuring 1,016. It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves. Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke. Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java. A volcanologist explains eruption images The rock band swept away by deadly waves How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis Disaster as it happened Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that another tsunami is a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. ""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" he said. A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater. On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. But, he added, that with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system. He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake. The child who came back from the dead after tsunami How reliable are tsunami warning systems? Sea water did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami and experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time.

Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage. Survivors' stories By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. In other words, it's been part of the background. And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water. The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions.

'Super Saturday' fails to boost retailers,"The so-called ""Super Saturday"" before Christmas saw an incremental boost in shoppers, according to latest data from retail experts Springboard. High Street footfall rose by 1% on last year, and was up 6.9% on the previous Saturday, figures show. However, overall footfall still declined by 0.7% on last year. ""It was a bit of a last-minute burst, but it's not good,"" Springboard's insight director Diane Wehrle told the BBC. The reason for the incremental rise is that Christmas shoppers have been holding out until the last minute for bargains, but aggressive discounting has not drawn the crowds of consumers it might once have done. ""The discounting is a real issue. People are buying less and what they're buying is at a lower price, so this is bad for retailers as they're left with more stock and they're selling it at a lower profit,"" said Ms Wehrle. Why are people spending less this Christmas? Can 'Super Saturday' save Christmas? When is a sale actually a sale? Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? Springboard noted that footfall has fallen on the last Saturday before Christmas every year consecutively for the last decade. This phenomenon has also been observed with Boxing Day sales. Ms Wehrle thinks one reason for the drop in footfall is that people avoid shops when they do not have the money to spend, and this year consumers aredefinitely spending less on Christmas. ""In the past year, wages didn't increase with price rises,"" she said. ""Now that has changed a bit, wage inflation is above price inflation, but the problem is consumers have had to spend a year funding that through savings, wages, loans or credit cards, so now they're conscious they don't want to spend too much as they have to pay back some of those loans.""

Macron 'deeply regrets' Trump's Syria plan,"This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? France's President Emmanuel Macron has said he deeply regrets President Donald Trump's controversial decision to withdraw all US troops from Syria. ""An ally must be dependable,"" said Mr Macron, who reportedly called Mr Trump to warn him against the plan. The US said the Islamic State (IS) group had been defeated, a claim disputed by allies and US politicians. France, a key part of the US-led coalition against IS in Syria and Iraq, said its troops would remain in Syria. Trump's Syria troop removal prompts questions After the caliphate: What next for IS? Some 2,000 US troops have helped rid much of Syria's north-east of the jihadist group, but pockets of fighters remain. Critics of Mr Trump's decision say it could lead to a resurgence of the group, and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis resigned over the issue. Speaking on a visit to French troops in Chad, Mr Macron said: ""To be allies is to fight shoulder to shoulder. It's the most important thing for a head of state and head of the military."" Mr Trump's sudden announcement on Wednesday and Gen Mattis' resignation sparked concerneven among Republican supporters of the president. The US special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat IS,Brett McGurk, also quit over the decision. Meanwhile, the French president paid tribute to Gen Mattis, calling him a ""reliable partner"". Mr Macron spoke in N'Djamena during a visit to French troops in Chad Mr Macron's remarks are the latest in a series ofrecent tense exchangesbetween the two leaderswho are often described as close allieswith a good personal and working relationship. He also stressed the importance of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago. ""I call on everyone... not to forget what we owe them,"" he said. The president, who has long pledged to pull troops out of Syria, continued to insist that his decision was the right one and that, now that IS was defeated on the ground, other players could take care of the situation.

And these satellite images, taken by Europeâs Sentinel-1 spacecraft, may back up that explanation. They were posted on Twitter and appear to show that the side of the volcano collapsed and spouted a cloud of ash into the sky. Allow Twitter content?

Video shows the aftermath of the tsunami that ravaged parts of Indonesia's coastline. Buildings have been flattened and people are being warned to stay away from coastal towns. This video can not be played Buildings flattened on Sunda Strait after Krakatau eruption From members of a popular Indonesian rock band to a Norwegian photographer, a number of survivors have shared their dramatic stories of the disaster. Azki Kurniawan, 16, said he was at a hotel in the popular resort area of Carita Beach on Java when people suddenly burst into the lobby yelling: ""Sea water rising!"" He then ran to the parking lot to try to reach his motorbike but it was already flooded by the time he got there. ""Suddenly a 1m (3.3ft) wave hit me,"" he said. You can read more firsthand accounts of the tsunami here. A resident searches for items among the ruins of a villa in Carita beach, Indonesia Michel Rooijackers from Save the Children Indonesia has told the BBC that the charity will work alongside the Indonesian government to respond to this disaster. ""In events like these children are much more affected than adults,"" he said. ""So we will set up programmes around psychosocial support and make sure they are back in the classroom quickly."" ""The government is well capacitated to handle situations like these and so is Save the Children,"" he added. Children gather to receive therapy at a camp for displaced victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia earlier this year Rescuers and residents look for survivors in South Lampung, Indonesia The tsunami destroyed buildings all along the Indonesian coast Emergency officials are investigating whether the tsunami was caused by undersea landslides after the Anak Krakatau volcano erupted. When volcanoes erupt, hot magma pushes underground and can displace and break through colder rock, volcanologist Jess Phoenix told the BBC. This can trigger a landslide which then pushes the water, possibly causing a tsunami. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News If there had been a major earthquake tremor associated with the eruption on the Anak Krakatau volcano, this might have been enough to prompt many locals to take evasive action. But although there was seismicity reported by sensitive instruments, it wasn't large enough to change people's behaviour. And you really have to rely on yourself in an evacuation in cases like this because the distance from the source of the tsunami is so short. ""Tsunami warning buoys are positioned to warn of tsunamis originated by earthquakes at underwater tectonic plate boundaries,"" explains Prof Dave Rothery from the UK's Open University. ""Even if there had been such a buoy right next to Anak Krakatau, this is so close to the affected shorelines that warning times would have been minimal given the high speeds at which tsunami waves travel,"" he says. What an event like this one (and the one at Palu City which also caught the population unawares) teaches us is that there needs to be far more investigation into the hazards that exist away from the expected dangers in the region. Read more from Jonathan Amos here. An aerial photo shows buildings damaged by the tsunami BBC Indonesia correspondent Rebecca Henschke describes people in the affected areas as being on edge. They are watching and listening to the sea, she says, looking for signs of another tsunami She says the government has told people to move to higher ground but adds that the access roads are not good. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Nobody had any clue. There was certainly no
warning. Itâs part of the picture that now points to a large underwater
landslide being the cause of Saturdayâs devastating tsunami in the Sunda
Strait. Of course everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau,
the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But
its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively
low-scale and semi-continuous. In other words, itâs been part of the
background. And yet it's well known that volcanoes have the capacity to
generate large waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large
volume of water. Except, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which
the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide. It isn't clear at this stage whether part of the flank
of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water
ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in
sediment under the water surface. The latter at this stage appears to be the
emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed
and waves propagate outwards. Thousands of people have died in Indonesia in recent years because of tsunamis Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia. However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, as the latest one is suspected to be, are less frequent. Debris and furniture seen strewn in the damaged interior of a home in Carita Speaking at a news conference on the island of Java, National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho warned that the risk of more tsunamis wasn't over: ""Recommendations from Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while, because the potential for a fresh tsunami is still possible because the volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatau continues to occur, potentially triggering tsunami."" Speaking from the disaster zone, Sydney Morning Herald correspondent James Massola described people ""picking through the ruins of their homes trying to find clothing and food"" However, he told BBC World News that help was getting through to survivors more
quickly compared to previous natural disasters, partly due to the areaâs
proximity to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Concerning early warnings of the tsunami, he said rescue agency
officials have suggested the system was damaged by the volcanic eruption so information wasnât
getting through. ""The trip wires weren't tripped and people were surprised."" Rudi Herdiansyah says there were no warnings Rudi Herdiansyah, who owns a small shop by the beach in Cinangka, Baten province, Java, said the area was
quiet on Saturday night. There was no rain and everything seemed normal, he told the BBC's Indonesian service. ""Then suddenly I heard a very loud
noise from the sea."" The wall of water smashed into his shop, dragging everything away. He recalled being knocked down three times by the powerful wave. ""Thank God. Allah saved me, I
was able to get out from the debris."" He said he didnât hear any warnings. But
he had once taken part in a tsunami drill. ""It made me awareâ¦ I tried to get hold
of anything to help me survive. I hid away, and clung onto a bench to be
safe."" His shop was destroyed by the tsunami Witnesses across the areas affected by the tsunami say it hit without warning, leaving people desperate. Azki Kurniawan, 16, said he was undergoing training with some 30 other students at Patra Comfort Hotel in the popular resort area of Carita Beach on Java when people suddenly burst into the lobby yelling: ""Sea water rising!"" He told AP news agency that he wasn't sure what was happening because he didn't feel an earthquake. He ran to the parking lot to try to reach his motorbike but it was already flooded by the time he got there. ""Suddenly a 1m (3.3ft) wave hit me,"" he said. ""I fell down, the water separated me from my bike. I was thrown into the fence of a building about 30m from the beach and held onto the fence as strong as I could, trying to resist the water, which feels like it would drag me back into the sea. I cried in fear. 'This is a tsunami?' I was afraid I would die."" Carita is a popular beach resort near Indonesia's capital Jakarta Disaster risk reduction expert Carina Fearnley said further landslides in the areas hit by the tsunami were possible. ""It's an unstable structure. A lot of material has been shifted so definitely there is scope for further landslides,"" she told BBC World News. ""Generally once a landslide has happened it will settle but it might change the landscape of the volcano on the side and make it more vulnerable."" She also said scientists were working to detect where landslides can happen. However, she added it was ""very costly"" to monitor all coastlines and an early warning system would be ""very challenging"" to establish.  This video can not be played Tsunami warning systems: how reliable are they? Rescue workers and ambulances are finding it difficult to
reach some hard-hit areas because some roads have been partially destroyed or  blocked by debris, officials say. The western coast of Banten province in Java was the
worst-hit area, according to Indonesia's national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. The tsunami hit popular tourist areas around Indonesia's Sunda Strait in a busy time of the year. ABC Australia's Indonesia correspondent David Lipson has visited a beachfront hotel where three tourists were killed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Thousands sleeping rough in cars, charity saysFor every one person sleeping rough, there is another living in a vehicle or tent, figures suggest.UK","Crisis runs Christmas centres over the festive period where homeless guests can get food and companionship as well as medical and housing advice Homelessness in the UK is at a record high with 170,000 families and individuals experiencing destitution, the charity Crisis has said. For every one person sleeping rough on the street, there is another living in a car or a tent, figures suggest. Publishing the new research on Sunday, Crisis insisted the underlying causes of homelessness could only be tackled by changes in government policy. The government said it is investing Â£1.2bn to alleviate the problem. The new research on homelessness, carried out for Crisis by researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, suggested: Homelessness increased every year between 2012 and 2017 38,000 under-25s and 4,200 over-65s are estimated to be homeless 170,800 households are experiencing the most extreme forms of homelessness, compared to 151,600 in 2012. This includes people who are sofa-surfing, living in hostels and rough sleeping 12,300 people are sleeping rough and a similar number of people (12,000) are living in cars, tents or public transport - double the amount compared to 2012 Crisis released the statistics as it prepares to open up its Christmas centres for homeless people. Singer Ellie Goulding says she visits Crisis' Christmas centres every year Singer Ellie Goulding, who has supported the charity for several years, visited one of its centres in London on Sunday. She told BBC News: ""People can come here for the day, get in the warm, have a tea, have a shower if they need to and it's just a really nice atmosphere and safe environment."" She said Crisis and other charities did brilliant work but said more affordable housing was needed to tackle homelessness in the long-term. Jon Sparkes, the charity's chief executive, said: ""This new research echoes what we see every day in our front-line work - that there is no such thing as a 'typical' homeless person, and that this crisis is affecting people who range from young care-leavers to pensioners. ""And, while rough sleeping is the most visible form of homelessness, for every person on our streets there are another twelve families or individuals experiencing other terrible situations like sofa-surfing and living in cramped B&Bs."" The 'angel' who helps the homeless in Stafford 'I've been homeless for four years' Hotel steps in to give rooms to homeless Could you give up your Christmas? It comes after the number of deaths of homeless peoplewere published for the first time everearlier this week. The Office for National Statistics found almost 600 homeless people died in England and Wales last year. The average age of death was 44 for homeless men and 42 for homeless women, compared with 76 for men and 81 for women among the rest of the population Crisis blames the problem on a shortage of social housing, housing benefits which do not cover private rents, and a lack of homeless prevention schemes for people leaving care. It wants the government to make policy changes. Earlier this week, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said if his party were elected, he would repeal the 19th Century law which criminalises rough sleeping. The Vagrancy Act 1824 makes it a crime to beg or sleep rough in Britain. The party said it was used nearly 3,000 times in 2016 - with those convicted facing fines of up to Â£1,000. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said: ""No-one is meant to spend their lives on the streets, or without a home to call their own. ""That's why we are investing Â£1.2bn to tackle homelessness and have bold plans backed by Â£100m to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it by 2027. ""And to stop people from becoming homeless in the first place, we've changed the law to require councils to provide early support for those at risk of being left with nowhere left to go, are boosting access to affordable housing, and making renting more secure."" According to Crisis, members of the public in England and Wales can help a homeless person by callingStreetlink,external. People in Scotland can call the local council. The location of the homeless person can be reported and they can be connected with local homelessness services. Anyone who has immediate concerns about the welfare of a homeless person should call 999, the charity adds.

Ex-Lib Dem leader Ashdown 'made real mark',"Tributes have been paid to the former Liberal Democrats' leader Paddy Ashdown, who died on Saturday after a short illness aged 77. A party spokesman said the Lib Dem peer and former MP for Yeovil ""made an immeasurable contribution to furthering the cause of liberalism"". Current party leader, Sir Vince Cable, said Lord Ashdown had ""made a real mark"" and it was ""a hugely sad day"". Lord Ashdown was diagnosed with bladder cancer in October. While his real name was Jeremy John Durham Ashdown, he was nicknamed Paddy when he moved to England, after spending his childhood years in Northern Ireland. The longest serving leader of the Lib Dems in its history, Lord Ashdown led the party between 1988 and 1999, when it became a growing force in UK politics. After standing down as an MP in 2001, he served as the United Nations' high representative in Bosnia-Herzegovina, helping steer the country through its post-war reconstruction.

""Paddy was the reason I entered politics,"" he said. ""He was the reason I became a liberal. And he became a lifelong mentor, friend and guide."" People from outside of politics also paid tribute to the politician. Monty Python actor John Cleese tweeted that it was ""really terrible"" news, while scientist and TV presenter Prof Brian Cox said Lord Ashdown had lived ""a remarkable life"". Comedian Matt Forde also tweeted: ""Really sad to hear about the passing of Paddy Ashdown. He was one of the great politicians of my lifetime, a proper heavyweight. ""His pragmatism never got in the way of his principles. He was also a great laugh. We need more politicians like Paddy, not less. RIP.""

UNiDAYS founder denies harassment claimsMore than 750 people sign a petition accusing discount site boss Josh Rathour of inappropriate behaviour.Business,"Josh Rathour has been celebrated for his entrepreneurship. The chief executive of popular student discount site UNiDAYS has strongly denied claims made against him in an anonymous online petition. More than 750 people have signed a letter accusing Josh Rathour, who set up the company in 2011, of sexual harassment and bullying. The allegations were made on Organise, a campaign website that hosted a petition against the boss of Ted Baker. A spokesperson for Mr Rathour said he ""would welcome any investigation"". A statement from UNiDAYS said the company would be conducting an investigation in the new year ""to establish the facts"". The firm, which offers money off clothes, gadgets, music, transport and food has grown into a global brand. The site, and accompanying app, both marketed at ""Generation Z,"" boasts 10 million members. Its many partners include Adidas, Asos, Microsoft, Nike and Topshop. UNiDAYS was founded, and is based, in Nottingham The petition, which was published on Saturday, claims inappropriate behaviour at UNiDAYS was ""rife and wholly unchecked"". It also alleges that some staff were made to sign so-called ""gagging orders"" - effectively banning them from disclosing their grievances. UNiDAYS' human resources team, it adds, ""wilfully ignored reports of harassment"". A spokesperson for Mr Rathour said he was ""confident any investigation will not find any truth in the allegations about his behaviour at work"". The spokesperson added that the culture at UNiDAYS was inclusive and respectful and that half the line managers were female. A source close to the firm claimed none of the allegations detailed in the petition had officially been put to the company. Mr Rathour, 36, has been celebrated for his entrepreneurship. His firm, which is headquartered in Nottingham, has offices in London, New York and Sydney, and employs more than 250 people worldwide. In 2015, UNiDAYS was crowned Digital Business of the Year. Organise founder Nat Whalley says former UNiDAYS employees were inspired by a Ted Baker petition Allegations of harassment at the company had appeared on the workplace review site Glassdoor, but have since been removed. Nat Whalley, the founder of Organise which is hosting the current petition, said it was started by a group of former UNiDAYS employees. She says they were inspired by a similar petition against Ray Kelvin, the founder of Ted Baker, calling for an end to ""forced hugging"" and a culture of harassment. Mr Kelvin has now taken a leave of absence while the company conducts an independent external investigation into the claims.

Universal Credit 'stops people taking jobs',"Many parents rely on childcare to be able to work The Universal Credit system leaves too many UK claimants with children facing a stark choice between turning down jobs or getting into debt, MPs warn. The Work and Pensions Select Committee says the way parents have to pay for childcare up front, then claim it back afterwards is a ""barrier to work"". Committee chairman Frank Field said it was ""irresponsible"" to put this burden on ""struggling, striving parents"". The government said childcare support is more generous under the new system. But the committee's report on the childcare aspect of Universal Credit is further criticism of the already much-criticised benefit. The welfare payment, which collapsed six benefits into one monthly payment, is being phased in across the UK. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? The report said: ""Parents and carers' decisions about whether and how much to work are closely tied to being able to access affordable, good quality childcare. ""The Department for Work and Pensions aspires for 200,000 more people to work under Universal Credit than under the system it replaces, and for people already in work to contribute over 100 million additional hours every year. ""Its success or failure in achieving these aims depends largely on working parents. That means that making childcare payments work is critical to the success of Universal Credit."" But it claims the design of Universal Credit childcare support directly conflicts with the aim of making it easier for claimants to work, or to work more hours. ""Universal Credit claimants must pay for childcare up front and claim reimbursement from the department after the childcare has been provided,"" the report says. ""This can leave households waiting weeks or even months to be paid back. ""Many of those households will be in precarious financial positions which Universal Credit could exacerbate: if, for example, they have fallen into debt or rent arrears while awaiting Universal Credit payments. ""Too many will face a stark choice: turn down a job offer, or get themselves into debt in order to pay for childcare."" The system of reimbursement was adopted to cut down on fraud and error, and the government says switching to a system of direct payments to childcare providers would require changes to the benefits payment system. The committee wants direct payments to be adopted, but in the meantime more should be done to help claimants with up-front costs, it says. Mr Field said: ""If the government had set out to design a system to make it harder for parents to get into work, it could hardly have done better than this one. ""It's not just driving parents into despair and debt and creating problems for childcare providers - it's also actively working to prevent the government achieving its own aim of getting more people into work."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Working parents can claim back up to 85% of eligible costs, compared to 70% on the old system. ""Universal Credit is a force for good for many, and people are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. ""Recent Budget changes also mean an extra Â£2bn will be directed to the poorest families."" What's the problem with universal credit? Video, 00:02:57What's the problem with universal credit?

"Thousands sleeping rough in cars, charity says","Crisis runs Christmas centres over the festive period where homeless guests can get food and companionship as well as medical and housing advice Homelessness in the UK is at a record high with 170,000 families and individuals experiencing destitution, the charity Crisis has said. For every one person sleeping rough on the street, there is another living in a car or a tent, figures suggest. Publishing the new research on Sunday, Crisis insisted the underlying causes of homelessness could only be tackled by changes in government policy. The government said it is investing Â£1.2bn to alleviate the problem. The new research on homelessness, carried out for Crisis by researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, suggested: Homelessness increased every year between 2012 and 2017 38,000 under-25s and 4,200 over-65s are estimated to be homeless 170,800 households are experiencing the most extreme forms of homelessness, compared to 151,600 in 2012. This includes people who are sofa-surfing, living in hostels and rough sleeping 12,300 people are sleeping rough and a similar number of people (12,000) are living in cars, tents or public transport - double the amount compared to 2012 Crisis released the statistics as it prepares to open up its Christmas centres for homeless people. Singer Ellie Goulding says she visits Crisis' Christmas centres every year Singer Ellie Goulding, who has supported the charity for several years, visited one of its centres in London on Sunday. She told BBC News: ""People can come here for the day, get in the warm, have a tea, have a shower if they need to and it's just a really nice atmosphere and safe environment."" She said Crisis and other charities did brilliant work but said more affordable housing was needed to tackle homelessness in the long-term. Jon Sparkes, the charity's chief executive, said: ""This new research echoes what we see every day in our front-line work - that there is no such thing as a 'typical' homeless person, and that this crisis is affecting people who range from young care-leavers to pensioners. ""And, while rough sleeping is the most visible form of homelessness, for every person on our streets there are another twelve families or individuals experiencing other terrible situations like sofa-surfing and living in cramped B&Bs."" The 'angel' who helps the homeless in Stafford 'I've been homeless for four years' Hotel steps in to give rooms to homeless Could you give up your Christmas? It comes after the number of deaths of homeless peoplewere published for the first time everearlier this week. The Office for National Statistics found almost 600 homeless people died in England and Wales last year. The average age of death was 44 for homeless men and 42 for homeless women, compared with 76 for men and 81 for women among the rest of the population Crisis blames the problem on a shortage of social housing, housing benefits which do not cover private rents, and a lack of homeless prevention schemes for people leaving care. It wants the government to make policy changes. Earlier this week, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said if his party were elected, he would repeal the 19th Century law which criminalises rough sleeping. The Vagrancy Act 1824 makes it a crime to beg or sleep rough in Britain. The party said it was used nearly 3,000 times in 2016 - with those convicted facing fines of up to Â£1,000. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said: ""No-one is meant to spend their lives on the streets, or without a home to call their own. ""That's why we are investing Â£1.2bn to tackle homelessness and have bold plans backed by Â£100m to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and end it by 2027. ""And to stop people from becoming homeless in the first place, we've changed the law to require councils to provide early support for those at risk of being left with nowhere left to go, are boosting access to affordable housing, and making renting more secure."" According to Crisis, members of the public in England and Wales can help a homeless person by callingStreetlink,external. People in Scotland can call the local council. The location of the homeless person can be reported and they can be connected with local homelessness services. Anyone who has immediate concerns about the welfare of a homeless person should call 999, the charity adds.

German 'fake news' reporter may be charged,"The German reporter Claas Relotius, accused by top news magazine Der Spiegel of faking stories, could now face embezzlement charges.

In the latest development,Der Spiegel reports (in German),externalthat it received messages from readers saying Relotius had used a private email account to ask for donations to help Syrian orphans in Turkey. The money should be sent to his personal bank account, the magazine quotes readers as saying.

IGN sacks writer amid plagiarism controversy ABC boss quits over political interference claims Relotius' appeal for donations was linked toan article he wrote about two Syrian street-children, a brother and sister, in Turkey - parts of which Der Spiegel says were faked. A Turkish photographer who accompanied Relotius on the story said the reporter had made up some aspects of the boy's life and heavily fictionalised others. The photographer suspects that the sister may not have existed at all. The American ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, has also intervened, writing to Der Spiegel's editor to demand an independent investigation and accusing the publication of institutional bias against the US. Like many publications, Der Spiegel has carried stories critical of President Donald Trump. One of the Relotius stories at issue centred on the US-Mexican border. Der Spiegel said its investigation revealed that he had fabricated information about seeing a hand-painted sign in a town in Minnesota that read: ""Mexicans Keep Out."" False information appeared in other stories including one about inmates at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay and another about the US NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Relotius, who has been sacked, told the magazine he regretted his actions and was deeply ashamed. According to Der Spiegel, he admitted deceiving readers in some 14 stories.

In another post,external, he shared a picture of him with his wife in Paris saying: ""Today is your birthday... Hurry home."" A crew member, Zack, said on Instagram that he survived by grabbing onto part of the stage, and ""in the final seconds [underwater] I almost ran out of breath"", Reuters reported. A statement from the group, reported by AP news agency, said: ""The tide rose to the surface and dragged all the people on site. ""Unfortunately, when the current receded our members are unable to save themselves while some did not find a place to hold on."" Shop owner Rudi Herdiansyah was knocked down by the wall of water Shop owner Rudi Herdiansyah, from Cinangka sub-district, Serang district, Banten province, said the beach was quiet on Saturday night, until he heard a ""very loud noise from the sea"". The wall of water smashed into his beachside shop and he was dragged away by the powerful wave. He recalled being knocked down three times. ""Thank God. Allah saved me, I was able to get out from the debris,"" he said. Rudi's beachside shop was partially destroyed by the tsunami He said he didn't hear any warnings, but he had once taken part in a tsunami drill. ""It made me aware,"" he said. ""I tried to get hold of anything to help me survive. I hid away, and clung onto a bench, to be safe."" His warung (small shop) was devastated by the tsunami.

""I fell down, the water separated me from my bike. I was thrown into the fence of a building about 30m from the beach and held onto the fence as strong as I could, trying to resist the water, which feels like it would drag me back into the sea. I cried in fear. 'This is a tsunami?' I was afraid I would die.""

Oystein Lund Andersen, Norwegian volcano photographer, Anyer Beach in West Java I was on the beach. I was alone, my family were sleeping in a room. I was trying to photograph the erupting Krakatau volcano. Earlier in the evening, there was quite heavy eruption activity. But just prior to the waves hitting the beach, there was no activity at all. It was just dark out there. And suddenly I saw this wave coming, and I had to run. There were two waves. The first wave wasn't that strong - I could run from it. Flooded streets in Anyer after the tsunami I ran straight to the hotel, where my wife and my son were sleeping. And I woke them up... and I heard a bigger wave coming. I looked out of the window when the second wave hit. It was much bigger. The wave passed the hotel. Cars were pushed off the road. We and other people at the hotel went straight to the forest (on higher ground) next to the hotel. And we're still up on the hill now. - Oystein Lund Andersen was speaking to BBC World News television Rani has a beachside stall in Anyer on Java that was destroyed by the tsunami.

US shutdown set to drag through Christmas,"Republican Mitch McConnell arrives at Congress. Most people are in the dark A partial US government shutdown is set to continue through Christmas with no deal in sight to break the impasse over budget spending. The Senate, which must pass a deal, has now adjourned until Thursday. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump will stay on in Washington for the festive period, cancelling holidays in Florida. The shutdown began at midnight on Friday after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. Mr Trump warned there could be ""a long stay"" in the talks and Democrats told him: ""You must abandon the wall."" Vice-President Mike Pence stressed that negotiators were still talking. Five big things from Trumpâs head-spinning week Nine of 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice began partially shutting down after funding for them lapsed at midnight (05:00GMT Saturday). Hundreds of thousands of federal employees will have to work unpaid or are furloughed, a kind of temporary leave. This is the third time US federal funding has lapsed so far this year, although the other two were brief. The Senate held a rare Saturday session but it was not long before it adjourned. Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell said the ""pause button"" had been pushed and that there would be no new Senate vote until he had a signature from the president - and agreement from the Democrats - on a budget deal. The green light for government appears a way off yet Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said a budget bill that had passed the Republican-controlled House on Thursday approving $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) of funding for the wall would ""never pass the Senate, not today, not next week, not next year"". He added: ""So Mr President, if you want to open the government, you must abandon the wall, plain and simple. ""The Senate is not interested in swindling American taxpayers for an unnecessary, ineffective and wasteful policy."" In a tweet on Saturday, Mr Trump said ""we are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed border security"" but the talks ""could be a long stay"". He again defended the wall, saying ""the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall. Let the work begin!"" One White House official said the administration hoped the shutdown would last only a few days but it could be longer. Some Republican lawmakers still hope there can be a deal, perhaps involving less money for the wall. On Wednesday, a bilateral deal appeared to have been agreed in the Senate to keep federal agencies open until 8 February. But the agreement did not include funding for the wall. This video can not be played Trump: ""Any measure that funds the government must include border security"" Mr Trump then dug his heels in over the issue after criticism from conservative talk show hosts and other allies, and insisted that funds for the wall must be included for him to sign the budget off. The House then passed a bill with such funding, with Mr Trump well aware the Democrats will be taking control of the legislature in January and wall funding will stall. But Mr Trump does not have the 60 votes in the 100-seat Senate he needs to get the House budget passed. He earlier suggested that Mr McConnell should invoke the so-called ""nuclear option"" to break the impasse. That would mean the bill could be approved in the Senate with a simple majority. But Mr McConnell has repeatedly refused in the past to invoke such an extreme manoeuvre. About 380,000 government employees will be made to take temporary, unpaid leave. Meanwhile, 420,000 employees working in essential roles - considered necessary for the ""protection of life and property"" - will keep working, without being paid. In practice, this means that: Customs and border staffwill keep working, although their pay will be delayed.Airportswill continue operating. About 80% ofNational Parksemployees will be sent home, and parks could close - although some may stay open with limited staff and facilities. About 90% ofhousing departmentworkers will take unpaid leave, which could delay loan processing and approvals. Most of theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) will be sent on unpaid leave, including those who assist taxpayers with queries. The Food and Drug Administration will pause routine inspections but ""continue vital activities"". The remaining 75% of the federal government is fully funded until September 2019 - so the defence, veterans affairs, labour and education departments are not affected. Martin Ely, 54, a tax officer in Arizona, is affected by the shutdown and says he's frustrated with the politicians. ""I would like them not to use us a bargaining chip. ""I was last paid a week ago and hopefully should still be paid on 30 December for this week just gone, but anything after that will definitely be affected by the shutdown. ""I have been an IRS employee for around nine years, and I was furloughed during the 2013 shutdown that lasted from October 1-17. Being furloughed is never a pleasant experience. Having to live on savings and/or credit while waiting for back pay, which must be approved by Congress, is tremendously stressful. ""During the 2013 shutdown, I spent the entire time glued to the TV watching the news and waiting to be called back to work. Many of my co-workers did the same. We can't travel far or plan a vacation during a shutdown because we usually only get a day's notice or less to report back to work. So it's no holiday, especially during the Holidays."" A strengthened southern border wall was a key election promise from Mr Trump. On Friday he shared a graphic of his steel-slat design for the wall. Allow Twitter content?

Open championship's ÃÂ£69m boost to economy,"The Angus area alone received a Â£21m cash injection from Carnoustie hosting the event The Open golf championship at Carnoustie in July boosted the Scottish economy by Â£69m this year, according to an independent study. Researchers at Sheffield Hallam University found the Angus area alone received a Â£21m cash injection from hosting the event. The 147th Open attracted a record 172,000 fans to the tournament,which was won by Italian Francesco Molinari. Nearly half of the spectators (49.8%) travelled from outside Scotland. The majority of Scottish fans (84.8%) came from outside Angus. The study, which was commissioned by golf's governing body the R&A, VisitScotland and Angus Council, also suggested the global TV marketing value to Scotland was Â£51m. Franceso Molinari became the first Italian to win The Open First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said The Open had ""once again showcased Scotland internationally as the perfect stage for major events"". She said: ""The figures released today also demonstrate the economic benefits of hosting major events and I'm pleased the 147th Open generated significant income for both the local Angus area and for the wider Scottish economy."" David Fairweather, the leader of Angus Council, said the event had attracted global interest and attention, ""as well as immediate and long-lasting economic benefits to local and regional communities and business"". He added: ""Twenty-one million pounds of new money into the local economy is great news for Angus, its people, hotels, B&Bs, shops and restaurants."" The R&A's chief executive Martin Slumbers said: ""The Open has a proven track record of generating substantial economic benefit for the host country in which it is staged thanks to the tens of thousands of spectators who attend each year.""

Here's what you need to know:  It is thought that undersea landslides may have caused the tsunami, but officials are still working to establish the full details. One theory posed by experts is that part of the Anak Krakatau volcano collapsed, with material then entering the sea and pushing water ahead of it. And these satellite images, taken by Europeâs Sentinel-1 spacecraft, may back up that explanation. They were posted on Twitter and appear to show that the side of the volcano collapsed and spouted a cloud of ash into the sky. Allow Twitter content?

Azki Kurniawan, 16, said he was at a hotel in the popular resort area of Carita Beach on Java when people suddenly burst into the lobby yelling: ""Sea water rising!"" He then ran to the parking lot to try to reach his motorbike but it was already flooded by the time he got there. ""Suddenly a 1m (3.3ft) wave hit me,"" he said. You can read more firsthand accounts of the tsunami here. A resident searches for items among the ruins of a villa in Carita beach, Indonesia Michel Rooijackers from Save the Children Indonesia has told the BBC that the charity will work alongside the Indonesian government to respond to this disaster. ""In events like these children are much more affected than adults,"" he said. ""So we will set up programmes around psychosocial support and make sure they are back in the classroom quickly."" ""The government is well capacitated to handle situations like these and so is Save the Children,"" he added. Children gather to receive therapy at a camp for displaced victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia earlier this year Rescuers and residents look for survivors in South Lampung, Indonesia The tsunami destroyed buildings all along the Indonesian coast Emergency officials are investigating whether the tsunami was caused by undersea landslides after the Anak Krakatau volcano erupted. When volcanoes erupt, hot magma pushes underground and can displace and break through colder rock, volcanologist Jess Phoenix told the BBC. This can trigger a landslide which then pushes the water, possibly causing a tsunami. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News If there had been a major earthquake tremor associated with the eruption on the Anak Krakatau volcano, this might have been enough to prompt many locals to take evasive action. But although there was seismicity reported by sensitive instruments, it wasn't large enough to change people's behaviour. And you really have to rely on yourself in an evacuation in cases like this because the distance from the source of the tsunami is so short. ""Tsunami warning buoys are positioned to warn of tsunamis originated by earthquakes at underwater tectonic plate boundaries,"" explains Prof Dave Rothery from the UK's Open University. ""Even if there had been such a buoy right next to Anak Krakatau, this is so close to the affected shorelines that warning times would have been minimal given the high speeds at which tsunami waves travel,"" he says. What an event like this one (and the one at Palu City which also caught the population unawares) teaches us is that there needs to be far more investigation into the hazards that exist away from the expected dangers in the region. Read more from Jonathan Amos here. An aerial photo shows buildings damaged by the tsunami BBC Indonesia correspondent Rebecca Henschke describes people in the affected areas as being on edge. They are watching and listening to the sea, she says, looking for signs of another tsunami She says the government has told people to move to higher ground but adds that the access roads are not good. Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Nobody had any clue. There was certainly no
warning. Itâs part of the picture that now points to a large underwater
landslide being the cause of Saturdayâs devastating tsunami in the Sunda
Strait. Of course everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau,
the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But
its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively
low-scale and semi-continuous. In other words, itâs been part of the
background. And yet it's well known that volcanoes have the capacity to
generate large waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large
volume of water. Except, unlike in a classic earthquake-driven tsunami in which
the seafloor will thrust up or down, it seems an eruption event set in motion some kind of slide. It isn't clear at this stage whether part of the flank
of the volcano has collapsed with material entering the sea and pushing water
ahead of it, or if movement on the flank has triggered a rapid slump in
sediment under the water surface. The latter at this stage appears to be the
emerging consensus, but the effect is the same - the water column is disturbed
and waves propagate outwards. Thousands of people have died in Indonesia in recent years because of tsunamis Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia. However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity, as the latest one is suspected to be, are less frequent. Debris and furniture seen strewn in the damaged interior of a home in Carita Speaking at a news conference on the island of Java, National Disaster Management Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho warned that the risk of more tsunamis wasn't over: ""Recommendations from Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency (BMKG) are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while, because the potential for a fresh tsunami is still possible because the volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatau continues to occur, potentially triggering tsunami."" Speaking from the disaster zone, Sydney Morning Herald correspondent James Massola described people ""picking through the ruins of their homes trying to find clothing and food"" However, he told BBC World News that help was getting through to survivors more
quickly compared to previous natural disasters, partly due to the areaâs
proximity to the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Concerning early warnings of the tsunami, he said rescue agency
officials have suggested the system was damaged by the volcanic eruption so information wasnât
getting through. ""The trip wires weren't tripped and people were surprised."" Rudi Herdiansyah says there were no warnings Rudi Herdiansyah, who owns a small shop by the beach in Cinangka, Baten province, Java, said the area was
quiet on Saturday night. There was no rain and everything seemed normal, he told the BBC's Indonesian service. ""Then suddenly I heard a very loud
noise from the sea."" The wall of water smashed into his shop, dragging everything away. He recalled being knocked down three times by the powerful wave. ""Thank God. Allah saved me, I
was able to get out from the debris."" He said he didnât hear any warnings. But
he had once taken part in a tsunami drill. ""It made me awareâ¦ I tried to get hold
of anything to help me survive. I hid away, and clung onto a bench to be
safe."" His shop was destroyed by the tsunami Witnesses across the areas affected by the tsunami say it hit without warning, leaving people desperate. Azki Kurniawan, 16, said he was undergoing training with some 30 other students at Patra Comfort Hotel in the popular resort area of Carita Beach on Java when people suddenly burst into the lobby yelling: ""Sea water rising!"" He told AP news agency that he wasn't sure what was happening because he didn't feel an earthquake. He ran to the parking lot to try to reach his motorbike but it was already flooded by the time he got there. ""Suddenly a 1m (3.3ft) wave hit me,"" he said. ""I fell down, the water separated me from my bike. I was thrown into the fence of a building about 30m from the beach and held onto the fence as strong as I could, trying to resist the water, which feels like it would drag me back into the sea. I cried in fear. 'This is a tsunami?' I was afraid I would die."" Carita is a popular beach resort near Indonesia's capital Jakarta Disaster risk reduction expert Carina Fearnley said further landslides in the areas hit by the tsunami were possible. ""It's an unstable structure. A lot of material has been shifted so definitely there is scope for further landslides,"" she told BBC World News. ""Generally once a landslide has happened it will settle but it might change the landscape of the volcano on the side and make it more vulnerable."" She also said scientists were working to detect where landslides can happen. However, she added it was ""very costly"" to monitor all coastlines and an early warning system would be ""very challenging"" to establish.  This video can not be played Tsunami warning systems: how reliable are they? Rescue workers and ambulances are finding it difficult to
reach some hard-hit areas because some roads have been partially destroyed or  blocked by debris, officials say. The western coast of Banten province in Java was the
worst-hit area, according to Indonesia's national disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. The tsunami hit popular tourist areas around Indonesia's Sunda Strait in a busy time of the year.

Deadly 'volcano tsunami' hits Indonesia,"This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water At least 222 people have been killed and 843 injured after a tsunami hit coastal towns on Indonesia's Sunda Strait, government officials say. There was no warning of the giant waves which struck at night, destroying hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees. It is thought undersea landslides from the Anak Krakatau volcano caused them. President Joko Widodo has expressed his sorrow for the victims and urged people to be patient. Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. The Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Sumatra, connects the Java Sea to the Indian Ocean. The disaster management agency has warned people to stay away from the coastline due to fears of another tsunami. Saturday's tsunami struck at about 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT), during a local holiday. It hit several popular tourist destinations including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort in the west of Java island. As it happened: Indonesia tsunami Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen was performing. Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage. Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit In a tearful Instagram video, singer Riefian Fajarsyah said the band's bassist and road manager had died, and  three other band members and his own wife were missing. Survivors' stories Red Cross official Kathy Mueller told the BBC: ""There is debris littering the ground, crushed cars, crushed motorcycles, we're seeing buildings that are collapsed."" It appears that the main road into Pandeglang has been badly damaged, making it difficult for rescuers to reach the area, she added. Eyewitness Asep Perangkat said cars and containers had been dragged about 10 metres (32 feet). Anak Krakatoa has erupted a number of times in recent months: this image was taken in July ""Buildings on the edge of [Carita] beach were destroyed, trees and electricity poles fell to the ground,"" he told AFP news agency. Officials say more than 160 people were killed in Pandeglang - a popular tourist district on Java known for its beaches and national park. Meanwhile, 48 were reported dead in South Lampung on Sumatra, and deaths were also reported in Serang district and Tanggamus on Sumatra. Officials fear the death toll could rise further. So far, no foreign nationals have been reported dead, officials say. By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent It is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate large waves.

Read on Anak Krakatau has seen increased activity in recent months. Indonesia's geological agency says the volcano erupted for two minutes and 12 seconds on Friday, creating an ash cloud that rose 400 metres above the mountain. It recommended that no-one be allowed within 2km (1.2 miles) of the crater. A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August After the tsunami struck, there was confusion over what had actually happened, with Indonesian disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho initially reporting it as a tidal surge. He later apologised for his mistake, saying there had been confusion because there was no earthquake. High seas as a result of the full moon might have contributed to the strength of the waves, the disaster management agency said. The proximity of the volcano to the coast gave authorities very little time to act, Professor David Rothery from The Open University told AFP news agency. ""Tsunami warning buoys are positioned to warn of tsunamis originated by earthquakes at underwater tectonic plate boundaries,"" he said.

"Universal Credit 'stops people taking jobs'The way childcare is funded under Universal Credit prevents parents working and leads to debt, MPs warn.Family & Education","Many parents rely on childcare to be able to work The Universal Credit system leaves too many UK claimants with children facing a stark choice between turning down jobs or getting into debt, MPs warn. The Work and Pensions Select Committee says the way parents have to pay for childcare up front, then claim it back afterwards is a ""barrier to work"". Committee chairman Frank Field said it was ""irresponsible"" to put this burden on ""struggling, striving parents"". The government said childcare support is more generous under the new system. But the committee's report on the childcare aspect of Universal Credit is further criticism of the already much-criticised benefit. The welfare payment, which collapsed six benefits into one monthly payment, is being phased in across the UK. This video can not be played Universal credit: Is the government's benefit system working? The report said: ""Parents and carers' decisions about whether and how much to work are closely tied to being able to access affordable, good quality childcare. ""The Department for Work and Pensions aspires for 200,000 more people to work under Universal Credit than under the system it replaces, and for people already in work to contribute over 100 million additional hours every year. ""Its success or failure in achieving these aims depends largely on working parents. That means that making childcare payments work is critical to the success of Universal Credit."" But it claims the design of Universal Credit childcare support directly conflicts with the aim of making it easier for claimants to work, or to work more hours. ""Universal Credit claimants must pay for childcare up front and claim reimbursement from the department after the childcare has been provided,"" the report says. ""This can leave households waiting weeks or even months to be paid back. ""Many of those households will be in precarious financial positions which Universal Credit could exacerbate: if, for example, they have fallen into debt or rent arrears while awaiting Universal Credit payments. ""Too many will face a stark choice: turn down a job offer, or get themselves into debt in order to pay for childcare."" The system of reimbursement was adopted to cut down on fraud and error, and the government says switching to a system of direct payments to childcare providers would require changes to the benefits payment system. The committee wants direct payments to be adopted, but in the meantime more should be done to help claimants with up-front costs, it says. Mr Field said: ""If the government had set out to design a system to make it harder for parents to get into work, it could hardly have done better than this one. ""It's not just driving parents into despair and debt and creating problems for childcare providers - it's also actively working to prevent the government achieving its own aim of getting more people into work."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Working parents can claim back up to 85% of eligible costs, compared to 70% on the old system. ""Universal Credit is a force for good for many, and people are getting into work faster and staying in work longer. ""Recent Budget changes also mean an extra Â£2bn will be directed to the poorest families."" What's the problem with universal credit? Video, 00:02:57What's the problem with universal credit?

Stowaway teens still missing a year onThe group were among 13 found in the back of a lorry in Corby in June 2017 and taken into care.Northampton,"The eight teenagers left Northamptonshire County Council care in June, July and September 2017 Eight out of the 13 Vietnamese teenagers who disappeared from a county council's care more than a year ago are still at large, police have confirmed. The group absconded after they were discovered in the back of a lorry in Corby, Northamptonshire, in June 2017, having entered the UK illegally. A year after police issued an appeal, only five of the young people, aged between 15 and 18, have been located. Northamptonshire County Council said it was ""very concerned"" for their welfare. A spokesman for the authority said: ""There are particular concerns about these young people due to the circumstances of their arrival, given the fact that we had very little time to assess their needs when they came into our care before they went missing."" The three girls and 10 males were looked after by Northamptonshire social services after they were found in the lorry on a Corby industrial estate on 17 June, 2017. They then disappeared ""one after the other"" from accommodation in Northampton and Corby where they had been safeguarded, police added. Eight boys remain at large after leaving properties separately in June, July and September 2017.

Open championship's Â£69m boost to economy,"The Angus area alone received a Â£21m cash injection from Carnoustie hosting the event The Open golf championship at Carnoustie in July boosted the Scottish economy by Â£69m this year, according to an independent study. Researchers at Sheffield Hallam University found the Angus area alone received a Â£21m cash injection from hosting the event. The 147th Open attracted a record 172,000 fans to the tournament,which was won by Italian Francesco Molinari. Nearly half of the spectators (49.8%) travelled from outside Scotland. The majority of Scottish fans (84.8%) came from outside Angus. The study, which was commissioned by golf's governing body the R&A, VisitScotland and Angus Council, also suggested the global TV marketing value to Scotland was Â£51m. Franceso Molinari became the first Italian to win The Open First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said The Open had ""once again showcased Scotland internationally as the perfect stage for major events"". She said: ""The figures released today also demonstrate the economic benefits of hosting major events and I'm pleased the 147th Open generated significant income for both the local Angus area and for the wider Scottish economy."" David Fairweather, the leader of Angus Council, said the event had attracted global interest and attention, ""as well as immediate and long-lasting economic benefits to local and regional communities and business"". He added: ""Twenty-one million pounds of new money into the local economy is great news for Angus, its people, hotels, B&Bs, shops and restaurants."" The R&A's chief executive Martin Slumbers said: ""The Open has a proven track record of generating substantial economic benefit for the host country in which it is staged thanks to the tens of thousands of spectators who attend each year.""

The bridge that crossed an ocean," Robert Paxton McCulloch was already a multi-millionaire by the time he turned 18. But inheriting part of his grandfather’s fortune in 1925 didn’t blunt his ambition or work ethic. Driven by a compulsion to invent, after graduating from Stanford University he started a company that created supercharged car engines. While he was still a young man McCulloch sold the business for $1m. It was the first chapter in a lucrative career that would take him from the Midwest to California, where he had successful ventures making chainsaws and boat engines. “He was a genius,” says his grandson Michael. “He was astute at building and invention; he designed engines - that was his forte. “He was a little on the eccentric side, but extremely nice. I only ever saw a very gentle person.” McCulloch married Barbara Ann Briggs, daughter of the co-founder of the engine company Briggs and Stratton McCulloch, who was known to his grandchildren as RP, never lost his temper and was fun to be around, Michael says. He was something of a character who kept odd hours, working late into the night and sleeping until noon. Later, he would order the same thing at the same branch of Marie Callender’s pie place; a distinctive sight in the outfit he wore almost every day. “It was a cream chino suit, a very thin black tie, a white shirt, and he had his trousers taken up three inches shorter. He would wear yellow socks, with white and brown saddle shoes,” says Michael. “When he passed away, I wanted a pair of those shoes because that was his trademark. I opened the closet and there were 40 pairs of shoes and 25 suits and nothing else.” Robert Paxton McCulloch was already a multi-millionaire by the time he turned 18.

Robert Jr was the eldest of the couple's four children Later, he would order the same thing at the same branch of Marie Callender’s pie place; a distinctive sight in the outfit he wore almost every day. “It was a cream chino suit, a very thin black tie, a white shirt, and he had his trousers taken up three inches shorter.

I opened the closet and there were 40 pairs of shoes and 25 suits and nothing else.” McCulloch was a man who fizzed with ideas and was often found tinkering at his holiday house in Palm Springs. It was a place of innovation, where the mundane became fascinating. Drawers did not hold typical domestic trappings - they slid open to reveal chilled cocktail glasses. Such quirks led to Life magazine dubbing the country club home a “push-button paradise” in 1956. The issue featured a number of McCulloch’s inventions “It was way, way before its time,” says Michael. “Everything was electronic. All the doors, all the drawers, everything opened by pushing buttons or by sliding a toggle. “There were features that would turn on the coffee [machine] or the bath or the steam room at whatever time you wanted. All the lighting was controlled by a master panel. No other house had that.” After a successful start in making racing engines, McCulloch branched out into boat engines McCulloch was constantly looking for ways to make life easier. The magazine’s front cover featured another of his creations - a human “Lazy Susan” that rotated with the sun to ensure an even tan. “He came up with a lot of ideas,” says Michael. “He created a jet pack, a two-person helicopter. He made a thing that was like a facelift [using] steam, which would tighten your skin. “It was just something he did for fun. He was a very smart, creative person that needed to keep inventing.” Lake Havasu was created after the completion of the Parker Dam in 1938, which held back the Colorado River It was this compulsion, coupled with good business acumen, that led to his next project. With nowhere to test his boat engines in land-locked eastern California, he hopped over the border into Arizona in search of water. The story goes that it was from the air that McCulloch spotted the ribbon of Havasu’s lake below, snaking through a parcel of land flanked by the Chemehuevi, Whipple and Mojave Mountains. “They noticed it was a really, really beautiful place,” says Michael.  “They took a look around, offered $76 an acre and started building. “He realised there was a huge opportunity there.” The Bridge House Estates committee of the City of London Common Council had known for some time London Bridge was sinking further into the River Thames with every passing rush hour. Horse-drawn carriages had long since made way for cars and double-decker buses and, over the years, the structure had been hammered deeper into the riverbed. The obvious solution to members in 1965 was to demolish it and start again; build a new bridge, for a new era of commuters. Former newspaper and PR man Ivan Luckin had other ideas. “He thought it was all very well knocking it down, but what about its future?”  says former councillor Archie Galloway. “That’s when Ivan made his move. He said to the committee, ‘we ought to sell it’. “A lot of eyebrows went up at that.” Luckin wanted to go a step further and advertise in the United States, where he felt certain someone would be interested in buying a well-known London landmark. “Someone sensibly asked what they might get for [the bridge] and Ivan is recorded as saying, ‘one million’,” says Archie. “And they said, ‘one million dollars?’ “Ivan said, ‘I’m talking about one million pounds.’ [Nearly three millions dollars at the time.] They sat up at that.” News of the sale was soon the subject of newspaper and TV reports trotting out the inevitable line that London Bridge “was falling down”. Luckin’s glossy 40-page brochure for prospective buyers promoted not only the structure itself, but the chance to own a slice of history - a bridge had crossed the Thames in this part of London since Roman times. The new bridge was opened in 1973 by the Queen It was this potential that inspired McCulloch and his business partner, Cornelius Vanderbilt “CV” Wood, who was known for designing Disneyland in California. Stories about how the pair got wind of the sale vary - according to Michael, they saw an advert on TV while on business in London. “They had been having a few drinks together and saw it and I think they probably looked at each other and thought, ‘we should take that apart, that will be our gimmick’.” Another version has Wood at a meeting about the sale of the RMS Queen Mary, at New York’s Plaza Hotel, where he supposedly asked, “anything else for sale?” Either way, Luckin’s perseverance paid off and when the ink dried on the contract of sale on 18 April 1968, he was a man vindicated - his outlandish idea matched only by an even more ludicrous one. “Ivan was immensely proud of it but never went around shouting it from the rooftops,” says Archie. “I think a lot of people thought he was a lunatic, but he was a man of single purpose. “I can’t believe anyone else would have thought of the idea.” When his parents announced they were moving to Lake Havasu City in February 1965, Rick Kingsbury was incredulous. It sounded to him the place barely existed - and he was right. “It wasn’t my idea to move here; no 13-year-old kid in his right mind would want to move to a godforsaken place like this at the time. “We had no electricity, no water, we didn’t have air conditioning. There was one phone, the post office was a closet at the liquor store and the mail went to a box 20 miles away. “Those first few months were like a big camping trip you were never going to go home from. “There was nothing here. I hated the place.” In 1965 there were about 20 homes and a trailer park For Joe Hunnicutt, the worst thing was the dizzying heat of summers inching towards 50C (122F). “I absolutely hated it. My parents took me out of Wyoming and they took me to hell. “We came in August and I stepped outside and I was like,‘are you kidding me?’ “I was eight and all I wanted to do was ride my bike. I couldn’t do that there. “My whole goal was to get out, but you’ve got to give it to them, the people that stuck it out in that godforsaken middle of nowhere.” Those who moved to Lake Havasu between 1964 and 1974 call themselves pioneers - a nod to their 19th Century forefathers who travelled westwards in wagons in search of a better life. But Rick wasn’t imbued with such spirit and it was a year before he saw the merits of living somewhere with one stop sign, two roads and 600 neighbours. The first 10 houses were built in 1964 by Alfred Anderson “I was a reluctant pioneer,” says Rick.“It was only during that second summer I realised what a paradise it was for a kid. “There was all this exploring in the desert, so there was this feeling of Tom Sawyer, of living in this wonderland. “We had this great big lake pretty much to ourselves and we were up to our necks in the cool water. “It was this huge playground and it was all ours.” By the end of 1965, the elementary school had acquired two new classes, and a grocery store had opened its doors. The real change, however, came in 1968, when news trickled back to this tiny desert “city” that its founder had made a bizarre purchase. In the beginning there was just one major crossroad “The whole economics of the place and the attitude of the town changed overnight,” says Rick. “It was like a rocket ship, it took off and went crazy. In the three years it took to build the bridge, the population tripled. “But there was almost a little regret for me. We were growing and I realised it was going to go away. “It was all going to change.” Visitors to Lake Havasu City might assume it existed only because its founder had embarked upon a curious plan to rebuild a piece of British history in the desert. In reality, McCulloch’s small community grew steadily in its fledgling years. The US census recorded that by 1970 the city had more than 4,000 residents - a substantial increase on the handful that called it home six years earlier. But even the engineer’s most faithful supporters struggled to share his vision back in 1964. Early West remembers how in the spring of that year, he and McCulloch had been drinking coffee outside the entrepreneur's new factory in Lake Havasu when, seemingly out of the blue, he said: “I see a city.” “I didn’t know what to say; there was nothing, just desert,” says Early. “I said, ‘I don’t see that city’. And Robert said, ‘I promise, you will’.” Adverts appeared in newspapers offering free trips to Lake Havasu City Lake Havasu’s growth was in part down to dynamic marketing of the American dream - the promise of a better (and sunnier) life. “RP started doing commercials and advertising in the Midwest where it was freezing,” says Michael. “He purchased a bunch of planes and started flying people out on free flights. “They were treated like kings. They were put up in a beautiful hotel for two or three days, had all their meals paid for and all they had to do was go on a tour for a couple of hours. “And it worked like a charm. They sold a lot of those homes that way.” Visitors to Lake Havasu City might assume it existed only because its founder had embarked upon a curious plan to rebuild a piece of British history in the desert.

They sold a lot of those homes that way.” Hundreds boarded the McCulloch-branded propeller planes on chilly runways in Chicago, Boston and New York. On arrival, they were chauffeured to the Havasu Hotel, where a waterfall cascaded dramatically over its front door. “It was unbelievable,” says Evie Cistaro, who visited from Boston on the Thanksgiving weekend of 1972. “We stopped and picked up people in Pennsylvania and Chicago and when we arrived it was 75F (24C) and the sun was shining. “They wined us and dined us and showed us the land, and we bought it and signed. “It was a new beginning.” A salesman was assigned to each couple that stepped off the plane Joe Hunnicutt remembers hearing the sales pitch from his father, Ray, who sold lots for McCulloch. “They drove people around to buy property and I used to sit in the back of the Jeep with them,” he said. “I had that [pitch] memorised... some of it was true, some of it wasn’t.” Hundreds boarded the McCulloch-branded propeller planes on chilly runways in Chicago, Boston and New York.

I thought, ‘it’s an investment’. “But I remember people walking up and down the aisles [on the flight back] saying, ‘who wants to buy a pile of rocks?’ “And I thought, ‘they don't see beyond’.” Evie’s salesman brother, Jay Scavusso, found the Gunnarssons their home The Gunnarssons moved three years later into the only house on an undeveloped hill. “People used to say… ‘you live way up there?’,” says Brooklyn-born Betty. “You could look out for almost a mile. The boys had bikes and they would go out into the desert and [crumble crackers] to make trails so they didn’t get lost. “The experience opened up their eyes. It was a good life.” Before April 1968 few people knew where Lake Havasu City was, but news of the sale made international headlines and gave the tiny desert community a high profile. However, the purchase of London Bridge was also the source of much scorn. Many people assumed McCulloch had lost his mind - although others recognised there might be some cunning behind the bizarre scheme. “There were lots of articles that described RP as crazy,” says Michael. “Then that changed - to crazy like a fox. “People couldn’t conceptualise it… take this bridge in London and put it in the middle of the desert?” A rumour that McCulloch - a millionaire and successful businessman - had “bought the wrong bridge” probably didn’t help, although it was, of course, complete nonsense. McCulloch and Wood went to London to inspect their purchase “I know for a fact they knew exactly which bridge they were going to buy,” says Michael. “Do you think anyone in their right mind would look at Tower Bridge and think they could take it apart and bring it here? “But RP and CV felt that by allowing that rumour to perpetuate, it gave them continued publicity, so they let it go.” Before April 1968 few people knew where Lake Havasu City was - but news of the sale made international headlines and gave the tiny desert community a high profile.

She remembers how the McCulloch salesmen would point her out as a local curiosity to those fresh off the flights, and say “there’s the girl that comes by boat”. She watched as the bricks piled up on the side of the road slowly transformed into a bridge. “I thought it was pretty bizarre at the time,” she says. After all, there was no river in the city for the exported bridge to cross. “Most people build bridges to cross a river, McCulloch built a river under a bridge.” English expat Linda Binder felt similarly when she heard the bridge she had often walked across as a child was moving. “I saw in the papers McCulloch was buying London Bridge and I thought, ‘what are those crazy Yanks doing building a bridge on sand?’ “But I think he did an extraordinary job of bringing it over and having the foresight to bring it brick by brick and rebuild it with the city around it. “I mean, who does that?” Years later, the Londoner moved to Lake Havasu where she became an Arizona state senator and, for many years, the point of contact for British dignitaries visiting the new city. Her husband, Bill, recalls how his friend CV Wood had to get permission from the President of the United States to create a channel under London Bridge. US president Lyndon B. Johnson had to be persuaded by Wood to sign off on the channel “Woody told me the [plan] was to build the bridge on dry land and dredge it out, but they applied for a permit and got denied,” says Bill. Wood was told such permission could be only be granted by the highest authority in the land, so he used his connections to secure a 10-minute audience with Lyndon Johnson, only to be told by the president: “Sorry, you can’t set this precedent. You can’t move a river.” “Woody said the pressure was really on,” says Bill. “He was a Texas boy and so was Johnson, so he started talking with this Texan accent. “He said ‘by golly, the next time someone buys London Bridge and moves it to the US, well, you’ll have to move another damn river’. “Johnson looked at Woody and said, ‘sign it’ [to an aide about the necessary paperwork] and left the room.” Wood, right, was an instrumental part in McCulloch’s plan It wasn’t the only time Wood - who was married to Hollywood actress Joanne Dru - put his famed persuasiveness into action. He is also said to have taken less than two hours to convince 16 environmental agencies opposed to the bridge to get on board. “The reality is RP was an engineer, an entrepreneur,” says Michael. “But CV, he was a showman; he could sell ice to Eskimos. “That’s why they were so good together. They made a good pair.” The first stone arrived in Lake Havasu on 9 July 1968, its swift delivery in part because work had begun to take it down long before McCulloch had signed a cheque for $2.46m. Alan Saines numbered the pieces as they came off the bridge in London. “There was only me numbering them and there were hundreds. If we did 20 a week, we were lucky. “It wasn’t a case of smashing it; the [stones] had to be taken down carefully and stored carefully and all the time they were building the new bridge.” Alan Saines was 17 when he got his first job, taking down the bridge Alan Simpson worked on the design of the new bridge for engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. He said the old bridge came down in slices to make room for the new one. “The only way of doing it was to take down one side of the old bridge so there was just room for the new bridge, then move over to the other side, switch the traffic, then take down the rest of the bridge in the middle and tie [it] back together. “It was complicated. And it wasn’t until fairly late in the day that taking it all down carefully to ship halfway around the world became an additional requirement.” Dockers put the stones on to freighters bound for the US The stones were sent to Surrey Docks, where fellow Mott engineer Bernard Waterworth would consult a long-range telescopic photo of the bridge and direct some pieces on to freighters bound for Long Beach, California, via the Panama Canal. Others first went to Merrivale Quarry in Devon, where the faces were sliced off to cut down on shipping costs, before continuing their 5,000-plus mile journey. “It was an historic monument and you were aware it was unusual,” explains Bernard. “You don’t forget it - projects like that are few and far between.” About 10,600 stones arrived in Lake Havasu, making the final leg of the journey by road on flatbed trucks. Curious tourists would line the roads to watch them trundle into the storage compound, where the stones were unloaded and put in order, ready to be used by construction crews. The interior of the bridge was sold for $2.5m and made into counter-tops and headstones “We would see the trucks coming down the highway and we would sit and watch them go by,” says Norma Grzesiowski, who had just moved to nearby Desert Hills. ""We were thinking, ‘what are they doing? What are they building?’” The cornerstone was lowered by Sir Gilbert Inglefield as McCulloch and Wood looked on “We decided to steal some of the stones and the four of us were in my ’53 Chevy station wagon waiting with bolt-cutters to get in the yard,” remembers Rick Kingsbury. “But those things weighed three times as much as my car did! The ground was shaking as they went by on those eight-axle trucks. “We thought... ‘well that’s a bad idea’.” About 10,600 stones arrived in Lake Havasu on flatbed trucks.

The ground was shaking as they went by on those eight-axle trucks. “We thought... ‘well that’s a bad idea’.” The cornerstone was laid on 23 September 1968 in a ceremony attended by London’s lord mayor. Then work to resurrect the bridge began, starting with the arches, which were laid across the sand. The rebuild began by calculating the angle of the arches “You just saw the skeleton going up, and then they put the face on,” says Norma, who used to sit in a boat on the lake and watch. “The builders explained it was like putting together a puzzle. It was exciting, but it was surreal.” Construction workers had to build the bridge in the sweltering Arizona heat The rest was built around the framework in reinforced concrete. To avoid the sinking fate of its 133,000-tonne predecessor, it was made hollow and finished with a veneer of stone, making it 33,000 tonnes. “It almost felt like I was in a movie,” says former labourer Roy Martin, who helped winch the stones. “People were always coming up to us and asking questions, wanting to take pictures and wanting to know if we had any extra pieces they could take home as souvenirs.” The stones were manoeuvred in by hand and secured with pins, wire and concrete. The work was slow and laborious - crews had to force the 400-500lb pieces in one at a time. On a good day they’d get through 10; the worst was one. If a stone was too damaged to use, it had to be replaced, says Harvey Robertson, who laid steps on the south side of the bridge. But the local rock didn’t match that which had been blackened by a century of London pollution. “It was a lighter colour, so they had these kerosene burners making soot,” he recalls. “Then they painted it on there to make it look dark and weathered, so people wouldn’t know they weren’t the original stones.” The dredge swung across the channel, eating out a path for the water Once the bridge was up, the dunes were sucked out of the arches to make way for the president-approved channel. The land underneath the structure was dredged, allowing London Bridge to tower above a waterway for the first time since it had left Britain. “I remember thinking at the time McCulloch had more money than sense,” says Harvey. “But once I started working on it, I thought he was pretty much a genius.” On 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu’s London Bridge opened to great fanfare. The British were out in force, represented by a delegation from London accompanied by a troupe of red-jacketed horse-riders trotting through the desert. McCulloch, London's lord mayor Sir Peter Studd and Wood attended the dedication The  English Village offered a taste of home with its red phone box, double-decker bus and pub serving Yorkshire pudding and roast beef. But the jewel was the bridge, with the British and US flags flying down both sides. Riders on horseback made a strange sight against the desert backdrop “The whole place was just buzzing,” says Norma Grzesiowski. “They had a big tent down there on the bridge and lots of events and games going on. “I remember them releasing the birds and they had a big hot-air balloon with the British flag on. It was breathtaking - such an exciting thing to be part of.” There was a party atmosphere as the anticipation built According to a report in the Lake Havasu City Herald at the time, some 50,000 people lined the roads to watch the celebrations. The gala featured a float-filled parade and the dramatic release of 30,000 balloons and 3,000 birds, to a backdrop of “home at last” which had been scrawled across the sky. The dedication day festivities were an explosion of colour Bobbi Holmes performed in the opening ceremony - an experience, she jokes, that scarred her for life. “I was a member of the pom-pom girls and we did a dance. We were carrying these pom-poms and doing this routine and my arms felt so heavy. I thought, ‘I never want to be in a parade again’. “But it was really fun and people came from all over. The English Village reminded me of Disneyland, which I later realised was because CV was behind it. “It was pretty, sparkly, clean, with beautiful flowers. It was kind of magical.” On 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu’s London Bridge opened to great fanfare. The British were out in force, represented by a delegation from London accompanied by a troupe of red-jacketed horse-riders trotting through the desert.

The English Village reminded me of Disneyland, which I later realised was because CV was behind it. “It was pretty, sparkly, clean, with beautiful flowers. It was kind of magical.” “Everyone came out,” says Joni Echelberger, whose family had not long moved from Illinois. “My aunt and uncle got to have the $100 dinner in the big tent and I was so jealous because I wanted to be in there. “We were outside waiting and waiting and waiting for the fireworks and they wouldn’t go off until the celebration was done [so] they didn’t go off until midnight. “For such  a  small  community,  it  was  really a  big  deal.” A long red carpet led to the huge striped tent Joe Hunnicutt remembers a “crazy” day that was bursting with community pride. But he tells a different story about those birds, claiming McCulloch hadn’t been able to find doves as planned. Instead, he mainly settled for pigeons. “I remember standing there with my dad and he was wearing his blazer and tie, smoking a cigar, and he says, ‘You know, I think McCulloch is going to regret this particular decision.' “And since 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu City has been infested with pigeons. “They’re the joke and scourge of the town; you can’t get rid of them.” Six years later, McCulloch died from an accidental overdose of alcohol and pills. His death was keenly felt in the community he had built, where his legacy is remembered with a bronze statue and a road bearing his name. Early West, who worked for him for 40 years, describes him as a man who “thought number one about his employees” and remained down to earth. A statue of McCulloch and Wood stands at one end of the bridge “Bob was  a  rich  man,  but  he  was  pretty  common,” the 86-year-old says. “Ordinary people live on a certain level, and he didn’t get too much above that. “I never  noted  him  putting  himself  above  anyone  else.” Early West was convinced by McCulloch to move from the entrepreneur’s LA factory to Lake Havasu Fifty years on and people are still poking fun at McCulloch’s dream. At this year’s Academy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel made a jibe about Lake Havasu while encouraging Oscar winners to keep their acceptance speeches short. His gag actually caused a surge in interest in the resort - not that it really needed the help. According to the state tourist board, 3.65m people visited London Bridge in 2017 - making it Arizona’s third most popular attraction after the Grand Canyon and the Glen Canyon national parks. Thousands of tourists have pierced a map in the visitors’ centre with pins marking their home state McCulloch’s grandson Michael says people come because they’re ""curious"". It’s a word that sums up Lake Havasu perfectly. Driving in from Highway 95, the billboards scream “Visit the home of the London Bridge”. Before long, a flash of blue appears - not a desert mirage, but the waters of the Colorado River filling the city’s man-made lake up ahead. Then before you know it, the bridge appears, dominating a landscape peppered with fast food outlets, hotels and palm trees. It’s a surreal moment, even though you’ve been warned what to expect. For the 52,000 residents that call Lake Havasu City home, the bridge is just a part of everyday life, providing the only access to and from the marina and the homes perched on the first spit of land purchased by McCulloch back in 1958. And although the whole project cost about $12m, McCulloch is said to have recouped his costs before the last brick had even been laid in its new home. The English Village was recently refurbished after standing derelict for years Today, the resort thrives not just on tourism from the bridge, but from income from water sports enthusiasts and college kids on spring break. The calm lake and sunny weather have made the city a legitimate holiday destination - an outcome even its founder would probably not have predicted. That a sinking bridge in London would be the making of a city in Arizona is a testament to McCulloch. But that it became such a success is down to boldness, determination and belief - a reflection, perhaps, of the American spirit. Michael McCulloch says Lake Havasu was his grandfather's ""pride and joy"" “The bridge changed things immensely, I don’t know what the city would be like if it wasn’t here,” reflects Michael. “It was [supposed to be] a retirement resort but it’s turned into a sustainable economy and a lot of people are born here and have chosen not to leave. “I think RP would be amazed by that.” Built with Shorthand"
Seal pup found in Norfolk  back gardenThe three-week-old pup ended up four miles away from the sea after travelling along a drainage system.Norfolk,"The seal pup was found in a garden four miles (6.4km) away from the sea A three-week-old seal pup was found in a back garden four miles (6.4km) away from the sea. The RSPCA said it was found in Terrington St Clement in Norfolk. It said it believed the pup travelled up a drainage system in the hope of finding water or food. Animal collection officer Naemi Kilbey said she was grateful the ""incredibly feisty little fella"" was found, otherwise he may have died from starvation. The seal pup was taken to the RSPCA East Winch Wildlife Centre where it was checked over. The seal pup was taken to the RSPCA's East Winch Wildlife Centre Ms Kilbey said it was found in a garden in an area surrounded by agricultural farmland and ""there was definitely no sign of the sea or a beach"". She said the water system had only two inches of water in it ""so this poor pup must have just kept trying to travel further and further down in the hope of finding water or food"". The RSPCA said it believed the seal pup travelled up a drainage system to get so far inland ""He was an incredibly feisty little fella and it took all my strength to catch and rescue him, but it would have been his spirit and fight for life, that would have kept him alive during his ordeal,"" she said.

How Spice causes chaos in prisons," Warning: Contains offensive language Rob was often the last prisoner into the visitors’ room. On one of Alison’s previous attempts to see her son, he hadn’t turned up at all. The officers simply said they couldn’t find him. Now she was here again on one of the hottest days of summer 2016. The room - big enough to hold 40 tables - was sweltering. Alison and her husband Chris sat down in the middle of the room - waiting and watching intently. A single file of inmates queued - each was methodically patted down before coming in. Alison didn’t look away for a second - she wanted to see Rob the moment he arrived. Despite his distinctive close-cropped red hair, it was sometimes hard to make him out among the identical blue and white check shirts worn by the other prisoners. But this time he was unmissable. Every visitor turned to see Rob enter the room. “He was walking like a zombie with his back arched, completely out of it. I was absolutely shocked,” his mother recalls. Alison leapt up and ran to Rob. Chris, who was queueing for coffee, also rushed to his son. Rob looked on the verge of collapse. Chris called his son’s name, says Alison. “Rob said, ‘Is that you, Dad?’” They brought their son over to where they were sitting. “I was shouting, ‘Can somebody come and help us?’” says Alison. As Rob sat down, she noticed that he had a T-shirt on underneath his prison-issue top - two layers despite the heat. Alison wanted to cool him down. “As I pulled the T-shirt down I noticed that he had ‘twat’ drawn across his chest in Biro.” Alison shouted again for help from nearby prison officers. The medical team escorted Rob out of the visitors’ room and checked him over. They denied he was under the influence of Spice, but his mother was convinced. “It was obvious he’d taken it, we know he had. I was scared for him and I felt that he was humiliated.” Also in the visitors’ room that day was Ben, an inmate who had served time in six prisons and was then inside after a fraud conviction. He was talking to his girlfriend when Rob entered the room. “I’d seen Robert about, always dazed, high all the time.” Rob and Ben were being held on the same wing. But it was only after seeing the episode in the visitors’ room that Ben got to know Rob. “He came in doubled over backwards as if he was going to fall over, sweating. “When the parents sat down I told them, ‘I’ve seen him on my wing, I will keep an eye on him.’” Rob had been transferred to The Mount prison on 11 May 2016 at the age of 24, after serving a large part of his sentence in HMP Peterborough. It marked one of the final stages of a sad decline. He had been someone that people loved. One friend would later describe his “wildly engaging smile and his eccentric sense of humour”. Another wrote: “Swimming in the park on boiling hot days will always stay with me, as will making dens and climbing trees - always in places we shouldn’t.” But Alison had seen a big change in Rob in his penultimate year at secondary school. Previously a sporty child, playing rugby and cricket at county level, he and his friends then started to smoke cannabis. The drug was supplied by one friend in particular. “He was able to supply them with whatever they wanted and they were impressionable. “A lot of his friends got through that stage but for Rob, I realise now, from the age of 18 it affected his mental health. That’s when his behaviour became quite unpredictable.” There is evidence that cannabis can have an effect on teenagers’ mental health. A 2015 study by King’s College London found that the risk of psychosis was five times higher for those who smoked potent cannabis every day compared with non-users. Rob didn’t seem built to cope with addiction. In his early 20s he travelled to India three times.  He had always been interested in the spirituality of India - but his mother thinks he was really just trying to escape from his addiction. On one of his trips he had to be picked up from Dubai airport by his father. Rob had experienced a drug-induced breakdown and was in custody after stealing alcohol from an airport shop. In the year before being sent to prison in the UK, his alcohol and drug addiction led to a string of shoplifting offences and then robbery. One evening in November 2015 he demanded money from a man leaving a supermarket. When the man refused, he punched him in the face. Rob was arrested and pleaded guilty to attempted robbery and theft. He was sentenced to 21 months in prison for those offences, with another three months added from a previous suspended sentence. Alison says Rob was drunk at the time of the robbery and on anti-psychotic medication. He was full of remorse although he had little memory of exactly what he had done. Rob was classed as a vulnerable person on entering prison because he had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychosis. “He finally was sent to prison after he had been diagnosed with a mental illness,” Alison says. “As his family, we were relieved, thinking the prison system will sort this out now.” Warning: Contains offensive language Rob was often the last prisoner into the visitors’ room.

You can still see the remains of the control tower. Another part of the old RAF base holds an outdoor market where you can get everything from cheap trainers to Chinese food. Once a tiny medieval village, Bovingdon expanded rapidly after World War Two and is now a 9,000-strong community, firmly ensconced in the London commuter belt. The prison is home to just under 1,000 men. The names of its wings mostly refer to WW2 bomber pilots - Lakes, Ellis, Fowler, Brister. It’s category C - a closed prison but one where inmates typically serve shorter sentences for more minor crimes. But being the nearest category C prison to London, it has a lot of prisoners from the capital. A lot of inner-city mentality lands in rural Hertfordshire, says Michael (not his real name), a prison officer with two decades of experience who has worked in The Mount. Short-staffing always causes problems. Experienced staff left and were not fully replaced. A high proportion of officers and managers had less than two years’ experience. Many other prisons have also been struggling. In November 2016, the then Justice Secretary Liz Truss announced plans for more funding and for 2,500 extra officers across the system in England and Wales. Up until then officer numbers had fallen from about 25,000 in 2010 to just 18,000. “A lot of problems are caused by staff shortages,” says Michael. But while staff shortages have caused many prisons to struggle, another factor has pushed some to the brink - Spice. Spice was originally a brand name but has come to be used generically for a number of synthetic replacements for cannabis created from the 1980s onwards. These substances were designed to mimic cannabis, but some experts say they can be up to 100 times more potent. Soon after their invention they were being used recreationally, marketed as “legal highs”. A rapid spread was to follow. By 2012, the drug was beginning to have a foothold in British prisons and by 2015 it was everywhere. Spice became illegal in May 2016, under the Psychoactive Substances Act. There was some progress, but the change in the law did not stop the drugs getting into prison. Ministry of Justice figures obtained by the BBC show Spice seizures in the six months after the ban were 20% down in prisons in England and Wales. But not a single month passed without Spice being seized in The Mount between October 2015 and June 2017. Every night, drones would fly in to deliver the drug, taking advantage of the absence of netting, a report by the prison's independent monitoring board noted. That was addressed and drone deliveries were declining, its report suggested last year, but drugs were still getting in. In February this year, 50 prisoners were randomly tested - 24 had taken a drug of some kind. Lots of prisons have problems with Spice, and the effect of this drug on prison life is chilling. “Spice is the worst drug I’ve ever seen,” says Michael, whose duties included administering drug tests. “Unless you see a full-on Spice attack you can’t imagine. It’s like they’re absolutely paralytically drunk but can also speak. “If you didn’t know better you would say they were fitting. It’s extreme.” As well as these dramatic zombie-like “attacks”, Spice has also been linked to a wave of self-inflicted deaths in prison. Figures from the Prison Ombudsman show that 79 prisoners died in England and Wales between June 2013 and September 2016 who were either known to use synthetic cannabinoids, or were strongly suspected to have taken them before death. In 42 concluded inquests from this period, 27 of the deaths were deemed to be self-inflicted. Michael says problems connected with Spice exacerbate short-staffing. He remembers three or four ambulances attending The Mount in a single day for separate Spice attacks. Officers have to accompany inmates to hospital. “The impact on staff is demoralising. For each person in hospital, that takes four staff out of the system for 24 hours.” In November 2016 alone there were 70 emergency service call outs, mainly for drug-related problems. More than half of those occurred in a single week. And the popularity of the drug in prisons creates a dangerous Spice economy.

More than half of those occurred in a single week. And the popularity of the drug in prisons creates a dangerous Spice economy. Like many other prisons, Spice was easy to get hold of in The Mount. But there were reports of a particularly virulent strain. It was known simply as Death. This type of Spice was widely available and led to a number of hospital visits, the prison’s Independent Monitoring Board said. Ben says cannabis was everywhere too. “When you come into my wing you smell so much weed, more than I’ve ever smelt outside. “Even an idiot officer comes to the wing, which they do every hour, and knows somebody’s smoking it there.” Once the drugs were in, many prisoners would do anything to get hold of them. The debt culture was so acute in The Mount, Michael says, that prisoners who owed money and goods to others were deliberately offending so they could get into the prison’s segregation unit, or be transferred to another prison. Ben remembers one particularly vicious assault in The Mount. “I went down to the laundry and four or five guys started on someone, punching and kicking him in the face. “It was so ferocious. His face was so mashed up he looked like he’d been hit by a car.” Ben was told the inmate was attacked because he had not settled a debt. While Rob was in The Mount, Alison received phone calls as regularly as once a week from her son on different prisoners’ mobile phones. Each time he was asking her to transfer money. “He told me it was for tobacco and if he didn’t get the money he would be beaten up. “I think what had happened was Robert has been given Spice on tick [credit] and then he had to pay it back.” Alison says she typically paid £25 each time. “I was scared for him. It’s very difficult.” Like many other prisons, Spice was easy to get hold of in The Mount. But there were reports of a particularly virulent strain. It was known simply as Death.

It’s very difficult.” Ben says addicts like Rob are especially vulnerable to bullying in prison. In Rob’s case he would buy things from “canteen” and then give them to other prisoners. Canteen is in effect a shop where each prisoner has a set allowance to spend and the goods are collected on Fridays. “Rob never spent any money from his canteen [on things for himself],” says Ben. “I told the officers, ‘Stop his canteen, let’s see who’s taking this from him because he’s got nothing in his room.’ “Who is it taking it from him? If he’s got money where’s the money going to? Why is nobody checking the bullying?” Other prisoners would stand alongside Rob, ready to take his items as soon as they were handed to him. This happened in plain sight in front of officers, says Ben, but they dismissed his concerns. “They’d say he’s an addict - he can deal with it. I said you can see he’s not capable of dealing with it.” Robert was an easy target for drug dealers inside prison, says Alison. On one occasion he was held hostage by another inmate for two hours. Alison obtained prison records of Rob’s mental and physical health inside The Mount. They said “staff could hear Mr Morris being punched and crying out in pain”. The records said: “When the hostage situation was resolved, Mr Morris denied that he was being punched, which was challenged by staff.” Rob told officers that he did not want to press charges and did not want to get other prisoners in trouble. Staff on Rob’s wing told mental health services that he was a regular Spice user and “allows other prisoners to punch [him] as payment”. “That’s what they do, they completely and utterly bully a vulnerable person,” says Alison. The Spice trade has cultivated bullying in many prisons, says Mike Trace, chief executive of the Forward Trust. The charity helps prisoners with drug and alcohol dependence and ran a centre in The Mount. Last year the trust stopped running rehabilitation courses because drugs were too readily available across the prison. “The scale of the consumption of Spice was also creating violence and intimidation problems because it was gang-led.” Prisoners undergo “Spice dares” - ridiculous challenges either while high on Spice or in return for more of the drug, says Ben. Their behaviour is erratic enough without being goaded or forced into worse. “I’ve seen people being dragged [around the floor] banging their heads into walls,” says Ben. “People watch people on Spice and they just see it as entertainment. This is what keeps them happy in prison.” Sexual violence was driven by the drug trade, Ben believes. “I’ve heard of inmates being offered spice for sexual favours. It’s a bit rampant actually.” Alison understands that Rob was subjected to sexual abuse inside the prison, recorded in his medical records as a “suspected assault”. She says her son’s release papers also showed he had received rape counselling. “I never asked Robert about that because it could humiliate him more.” She says on release that information was not passed on to his probation officer, psychiatrist or his mental health team. “And so when he came out he had to live with all of those things that had happened to him.” Ben says addicts like Rob are especially vulnerable to bullying in prison. In Rob’s case he would buy things from “canteen” and then give them to other prisoners. Canteen is in effect a shop where each prisoner has a set allowance to spend and the goods are collected on Fridays. “Rob never spent any money from his canteen [on things for himself],” says Ben. “I told the officers, ‘Stop his canteen, let’s see who’s taking this from him because he’s got nothing in his room.’ “Who is it taking it from him?

The records said: “When the hostage situation was resolved, Mr Morris denied that he was being punched, which was challenged by staff.” Rob told officers that he did not want to press charges and did not want to get other prisoners in trouble. Staff on Rob’s wing told mental health services that he was a regular Spice user and “allows other prisoners to punch [him] as payment”. “That’s what they do, they completely and utterly bully a vulnerable person,” says Alison. The Spice trade has cultivated bullying in many prisons, says Mike Trace, chief executive of the Forward Trust. The charity helps prisoners with drug and alcohol dependence and ran a centre in The Mount. Last year the trust stopped running rehabilitation courses because drugs were too readily available across the prison. “The scale of the consumption of Spice was also creating violence and intimidation problems because it was gang-led.” Prisoners undergo “Spice dares” - ridiculous challenges either while high on Spice or in return for more of the drug, Ben says. Their behaviour is erratic enough without being goaded or forced into worse. “I’ve seen people being dragged [around the floor] banging their heads into walls,” says Ben. “People watch people on Spice and they just see it as entertainment. This is what keeps them happy in prison.” Sexual violence was driven by the drug trade, Ben believes. “I’ve heard of inmates being offered spice for sexual favours. It’s a bit rampant actually.” Alison understands that Rob was subjected to sexual abuse inside the prison, recorded in his medical records as a “suspected assault”. She says her son’s release papers also showed he had received rape counselling. “I never asked Robert about that because it could humiliate him more.” She says on release that information was not passed on to his probation officer, psychiatrist or his mental health team. “And so when he came out he had to live with all of those things that had happened to him.” “I’ve seen people dance on netting, be jabbering wrecks on the stairs, tell officers they love them.” Spice’s impact on existing mental health problems is devastating, says Michael. “I can’t blame the prisoners. They can’t get a beer out the fridge after a bad day. I come home and watch a film. That’s my escapism.” He says the general mental health of prisoners has been in decline for years. “When I joined the service two decades ago, there were very few mental health problems. Now it seems only one in three hasn’t got a mental health issue. It’s that prevalent. “I’ve had people walk up to me and slice their own stomach open.” More than one in three (37%) prisoners report having mental health or well-being issues at any one time, according to surveys carried out by HM Inspectorate of Prisons for England and Wales. The number of health emergencies and mental health interventions is rising throughout the prison system, says Mike Trace. Forward Trust tries to track them. Spice is causing both cardiac and respiratory problems as well as psychosis. “The level of use of cannabis in prisons has been high for decades and what we’ve seen is a partial replacement of cannabis and tobacco with Spice. That’s the explanation for the much higher rates of hospitalisation and psychosis,” says Mr Trace. In April 2015, an unannounced inspection of The Mount by the Chief Inspector of Prisons found that while secondary mental health care provision was deemed good, primary mental health services - the first port of call for inmates - were inadequate. Michael has seen everything there is to see in prison. He says he’s witnessed 16 riots, cut down 12 inmates who had attempted suicide, and dealt with six deaths. He believes more sheltered accommodation needs to be provided for low-level offenders with mental health problems. “There is still a view from judges that for people with diagnosed mental health illness, prisons are a place of safety,” says the President of the Prison Governors Association, Andrea Albutt. “They are not a place of safety. Someone with mental health illness is very vulnerable.” Just before he was released from The Mount in September 2016 Rob wrote a letter, in effect for himself, setting out what he hoped to achieve when he got out. It started: “My main aim on my release from prison is to make my parents proud.” The letter was an assessment of the flaws in his character and what he needed to do to make things better and restore his relationships with his family. He talked of his severe depression. And of giving up smoking Spice. He finished by writing: “I wonder when it was that I chose to get off the ride - one too many trips and an unstable mind makes for a complete mess.” Robert Morris died on 3 March 2017 at the age of 25. It was just six months after he left The Mount, although he had also spent a stint back at HMP Peterborough in that time after being arrested for being drunk and disorderly. He was found slumped in a chair in his room in a supported living accommodation unit, having inhaled his own vomit after drinking heavily. The coroner’s report into Rob’s death recorded a verdict of misadventure. But it criticised a failure to rehabilitate him and the lack of attention paid to his mental illness. “During his time in prison he suffered significant abuse but his severe mental illness does not seem to have been fully recognised or addressed and an opportunity for beneficial treatment that this period of detainment afforded was missed,” the coroner said. (Below: Alison, Rob's mother) From early 2015 it had been clearly established that Rob “suffered from paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by his alcohol and illicit drug abuse”. There’s no doubt Rob Morris must have been a complex prisoner to deal with. His prison records show he refused or failed to take medication on five occasions. But it's clear he suffered a lot during his time in prison. In the first few months the records state that he was held hostage, as well as suffering bruises and abrasions on his body, a number of Spice incidents, suspected relapses of schizophrenia and a suspected sexual assault. After nearly three and a half months he was moved to a different wing. Ben believes the prison was responsible for his death. “The Mount killed him 100%. I’ll stand anywhere in the world and say that. “If he’d had 1% of the right help he’d be here now. The system did not care about Rob. “If I had a headache you’d tell me to go to the hospital. He had mental issues - they put him in a prison with a thousand people from the general population who are messed up anyway.” Alison says the prison can’t be blamed wholly for her son’s death. “Robert was leading a risky life. Rob was sent to prison because he had committed crime, low-level crime. “[But] he was sent into a den of drug taking, abuse, bullying and was not kept safe. So what was the point of it all?” Alison doesn’t dispute that her son should have been sent to prison - she just wishes there was some way that people like Rob could be looked after once inside. “When a young person with complex needs such as Rob is sent to prison [they should be] rehabilitated. “In fact, prison was less safe than the environment he’d come from. There were not enough staff there to deal with specific issues people may have.” People like Rob are often going to have difficulties in prison, says Andrea Albutt. “Prisoners with mental health problems are vulnerable so are ripe to be abused by the stronger prisoners. “We have a lot of people who drop between mental health and segregation units.... It’s really difficult to manage them - they disrupt wings and that further adds to what’s going on and it’s destabilising. If you have one or two people who are unwell it can have a massive impact.” The BBC’s request for an interview with the governor of The Mount was declined. But in a statement, the Ministry of Justice said its “sincere condolences are with the family and friends of Mr Morris”. “The safety and welfare of people within our custody is our priority and all prisons, including The Mount, have procedures to identify, manage and support people with mental health issues,” it added. The POA, which represents rank-and-file officers, has for some time been raising the issue of psychoactive substances and the potential personality changes and cognitive function damage caused to inmates. It is well known that prisoners bully other prisoners to take a drug in order to establish the strength of a batch, says Andy Baxter, from the POA’s National Executive Committee. “Unfortunately, despite government claims to have addressed the recruitment emergency, our members are simply rushed off their feet in the chaos that is a Prison Service in crisis, perpetuated in part by the availability of psychoactive substances. “Prison officers want to do a good job, but staffing levels of five or six officers to 190 prisoners make it impossible for staff to be all places at all times. “The chaos within our prisons needs to slow down - things need to go back to being controlled and safe.” In July 2018, new figures showed that almost a third of prisoners randomly tested in The Mount over 12 months had taken drugs. Across the prison system, the figure was one in five. Alison is sure that it was The Mount where Rob’s condition deteriorated most, rather than in Peterborough where he spent more of his sentence. 2017: Dozens of prisoners rioted at the Mount But it would be wrong to suggest that The Mount is a particularly bad prison. The problems it has are common to varying degrees across the prison system in England and Wales. When it was last inspected in 2015, The Mount was deemed to be “reasonably safe” and several aspects of the prison were praised or deemed better than comparable prisons. But the then chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick identified problems in key areas. “Too many victims of bullying sought sanctuary in the segregation unit and most were then moved out to prisons with insufficient effort to resolve their concerns and reintegrate them back on the wings where appropriate. “Prisoners told us drugs and alcohol were easily available, despite determined efforts by the prison to prevent this.” On 31 July 2017, almost a year after Rob left The Mount, there was an illustration of the pressures that can build up in a prison. For two days armed inmates took control of all of one wing and half of another. Specialist “tornado” riot-trained staff were called in. As many as 30 prisoners were involved - threatening prison officers and smashing windows. In the middle of the chaos, a report was published warning of “severe” staff shortages at the jail. A year afterwards, the Independent Monitoring Board said the prison had been “locked into a vicious spiral of decline”. The current Chief Inspector of Prisons, Peter Clarke, has said that jails have become ""unacceptably violent and dangerous places"" with attempted reforms undermined by the presence of Spice and similar drugs among inmates. In a recent report he criticised “the shockingly high numbers who acquire a drug habit while they are detained”. But the Ministry of Justice says it has tackled the rise in Spice by “bringing in 300 specialist drug dogs, new body scanners and making it a criminal offence to possess NPS [synthetic drugs such as Spice] in prison”. Ms Albutt does not think these changes have had an effect yet and says drug use and mental health problems remain ubiquitous across the prison system. The effect of funding cuts, and the loss of experienced staff, was exacerbated by other changes. “A lot of prisons are in dire straits. We lost years and years of knowledge and at the same time the demographics of prisoners started to change so we had younger, more violent, less respectful men in prison. “Organised crime gangs managed to get a hold of our prisons. Staff are scared. Self-harm, violence, prisoner on prisoner - every stat has gone up. “We need more technology. We need body scanners. We need to have really well-resourced security departments joined up with the police. We are recruiting 2,500 officers but they’re brand new and coming into a prison service that has been in crisis for a long time. Once we get experienced officers and trust with prisoners - it will take time.” The death of a former prisoner isn’t the kind of thing that normally makes headlines. But Rob’s family and friends will always remember that prison was a place where he couldn’t find the help to be who he wanted to be. “I am not ashamed of my son,” says Alison. “I’m actually quite proud of Rob because he suffered an awful lot in his life. “At his funeral we had 200 people. They remembered the Robert that was well.” Author:  Noel TitheradgeIllustrations: Rebecca HendinOnline production: Ben MilneEditor: Finlo Rohrer Photography: Press Association; Shutterstock; Getty Images; Science Photo Library All images subject to copyright Built with Shorthand"
A man who thinks Europe is being invaded," In January 2015, four days after the terror attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, an estimated 1.5 million people marched through Paris. Viktor Orban was one of 40 world leaders at their head, standing in solidarity for freedom of expression and against terror. 2015: World leaders march through Paris after the Charlie Hebdo attacks Different countries drew different conclusions from the Charlie Hebdo murders, and later terror attacks. Orban was clear from the first moment who to blame. Immigrants. The troubled family background of the perpetrators, their upbringing in an orphanage, the radicalisation they succumbed to - all these were of no interest to Orban. He told Hungarian TV: “We will never allow Hungary to become a target country for immigrants. We do not want to see significantly sized minorities with different cultural characteristics and backgrounds among us. We want to keep Hungary as Hungary.” It was a narrative that Orban had used before but then started to exploit tirelessly to win votes at home. In 2015 and 2016, in addition to a wave of terror attacks, Europe faced another challenge - the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees. By equating migrants with terrorists Orban tried to offer both a simple explanation and a simple solution. Most of those coming were not refugees, fleeing war and persecution, he explained. They were economic migrants wanting a better life in Western Europe. His message struck a chord with many Hungarians. Orban asked his population in a referendum in October 2016 whether they wanted the EU to “impose migrants” on Hungary. He got a resounding “no” from the 41% of the electorate who cast a valid vote, although that turnout was too low to make the final result count. Votes being counted in the 2016 referendum on migration quotas Hungary’s population has long been falling - 30,000 people a year, equivalent to the loss of a small town. The solution is not immigration, but rather to encourage Hungarian families to have more children, Orban believes. To understand why an anti-immigration agenda might be so successful, it’s necessary to explore Hungary’s history. Less than 2% of the Hungarian population was born outside the country. And Hungarians have long memories of foreign invasion - of being overrun by the Turks, the Austrians and the Russians. In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon settled the post-World War One borders of Hungary, one of the successor states of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hungary lost 72% of her territory, and 31% of ethnic Hungarians found themselves outside her borders as minorities in Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Hungary was also deprived of her multicultural communities - the many Romanians, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats and Ruthenians who had previously lived side-by-side with Hungarians. In World War Two, most of her large Jewish population was murdered in death camps, and in the post-war deportations she lost many of the Germans who had settled in Hungary since the 18th Century. Hungary had been emptied of all but her Hungarians. There’s a historical and literary parable that Viktor Orban likes. Every Hungarian schoolchild reads Geza Gardonyi’s novel - The Eclipse of the Crescent Moon. It's 1552 and the castle of Eger in northern Hungary is besieged by a huge Ottoman army. Captain Istvan Dobo and his tiny garrison defend the town and send the Turks packing. The hero is Gergely Bornemissza, an explosives expert who plays a central role in the defence of the fortress. Hungarian author Geza Gardonyi (1863-1922) Other Hungarian castles fell to the Turks in the following decades but only after inflicting such losses on the invaders that their advance into Europe faltered, then failed. In September 2015 at the monastery of Banz in Bavaria, Orban conjured up the spirit of the 16th Century. He told his admirers from the German centre-right that he was just a captain, defending the outer castles from the same Muslim enemy, intent on swamping Christian Europe. “If we want a Hungarian Hungary and a European Europe, and that is exactly what we want,” he said in a speech in October 2017 in Oradea, Romania, “then we must also want a Christian Hungary and a Christian Europe, instead of what now threatens us - a Europe with a mixed population and no sense of identity.” Orban’s image of “mixed” versus “unmixed” populations provoked strong reactions. In February the UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Husseincalled him a racist and a xenophobe. The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto rejected the criticism as “unacceptable and inappropriate” andcalled on al-Hussein to resign. They were on their way to the more prosperous countries of Western Europe. But Orban’s nightmare was that they might in future be sent back to Hungary by Vienna or Berlin. In May 2015, the European Commission proposed compulsory quotas to redistribute asylum seekers. Orban was having none of it. “No-one will tell us who we let into our own house,” he thundered. His answer was a fence. On 16 June 2015, Hungary announced the construction of a 175km (110-mile) barrier along the southern border with Serbia. In the spring of 2015, Orban’s party Fidesz had lost two by-elections and the leader, according to his critics, saw the value of playing the migration card. In the following months his party won back anything up to a million supporters, pollsters estimated. The border fence (in red) spans Hungary's border with Serbia and Croatia The fence was built by a combination of soldiers, prison inmates and unemployed people on community work schemes. It was completed on 15 September 2015. By mid-October, a 40km extension was added along the border with Croatia. At 3m high, dug 1.5m into the ground, and topped with coils of razor wire, it was later reinforced with a second fence, a service road down the middle, a 900-volt electric current and night-vision cameras. All of this was guarded by up to 10,000 police and soldiers. “The old Iron Curtain was built against us, this one was built for us,” Orban told a press conference. He introduced new laws to criminalise migrants. Crossing or damaging the fence became a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. Most who do so are caught and summarily expelled from the country - through gates built into the fence. One Syrian found guilty of inciting migrants to cross the border and throwing objects at police has recently been found guilty of “complicity in an act of terror” and sentenced to seven years in jail. Two “transit zones” built into the fence at Tompa and Roszke, initially allowed 20 asylum seekers a day to apply. That figure is now down to two a day,according to the UNHCR. The border near Roszke In April 2017 the zones were enlarged into “container camps” where asylum seekers, including unaccompanied minors as young as 14, could be detained for many months. In 2017, 3,700 were allowed to apply, of whom 1,300 were granted some kind of protected status. Most subsequently left the country. Integration programmes for the small number granted asylum in Hungary have been slashed or abolished. Orban’s message is clear. Hungary is not open to migrants. Soviet soldiers pulling out of Hungary, 1990 The phone rang in my 4th floor apartment overlooking the Kiraly Baths in Budapest. It was Miklos Haraszti, a well-known dissident. “I’ve got a young man here who wants to meet you.” Later that day Viktor Orban was sitting in my flat, drinking tea from one of my chipped mugs. He was bearded, earnest, and keen to impress - explaining how he and his friends were setting up a new political movement. It was to be called Fidesz - the Alliance of Young Democrats - and would be a rival of the Young Communist League. It was March 1988 and Orban was 25. At secondary school he had briefly pledged his allegiance to the Young Communists. But now they were falling apart. The Party’s grip on power was always backed up by the presence of 55,000 Soviet troops. One would occasionally see them, always in small groups, at the zoo or railway stations, their broad-topped green felt caps looking like the baize on a miniature pool table. But their effect was well understood. It was Soviet troops who had crushed the Hungarian attempt to break away from Moscow in 1956 under Prime Minister Imre Nagy. The threat remained in the years which followed. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985, he publicly renounced the Brezhnev doctrine under which Moscow claimed the right to send military force to defend the Communist Party in any Warsaw Pact country. This was a body-blow to the Communist leaders of Eastern Europe. They now realised that if the people ever rose up, the regimes might be unable to defend themselves. They didn’t have long to wait. Meanwhile, Hungary increasingly took over from Poland as the main seedbed of democracy in the region. Viktor Orban quickly became one of the bigger seeds. He was born in Szekesfehervar in May 1963, a city 60km (37 miles) south of Budapest, and capital of Hungary in the Middle Ages. By the 1970s, it had recovered from heavy damage in World War Two, and boasted important bus and electronics factories, as well as a mechanised infantry battalion of the Red Army. Orban grew up in the nearby villages of Felcsut and Alcsutdoboz, the oldest of three sons. He still has a weekend house in Felcsut. His father Gyozo was a member of the Communist Party and technical inspector in a local mine. The young Viktor was a bright pupil and a talented footballer. The trainer’s notes for the Felcsut team read: “Viktor Orban: Forward - quick thinker, fast shooter, dynamic passer - shows potential.” Orban later told an interviewer: “I was probably the first in our family, when there was a choice of schoolwork or work in the garden, who chose to study.” He was beaten regularly by his father as a teenager for“disobeying him and being cheeky to his mother”. His mother taught children with special needs. Orban’s anti-Communism probably stemmed from the bullying and Marxist propaganda he was subjected to during his military service, according to one of his biographers, Paul Lendvai. In 1982 he moved to Budapest to study law and political science at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. He quickly formed a tight group with his fellow students - who later became the core of Fidesz. There was a fierce loyalty among them, and according to their adversaries, “the best girls hung out there”. Orban came from a Calvinist Protestant background but is thought to have been an atheist in his youth. In 1986 he married university classmate Aniko Levai in a civil ceremony, despite her Catholic upbringing. They were both 23. Orban with his wife Aniko Levai in 2016 Fidesz rapidly transformed itself from a youth movement into a political party, with a liberal ideology and an upper age limit of 35. “Rather than attacking Communist rule directly, we would create small islands of freedom, interconnected social circles and associations, which, when the moment came, could be connected to change the system,” wrote Orban. In June 1989, anti-Communist and Communist reform groups agreed that it was time to rebury Imre Nagy and his colleagues, secretly executed by the Communists in 1958. In front of a crowd of tens of thousands in Heroes Square in Budapest, Viktor Orban broke ranks with other leaders of the nascent Hungarian opposition, to demand that Soviet troops leave Hungary. “If we are determined enough, we will be able to coerce the ruling party to submit to free elections. If we have the guts to will all of this, then and only then we shall fulfil the destiny of our revolution.” In the taxi afterwards the Polish dissident leader Adam Michnik told him: “Viktor, you shouldn’t have said that.” But while others on the stage were afraid of a coup against Gorbachev in Moscow, and hardline Communists returning to power in Hungary, Orban plunged in. The last Soviet soldier left Hungarian soil in June 1991, as Fidesz activists waved triumphant banners beside their trains. Fidesz won a respectable 9% in the election in 1990, but slipped to a disappointing 7% in 1994. Orban saw a gap opening on the political right and seized it - dragging his liberal party to the conservative side, although several of his closest friends quit in protest. Inspired by Germany’s long-serving centre-right Chancellor Helmut Kohl, from 1995 onwards Orban set about gathering everyone in Hungary who was right of centre under his own flag. What mattered to him was to win power, and keep it, at any cost” A conversation from the early 1990s illustrates Orban’s ambition. “We were sitting in the Angelika cafe, across the Danube from parliament,” economist Peter Rona remembers. Orban was describing how he wanted to turn Fidesz into a modern conservative party, but Rona warned of the danger of abandoning the “modern” at the first sign of electoral trouble. “‘I will not fall into that trap, but if necessary, so be it,’ replied Orban, to my surprise. What mattered to him was to win power, and keep it, at any cost.” In the mid-1990s, while a Socialist-Liberal coalition ruled Hungary, Orban was becoming more conservative. He had opposed the Pope’s visit to Hungary in 1991 and mocked Christian Democrats in parliament, but he now realised he would have to be a Christian. His decade-long marriage to Aniko Levai was blessed in a Calvinist church ceremony in 1996. All his five children were baptised. The 1990s saw dramatic change in Hungary. Factories, agricultural land, forests, homes, and businesses were privatised. Many late Communist-era managers made fortunes overnight, but there were also opportunities for sharp-witted, younger entrepreneurs, unconnected to the old regime. Foreign investment poured into the country, but a large part of Hungarian manufacturing was destroyed. Western companies didn’t want semi-obsolete industries. Unemployment leapt to one million. The country was brimming with resentment - between the city and the village, the new rich and the new poor, and between nationalists and liberals. Many people felt that privatisation had gone too far, and that the national wealth had been lost. Orban won the 1998 election, and formed a coalition government. His government was viewed as moderately successful and quietly prepared Hungary for EU membership. Orban was stunned to lose narrowly to the Socialists in 2002. 2002: A poster from Orban's unsuccessful campaign for re-election “The nation cannot be in opposition,” he assured a mass torch-lit vigil by his supporters in the castle district in Buda, after conceding. It was a turning point in his career. That autumn Orban was introduced to Arpad Habony, a communications expert and a champion in the Japanese martial art of kendo. “[Habony] taught him to change the way he dressed, and the audience he talked to,” says a source close to the government. “To create a new image for himself, to speak and act like an average Hungarian.” To this day, Habony remains Orban’s communications guru, although he has no official role in the government, and does not appear on the payroll. Behind the scenes, Orban’s old schoolfriend Lajos Simicska was building a financial empire that would also help Fidesz back into power. Simicska’s company specialised in concrete, steel, and tarmac. As Hungary built hundreds of kilometres of highway, largely with EU money, the cash flowed into the coffers of Simicska, and his party. Orban was beaten again in the 2006 election. Finally in 2010, Fidesz swept back to power with a two-thirds majority in a country still staggering from the effects of the global economic crisis. Orban during his successful 2010 election campaign Orban went first to Brussels, to ask for more time to tackle the country’s excessive deficit. The cold shoulder he received there, and in Berlin, left him bitter towards “the Brussels bureaucrats”. His government needed money. Private pension funds were diverted to the state. There were new taxes on bank transactions, mobile phone calls and text messages. The tax on the revenue of foreign-owned energy companies was doubled. 2010: A Fidesz supporter carries a banner reading “Thank you Hungary” With a two-thirds majority in parliament, Fidesz was unstoppable, carving out a new state based on its own ideology. Orban pushed through a new constitution which stressed Christian-Conservative values - nation and family. This new constitution stated that Hungary had lost its self-determination from March 1944 to May 1990 - the years first of Nazi then Communist rule - and so partially absolved Hungarians of guilt for the Holocaust. It also weakened the power of the Constitutional Courtto act as a check on the power of the government. Orban granted citizenship and the right to vote in Hungarian elections to more than a million Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. At the last election, 95% of those who voted backed Fidesz. A new media law was passed, creating a powerful National Media Authority. Public TV and radio and the state news agency became government mouthpieces. Under international pressure, the law was amended. But a year later, in 2012, the Council of Europe criticised political influence over appointments to the authority. Critics were purged from the civil service, state companies, schools and even hospitals. When I asked Orban before the 2010 election how many people he intended to replace if he won, he replied without hesitation “12,000”. It was as if he knew their names. In 2014 Orban won again. The new election law, passed in 2011, turned the 44% won by Fidesz into another two-thirds majority. Even his critics acknowledge grudgingly that he “got the country back to work”, though they challenge the way he did it. In 2010, only 54% per cent of Hungarians of active age worked - now the figure is nearer 70%. Orban promised a million jobs in 10 years, and claims to have now reached 740,000. But 180,000 are employed in government work schemes, sweeping streets and clearing scrubland, with little training for the job market. The boom in construction is fuelled by EU funds of €3-4bn a year. Massive state construction projects focus on football stadiums and the rebuilding of public spaces. Many Hungarians undoubtedly feel better off than four years ago. Wages have risen at more than 10% a year. Annual growth is over 4% and unemployment is below 4%. But there is a growing shortage of workers, as over 600,000 emigrated to other EU countries seeking higher wages. Electronics companies cannot fulfil orders because of a shortage of IT engineers. Hospitals complain of a shortage of doctors and nurses. Loudspeaker announcements at train stations try to attract new train drivers. Restaurants and shops advertise in vain for staff. Orban and his media lambastmigrationas both undesirable and stoppable, but Hungarian families are acutely aware ofemigration. There are allegations of corruption. The prime minister’s son-in-law, as well as a narrow coterie of ministers and businessmen connected to Fidesz stand accused of diverting public funds. Orban’s son-in-law denies any wrongdoing. OLAF, the EU anti-corruption watchdog, is investigating alleged irregularities in contracts for the street-lighting of 39 towns. The most radical action the EU could take would be to suspend all payments until investigations are completed. In the spring of 1986 a new sound could be heard in the secondary schools and libraries of Hungary - the whirr and clunk of photocopiers. The Hungarian-born financier and philanthropist George Soros, who made a spectacular fortune after emigrating to the US, donated hundreds of them. George Soros, pictured in 1991 It was about more than education. While teachers could copy pages for their classes, pupils could mass produce subversive pamphlets. The young radicals around Viktor Orban were among the first to take advantage. And that wasn’t the last time Orban benefited from the largesse of George Soros. The billionaire set up the first branch of his Open Society organisation in Budapest in the 1980s to support dissident groups. He also handed out scholarships liberally to a new generation of bright students. In October 1989 Orban went to Pembroke College, Oxford,on a Soros scholarship. From there, he watched the revolutions unfolding across Eastern Europe in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania, then broke off his studies to hurry home to Budapest, to make sure he was in the front row of his own. Then Orban was happy to accept support from Soros. Thirty years later he takes a very different view. The Berlin Wall falls, 1989 Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been targeted by the Fidesz government. They depend on contributions from philanthropic organisations like the Open Society Foundations. These NGOs include Transparency International which examines state corruption, and the Helsinki Committee, which provides legal aid to the small number of people who still seek asylum in Hungary. 2018: A Fidesz election poster shows opposition leaders alongside George Soros, tearing down Hungary's border fence Soros’s support for groups like these has angered Orban. In 2017, giant posters went up across the country, with a grinning Soros and the words “don’t let Soros have the last laugh”. “National consultations” were launched, with questionnaires sent to all households in the country, blaming Soros and the groups which his foundations support for mass immigration to Europe. George Soros was long silent but he hit back in June 2017 in a speech in Brussels. Soros in Brussels, 2017 “I admire the courageous way Hungarians have resisted the deception and corruption of the mafia state Orban has established.” He praised the European Commission for taking action against Orban. As well as the NGOs, a Budapest-based university became a symbol of the battle between the two men. A new law restricting foreign universities was seen as an attack on the Central European University (CEU), part-funded by Soros. Fidesz officials took to calling it the “Soros university”. After protests and international criticism, the fate of the university still hangs in the balance. Those working in critical NGOs have been referred to as “the Soros mercenaries” in the government-controlled media. “Soros is one of the most dangerous people in the world,” Andras Bencsik, editor-in-chief of the weekly Magyar Demokrata, and organiser of large pro-Fidesz rallies tells me. “Soros has caused bigger damage to civilisation than a world war.” A “Stop Soros” bill, as the government refers to it, has already been tabled by parliament, to be voted on after the election. It could make the work of several groups impossible. On Easter Friday Orban told state radio that his government had the names of 2,000 “Soros henchmen” and warned that they would be dealt with after he won the election. That is likely to bring him into more conflict with the European Union, and its strongest member, Germany. In November 2009, Viktor Orban paid a short visit to St Petersburg, to the congress of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia Party. It was a peculiar choice of trip for a man who had risen to fame in 1989 by telling Russian soldiers to get out of his country. But the 2008 financial crisis had shaken Orban’s trust in the Western economic model. By “turning to the east” - including Russia, China, and Turkey - he looked for new investors whose willingness to do business wouldn’t be affected by disdain for his domestic actions. Meeting in Moscow, 2010 He saw how the Germans, quick to lecture him about democratic issues, were quietly doing plenty of business with President Putin. Hungary is heavily dependent on Russian energy. Giant pipelines, built in the Soviet era, channel it into Hungary across Ukraine. Hungary’s lone Soviet-era nuclear power station at Paks on the Danube, was getting old. Orban was in the market for a brand new nuclear power station, Paks 2, and Putin was keen to sell. Orban went to Moscow and signed the contract, despite studies suggesting that nuclear power would cost three times more than electricity bought from the European grid. The Russians will both build and finance it via a massive loan. Full details of the contract were made secret by the Hungarian parliament for 30 years. At about the same time, Orban agreed with the Russians to extend a 20-year gas deal, due to expire in 2016, on favourable terms. “The prime minister’s strategy is to keep equal distance between two bears, the Russians and the Germans,” a close political ally of Orban tells me. “He sees the tragedies of Hungarian history stemming from being too close to one or the other. But Orban is not Putin’s puppet. In fact, Orban thinks he can manipulate Putin.” Hungary’s economic fortunes are deeply intertwined with those of Germany. A quarter of Hungarian exports go to Germany, and 300,000 people work for German companies. The car industry alone provides 175,000 jobs in Hungary. 2012: Orban opens a Hungarian factory for the German car manufacturer Daimler Relations with Angela Merkel have cooled noticeably since her last visit to Budapest in February 2015. Since then, Orban has preferred to develop his contacts with German companies based in Hungary, andwith individual German statesrather than the federal government. He wanted “more understanding, a more business-oriented focus, and less criticism on human rights and political issues,” said Milan Nic, an analyst with the German Council on Foreign Relations. Angela Merkel is said to distrust Orban Even before the 2015 refugee crisis Angela Merkel regarded Viktor Orban as “a dangerous man”. Orban’s support for Merkel’s critics in the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - the sister party of her Christian Democratic Union - did nothing to improve their relations. German diplomatic sources say Merkel now refuses to even pick up the phone if Orban rings. This is fiercely denied by Hungarian diplomats. Hungary’s loyalty to the EU and Nato, they say, is proven by Hungary’s decision to expel a Russian diplomat over the recent Skripal poisoning affair in the UK. “There are other ways of showing solidarity with our European partners than taking in migrants,” says a senior government source, “for example by building fences to strengthen the outer borders of the EU.” Senior politicians from Germany’s CSU have pressed Hungary to compromise on migration. Part of the solution could be financial - countries that refuse asylum seekers, like Hungary, might give money to front-line states like Greece and Italy. Another option would be for Hungary to accept voluntary - not compulsory - quotas. But there are no signs yet of Orban backing down. Orban insists that the EU pay at least half his €800m (£700m) bill for building and defending the fence on the border with Serbia. Before Britain voted to leave the EU, Orban counted on it as a counterweight to French and German designs to create a stronger, deeper union. Now he relies on the four Visegrad Group countries - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - to act as a counterweight, a champion of national sovereignty, in the east of the EU. 2016: Orban with fellow leaders of the Visegrad Group of countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) There is no European identity, Orban says, contradicting the assertions of German, as well as French leaders. But there is a central European one - between the two bears of Russia and Germany. “What I admire most in Viktor Orban,” says his loyal champion, the journalist Andras Bencsik, “is his ability to predict the future.” Bencsik compares him to a chess grandmaster who can see 25 moves in advance. Viktor Orban has promised “a settling of accounts” after the election with those who mocked, criticised, or tried to undermine his rule. “Political, moral and legal” retribution will follow, he told a rally of 100,000 supporters. Every Wednesday, Viktor Orban holds a cabinet meeting. Thursday is his reading day. The Israeli author Yuval Noah Hariri’s Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind is a recent favourite. Target Hungary by the British-based sociologist Frank Furedi is another. Boston Politics, by Thilo Schabert, a third. Natural Right and History, by the German Jewish emigre Leo Strauss, whose thinking strongly influenced a generation of Republican politicians in the US, is the latest addition to his coffee table. What the books have in common is a pessimism about the future of Western liberal civilisation, and a fondness for strong leaders, rather than strong institutions. “Orban concentrates harder than he used to, he’s not as jovial, as easy going as he was,” says Bencsik. “Those who call him ‘Machiavellian’ are mistaking that ability to concentrate, for something else.” Budapest is a small city, and almost every year I bump into the prime minister, purely by accident. I was sitting in a cafe on Normafa, a popular hill overlooking Budapest, when Orban walked in without a bodyguard, looking for a table. I greeted him and he replied: “Hello Nick. Are you still alive?” Not the friendliest greeting, but I let it pass. We shook hands. His handshake is no longer firm, I noticed. In just the past four years he has put on a lot of weight. I asked him about Hodmezovasarhely, where a recent by-election saw an independent candidate defeat the Fidesz favourite by gathering the entire anti-Fidesz vote behind him. “It will certainly change the dynamic of the campaign,” he admitted. But to the surprise of even his supporters, the Fidesz campaign focused on the “threat of migration”, instead of the economic achievements of his government. Orban appeared rattled. March 2018: Opposition activists at an election rally for the Socialist Party (MSZP) “Orban runs the country like a city, in which he has a million workers,” says Sandor Csintalan, a friend of Orban’s former ally Lajos Simicska, who is now one of his chief foes. “If he wins again, the only way he can keep power is more autocracy. You cannot consolidate a system like this, because only fear and feudal relations hold it together.” Viktor Orban has stamped his own personality on the map of Europe. He is admired across the world by people who want to defend national sovereignty from globalisation. But how will history judge him? It depends whether he ends up on the winning or the losing side. If the Visegrad 4 countries grow stronger, as a counterweight to Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel’s visions of Europe, he will feel reassured. If his critics concede that he was right to identify migration as the “curse” of this age, he will claim victory. But if future EU funds are linked to respect for European values, or if the Hungarian public grow weary of his authoritarian style, Viktor Orban will be left out in the cold. Built with Shorthand"
