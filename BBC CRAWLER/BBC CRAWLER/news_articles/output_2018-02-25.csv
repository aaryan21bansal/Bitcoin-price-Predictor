Turkish women face death for IS links,"Hundreds of women have been detained on suspicion of being IS fighters' relatives An Iraqi court has sentenced at least 15 Turkish women to death by hanging, after they were found guilty of joining the Islamic State group (IS). Some reports say 16 women were handed the death penalty, while others say one was jailed for life. The women confessed to marrying IS fighters or providing the group ""with logistical aid or helping them carry out terrorist attacks"", the judge said. Thousands of foreigners have fought and died for IS in Iraq and Syria. The Iraqi government declared its war against the group over in December. While IS has been driven from its major strongholds, militants have continued to carry out suicide bombings and other attacks. How Iraqi courts deal with IS suspects What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? The women, said to be aged between 20 and 50, appeared dressed in black at the central criminal court in Baghdad on Sunday. Four had young children with them. One told the judge that she had fought Iraqi troops alongside the militants, an official said. At least 560 women and 600 children have been detained in Iraq on suspicion of being jihadists or IS fighters' relatives, AFP news agency reports. Hundreds are now being put on trial. In Januarya German woman captured during the 2017 battle for Mosul was sentenced to death for joining IS. She was accused of taking part in attacks on Iraqi security forces. Earlier this month a Turkish woman was also condemned to die, and 10 others sentenced to life imprisonment.

Lawyers for the women jailed for life had argued that they were tricked or coerced into travelling into IS territory, according to a courtroom observer. The rise and fall of IS Which countries have fleeing IS fighters gone to? The women now have a month to appeal.

Labour customs union shift confirmed,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We've long championed being in a customs union with the EU"" Jeremy Corbyn is to confirm a shift in the Labour Party's position on remaining in the customs union after Brexit, Sir Keir Starmer has indicated. The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour's front bench was ""unanimous"" in its backing for striking a new deal with the EU after Brexit. The UK would leave the customs union but then negotiate a treaty that will ""do the work of the customs union"". But Liam Fox said Labour's position did not make sense. Analysis: Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' What's the difference between single market and customs union? The international trade secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union. What does that mean? ""Is it like Turkey, which has a customs union but only in goods, not in agriculture, not in services, not in finance? Is that what we want for Britain? Will we take rules in certain sectors but not in others?"" Sir Keir also warned Prime Minister Theresa May ""crunch time"" was coming, as MPs geared up to vote on her policy of staying out of the customs union when the UK leaves the EU next March so that the UK can strike its own trade deals. Labour leader Mr Corbyn is due to make a speech on Monday setting out his party's position. Labour has previously said it wants the UK to retain the ""benefits"" of the customs union and the single market without saying how that would be achieved. Sir Keir said being in a customs union permanently was the ""the only way realistically to get tariff free access,"" which was ""really important for our manufacturing base"" and the only way to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works ""jointly with the EU"", adding: ""We all want to do bold new trade agreements but we would be better off doing that with the EU."" Anna Soubry: Ready to call off revolt? By BBC Political Correspondent Emma Vardy Labour's efforts to persuade Conservative rebels to side with them are set to intensify. Now that Labour appears to have come down firmly on the side of a softer Brexit, after months of hedging its bets, there's a renewed focus at Westminster on whether Tory rebels can defeat Theresa May and keep the UK in the customs union. On paper, there would appear to be the numbers for pro-EU Conservative MPs to side with Labour (and the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party) to overturn Theresa May's majority. But Conservative rebels would need nerves of steel to torpedo the PM's whole Brexit strategy. It could pave the way to another general election, which might just deliver a Labour government. The PM is hoping she can say enough this week to keep the Remainers on side, but the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit expected in the autumn looms ever larger. Mr Fox has said the UK can only strike its own trade deals if it is not part of a customs union - and he told Andrew Marr his department was working with ""21 different countries"" to get agreements in place that could be signed as soon as the UK leaves. He said Mrs May would be setting out what the cabinet had agreed on the UK's future economic relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday, in the north-east of England. And he urged Remain-supporting Tory MPs, who are threatening to derail the prime minister's plan to leave the customs union, to have an ""an open mind"" and listen to what she had to say, which would ""deal with a lot of the reservations that they have"". This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union, what does that mean?"" The Labour leadership is under pressure from some of their own MPs to join forces with Conservative rebels and the Lib Dems to back an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently making its way through Parliament, to stay in a customs union. Mr Fox said a vote on the bill, which had been due to take place next week, had been delayed because ""we want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument before we take the bill forward"". Sir Keir said the Labour leadership had not yet decided to back the rebel Tory amendments but claimed they were similar to ones that had been tabled by the Labour front bench. He said Mrs May did not have a majority in Parliament for staying out of a customs union and she would face a ""crunch"" vote ""sooner rather than later"" - although he denied Labour was engaged in a cynical attempt to remove her from office and force a general election. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith warned would-be Tory rebels Tory rebel Anna Soubry suggested she was ready to pull back if Mrs May announced measures that would amount to a customs agreement on Friday, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's absolutely beholden now on the government to get itself in the right place."" In his speech on Monday, Mr Corbyn will say the EU ""is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems,"" adding: ""Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations."" More than 80 senior figures in the Labour Party have, meanwhile, urged Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the EU single market after Brexit. This video can not be played Labour MPs clash over party's Brexit policy In a statement seen by the Observer,external, figures including Lord Mandelson, pro-European backbencher Chuka Umunna, former leader Lord Kinnock, and trade union leaders said the party as a minimum ""must clearly and unambiguously"" set out to remain part of the European economic area. Although they regard Mr Corbyn's expected commitment on Monday as a ""step forward"", they said this falls ""way short"" of where Labour should be on Brexit. Mr Umunna warned leaving the single market and customs union would ""torpedo"" Labour's anti-austerity and industrial investment plans.

Leicester blast triggers police alert,"This video can not be played BBC journalist John Alexander: ""Debris and rubble has blown across four lanes of traffic."" Six people have been taken to hospital after an explosion destroyed a shop in Leicester. Police declared a ""major incident"" after reports of a blast in Hinckley Road just after 19:00 GMT on Sunday. A police spokesman said: ""At this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related."" Two of the six in hospital are in critical condition and the others are ""walking wounded"", said the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. Carlisle Street and part of Hinckley Road have been closed and people are being asked to avoid the area. Electricity has been cut off for a number of properties. Emergency services remain at the scene and Leicestershire Police said the ""search and rescue operation"" would continue throughout Monday. Crews are searching through debris strewn across Hinckley Road Angel Namaala lives opposite the shop and told the BBC she heard ""this big thud, like an earthquake"". She said: ""The building had gone down and people were trying to help where they could by taking the bricks off. But the fire was getting bigger and bigger so people were told to leave the scene."" She said she and others helped a boy, believed to be aged about 15, who was hurt in the blast. ""He was in there when it happened. I think he was in the flat above the shop. We were keeping him warm and assuring him he'd be OK and the ambulance would be there,"" she added. ""Someone was with him already bringing him to the road so I stopped and gave him my coat. And other neighbours gave him blankets to cover himself."" Police said neighbouring buildings in Hinckley Road were damaged as a result of the blast Six fire engines were sent to the scene and a fire service spokeswoman said the property was a two-floor building with a loft conversion that had suffered a ""pancake collapse"". Leicestershire Police said: ""The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service."" Allow Twitter content?

All of the casualties have been taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary and people have been asked not to attend A&E unless ""absolutely necessary"". Witnesses said the shop was formerly a Londis but recently became a Polish supermarket. Looking down Hinckley Road, past the cordon, there's a smoking gap where the shop once stood. It exploded with such force that glass and debris were scattered across all four lanes of the dual carriageway. It's a few hours since the blast, but the air is still thick with smoke. Earlier, dozens of onlookers gathered - many with scarves over their mouths, or jumpers pulled up, to avoid breathing in fumes. Witnesses said the destroyed shop had flats above it, and at least one of those injured is thought to have been a resident. BBC journalist John Alexander said the emergency services had cordoned off about 60 houses in the area. ""I live about 80 yards away from where it happened,"" he said. ""I felt a tremor, what felt like an earthquake shock and I heard a very low boom that sounded like a very, very fast release of pressure. ""I thought my house was going to fall down on top of me and all my neighbours have said the same thing."" The fire service said its teams are working in ""tough conditions"" Harish Pattni was in a pizza shop six doors down when the explosion happened. He said: ""I've never experienced anything like this. It sounded like those big, loud boom speakers that people have in their cars, real vibration. The bass sound was so loud that it shattered the car windows. ""The flames started more or less upstairs so I thought it must be something to do with upstairs, the flats. ""My immediate worry was when I saw the floorboards, all the wood on the floor level, I thought there must be people in the shop trapped."" Allow Twitter content?

Minister rules out customs union,"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt tells Today the government has ruled out staying in a customs union after Brexit Jeremy Hunt has said there is no possibility of the government backing a customs union with the EU after Brexit. The health secretary said the UK wanted ""frictionless trade"" but would ""find a different way"" to achieve that. Tory rebels are attempting to force the government to keep the option of a customs union with the EU on the table and have some cross-party support. Theresa May will make a speech on the UK's future relationship with the EU next Friday. And Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to outline Labour policy on a customs union on Monday, amid reports that his party's position on it is ""evolving"". EU leaders split on spending after Brexit Laura Kuenssberg - a happy ending? The customs union explained in 45 seconds Labour's policy 'evolves' on customs union If he backs membership of a customs union, it could mean Mrs May faces a Commons showdown over the issue - with pro-European Conservative rebels joining forces with Labour MPs. Conservative MP Anna Soubry says there is cross-party support for an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently going through Parliament, urging the government to pursue as a negotiating objective forming a customs union after Brexit. This video can not be played Tony Blair calls for a second referendum A customs union means countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union - but it does not allow members to strike their own trade deals. Supporters of the UK being in a customs union argue it is vital to protect businesses - but opponents fear it would mean ""Brexit in name only"" and the UK should make its own arrangements. Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a customs union was ""one way of getting frictionless trade but it is not the only way"". The government wanted to agree ""frictionless trade by agreement between two sovereign bodies, the United Kingdom and the European Union"", he said. Asked if there was any possibility of the government coming round to the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit, he replied: ""No"". The cabinet's Brexit sub-committee discussed the government's approach for eight hours at Chequers on Thursday The health secretary was not at the meeting of senior ministers at Chequers on Thursday but said a broad agreement had been reached ahead of a discussion by the whole cabinet and the prime minister's speech next Friday. Despite ""divergent views"" there was a  ""central common understanding is that there will be areas and sectors of industry where we agree to align our regulations with European regulations, such as the automotive industry. ""But it will be on a voluntary basis, we will as a sovereign power have the right to choose to diverge, and what we won't be doing is accepting changes in rules because the EU unilaterally chooses to make those changes,"" said Mr Hunt. But pro-EU Labour backbencher Chuka Umunna - an ally of Anna Soubry - warned Theresa May her plan to leave the customs union could be defeated by MPs. ""If they are not going to change their position they are going to lose votes in the House of Commons, it's a straightforward as that."" Former prime minister Tony Blair said if there was an ""impasse"" in Parliament on the customs union issue, it made the case stronger for a referendum on the final Brexit deal - something dismissed by Labour Brexiteer Kate Hoey as ""ridiculous"". He said a customs union would mitigate the problems of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In an articleon his website,external, he attacked those politicians who, he said, were ""prepared to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement on the altar of Brexit and declare that the peace agreed in Northern Ireland is not, really, worth having anyway"". ""This is irresponsibility that is frankly sickening,"" he said. Mrs May will meet European Council President Donald Tusk in London on Thursday, the day before her speech. Meanwhilethe Times has reported,externalthat the prime minister is planning a U-turn over the right of EU citizens who arrive in the UK after Brexit, but during the ""transition period"", to remain in the country permanently. Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC that would be ""quite wrong"": ""I'd be astonished if Mrs May would make U-turn of that kind; she is a lady of great backbone and for her to kowtow to the European Union is, I think, unconscionable.""

Freezing temperatures set to hit UK,"This video can not be played Heavy snow and freezing winds are forecast for Tuesday Snow is falling across parts of the UK as very cold air sweeps in from Russia. Heavy snow is expected across southern and eastern England overnight on Monday - with warnings extending into the Midlands, Scotland and Wales on Tuesday morning. Many areas have been hit by freezing temperatures, with a wind chill making it feel like -15C in some places. Rail firms have warned of disruption, with many planning to run a reduced service overnight and on Tuesday. A snow emergency was declared in Kentand the council urged people not to contact it unless there is an emergency. Heavy snow is forecast for much of Yorkshire, Teesside, Durham and Newcastle in the early hours of Tuesday morning, which is likely to cause delays on the roads, the Met Office said. A warning is also in place for London and parts of the South East on Tuesday, with the possibility of delays and cancellations on travel networks as well as power cuts in rural areas. Snow warnings have been issued forthe whole of Wales, with temperatures expected to fall to -5C, the Met Office says. The Met Office,externalhas both yellow warnings and more serious amber warnings - meaning there is a potential risk to life and property - for large parts of the UK for the rest of the week.

Scotland is expected to have between 5cm (2ins) 10and 10cm (4ins) of snow on Wednesday. The Met Office is predicting that some roads may become impassable and vehicles may be stranded. BBC Weather has warned of possibly hazardous conditions in southern England later in the week as a low pressure weather system moves up from the Bay of Biscay and hits the already ""exceptionally cold air"". Alina Jenkins, from the BBC's Weather service, said: ""Any precipitation will turn readily to snow, and with bitterly cold strong to gale force easterly winds, blizzards are likely."" Met Office meteorologist Charlie Powell said: ""Unusually for Britain, the snow is going to be quite dry, so it will blow around and gather in drifts and we could see some blizzard conditions."" He added that while he did not want to alarm people, the Met Office was urging people to be prepared for the so-called ""beast from the East"". Parts of the UK will feel as cold as Norway and Iceland.

North Korea 'willing to hold US talks',"The North Korean general and Ivanka Trump cheered from the same stand - but are not expected to meet The United States says any dialogue with North Korea must have nuclear disarmament as the end goal. The North indicated on the last day of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang it was ready for talks, according to South Korea. North Korea has previously said it will not accept any preconditions. ""We will see if Pyongyang's message... that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization,"" the US said. Reports about the North's willingness to speak to the US emerged after a meeting of its officials with the South Korean president before the Games' closing ceremony on Sunday. North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka also attended the ceremony but she is not expected to talk with any North Koreans, even though she sat a few feet from their main envoy, Gen Kim Yong-chol, at the Olympic Stadium. North Korea was ""very willing"" to hold talks with the US, said the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It added that the North had ""agreed that inter-Korea talks and North-US relations should improve together"". The revelation from the South Korean presidency came hours after a furious statement from the North that describedfresh sanctions announced by Washingtonas ""an act of war"". Pyongyang's foreign ministry praised the way the two Koreas had co-operated together during the Olympics but said the US had ""brought the threat of war to the Korean peninsula with large-scale new sanctions"". The Korean peninsula has been divided since the 1950-53 war and the two sides have never signed a peace treaty. The rapprochement between the two Koreas has been seen as a move by the North to drive a wedge between the South and the US. Experts have cautioned that the latest developments do not put an end to underlying regional tensions, particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. South Korean media is abuzz with suggestions that North-US talks could still take place while the respective delegations are in town. The BBC's Laura Bicker, in Pyeongchang, asked an official from South's government if the meeting could take place in the next two days, and the answer was: ""We will see."" Mike Pence was seated directly in front of the North Korean delegation at the opening ceremony North Korea has sent an eight-person team across the border, including Gen Kim Choe Kang-il, a senior diplomat handling North American affairs. Meanwhile, Allison Hooker - a Koreas specialist from the US National Security Council - is part of the US delegation. She met Gen Kim in 2014 in North Korea, as the US tried to free two American detainees. The scene could be set for a more low-key meeting than a failed attempt with US Vice-President Mike Pence. He had been set to meet Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean President Kim Jong-un, at the start of the Games but the meeting was cancelled inexplicably by the North Koreans, according to the US officials.

British skier killed in Alps cliff fall,"A British skier has fallen to his death in the French Alps, authorities have confirmed. The man - part of a trio who went off-piste in the Alpe d'Huez ski resort - fell from what a mountain rescue spokesperson described as a cliff. A second skier who fell was injured in the ""steep and icy"" conditions, but survived. The third was unharmed and both men were rescued. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. In a statement confirming the death, it added: ""We remain in close contact with local authorities. Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time."" Francois Bepol, a spokesperson at the gendarme mountain rescue unit in Grenoble, said the trio got into difficulty after going the wrong way and taking off their skis in an attempt to climb upwards. The accidentfollows the death of 12-year-old French boywho also died after falling from a cliff in the French Alps on Saturday, while his 10-year-old brother survived. The siblings, who were on a skiing holiday near the Avoriaz ski resort, went down a mountain and strayed off-piste for an unknown reason.

"Breaking|Breaking newsLeicester blast triggers police alertPolice declare a ""major incident"" after reports of an explosion in the Hinckley Road area of Leicester.7m7 minutes agoUK","This video can not be played BBC journalist John Alexander: ""Debris and rubble has blown across four lanes of traffic."" Six people have been taken to hospital after an explosion destroyed a shop in Leicester. Police declared a ""major incident"" after reports of a blast in Hinckley Road just after 19:00 GMT on Sunday. A police spokesman said: ""At this stage there is no indication this is terrorist related."" Two of the six in hospital are in critical condition and the others are ""walking wounded"", said the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. Carlisle Street and part of Hinckley Road have been closed and people are being asked to avoid the area. Electricity has been cut off for a number of properties. Emergency services remain at the scene and Leicestershire Police said the ""search and rescue operation"" would continue throughout Monday. Crews are searching through debris strewn across Hinckley Road Angel Namaala lives opposite the shop and told the BBC she heard ""this big thud, like an earthquake"". She said: ""The building had gone down and people were trying to help where they could by taking the bricks off. But the fire was getting bigger and bigger so people were told to leave the scene."" She said she and others helped a boy, believed to be aged about 15, who was hurt in the blast. ""He was in there when it happened. I think he was in the flat above the shop. We were keeping him warm and assuring him he'd be OK and the ambulance would be there,"" she added. ""Someone was with him already bringing him to the road so I stopped and gave him my coat. And other neighbours gave him blankets to cover himself."" Police said neighbouring buildings in Hinckley Road were damaged as a result of the blast Six fire engines were sent to the scene and a fire service spokeswoman said the property was a two-floor building with a loft conversion that had suffered a ""pancake collapse"". Leicestershire Police said: ""The cause of the explosion will be the subject of a joint investigation by the police and Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service."" Allow Twitter content?

All of the casualties have been taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary and people have been asked not to attend A&E unless ""absolutely necessary"". Witnesses said the shop was formerly a Londis but recently became a Polish supermarket. Looking down Hinckley Road, past the cordon, there's a smoking gap where the shop once stood. It exploded with such force that glass and debris were scattered across all four lanes of the dual carriageway. It's a few hours since the blast, but the air is still thick with smoke. Earlier, dozens of onlookers gathered - many with scarves over their mouths, or jumpers pulled up, to avoid breathing in fumes. Witnesses said the destroyed shop had flats above it, and at least one of those injured is thought to have been a resident. BBC journalist John Alexander said the emergency services had cordoned off about 60 houses in the area. ""I live about 80 yards away from where it happened,"" he said. ""I felt a tremor, what felt like an earthquake shock and I heard a very low boom that sounded like a very, very fast release of pressure. ""I thought my house was going to fall down on top of me and all my neighbours have said the same thing."" The fire service said its teams are working in ""tough conditions"" Harish Pattni was in a pizza shop six doors down when the explosion happened. He said: ""I've never experienced anything like this. It sounded like those big, loud boom speakers that people have in their cars, real vibration. The bass sound was so loud that it shattered the car windows. ""The flames started more or less upstairs so I thought it must be something to do with upstairs, the flats. ""My immediate worry was when I saw the floorboards, all the wood on the floor level, I thought there must be people in the shop trapped."" Allow Twitter content?

Samsung's new phone focuses on camera tricks,"This video can not be played WATCH: Spencer Kelly gets hands on with the Galaxy S9 New and improved camera capabilities are the main thrust of Samsung's pitch for its latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S9 and larger S9+. The handsets gain a super-slow-motion facility designed to make it easy to extend key moments of action. They also gain a type of lens that should improve low-light photography. Samsung's sales rose in 2017 but not as fast as those of many Chinese rivals. Experts suggest the new facilities represent minor upgrades. That may make marketing the S9 a challenge since the phone's design also strongly resembles that of the existing S8. Slightly smaller bezels at the top and bottom and a new position for the fingerprint sensor are the biggest alterations. The S9+ is only a little more distinct from the S8+. It now features two camera lenses on its rear, providing different fields of view and allowing photo backgrounds to be digitally blurred. The S9 can automatically design an avatar or emoji for users ""I'm not sure if the improvements will be enough to make people rush and upgrade,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at market research firm IDC. ""The quality of the camera is a purchasing driver for many consumers, and Samsung's does appear better than [Google's] Pixel 2. ""But I was expecting to see more development around its intelligence - it still relies on the cloud, meaning you need to be connected to the net to do live translations, for instance."" By contrast, he added, Huawei's latest phones can translate words they are shown while offline thanks to their useof a new chip technology,external. Source: IDC Samsung held its launch on the eve of the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona. It has priced the S9 at Â£739/$720/849 euros and the S9+ at Â£869/$840/949 euros. That represents 50 euros more than their predecessors but less than Apple's iPhone X. The biggest hardware change to the S9's camera is that it now features a variable aperture, with a choice of two settings. Nokia reveals 'unbendable' 8 Sirocco and Matrix 8110 MWC: Why do smartphones look so alike? At its widest setting it allows in more light, which can be helpful in dim conditions, but at a cost of having shallower focus. It is not the first handset-maker to do this. Nokia offered a similar technology in its N86 phone in 2009, but the innovation failed to catch on. To further improve low-light imagery the S9 now takes 12 images in quick succession to help detect and remove noise - the S8 took three. But its standout feature is the capacity to slow down video while keeping it in high-definition resolutions: 960 frames per second in 720p and 480fps in 1080p. The slow motion videos can be turned into Gifs and also be placed on the phone's lock screen Sony's Xperia XZ Premium phone added a similar feature last year, but Samsung says its version is ""more usable"". In both cases, owners must determine, at point of capture, the 0.2 seconds that get turned into six seconds of footage, at the slowest setting.This can be a challenge to get right. While Sony relies on users pressing a button at exactly the right moment, Samsung's S9 auto-triggers the function when motion is detected in a chosen part of the screen. Other camera-related innovations include the introduction of AR Emojis. Samsung's latest phone has a camera that adapts to different light levels These are animated cartoons created from facial scans of the owners that then mimic their expressions. They are similar in concept to Apple's animal-based Animojis, but Samsung suggests its version is more ""personal"". The Bixby Vision image-recognition app gains the ability to identify foods the camera is pointed at and estimate their calorie content. And the phone now combines data from its iris and facial-recognition systems to improve their reliability. Samsung, however, declined to provide a failure rate to permit a comparison with Apple'sone-in-a-million statistic,externalfor its Face ID facility. IHS Technology's Ian Fogg said the risk for Samsung was that if consumers do not view the new features as a huge leap forward, they might prefer to wait to see what the S10 offers. ""The typical Samsung upgrader probably has an S6 or S7,"" he explained ""Samsung has delivered significant incentives to upgrade with the improved camera and the larger display, compared with the older phones. ""But the problem is that those handsets from two to three years ago are still very usable and will still feel pretty good to many."" Rory was not convinced his AR Emoji was a great likeness How keen are you to see the world in ultra slooooooow motion or to have an animated emoji that looks just like you? Samsung is betting that these are not niche interests and will spark a rush to upgrade, particularly amongst those people whose phones are a couple of years old. In truth, the Galaxy S9 feels like an incremental improvement on last year's S8 - the screen stretches a bit further in the same space, the sound system is louder, which means more anti-social noise in public places, and Samsung's underwhelming Bixby assistant has got a bit smarter at reading foreign menus. To be fair, smartphones like the Galaxy are already brilliant computers delivering extraordinary performance on the move - and making new models stand out from the crowd is a struggle for all manufacturers. It is a good bet that the S9 will sell very well indeed and put another rocket under Samsung's profits - it just isn't going to make jaded phone-buyers go ""wow!""

GB winter sport 'going in right direction',"This video can not be played Team GB's Winter Olympians return home Great Britain's record medal haul at Pyeongchang 2018 shows winter sport in the country is ""going in the right direction"", said the team's chef de mission as the Games ended on Sunday. Team GB won five medals in South Korea, surpassing the previous record of four and meeting their pre-Olympics target. It came on the back of Â£28.35m funding from UK Sport. ""These athletes can rightly return home very proud of what they accomplished here in South Korea,"" said Mike Hay. Lizzy Yarnold defended her skeleton title to win Britain's only gold, while Dom Parsons and Laura Deas took bronze in the same sport. Izzy Atkin was also third in the ski slopestyle and Billy Morgan claimed a surprise bronze in the big air competition. ""To leave Pyeongchang with five medals - our best ever Games in that respect - and a host of fourth-place finishes and top 10s across the sports shows that winter sport in the United Kingdom is going in the right direction,"" added Hay. Read more: How a nation of 5.2 million topped the world Nine unlikely stars of the Winter Olympics Chair of UK Sport Dame Katherine Grainger said Team GB did ""a brilliant job"". ""We have seen two weeks of phenomenal sport, there is a real interest from the British public and people do like to see us successful,"" Grainger told BBC Sport. ""A lot of investment has gone in and there is a criticism over whether we are giving too much. ""What does everyone want? What is best for the country? There is an amazing reaction from people who see the Olympic Games - people get very engaged, united and inspired by it, go and do activities because of it. ""When you try and put a number on 'is it worth the values we see', it's so much more complicated than 'that medal cost that much' or otherwise. It's buying into a huge system of sport across many countries."" South Korea and North Korea marched together at the Winter Olympics closing ceremony After the awarding of 102 gold medals in 15 sports across 16 days, nearly 3,000 athletes from 92 countries marched into the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, greeted by colourful light shows and South Korean music, for Sunday's closing ceremony. South Korean president Moon Jae-in and Ivanka Trump, the daughter of US president Donald Trump, were in attendance, as was General Kim Yong-chol, the head of North Korea's delegation. As they did in the opening ceremony, and following the entry of a unified Korean women's ice hockey team, South and North Korean athletes marched together at the closing ceremony. ""With your joint march, you have shared your faith in a peaceful future with all of us,"" said Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). ""You have shown how sport brings people together in our fragile world; you have shown how sport builds bridges. The IOC will continue this Olympic dialogue, even after we extinguish the Olympic flame. ""In this, we are driven by our faith in the future."" Nine unlikely stars of Pyeongchang 2018 This video can not be played Golden goal, bobsleigh drama & funny moments It was a Games that featured new events in big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, mass start speed skating and mixed team alpine skiing, as well as competitors for the first time from countries such as Nigeria, Kosovo and Ecuador. Bach said Pyeongchang was a ""Games of new horizons"", as a number of delegates joined him on stage - including Tongan cross country skier Pita Taufatofua and American Lindsey Vonn. ""These Olympic Winter Games have introduced new events that appeal to new generations,"" added the IOC president. ""We have brought together a record number of National Olympic Committees to participate. ""We are embracing these new horizons. We offer our hand to everybody to join forces in this faith in the future."" The Winter Paralympics begin in South Korea on 9 March. Four-time Olympic rowing champion Sir Matthew Pinsent on BBC TV I think Korea have done amazingly well. I think the re-unification idea was great and well executed. It was such a cherished part of their bid. An idea that for 16 days they would join - North and South - and it has come to fruition. If there's anything to take from these Games, that will be it. This video can not be played Morgan's dramatic big air bronze Britain surpassed their efforts at Sochi 2014 and Chamonix 1924, with snowboarder Morgan - whowas Team GB's flag bearerat the closing ceremony - clinching the record-breaking British medal. Team GB's chef de mission Hay said, as well as the medallists, British athletes had shown their potential to compete in four years' time at the Beijing Games. ""Five medals is a great haul for us,"" he told BBC Sport. ""There have been a number of close shaves with a few fourth places and a number of top 10s - but actually that's really encouraging. ""It's not all about medals. Obviously it's a benchmark and people will judge us on that, but it's about looking at people to do personal bests and youngsters to come through and see the potential for Beijing."" Hay tipped the men's curling team, who finished fifth, and 21-year-old alpine skier Laurie Taylor as ""ones for the future"". However, with the women's curling team narrowly missing out on a bronze, that sport failed to secure the minimum target of one medal set by UK Sport. Elise Christie was tipped to collect at least the one medal minimum set for Britain in the short track speed skating, but the triple world champion fell in the 500m final and 1500m semi-finals, and was disqualified from the 1,000m heats. Meanwhile, on the back of Â£5m funding, the men's four-man bobsleigh team missed their minimum target of a fifth-placed finishto come 17th and 18th.

It said one child had died. Eastern Ghouta resident Mohammed Adel said one of his colleagues had visited the hospital and said the child - a boy - had ""suffocated from the chemical attack"".

The man - part of a trio who went off-piste in the Alpe d'Huez ski resort - fell from what a mountain rescue spokesperson described as a cliff. A second skier who fell was injured in the ""steep and icy"" conditions, but survived. The third was unharmed and both men were rescued. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. In a statement confirming the death, it added: ""We remain in close contact with local authorities. Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time."" Francois Bepol, a spokesperson at the gendarme mountain rescue unit in Grenoble, said the trio got into difficulty after going the wrong way and taking off their skis in an attempt to climb upwards. The accidentfollows the death of 12-year-old French boywho also died after falling from a cliff in the French Alps on Saturday, while his 10-year-old brother survived. The siblings, who were on a skiing holiday near the Avoriaz ski resort, went down a mountain and strayed off-piste for an unknown reason.

"Freebirth data 'should be collected'A woman tells of her choice to give birth without medical help, but experts warn it is dangerous.9h9 hours agoSouth East Wales","This video can not be played Eleanor Horrigan described her freebirth experience as magical Data on how many women choose to give birth without medical assistance should be collected across the UK, medical associations have said. The NHS in London records how many women ""freebirth"" via a form parents can complete at itschild health hubs,external. The Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments said they had no plans to record such births. The Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists say it would be welcome. Eleanor Horrigan, 26, from Cardiff, had a freebirth five months ago and described it as a magical experience. She said she arrived at her decision because she wanted to avoid examinations and being encouraged to have medical interventions she did not want. But the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), Heads of Midwifery Wales group and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) all expressed concerns about freebirths and pointed out potential risks for both mother and baby. The Birth Trauma Association described it as ""dangerous"". But Ms Horrigan said she was completely confident in her decision and giving birth to her daughter Autumn-Violet was ""amazing"". ""With my son's birth I felt there were exams and monitoring and you were being told what to do,"" she said. ""But with her birth I felt she [the baby] was telling me what to do and that's what was so amazing about it."" Ms Horrigan said she chose a freebirth because she was afraid of medical intervention She rejected any suggestion her choice was risky, saying: ""It's down to perception of risk. ""Having somebody there to disrupt what I wanted and to disrupt what I thought I needed to keep my birth safeâ¦ I would never judge anyone else for their decisions."" Ms Horrigan had planned a home birth for her first born, now four, but had him in hospital as there were no midwives available to visit her when she went into labour. Paloma Faith on childbirth and motherhood Maternity lapses lead to mistake every five births 'Why I gave my baby another woman's breast milk' ""I was pushed into things I didn't really want and felt like my choices were taken away from me in terms of examinations and being told to push,"" she said. After having her first child she decided to train as an antenatal teacher, began working as adoula,externaland decided her next birth would be at home with only her family and her friend, a fellow doula, present. ""The plan was always to do it ourselves but I knew that if I wanted to at any point I could call a midwife but that point never came."" She has no regrets and puts her daughter's easy temperament down to her birth choice. ""She's so content and so lovely. She's had the perfect entrance to the world."" Ms Horrigan has two children aged four and five months NHS England said up to 200 women in London give birth without being registered with a GP or midwife each year. It said this data was collected via a form parents can complete through child health hubs. Freedom of information (FOI) requests to Wales' health boards revealed at least 463 women in Wales gave birth without a medic present over the past five years but it is not clear how many of those made a decision to reject medical help. The RCOG said a better understanding of the numbers of freebirths would be beneficial. ""We welcome any data collected on freebirthing across the UK to help our understanding of women's birth preferences and inform best practice,"" it said. The RCM said it would ""welcome this type of data collection"" as long as it is carried out ""in accordance with data protection laws"". But it voiced concerns about freebirthing, saying it would ""strongly discourage"" it due to the ""potential risks for both mother and baby"". ""The RCM also believes that the more we develop maternity services which enable women and midwives to get to know each other and for women to trust their midwife, the less likely women are to choose to give birth without a midwife present,"" it said. The birth of the water baby How accurate are 'due dates'? This was seconded by the Heads of Midwifery Wales group, which is made up of head midwives from each health board, who said it ""cannot recommend something that is potentially unsafe"". But the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services (Aims) supported Ms Horrigan's choice, saying: ""Trusts need to understand freebirths are legal. A freebirth is an active and positive choice."" Doula UK said it supported a ""woman's autonomy and freedom of choice"" but does not take a stand on unassisted childbirth. Maureen Treadwell, co-founder of The Birth Trauma Association, said: ""We have to raise our heads about the parapet and say it's dangerous. ""People are misled by stuff on the internet that suggests it's not dangerous but people on the internet have no responsibilities. ""If you freebirth you have to factor in you might die.""

New mother 'found bandages' in her body,"Alexandra Loredana with her baby Dominic The NHS is investigating claims by a new mother who says she found bandages in her body seven weeks after giving birth at Wexham Park Hospital, Slough. ""I took out a large piece of decomposing material from inside me that was soaked in blood,"" Alexandra Loredana told BBC News. Ms Loredana added that she had suffered from thrush and 'light vaginal wounds'. A hospital trust spokesman told the BBC: ""We are aware. We have started an investigation."" Alexandra Loredana says the bandages were inside her body seven weeks after childbirth The new mother, from Slough, Berkshire, gave birth to baby Dominic in January. Ms Loredana said she initially explained to her midwife how she felt uncomfortable going to the toilet and that something smelled terrible - her midwife checked her stitches and said 'everything was fine'. The new mother said she was unable to get an appointment with her local walk-in centre until 7 March, 2018. She said: ""For seven weeks I changed my pads more than 10 times a day. Whether I had bleeding or not I just wanted my pads to absorb the horrible smell. ""Last night I had a bath for the first time and I felt courageous enough to wash with my fingers inside my vagina to clean it. ""I was breathless when I took out a large piece of decomposing material from inside me that smelled horrible and was soaked in blood. ""How did this happen?"" Ms Loredana then went to the accident and emergency department at the same Slough hospital and saw a doctor. The NHS Foundation Trust said it would make a further statement once it had spoken to Ms Loredana and completed an investigation into the case.

New mental health helpline for troops,"A helpline to battle growing mental health problems among UK troops has been launched by the Ministry of Defence - but it is not available to veterans. The MoD has pledged Â£20m over 10 years to fund the project, which will be operated by charity Combat Stress. The service will run in conjunction with the charity'sveterans' helpline,external, which the MoD contributes to. The new helpline - 0800 323 4444 - is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. ""Mental illnesses caused by life on the battlefield can have a devastating impact on our brave heroes and their families,"" said Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson.

Cartoonist Matt 'turning into own character',"This video can not be played Matt has been amusing Telegraph readers for three decades The satirical musings of the Daily Telegraph's cartoonist have seen him turning into his own characters. It is 30 years since a chance drawing became a career for Matt Pritchett, referred to as Matt, on the front page of the newspaper every day. In an interview on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, he revealed the regular couple who appear in their armchairs in his cartoons were based on real people. But now he thinks his own character is ""the only one who speaks any sense"". Top political cartoons of the year in UK newspapers ""When I first started drawing them I thought they were fools,"" he said. ""Now of course, a bit like owners end up looking like their dogs, I have turned into them. ""I am obsessed with when my bin is going to be emptied and all the other things that obsess him."" Matt's first cartoon came the day after the Telegraph printed the wrong date on the front of the paper, telling its readers it was Thursday 25 February 1988 a day early. ""The readers were so furious that they all rang in to say they had a row in the Post Office [or had] been to a doctor's appointment that didn't happen,"" he said. ""So Max Hastings, who was the editor, had to write a front page apology and they said we need a cartoon with this. ""I was literally just standing there not doing anything so they got me to do a cartoon."" Matt's first cartoon was inspired by the wrong date on the Telegraph front page Since then, Matt has appeared as a daily fixture on the paper's front page, dealing with topics from Mad Cow Disease through to MPs' expenses. But the cartoonist does have one request for Prime Minister Theresa May, to help him along when it comes to Brexit. ""I was going through cartoons from when I started and we were all obsessed with the Maastricht treaty then, so for me it has been going on since the 1990s,"" he said. ""So I would like to ask Theresa if she could move it on a bit. I am running out of jokes about transition."" Matt has notched up some famous fans. As well as Mrs May praising him on his anniversary, he once received a letter from the Duke of Edinburgh, saying he was an avid reader of the cartoon. ""I was thrilled and touched and amazed,"" he said. ""You don't know when you are drawing them who is looking. It really was a high point."" But does Matt have any advice on being able to find humour in the news? ""I can't remember who it was that said that nothing matters very much and hardly anything matters at all,"" he said. ""But if I say that to myself five times a day, then you do think, 'let's calm down, there must be a funny side to this'.""

Freebirth data 'should be collected',"This video can not be played Eleanor Horrigan described her freebirth experience as magical Data on how many women choose to give birth without medical assistance should be collected across the UK, medical associations have said. The NHS in London records how many women ""freebirth"" via a form parents can complete at itschild health hubs,external. The Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish governments said they had no plans to record such births. The Royal College of Midwives and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists say it would be welcome. Eleanor Horrigan, 26, from Cardiff, had a freebirth five months ago and described it as a magical experience. She said she arrived at her decision because she wanted to avoid examinations and being encouraged to have medical interventions she did not want. But the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), Heads of Midwifery Wales group and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) all expressed concerns about freebirths and pointed out potential risks for both mother and baby. The Birth Trauma Association described it as ""dangerous"". But Ms Horrigan said she was completely confident in her decision and giving birth to her daughter Autumn-Violet was ""amazing"". ""With my son's birth I felt there were exams and monitoring and you were being told what to do,"" she said. ""But with her birth I felt she [the baby] was telling me what to do and that's what was so amazing about it."" Ms Horrigan said she chose a freebirth because she was afraid of medical intervention She rejected any suggestion her choice was risky, saying: ""It's down to perception of risk. ""Having somebody there to disrupt what I wanted and to disrupt what I thought I needed to keep my birth safeâ¦ I would never judge anyone else for their decisions."" Ms Horrigan had planned a home birth for her first born, now four, but had him in hospital as there were no midwives available to visit her when she went into labour. Paloma Faith on childbirth and motherhood Maternity lapses lead to mistake every five births 'Why I gave my baby another woman's breast milk' ""I was pushed into things I didn't really want and felt like my choices were taken away from me in terms of examinations and being told to push,"" she said. After having her first child she decided to train as an antenatal teacher, began working as adoula,externaland decided her next birth would be at home with only her family and her friend, a fellow doula, present. ""The plan was always to do it ourselves but I knew that if I wanted to at any point I could call a midwife but that point never came."" She has no regrets and puts her daughter's easy temperament down to her birth choice. ""She's so content and so lovely. She's had the perfect entrance to the world."" Ms Horrigan has two children aged four and five months NHS England said up to 200 women in London give birth without being registered with a GP or midwife each year. It said this data was collected via a form parents can complete through child health hubs. Freedom of information (FOI) requests to Wales' health boards revealed at least 463 women in Wales gave birth without a medic present over the past five years but it is not clear how many of those made a decision to reject medical help. The RCOG said a better understanding of the numbers of freebirths would be beneficial. ""We welcome any data collected on freebirthing across the UK to help our understanding of women's birth preferences and inform best practice,"" it said. The RCM said it would ""welcome this type of data collection"" as long as it is carried out ""in accordance with data protection laws"". But it voiced concerns about freebirthing, saying it would ""strongly discourage"" it due to the ""potential risks for both mother and baby"". ""The RCM also believes that the more we develop maternity services which enable women and midwives to get to know each other and for women to trust their midwife, the less likely women are to choose to give birth without a midwife present,"" it said. The birth of the water baby How accurate are 'due dates'? This was seconded by the Heads of Midwifery Wales group, which is made up of head midwives from each health board, who said it ""cannot recommend something that is potentially unsafe"". But the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services (Aims) supported Ms Horrigan's choice, saying: ""Trusts need to understand freebirths are legal. A freebirth is an active and positive choice."" Doula UK said it supported a ""woman's autonomy and freedom of choice"" but does not take a stand on unassisted childbirth. Maureen Treadwell, co-founder of The Birth Trauma Association, said: ""We have to raise our heads about the parapet and say it's dangerous. ""People are misled by stuff on the internet that suggests it's not dangerous but people on the internet have no responsibilities. ""If you freebirth you have to factor in you might die.""

China moves to let Xi extend rule,"Xi Jinping became Chinese president in 2013 and is currently due to step down in 2023 China's governing Communist Party has proposed removing a clause in the constitution which limits presidencies to two five-year terms. The move would allow the current President Xi Jinping to remain as leader after he is due to step down. There had been widespread speculation that Mr Xi would seek to extend his presidency beyond 2023. The party congress last year saw him cement his status as the most powerful leader since the late Mao Zedong. His ideology was also enshrined in the party's constitution at the congress, and in a break with convention, no obvious successor was unveiled. Born in 1953, Mr Xi is the son of one of the Communist Party's founding fathers. He joined the party in 1974, climbing its ranks before becoming president in 2013. His presidency has seen economic reform, a fierce campaign against corruption, as well as a resurgence in nationalism and a crackdown on human rights. A Chinese move that many expected Xi: From princeling to president The thoughts of Chairman Xi Meet China's new leaders The announcement was carried on state news agency Xinhua on Sunday,external. ""The Communist Party of China Central Committee proposed to remove the expression that the President and Vice-President of the People's Republic of China 'shall serve no more than two consecutive terms' from the country's Constitution,"" it reported. It gave no other details, but the full proposal was due to be released later. The announcement appears carefully timed, with many Chinese people due to return to work on Monday after celebrating the Chinese New Year. China was also centre stage at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, as South Korea prepared to hand the Games over to Beijing for 2022. The top officials who make up the party's Central Committee are due to meet on Monday in Beijing. The proposal must be approved by China's parliament, the National People's Congress, which begins its annual meeting on 5 March but most expect this to be a formality. Under the current system, Mr Xi was due to step down in 2023. The tradition of limiting presidencies to 10 years emerged in the 1990s, when veteran leader Deng Xiaoping sought to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had marked the Mao era and its immediate aftermath. Mr Xi's two predecessors have followed the orderly pattern of succession. But since he came to power in 2012 he has shown a readiness to write his own rules. It is not clear how long Mr Xi might stay in power, but an editorial in China's state-run Global Times said the change did not mean ""that the Chinese president will have a lifelong tenure"". The paper quoted Su Wei, a Communist Party academic and party member, as saying it was a significant decision as China needed a ""stable, strong and consistent leadership"" from 2020-2035. But the prospect of further removing restraints on Mr Xi's power has alarmed some observers. ""I think he will become emperor for life,"" Willy Lam, politics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told AFP news agency. By Celia Hatton, BBC World Service Asia Pacific Regional Editor This is an announcement many have been expecting. For decades, the Communist Party has dominated life in China. Now, Xi Jinping has stepped into that spotlight, outshining the party that promoted him to the top spot. His photo is plastered on billboards across the country and his authorised nickname, ""Papa Xi"", appears in official songs. In the past the Communist Party stayed firmly in control, while the man at the top was in command for a limited amount of time. One leader would dutifully hand power to another after serving a decade in power. Xi Jinping disrupted that system from the early days of his time in office. He instituted an anti-corruption campaign, the same campaign that conveniently eliminated Mr Xi's political rivals. Mr Xi has also shown a clear political vision, promoting huge national projects like the One Belt One Road initiative to build new global trade routes and announcing grand plans for China to erase poverty by 2020.

Nine unlikely stars of the Winter Olympics,"Inpersonators, animals and athletes - the stars took all different forms Mikaela Shiffrin, Shaun White, Marcel Hirscher, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir - all the big names lived up to the hype when their moment arrived. But what of the Winter Olympics' surprises? There were a few, and not all came in the form of shock gold medals. Let's take a look at the unlikely stars of Pyeongchang 2018... There really had to be an animal in this list  - and the penultimate day of competition delivered the goods. Milena Bykova, competing for the neutral Olympic athletes from Russia team, narrowly avoided squishing the little critter on her run in the snowboarding giant slalom. The slow motion replay shows it JUST got away unharmed - bar the inevitable palpitations. Gold medal for bravery to that squirrel. This video can not be played Slalom squirrel - snowboarder narrowly avoids furry intruder Bookmark this page for those moments you need a pick-me-up, or even a little cry. Tongan taekwondo fighter turned cross country skier Pita Taufatofua, known as ""the topless Tongan"",finished 114th in the 15km race. The 34-year-old may have been 23 minutes slower than the gold medallist but he didn't see that as failure. His aim was to not ski into a tree and to finish before they turned out the lights. Nailed it. Not only that, but he displayed outstanding sportsmanship, waiting at the finish line for last-placed German Madrazo before hoisting the 43-year-old Mexican onto his shoulders. Despite the freezing conditions, the crowds stayed the extra half an hour to cheer on the remaining finishers. Hot chocolates all round. This video can not be played Winter Olympics: Cross-country crowd gets behind Tongan and Mexican skiers Freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, despite his 12th place finish, says this Olympics was more fulfilling than when he won a silver medal in Sochi four years ago. Why? ""Because I did it as me"" he told CNN. Kenworthy, who came out as gay in 2015, shared a kiss with boyfriend Matthew Wilkas before his qualifying run, a moment that has become a viral sensation and been hailed as a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride. ""My childhood self would never have dreamed of seeing a gay kiss on TV at the Olympics, but for the first time ever a kid watching at home CAN! Love is love is love."" he added. Kenworthy and his boyfriend Matthew say they had no idea this moment was being broadcast A Kim Jong-un impersonatormade the headlines when he was removed from the ice hockey arena, having tried to join in with the North Korean cheerleaders during the unified Korean women's ice hockey team's match against Japan. The imposter, who identified himself only as Howard, was filmed shaking hands with crowd members as he was escorted out of the arena by security. He reportedly claimed he had not committed any crime by looking like the North Korean president and cheering a hockey team. Earlier, he gatecrashed the opening ceremony with a doppelganger of US president Donald Trump. ""My face is too political,"" he said. ""I was born with this face, I've got to live with it."" Howard didn't appear to entertain the North Korean cheerleaders These Olympics gave us two of best moustaches we have seen. Possibly ever. American Matt Hamilton was the proud owner of one of them - and it was clearly lucky as the United States upset the odds to beat favourites Sweden to gold in the men's curling. Matt Hamilton's moustache became an internet sensation overnight... But we have to hand it to Robert Johansson and his outstanding face fuzz. The Norwegian ski jumper is taking home a gold and two bronze medals from Pyeongchang - but, more importantly, he can add 'BBC Sport's facial hair of the Games award' to his Wikipedia page. Excellently manicured... In a country which only a few weeks ago had barely heard of curling, the South Korean national team became superstars. Uiseong gymnasium was full of fans of the ""Garlic Girls"" for the gold-medal match The ""Garlic Girls"" are so named because of the small garlic-producing region they come from. Then there are the names they gave each other after sitting down for breakfast one day: Steak, Yogurt, Pancake, Sunny and Chocho. They appear so modest, but these incredible, determined underdogs won comfortably against established curling nations such as Canada, Great Britain and the US and made it all the way to the gold medal match. The Swedes has clearly not read the script though - they beat the home side 8-3 in the final. More on the Garlic Girls We have seen some outstanding outfits from competitors and fans alike in South Korea. The Norwegian curling team absolutely smashed it on Valentine's Day with these trousers, despite the awful colour clash with their shirts. Norway celebrated Valentine's Day in style Team USA's Nasa-inspired snowboarding outfits stood out. They even came complete with spaceman helmets for those medal-winning moments. Snowboarder Kyle Mack celebrated his silver medal in the big air with ""snow walk"" And while the majority of figure skaters opt for short, sparkly dresses, France's Mae Berenice Meite looked incredible in this embellished cat suit. The word ""chic"" springs to mind. Meite wore an unconventional cat suit for her performance BBC Sport's Nick Hope in Pyeongchang: The stars of the Games - unofficially London 2012 had its 'Games Makers', Sochi 2014 its 'Ice Makers' and Baku 2015 the 'Flame Makers' - all of whom were brilliant - but the volunteers at Pyeongchang 2018 have been on another level. They may have been given an official - and somewhat unfortunate - ""Passion Crew"" title but they have lived up to that enthusiastic billing with constant energy and countless 'Gangnam Style' dance renditions. Friendly, phenomenally good at English and always smiling, they helped lift the spirits of athletes, coaches, media and spectators during the most brutal sub-zero temperatures in South Korea. The unofficial stars of the Games. What a spectacle. A new event for this Olympics and we certainly hope it is here to stay. The women's competition allowed the athletes to show their full potential, after bad weather made for a chaotic slopestyle final, withAustria's Anna Gasserthe pre-games favourite proving her star quality. And as for the men's final - well, Team GB found themselves a flag bearer.

It follows a difficult year for British Bobsleigh after BBC Sport revealed in June that GB athletes had written to the governing body tocomplain of ""bullying, racism, sexism and discrimination"". Head coachDominik Scherrer resigned, less than five months before the Pyeongchang Games, while the women's team had its funding withdrawn in September. The British women's pair of Mica McNeill and Mica Moorefinished eighth in their eventafter a crowdfunding initiative raised Â£40,000 to help them compete at the Games. On the men's performance, BBC Sport commentator and two-time British Olympic bobsleigher John Jackson said: ""I think it will have funding implications because UK Sport are really tight on their targets. If they'd set a top-five target and we'd finished sixth or seventh then you could argue we're almost there. ""But to have a top-five target and finish 18th, 19th, then you're nowhere near."" Despite his sled's slowest time coming in the final run, Friedrich comfortably won gold with a combined time of three minutes 15.85 seconds Fellow German Andre Lange is the only other pilot to win in both the four-man and two-man Olympic events since 1984, doing so in 2006. BBC Sport Olympic sport reporter Nick Hope No 'worst case scenario' predications would have seen the two GB men's four-man sleds finish so low in the field. They have the technology and talent to genuinely push for the top six and lower medal positions, but it's gone dramatically and drastically wrong. Big questions will now be asked by UK Sport about how over Â£5m of investment has actually been spent.

Camilla urges parents to read to children,"The Duchess of Cornwall is passionate about books The Duchess of Cornwall is urging parents to read to children daily and ""lead them on a voyage of discovery"". Writing in the Sunday Express,,externalCamilla spoke of the joy her father brought to her by reading to her every night. She said: ""Those evenings didn't just pass on a lifelong love of reading; they made me, too, want to share that passion with my children and now with my grandchildren."" The duchess was writing ahead of ahead of World Book Day on Thursday. What books are you reading with your children? She said a day dedicated to books may seem ""a bit old-fashioned"" in a world ""that sometimes feels dominated by too many screens and too much information"". But Camilla said it was a ""timely reminder"" of how important books and reading are, especially for children. She said: ""Turning the pages of a favourite book creates a very special bond with our grandchildren, but it's not just an indulgent pleasure. We all know that reading is an invaluable life skill. ""It is vital for children in their education and as they take their place in the grown-up world."" The duchess also said books can ""fire the imaginations"" of children and ""get their brains buzzing unlike anything else"". She added: ""Reading to our children and our grandchildren is something we can all try to do every day of the year. ""Not only does it give us pleasure but it leads them on a voyage of discovery and enrichment that only books can bring."" Recalling her own father, Major Bruce Shand, reading to her as a child, she said the ""fervent bibliophile"" brought characters such as ""the dashing Scarlet Pimpernel"" or ""inquisitive Alice"" to life ""vividly"". ""We couldn't wait for the next instalment,"" she added.

N Korea 'willing to hold US talks',"The North Korean general and Ivanka Trump cheered from the same stand - but are not expected to meet The United States says any dialogue with North Korea must have nuclear disarmament as the end goal. The North indicated on the last day of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang it was ready for talks, according to South Korea. North Korea has previously said it will not accept any preconditions. ""We will see if Pyongyang's message... that it is willing to hold talks, represents the first steps along the path to denuclearization,"" the US said. Reports about the North's willingness to speak to the US emerged after a meeting of its officials with the South Korean president before the Games' closing ceremony on Sunday. North Korea's controversial Olympics delegate North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' US President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka also attended the ceremony but she is not expected to talk with any North Koreans, even though she sat a few feet from their main envoy, Gen Kim Yong-chol, at the Olympic Stadium. North Korea was ""very willing"" to hold talks with the US, said the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in. It added that the North had ""agreed that inter-Korea talks and North-US relations should improve together"". The revelation from the South Korean presidency came hours after a furious statement from the North that describedfresh sanctions announced by Washingtonas ""an act of war"". Pyongyang's foreign ministry praised the way the two Koreas had co-operated together during the Olympics but said the US had ""brought the threat of war to the Korean peninsula with large-scale new sanctions"". The Korean peninsula has been divided since the 1950-53 war and the two sides have never signed a peace treaty. The rapprochement between the two Koreas has been seen as a move by the North to drive a wedge between the South and the US. Experts have cautioned that the latest developments do not put an end to underlying regional tensions, particularly following last year's nuclear and missile tests carried out by the North. South Korean media is abuzz with suggestions that North-US talks could still take place while the respective delegations are in town. The BBC's Laura Bicker, in Pyeongchang, asked an official from South's government if the meeting could take place in the next two days, and the answer was: ""We will see."" Mike Pence was seated directly in front of the North Korean delegation at the opening ceremony North Korea has sent an eight-person team across the border, including Gen Kim Choe Kang-il, a senior diplomat handling North American affairs. Meanwhile, Allison Hooker - a Koreas specialist from the US National Security Council - is part of the US delegation. She met Gen Kim in 2014 in North Korea, as the US tried to free two American detainees. The scene could be set for a more low-key meeting than a failed attempt with US Vice-President Mike Pence. He had been set to meet Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean President Kim Jong-un, at the start of the Games but the meeting was cancelled inexplicably by the North Koreans, according to the US officials. North Korea made no comment. N Korea leader's sister takes 'real power' south There has been no official interaction between North Korea and the Trump administration.

Russian athlete banned,"Nadezhda Sergeeva (right) had returned a clean result in a doping test on 13 February, the Russian Bobsleigh Federation said Russian bobsleigh pilot Nadezhda Sergeeva has been banned from the Winter Olympics for doping - just a day before Olympic chiefs meet to discuss lifting sanctions on her country. The International Olympic Committee banned Russia over ""systemic"" doping at Sochi 2014, which the country hosted. However, 168 athletes who proved they were clean were allowed to compete as neutrals at the Pyeongchang Games. Sergeeva is the second of those 168 to have failed a doping test. The IOC's executive board met on Saturday, when a discussion on whether to maintain or lift the suspension on Russia took place - a decision is now expected on Sunday. Lifting the suspension would allow Russian athletes to parade with their national flag at Sunday's closing ceremony. Russian doping whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's flag warning However some feel that is now unlikely to happen, with Russian athletes producing two of the four failed doping tests in Pyeongchang. ""They were due to look at how we behaved here and decide, but as we've got two doping cases I don't think they will allow us to be at the closing with the flag,"" alpine skier Anastasia Silanteva told Reuters. ""Especially in light of the second doping offence, our position is that the flag should not come into the closing ceremony with the Russian team,"" Canadian Olympic Committee president Tricia Smith said. The neutral Olympic athletes from Russia (OAR) teamwon their first gold medal of the Games in South Koreaon Friday. That followed Russian curlerAlexander Krushelnitsky being stripped of his bronzemedal after being found guilty of doping. The OAR team are the third biggest at the Games, behind Canada and the United States. Sergeeva, 30, finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event. A Court of Arbitration for Sport panel met on Saturday to hear her case following her failed test. ""The athlete has accepted a provisional suspension beyond the period of the Games,"" it said, adding that Sergeeva had admitted an anti-doping rule violation after testing positive for trimetazidine. Trimetazidine is used to treat heart conditions but is also classed as a metabolic modulator by the World Anti-Doping Agency because it has performance-enhancing properties. The Russian Bobsleigh Federation hadearlier said Sergeeva had tested positivefor ""a heart drug"" that ""was not prescribed"" by its medical team. It added that a test on 18 February came back positive but a previous one on 13 February had showed a clean result. ""She doesn't understand where she made a mistake,"" said Russian bobsleigh official Sergei Zhurkin. Meanwhile, members of the US biathlon team have announced that they will not take part in next month's World Cup final - because it is being staged in Russia. The International Biathlon Union (IBU) event is taking place in Tyumen, from 19-26 March and the US team said it was ""completely unacceptable"" to allow that nation to host the event as it sent ""an outrageous message of anti-doping indifference to the world"". ""We fully support the right of clean Russian athletes to compete, and share the opinion that Russia should be eligible to host IBU World Cups in the future, but only after they have shown a meaningful commitment to rectifying the doping culture which has been shown to exist there,"" a US team statement added.

"UN approves 30-day ceasefire in SyriaBut hours later, air strikes on the Easter Ghouta resumed causing several casualties, activists say.3h3 hours agoMiddle East","This video can not be played Rawaa has been living in a basement with around 75 others for months The UN Security Council has unanimously approved a resolution demanding a 30-day ceasefire in Syria to allow aid deliveries and medical evacuations. However, some of the biggest jihadist rebel groups, and their associates, are not covered by the truce, raising questions about its real impact. The Eastern Ghouta rebel enclave near Damascus has been bombarded by government forces for the past week. And air strikes began soon after the vote in New York, activists said. The vote had been delayed several times since Thursday as members struggled to come to an agreement. Russia, an ally of Syria's government, wanted changes, while Western diplomats accused Moscow of stalling for time. Some 500 people are said to have been killed by government forces in the enclave since last Sunday while rebels fire on Damascus has reportedly killed at least 16 civilians. Life in Eastern Ghouta - read residents' stories Syria conflict: Will powers end up in direct war? Why is there a war in Syria? The draft had said the ceasefire would not apply to operations against the Islamic State (IS) group, al-Qaeda and the Nusra Front. The Nusra Front isa former al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria which changed its name to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) when it formed an alliance with other militants last year. After Russia asked for the resolution to include other groups ""co-operating with them"", the final text specifies that operations may continue against ""individuals, groups, undertakings and entities"" associated with IS, al-Qaeda or other groups designated by the Security Council as terrorists. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, called for the ceasefire to be implemented immediately but said she was sceptical that Syria would comply. She accused Russia of having ""dragged out the negotiations"". She said: ""In the three days it took us to adopt this resolution, how many mothers lost their kids to the bombing and the shelling?"" France's UN representative, FranÃ§ois Delattre, also said the action was very ""belated"". On Friday he said failure to act could spell the end of the UN itself. Its UN envoy, Vassily Nebenzia, said the ceasefire would not be possible without agreements between warring factions and he attacked what he said was propaganda over the situation in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. ""We know that the humanitarian situation in Syria is dire and requires urgent measures to be taken,"" he said. ""It is important to engage not just with Eastern Ghouta,"" he added. ""Assistance needs to be delivered to all parts of Syria."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said the situation in the Eastern Ghouta is like ""hell on Earth"". Children have been injured in the bombardment of the Eastern Ghouta Air strikes resumed on Sunday, hours after the Security Council meeting. They targeted the outskirts of Douma, the main town in the Easter Ghouta, causing several casualties, observers said. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has said that both Syrian and Russian planes have been used, although Russia denies direct involvement. Barrel bombs and shells have been dropped on the area, where some 393,000 people remain trapped. Aid groups report several hospitals being put out of action since Sunday. The Syrian government has denied targeting civilians and said it is trying to liberate the Eastern Ghouta from ""terrorists"" - a term it has used to describe both the jihadist militants and the mainstream rebel groups that hold the enclave. The rebels in Eastern Ghouta are not one cohesive group. They encompass multiple factions, including jihadists, and in-fighting between them has led to past losses of ground to the Syrian government. The two biggest groups in the area are Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. The latter has in the past fought alongside Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. The Syrian government says its attempts to recapture Eastern Ghouta are directly due to the HTS presence there.

"Labour customs union shift confirmedSir Keir Starmer says Labour wants a new treaty that will ""do the work of the customs union"".3m4 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We've long championed being in a customs union with the EU"" Jeremy Corbyn is to confirm a shift in the Labour Party's position on remaining in the customs union after Brexit, Sir Keir Starmer has indicated. The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour's front bench was ""unanimous"" in its backing for striking a new deal with the EU after Brexit. The UK would leave the customs union but then negotiate a treaty that will ""do the work of the customs union"". But Liam Fox said Labour's position did not make sense. Analysis: Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' What's the difference between single market and customs union? The international trade secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union. What does that mean? ""Is it like Turkey, which has a customs union but only in goods, not in agriculture, not in services, not in finance? Is that what we want for Britain? Will we take rules in certain sectors but not in others?"" Sir Keir also warned Prime Minister Theresa May ""crunch time"" was coming, as MPs geared up to vote on her policy of staying out of the customs union when the UK leaves the EU next March so that the UK can strike its own trade deals. Labour leader Mr Corbyn is due to make a speech on Monday setting out his party's position. Labour has previously said it wants the UK to retain the ""benefits"" of the customs union and the single market without saying how that would be achieved. Sir Keir said being in a customs union permanently was the ""the only way realistically to get tariff free access,"" which was ""really important for our manufacturing base"" and the only way to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works ""jointly with the EU"", adding: ""We all want to do bold new trade agreements but we would be better off doing that with the EU."" Anna Soubry: Ready to call off revolt? By BBC Political Correspondent Emma Vardy Labour's efforts to persuade Conservative rebels to side with them are set to intensify. Now that Labour appears to have come down firmly on the side of a softer Brexit, after months of hedging its bets, there's a renewed focus at Westminster on whether Tory rebels can defeat Theresa May and keep the UK in the customs union. On paper, there would appear to be the numbers for pro-EU Conservative MPs to side with Labour (and the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party) to overturn Theresa May's majority. But Conservative rebels would need nerves of steel to torpedo the PM's whole Brexit strategy. It could pave the way to another general election, which might just deliver a Labour government. The PM is hoping she can say enough this week to keep the Remainers on side, but the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit expected in the autumn looms ever larger. Mr Fox has said the UK can only strike its own trade deals if it is not part of a customs union - and he told Andrew Marr his department was working with ""21 different countries"" to get agreements in place that could be signed as soon as the UK leaves. He said Mrs May would be setting out what the cabinet had agreed on the UK's future economic relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday, in the north-east of England. And he urged Remain-supporting Tory MPs, who are threatening to derail the prime minister's plan to leave the customs union, to have an ""an open mind"" and listen to what she had to say, which would ""deal with a lot of the reservations that they have"". This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union, what does that mean?"" The Labour leadership is under pressure from some of their own MPs to join forces with Conservative rebels and the Lib Dems to back an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently making its way through Parliament, to stay in a customs union. Mr Fox said a vote on the bill, which had been due to take place next week, had been delayed because ""we want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument before we take the bill forward"". Sir Keir said the Labour leadership had not yet decided to back the rebel Tory amendments but claimed they were similar to ones that had been tabled by the Labour front bench. He said Mrs May did not have a majority in Parliament for staying out of a customs union and she would face a ""crunch"" vote ""sooner rather than later"" - although he denied Labour was engaged in a cynical attempt to remove her from office and force a general election. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith warned would-be Tory rebels Tory rebel Anna Soubry suggested she was ready to pull back if Mrs May announced measures that would amount to a customs agreement on Friday, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's absolutely beholden now on the government to get itself in the right place."" In his speech on Monday, Mr Corbyn will say the EU ""is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems,"" adding: ""Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations."" More than 80 senior figures in the Labour Party have, meanwhile, urged Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the EU single market after Brexit. This video can not be played Labour MPs clash over party's Brexit policy In a statement seen by the Observer,external, figures including Lord Mandelson, pro-European backbencher Chuka Umunna, former leader Lord Kinnock, and trade union leaders said the party as a minimum ""must clearly and unambiguously"" set out to remain part of the European economic area. Although they regard Mr Corbyn's expected commitment on Monday as a ""step forward"", they said this falls ""way short"" of where Labour should be on Brexit. Mr Umunna warned leaving the single market and customs union would ""torpedo"" Labour's anti-austerity and industrial investment plans.

Colombia extradites top drug suspectHe is accused of smuggling more than 250 tonnes of cocaine over the past decade.12h12 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Prado Ãlava was arrested in Colombia in April 2017 A man accused of smuggling more than 250 tonnes of cocaine over the past decade has been extradited to the US from Colombia. Prosecutors say Washington Prado Ãlava, an Ecuadorean national, was a drug lord with operations across the Americas. He is also accused of ordering the murders of judges, prosecutors and police officers in Ecuador. Mr Prado Ãlava was known in Colombia as Ecuador's Pablo Escobar, the infamous MedellÃ­n Cartel leader killed in 1993. In Colombia, he tried to join the ranks of the Farc leftist rebel group before it signed a peace agreement in 2016. The Colombian prosecutors say his intention was to take advantage of a transitional justice system, which was agreed between the government and the Farc to deal with crimes committed by the rebels during five decades of conflict. ""Washington Prado Ãlava is considered one of the biggestcapos[bosses] in recent years and became a top target for the United States,"" the prosecutors said in a statement. Mr Prado Ãlava allegedly operated in Ecuador and on Colombia's Pacific coast. Prosecutors said his fleet of speedboats was used to make regular cocaine deliveries to Central America and Mexico, and, from there, the drugs were shipped over the border into the US. Mr Prado Ãlava was arrested in April 2017 as he travelled to visit family in the Colombian city of Cali. The US Drug Enforcement Agency provided the Colombian authorities with key intelligence that led to his arrest and that of three other alleged gang members. On Saturday, he was taken from a prison where he was being held in the capital, BogotÃ¡, and put on a plane to face justice in the US. Fifty agents took part in the extradition operation, Colombian authorities said.

Corbyn urged to make single market pledge,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We've long championed being in a customs union with the EU"" Jeremy Corbyn is to confirm a shift in the Labour Party's position on remaining in the customs union after Brexit, Sir Keir Starmer has indicated. The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour's front bench was ""unanimous"" in its backing for striking a new deal with the EU after Brexit. The UK would leave the customs union but then negotiate a treaty that will ""do the work of the customs union"". But Liam Fox said Labour's position did not make sense. Analysis: Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' What's the difference between single market and customs union? The international trade secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union. What does that mean? ""Is it like Turkey, which has a customs union but only in goods, not in agriculture, not in services, not in finance? Is that what we want for Britain? Will we take rules in certain sectors but not in others?"" Sir Keir also warned Prime Minister Theresa May ""crunch time"" was coming, as MPs geared up to vote on her policy of staying out of the customs union when the UK leaves the EU next March so that the UK can strike its own trade deals. Labour leader Mr Corbyn is due to make a speech on Monday setting out his party's position. Labour has previously said it wants the UK to retain the ""benefits"" of the customs union and the single market without saying how that would be achieved. Sir Keir said being in a customs union permanently was the ""the only way realistically to get tariff free access,"" which was ""really important for our manufacturing base"" and the only way to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works ""jointly with the EU"", adding: ""We all want to do bold new trade agreements but we would be better off doing that with the EU."" Anna Soubry: Ready to call off revolt? By BBC Political Correspondent Emma Vardy Labour's efforts to persuade Conservative rebels to side with them are set to intensify. Now that Labour appears to have come down firmly on the side of a softer Brexit, after months of hedging its bets, there's a renewed focus at Westminster on whether Tory rebels can defeat Theresa May and keep the UK in the customs union. On paper, there would appear to be the numbers for pro-EU Conservative MPs to side with Labour (and the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party) to overturn Theresa May's majority. But Conservative rebels would need nerves of steel to torpedo the PM's whole Brexit strategy. It could pave the way to another general election, which might just deliver a Labour government. The PM is hoping she can say enough this week to keep the Remainers on side, but the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit expected in the autumn looms ever larger. Mr Fox has said the UK can only strike its own trade deals if it is not part of a customs union - and he told Andrew Marr his department was working with ""21 different countries"" to get agreements in place that could be signed as soon as the UK leaves. He said Mrs May would be setting out what the cabinet had agreed on the UK's future economic relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday, in the north-east of England. And he urged Remain-supporting Tory MPs, who are threatening to derail the prime minister's plan to leave the customs union, to have an ""an open mind"" and listen to what she had to say, which would ""deal with a lot of the reservations that they have"". This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union, what does that mean?"" The Labour leadership is under pressure from some of their own MPs to join forces with Conservative rebels and the Lib Dems to back an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently making its way through Parliament, to stay in a customs union. Mr Fox said a vote on the bill, which had been due to take place next week, had been delayed because ""we want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument before we take the bill forward"". Sir Keir said the Labour leadership had not yet decided to back the rebel Tory amendments but claimed they were similar to ones that had been tabled by the Labour front bench. He said Mrs May did not have a majority in Parliament for staying out of a customs union and she would face a ""crunch"" vote ""sooner rather than later"" - although he denied Labour was engaged in a cynical attempt to remove her from office and force a general election. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith warned would-be Tory rebels Tory rebel Anna Soubry suggested she was ready to pull back if Mrs May announced measures that would amount to a customs agreement on Friday, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's absolutely beholden now on the government to get itself in the right place."" In his speech on Monday, Mr Corbyn will say the EU ""is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems,"" adding: ""Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations."" More than 80 senior figures in the Labour Party have, meanwhile, urged Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the EU single market after Brexit. This video can not be played Labour MPs clash over party's Brexit policy In a statement seen by the Observer,external, figures including Lord Mandelson, pro-European backbencher Chuka Umunna, former leader Lord Kinnock, and trade union leaders said the party as a minimum ""must clearly and unambiguously"" set out to remain part of the European economic area. Although they regard Mr Corbyn's expected commitment on Monday as a ""step forward"", they said this falls ""way short"" of where Labour should be on Brexit. Mr Umunna warned leaving the single market and customs union would ""torpedo"" Labour's anti-austerity and industrial investment plans.

China proposes to extend Xi rule,"Xi Jinping became Chinese president in 2013 and is currently due to step down in 2023 China's governing Communist Party has proposed removing a clause in the constitution which limits presidencies to two five-year terms. The move would allow the current President Xi Jinping to remain as leader after he is due to step down. There had been widespread speculation that Mr Xi would seek to extend his presidency beyond 2023. The party congress last year saw him cement his status as the most powerful leader since the late Mao Zedong. His ideology was also enshrined in the party's constitution at the congress, and in a break with convention, no obvious successor was unveiled. Born in 1953, Mr Xi is the son of one of the Communist Party's founding fathers. He joined the party in 1974, climbing its ranks before becoming president in 2013. His presidency has seen economic reform, a fierce campaign against corruption, as well as a resurgence in nationalism and a crackdown on human rights. A Chinese move that many expected Xi: From princeling to president The thoughts of Chairman Xi Meet China's new leaders The announcement was carried on state news agency Xinhua on Sunday,external. ""The Communist Party of China Central Committee proposed to remove the expression that the President and Vice-President of the People's Republic of China 'shall serve no more than two consecutive terms' from the country's Constitution,"" it reported. It gave no other details, but the full proposal was due to be released later. The announcement appears carefully timed, with many Chinese people due to return to work on Monday after celebrating the Chinese New Year. China was also centre stage at the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympics, as South Korea prepared to hand the Games over to Beijing for 2022. The top officials who make up the party's Central Committee are due to meet on Monday in Beijing. The proposal must be approved by China's parliament, the National People's Congress, which begins its annual meeting on 5 March but most expect this to be a formality. Under the current system, Mr Xi was due to step down in 2023. The tradition of limiting presidencies to 10 years emerged in the 1990s, when veteran leader Deng Xiaoping sought to avoid a repeat of the chaos that had marked the Mao era and its immediate aftermath. Mr Xi's two predecessors have followed the orderly pattern of succession. But since he came to power in 2012 he has shown a readiness to write his own rules. It is not clear how long Mr Xi might stay in power, but an editorial in China's state-run Global Times said the change did not mean ""that the Chinese president will have a lifelong tenure"". The paper quoted Su Wei, a Communist Party academic and party member, as saying it was a significant decision as China needed a ""stable, strong and consistent leadership"" from 2020-2035. But the prospect of further removing restraints on Mr Xi's power has alarmed some observers. ""I think he will become emperor for life,"" Willy Lam, politics professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told AFP news agency. By Celia Hatton, BBC World Service Asia Pacific Regional Editor This is an announcement many have been expecting. For decades, the Communist Party has dominated life in China. Now, Xi Jinping has stepped into that spotlight, outshining the party that promoted him to the top spot. His photo is plastered on billboards across the country and his authorised nickname, ""Papa Xi"", appears in official songs. In the past the Communist Party stayed firmly in control, while the man at the top was in command for a limited amount of time. One leader would dutifully hand power to another after serving a decade in power. Xi Jinping disrupted that system from the early days of his time in office. He instituted an anti-corruption campaign, the same campaign that conveniently eliminated Mr Xi's political rivals. Mr Xi has also shown a clear political vision, promoting huge national projects like the One Belt One Road initiative to build new global trade routes and announcing grand plans for China to erase poverty by 2020.

Weight issues curtailed my racing: McCoy,"AP McCoy rode a record 4,358 winners and was champion jockey for 20 years Twenty-time champion jockey AP McCoy believes his career could have been extended had he been given better support to manage his weight healthily. McCoy, whoretired in 2015,told the BBC he had done ""everything you probably shouldn't do"" while racing. Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) experts have created special programmes to help jockeys lose weight safely. McCoy, who took part towards the end of his career, said he could have been even better had he joined earlier. Jockeys try to be as light as possible in order to minimise the combined weight of them and their saddles. The average weight of a jockey is about the same as a 13-year-old boy. McCoy,knighted in 2016,said he ""made weight"" for races by having hot baths, running with sweat suits on, and using saunas. ""Unfortunately I went there [LJMU] at the latter part of my career, when I was near retirement, but I went there because I was interested. ""Maybe I could've been so much better if I'd had the access to something like this earlier. ""It could've made me better; it could've made me last longer; it could've made me a much better jockey."" Born in Moneyglass, County Antrim on 4 May 1974 Won the Grand National on his 15th attempt with Don't Push It in 2010 His total number of winners (4,358) is nearly 1,000 greater than his nearest challenger (Richard Johnson on 3,377) He won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2010 and was knighted for services to racing in 2016 While racing he kept his weight at about 10st 3lb - his natural weight would have been closer to 12st Former jockey George Wilson aims to help jockeys manage their weight more safely Former jockey George Wilson, of LJMU's Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, led a study researching the health implications of ""extreme weight-making practices"" and has designed healthier and safer ways for jockeys to shed the pounds. Funded by the Racing Foundation - a grant-making organisation founded by British Horseracing Authority, The Horsemen's Group and the Racecourse Association following thegovernment's sale of the Tote- the programme is open to all jockeys and so far more than 300 have been involved. Boy, 13, caught driving car with toddler and mum inside Homeless 'devastated' by doorway death 'I was stalked by a polar bear' Dr Wilson said ensuring jockeys are ""realistic"" about their weight is one of the key aspects of the programme. ""We offer up an individually devised diet and nutrition programme, and an exercise programme based upon the research as opposed to the jockeys adopting these culturally driven methods which would not be the best for your health. ""To lose weight, you don't have to sweat and you don't have to starve."" Adele Mulrennan, a former jockey, was worried about her husband Paul's attempts to make weight Paul Mulrennan, who has ridden 946 winners throughout his career, said taking part had undoubtedly extended his career and improved his health. ""I don't think I'd be riding now if I hadn't met George."" He said he had witnessed some unhealthy practices and personally took part in others. ""Some of the lads have been flipping - bringing their food back up - and drinking too much,"" he said. Mulrennan, who has weighed as little as 8st 9lb (55kg), said he would often put on a sweat suit and go running to lose weight and there would also be other days when he would starve himself. ""If you go out and have six, seven, eight gin and tonics and don't eat you will be lighter in the morning, so you think 'that's great, I'll make the weight the next day' but obviously it's not good for your head."" His wife Adele said she thought the lifestyle would kill him, even without the drinking. ""There were times when I thought 'has he been drinking?' because it affects your brain, but he was just so dehydrated,"" she said. ""We did have a chat about giving up, but luckily Paul met George just at the right time and changed him round."" AP McCoy retired in 2015 The extreme weight-loss and the methods used do not just affect the jockey's physical health. ""The big problem for a jockey, especially a jump jockey, is that if the brain is starved that's when you can do the most damage when you bang your head if you fall, if you're dehydrated,"" explained McCoy. Dr Wilson agreed. ""From my own experience, starvation is not great and dehydration is not great and you feel terrible,"" he said. McCoy said programmes such as those developed by LJMU could help change mindsets. ""You're trying to educate that this is a better way of life, it's a healthier way of life, it's a safer way of life.""

Newham 'corrosive substances ban failing',"This video can not be played Investigation finds children can buy corrosive substances in shops despite voluntary ban. Corrosive substances were bought by children in a London borough suffering a record level of acid attacks, despite a voluntary crackdown in local shops, according to Newham Council. In four council enforcement tests, 11 of 23 retailers sold to a child. BBC 5 live Investigates was present at one of the undercover investigations where a 14-year-old girl was able to buy bottles of bleach in minutes. The government is reviewing law around the sale of corrosive substances. Newham has been dubbed the ""acid attack capital of Britain"" in several papers. The BBC can also reveal new figures showing there were 646 acid attacks in England and Wales last year, more than three times as many as in 2013. BBC 5 live Investigates was present during the operation led by Newham Council and the Metropolitan Police, in which the teenager bought the bleach. Three out of five shops sold the girl household cleaner, which suggested not all retailers were observing their pledge not to sell corrosive substances to anyone aged under 21. The voluntary scheme was introduced last year and 182 local retailers signed up to it. This followed almost 300 violent offences involving corrosive fluids in Newham between 2015 and 2017. Newham Council has demanded the government goes further and introduces a ban on the sale of these substances to children. ""We demand the government acts urgently and introduces licensing for the sale of all corrosive substances and noxious liquids as a priority,"" the council said in a statement. ""We cannot afford for the government to prevaricate on this issue. It must bring forward this legislation urgently."" Adele Bellis's former partner paid another man to carry out an attack using acid. Acid attack victim Adele Bellis, wholost an ear and suffered severe scarringwhen her ex-partner paid another man to throw acid at her in Lowestoft in 2014, said she is worried about the difference in prison sentences handed out to offenders. ""There's no consistency in all the sentencing,"" Ms Bellis told Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Mike West during an interview between the pair carried out for 5 Live Investigates. ""My attacker got four years, do half and is out, false identity and living his life while I'm in hospital, no further really in my recovery,"" Ms Bellis said. Det Sup West, the Metropolitan Police's lead on corrosive-based crime, said: ""Whilst it is a case-by-case basis, at the end of the day it is a serious assault you've been subjected to. I would challenge that as well, to say that isn't sufficient."" Acid attacks: Retailers sign up to voluntary ban on acid sales What has led to the rise and how can they be stopped? Acid attack victim Adele Bellis 'felt face melting' Hell in a bottle: I survived an acid attack The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to 46 police forces, asking for the number of acid attacks they had recorded, but not all replied with full information. A total of 25 forces reported an increase from 182 attacks in 2013 to 646 last year. The majority were in London, which recorded 464 incidents in 2017, compared with 131 four years earlier. In a statement, the Home Office said: ""We are considering responses to our consultation on legislative proposals to prohibit sales of corrosive products to under-18s and creating a new possession offence, and have put in place a set of voluntary commitments with retailers to restrict access to most harmful products. ""The Home Secretary announced in July 2017 an action plan to tackle the use of corrosive substances in violent attacks and we are making good progress on implementing this."" 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 25 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

Colombia extradites top drug suspectHe is accused of smuggling more than 250 tonnes of cocaine over the past decade.10h10 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Prado Ãlava was arrested in Colombia in April 2017 A man accused of smuggling more than 250 tonnes of cocaine over the past decade has been extradited to the US from Colombia. Prosecutors say Washington Prado Ãlava, an Ecuadorean national, was a drug lord with operations across the Americas. He is also accused of ordering the murders of judges, prosecutors and police officers in Ecuador. Mr Prado Ãlava was known in Colombia as Ecuador's Pablo Escobar, the infamous MedellÃ­n Cartel leader killed in 1993. In Colombia, he tried to join the ranks of the Farc leftist rebel group before it signed a peace agreement in 2016.

""Washington Prado Ãlava is considered one of the biggestcapos[bosses] in recent years and became a top target for the United States,"" the prosecutors said in a statement.

Carter Page is a former Trump campaign aide One: The Steele dossier:The Republican document alleged that the FBI used unsubstantiated evidence to spy on Carter Page, who was put under electronic surveillance by the intelligence agency. Central to that claim was the charge that, in its application to a court for a surveillance warrant against Mr Page in 2016, the FBI had relied upon evidence contained in a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele - without revealing that his findings had been funded in part by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The Democrats argue in their document that officials had not relied on Mr Steele's dossier alone but had provided ""additional information from multiple independent sources that corroborated Steele's reporting"", informing the court of existing FBI operations against the Russians over their alleged campaign to influence the US election. Furthermore, they reveal that the FBI had interviewed Mr Page over his Russian links and opened its inquiry months before the Steele dossier had been received. Two: Who paid Steele?Democrats also reject the allegation that failure to mention explicitly that the  dossier had been funded by the Clinton campaign constituted bias. In their rebuttal, Democrats argue that the Steele dossier had been commissioned by someone who wanted to discredit Mr Trump.

Weight issues limited career says jockey,"AP McCoy rode a record 4,358 winners and was champion jockey for 20 years Twenty-time champion jockey AP McCoy believes his career could have been extended had he been given better support to manage his weight healthily. McCoy, whoretired in 2015,told the BBC he had done ""everything you probably shouldn't do"" while racing. Liverpool John Moores University (LJMU) experts have created special programmes to help jockeys lose weight safely. McCoy, who took part towards the end of his career, said he could have been even better had he joined earlier. Jockeys try to be as light as possible in order to minimise the combined weight of them and their saddles. The average weight of a jockey is about the same as a 13-year-old boy. McCoy,knighted in 2016,said he ""made weight"" for races by having hot baths, running with sweat suits on, and using saunas. ""Unfortunately I went there [LJMU] at the latter part of my career, when I was near retirement, but I went there because I was interested. ""Maybe I could've been so much better if I'd had the access to something like this earlier. ""It could've made me better; it could've made me last longer; it could've made me a much better jockey."" Born in Moneyglass, County Antrim on 4 May 1974 Won the Grand National on his 15th attempt with Don't Push It in 2010 His total number of winners (4,358) is nearly 1,000 greater than his nearest challenger (Richard Johnson on 3,377) He won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award in 2010 and was knighted for services to racing in 2016 While racing he kept his weight at about 10st 3lb - his natural weight would have been closer to 12st Former jockey George Wilson aims to help jockeys manage their weight more safely Former jockey George Wilson, of LJMU's Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Sciences, led a study researching the health implications of ""extreme weight-making practices"" and has designed healthier and safer ways for jockeys to shed the pounds. Funded by the Racing Foundation - a grant-making organisation founded by British Horseracing Authority, The Horsemen's Group and the Racecourse Association following thegovernment's sale of the Tote- the programme is open to all jockeys and so far more than 300 have been involved. Boy, 13, caught driving car with toddler and mum inside Homeless 'devastated' by doorway death 'I was stalked by a polar bear' Dr Wilson said ensuring jockeys are ""realistic"" about their weight is one of the key aspects of the programme. ""We offer up an individually devised diet and nutrition programme, and an exercise programme based upon the research as opposed to the jockeys adopting these culturally driven methods which would not be the best for your health. ""To lose weight, you don't have to sweat and you don't have to starve."" Adele Mulrennan, a former jockey, was worried about her husband Paul's attempts to make weight Paul Mulrennan, who has ridden 946 winners throughout his career, said taking part had undoubtedly extended his career and improved his health. ""I don't think I'd be riding now if I hadn't met George."" He said he had witnessed some unhealthy practices and personally took part in others. ""Some of the lads have been flipping - bringing their food back up - and drinking too much,"" he said. Mulrennan, who has weighed as little as 8st 9lb (55kg), said he would often put on a sweat suit and go running to lose weight and there would also be other days when he would starve himself. ""If you go out and have six, seven, eight gin and tonics and don't eat you will be lighter in the morning, so you think 'that's great, I'll make the weight the next day' but obviously it's not good for your head."" His wife Adele said she thought the lifestyle would kill him, even without the drinking. ""There were times when I thought 'has he been drinking?' because it affects your brain, but he was just so dehydrated,"" she said. ""We did have a chat about giving up, but luckily Paul met George just at the right time and changed him round."" AP McCoy retired in 2015 The extreme weight-loss and the methods used do not just affect the jockey's physical health. ""The big problem for a jockey, especially a jump jockey, is that if the brain is starved that's when you can do the most damage when you bang your head if you fall, if you're dehydrated,"" explained McCoy. Dr Wilson agreed. ""From my own experience, starvation is not great and dehydration is not great and you feel terrible,"" he said. McCoy said programmes such as those developed by LJMU could help change mindsets. ""You're trying to educate that this is a better way of life, it's a healthier way of life, it's a safer way of life.""

Corbyn urged to make single market pledgeMore than 80 senior party figures urge their leader to remain part of the European economic area.3m4 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We've long championed being in a customs union with the EU"" Jeremy Corbyn is to confirm a shift in the Labour Party's position on remaining in the customs union after Brexit, Sir Keir Starmer has indicated. The shadow Brexit secretary said Labour's front bench was ""unanimous"" in its backing for striking a new deal with the EU after Brexit. The UK would leave the customs union but then negotiate a treaty that will ""do the work of the customs union"". But Liam Fox said Labour's position did not make sense. Analysis: Labour's customs union policy 'evolves' What's the difference between single market and customs union? The international trade secretary told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union. What does that mean? ""Is it like Turkey, which has a customs union but only in goods, not in agriculture, not in services, not in finance? Is that what we want for Britain? Will we take rules in certain sectors but not in others?"" Sir Keir also warned Prime Minister Theresa May ""crunch time"" was coming, as MPs geared up to vote on her policy of staying out of the customs union when the UK leaves the EU next March so that the UK can strike its own trade deals. Labour leader Mr Corbyn is due to make a speech on Monday setting out his party's position. Labour has previously said it wants the UK to retain the ""benefits"" of the customs union and the single market without saying how that would be achieved. Sir Keir said being in a customs union permanently was the ""the only way realistically to get tariff free access,"" which was ""really important for our manufacturing base"" and the only way to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" in Northern Ireland. He said Britain was more likely to strike new deals if it works ""jointly with the EU"", adding: ""We all want to do bold new trade agreements but we would be better off doing that with the EU."" Anna Soubry: Ready to call off revolt? By BBC Political Correspondent Emma Vardy Labour's efforts to persuade Conservative rebels to side with them are set to intensify. Now that Labour appears to have come down firmly on the side of a softer Brexit, after months of hedging its bets, there's a renewed focus at Westminster on whether Tory rebels can defeat Theresa May and keep the UK in the customs union. On paper, there would appear to be the numbers for pro-EU Conservative MPs to side with Labour (and the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Green Party) to overturn Theresa May's majority. But Conservative rebels would need nerves of steel to torpedo the PM's whole Brexit strategy. It could pave the way to another general election, which might just deliver a Labour government. The PM is hoping she can say enough this week to keep the Remainers on side, but the ""meaningful vote"" on Brexit expected in the autumn looms ever larger. Mr Fox has said the UK can only strike its own trade deals if it is not part of a customs union - and he told Andrew Marr his department was working with ""21 different countries"" to get agreements in place that could be signed as soon as the UK leaves. He said Mrs May would be setting out what the cabinet had agreed on the UK's future economic relationship with the EU in a speech on Friday, in the north-east of England. And he urged Remain-supporting Tory MPs, who are threatening to derail the prime minister's plan to leave the customs union, to have an ""an open mind"" and listen to what she had to say, which would ""deal with a lot of the reservations that they have"". This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""Labour say they want to join a customs union, what does that mean?"" The Labour leadership is under pressure from some of their own MPs to join forces with Conservative rebels and the Lib Dems to back an amendment to the Trade Bill, currently making its way through Parliament, to stay in a customs union. Mr Fox said a vote on the bill, which had been due to take place next week, had been delayed because ""we want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument before we take the bill forward"". Sir Keir said the Labour leadership had not yet decided to back the rebel Tory amendments but claimed they were similar to ones that had been tabled by the Labour front bench. He said Mrs May did not have a majority in Parliament for staying out of a customs union and she would face a ""crunch"" vote ""sooner rather than later"" - although he denied Labour was engaged in a cynical attempt to remove her from office and force a general election. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith warned would-be Tory rebels Tory rebel Anna Soubry suggested she was ready to pull back if Mrs May announced measures that would amount to a customs agreement on Friday, telling BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ""It's absolutely beholden now on the government to get itself in the right place."" In his speech on Monday, Mr Corbyn will say the EU ""is not the root of all our problems and leaving it will not solve all our problems,"" adding: ""Brexit is what we make of it together, the priorities and choices we make in the negotiations."" More than 80 senior figures in the Labour Party have, meanwhile, urged Mr Corbyn to commit to remaining in the EU single market after Brexit. This video can not be played Labour MPs clash over party's Brexit policy In a statement seen by the Observer,external, figures including Lord Mandelson, pro-European backbencher Chuka Umunna, former leader Lord Kinnock, and trade union leaders said the party as a minimum ""must clearly and unambiguously"" set out to remain part of the European economic area. Although they regard Mr Corbyn's expected commitment on Monday as a ""step forward"", they said this falls ""way short"" of where Labour should be on Brexit. Mr Umunna warned leaving the single market and customs union would ""torpedo"" Labour's anti-austerity and industrial investment plans.

UK ticket holder wins Â£78m on Euromillions,"A UK ticket holder has won almost Â£78m after matching all seven numbers in Friday night's Euromillions draw. The lucky entrant was one of just two that matched all the numbers and has come forward to claim a half-share of the almost Â£156m rollover jackpot.
