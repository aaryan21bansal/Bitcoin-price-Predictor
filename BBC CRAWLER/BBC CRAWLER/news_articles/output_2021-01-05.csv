"Scotland hopes to accelerate vaccine rollout - FMNicola Sturgeon says the goal of vaccinating everyone on the priority list by May is a ""cautious prediction"".Scotland","The new Oxford vaccine was given to the first people on Monday Scotland hopes to accelerate its vaccine rollout programme if supplies of the jab allow it to do so, the country's first minister has said. The Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. If the target is achieved, it would mean 2.7 million people - about half of the population - will have had the jab. It would then be rolled out to the rest of the adult population. But Nicola Sturgeon said that timetable was a ""cautious prediction"", and the aim was to accelerate the rollout ""as fast as we possibly can"" as more details about supply became available. Ms Sturgeon was speaking as new lockdowns began in both Scotland and England, with people being told to stay at home except for a handful of permitted reasons. The tough restrictions will remain in force across all of mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha until at least the end of the month, and will see schools closed to most pupils, places of worship shut and group exercise banned. Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? 'Stay at home' lockdown order comes into force What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Speaking to theBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said it was difficult to be definitive about when the restrictions would be lifted. But she said it might be possible to ease some of the rules if the vaccination programme managed to push ahead of the virus in the ""race"" over the coming months. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Lockdown is about trying to slow down the virus and push rates of it back down. ""Now, if we manage to do that, then hopefully we will be able to start lifting some of these restrictions while the vaccination programme is ongoing, even in that first phase of it. ""But I can't be certain about that yet, because it's dependent on us managing to get the levels of infection down."" Cases of Covid have risen sharply in recent days Scotland hopes to have received just over 900,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of January - including the 100,000 doses that have already been administered to people. Ms Sturgeon said the government did not yet have full certainty about supply schedules after this month, but said details were being firmed up all the time. And she said a ""cautious prediction"" would be that ""we will have vaccinated the whole of the JCVI priority list by early May, which is everybody in Scotland above the age of 50 and people under 50 with underlying health conditions. ""That is about 2.7 million people, and we will then go on to the rest of the population. ""But we will be working as information on supplies becomes clearer to accelerate that timetable as fast as we possibly can."" The NHS in England has said it hopes to be able todeliver two million vaccines a weekby the end of this month. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to vaccinate people in the top four priority groups in England by mid-February - which would include everyone over the age of 70 and the most clinically vulnerable, as well as care home staff and residents and frontline health and social care workers. Ms Sturgeon later told her daily briefing that said she would ideally want to do the same, but that she did not yet have enough certainty about the supply of the vaccine to be able to make a firm commitment. She said this could risk ""undermining people's confidence in our ability to deliver"" if it was not possible to meet the timetable. Opposition parties have called on the Scottish government to publish daily vaccination figures so that the public can clearly see what progress is being made in the fight against Covid-19. A further 2,529 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, about half of which are thought to be the new variant. The number of hospital patients confirmed to have coronavirus has also risen steeply to 1,347, an increase of 255 over the past week. Of these patients, 93 are in intensive care, an increase of 28 in the same period, while a further 11 deaths of people who had tested positive have been recorded. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped pupils would be able to return to the classroom from 1 February The first minister also said she hoped the situation would have improved enough to allow pupils to return  to school on 1 February, but admitted that she cannot be certain that this will happen. The Scottish Conservatives have warned that the attainment gap between richer and poorer pupils is poised to stretch even wider unless the Scottish government radically increase their support for learning at home. The party says the government has had months to prepare for a return to remote learning, but that schools still do not have the necessary guidance and resources they need to provide equal access to high quality education. The Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, has also warned that closing schools poses a ""serious risk of harm to the wellbeing of children and young people"" and online learning is being provided ""inconsistently"" across Scotland. And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the closure of schools had left working parents in a very difficult position. Ms Sturgeon said plans were being developed to extend testing for the virus in schools, but said it would be ""wrong"" to divert vaccine doses away from the most vulnerable people so they could be given to teachers instead. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We are trying to work out, within the overall programme, how quickly can we prioritise getting teachers and school staff vaccinated, so we have some discussions and some thinking still to do around that."" She also said she could see no reason why the Scottish Parliament election would not go ahead in May, adding that it was ""really important"" that the democratic process continues. MSPs passed legislation last month which contains contingency options for the election. It could allow voting to take place on more than one day, though ministers do not expect this power will have to be used. A legally-enforceable stay-at-home order is now in place across mainland Scotland and Skye with people only permitted to leave their home for an ""essential purpose"". This includes essential shopping, exercise, caring for someone, or if you are part of an extended household. Anyone able to work from home must do so, although those shielding to protect themselves from Covid-19 should not go into work - even if they cannot work from home. Schools will be closed to most pupils until 1 February at the earliest, meaning an additional two weeks of home learning for youngsters, in a move welcomed by teaching unions on Monday. Ms Sturgeon also revised the numbers of those allowed to gather outside to just two people from two different households, instead of the previous limit of six people from two households. However children aged 11 and under are not included in this limit and can still ""play outdoors in larger groups, including in organised gatherings"". From Friday, places of worship must close but can open to broadcast a service or conduct a funeral, wedding or civil partnership. A maximum of 20 people can attend a funeral service but wakes are banned, while up to five people can attend weddings and civil partnership services. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone also confirmed there will be ""increased patrols"" in Scotland's communities and said and officers will continue to act against anyone making ""wilful breaches"" of the law. Shetland, Orkney, Western Isles and several other islands currently remain at level three restrictions. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

YouTube makes U-turn over TalkRadio ban,"YouTube has reinstated TalkRadio's channel on its platform hours after saying it had been ""terminated"" for breaking the tech firm's rules. It said the broadcaster had posted material that contradicted expert advice about the coronavirus pandemic. But it explained its U-turn saying it sometimes made exceptions to guidelines that state repeat offenders face a permanent ban. TalkRadio said it had yet to be given a full explanation for the affair. The decision to ban TalkRadio had appalled digital rights campaigners, with one group - Big Brother Watch - claiming it was evidence that ""big tech censorship is spiralling out of control"". The Google-owned service has issued a brief statement explaining its actions. ""TalkRadio's YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,"" it said. ""We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case."" YouTube has not published details of the offending posts. But independent fact-checkers haverepeatedly challenged,externalsome of theclaims made by interviewees,externalfeatured by the London-based radio station. YouTube operates a ""three strikes"" policy, whereby channels that break its community guidelines three times within a 90-day period can bepermanently banned,external, but other infractions lead to temporary restrictions. Prohibited content includes""medically unsubstantiated claims"" relating to Covid-19, and videos that contradictexpert consensus from local health authoritiessuch as the NHS. ""YouTube is making decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, even when they are sourced to responsible and regulated new providers,"" TalkRadiosaid in a statement this evening,external. ""This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate."" The broadcaster tweeted the statement minutes after YouTube's change of heart. It did not appear to be aware that its channel had been reinstated at the time, but hassince acknowledged the move,external. TalkRadio has about 424,000 listeners,external, according to the latest figures from market research provider Rajar. It uses YouTube as a means to livestream shows from its studios and to provide an archive of past broadcasts. Its channel on the platform has 242,000 subscribers. YouTube's action had meant that TalkRadio's website had featured articles featuring broken embedded clips for most of the day, and that users who had shared its clips would have been unable to view them. The US firm has previously imposed a permanent ban againstconspiracy theorist David Icke, and a one-week video suspension ofright-wing outlet One America News Network's ability to publish new clips - in both cases for breaches of its Covid rules.  It's pretty clear something has gone wrong at YouTube in the last 24 hours. It appeared as though TalkRadio had been banned for good on YouTube - or ""terminated"" as the company put it. YouTube is now saying it was a short suspension, which certainly seems like a backtrack. Even now, it's not obvious what the offending material was that caused this action. The whole process reinforces the idea that YouTube's moderation policies - where it draws the line between freedom of expression and clamping down on misinformation - can be messy and inconsistent. And when YouTube takes such an action without giving full details, it rains controversy down on its own head. This plays to a broader movement by YouTube and other social media companies to take a harder line on disinformation. Joe Biden is about to become US President - and he wants social media companies to do more to remove fake news. But as they are increasingly finding out, refereeing their own platforms can be hugely difficult, and this highlights the need for greater transparency about moderation decisions.

Control of US Senate up for grabs as Georgia votes,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

No police officers charged in Jacob Blake shooting,"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back No police officer will face charges over the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin - an incident which sparked protests in the US. Mr Blake was left paralysed from the waist down after being shot several times in the back as he got into a car where his three children were sitting. The shooting of Mr Blake, a black man, by white policeman Rusten Sheskey on 23 August aggravated racial tensions. Two people died and one was injured in another shooting in Kenosha days later. Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics? Paralysed Jacob Blake 'released from handcuffs' Kyle Rittenhouse, now 18, denied six charges including first-degree reckless homicide over those shootings when he appeared at a virtual arraignment with his lawyer, Mark Richards, on Tuesday. He was among many armed civilians who descended on the city in answer to calls from right-wing militia after Jacob Blake was shot. Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced that no criminal charges would be brought against Officer Sheskey. The shooting was captured on video by a bystander. The district attorney said he ""would have to disprove the clear expression of these officers that they had to fire a weapon to defend themselves"". ""I do not believe the state... would be able to prove that the privilege of self-defence is not available,"" he said,quoted by the Associated Press,external. Mr Graveley added that he had informed Mr Blake of the news before announcing his decision publicly. The Kenosha police union said Mr Blake had been armed with a knife and Officer Sheskey had ordered him several times to drop it but he had refused. The police officer's lawyer, Brendan Matthews, said Officer Sheskey had fired because Mr Blake had started turning towards him while holding a knife. However, state investigators said only that officers had seen a knife on the floor of the car and did not say whether Mr Blake had threatened anyone with it. The police officers involved were not equipped with body cameras. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' The person who shot the video, Raysean White, told CNN that before he had begun filming, he had seen police wrestle, punch and Taser Mr Blake. It was then that he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr White told AP he had heard police officers shout ""Drop the knife!"" before gunfire erupted but said he had not seen a knife in Mr Blake's hands. He is accused of shooting dead Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, and wounding a third man, during street unrest - in incidents also partially captured on video. This video can not be played Two people were killed and one injured during unrest in Kenosha after the shooting Mr Rittenhouse says the three men attacked him and he fired in self-defence.

Vocational exams allowed to go ahead in England,"Vocational exams, including BTEcs, are to go ahead this month in England - despite calls for them to be cancelled alongside GCSEs and A-levels. ""Schools and colleges can continue with the vocational and technical exams that are due to take place in January, where they judge it right to do so,"" said a Department for Education spokeswoman. Further education college leaders had complained this was unfair to students. They said students would face ""stress"" from taking exams in the lockdown. The Association of Colleges warned the decision, giving schools and colleges the option on whether to carry on with BTecs, would create more confusion. 'Why haven't our exams been cancelled too?' say BTec students 'Cancelled exams a big disappointment' Schools and colleges closed and GCSEs and A-levels cancelled Chief executive David Hughes said some colleges would cancel exams and others would continue - but without any clarity about what would happen to ""students in colleges which do cancel for safety reasons"". ""A national decision would have allowed for more fairness,"" said Mr Hughes. The announcement from the Department for Education has left it open for schools and colleges to decide whether to go ahead with vocational and technical exams. ""Schools and colleges have already implemented extensive protective measures to make them as safe as possible,"" said the DFE's spokeswoman. The Department for Education said it recognised ""this is a difficult time"" but wanted to allow students who had prepared for exams and assessments to continue, including those who needed to take hands-on practical tests for qualifications for jobs. A joint statement from the mayors of Manchester and Liverpool said it was wrong to go ahead with these vocational exams when other academic exams had been cancelled. ""It is unfair to ask these students to go into colleges when everyone else is being told to stay at home. ""This will cause unnecessary anxiety and concern just when they need to be able to focus,"" said the statement from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram. The mayors highlighted that students taking BTecs were more likely to be from ""working-class backgrounds and ethnic minority communities"" and they should not be treated any less well than those following an ""academic route"" in exams.

'Stay at home' to become law in NI on Friday,"Northern Ireland's lockdown is set to have further restrictions attached An order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home - to stop the spread of Covid-19 - will become legally enforceable from Friday. The executive agreed the move after it met on Tuesday and tightened other measures. It will mean people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise and work that cannot be done from home. NI is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. As it happened:Executive agrees new lockdown rules Ministers also agreed to a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to reintroduce enforcement powers for the PSNI to order people to go home if they are engaging in prohibited activity. Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Arlene Foster said people should not wait for the regulations to take effect and insisted people should already be staying at home. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland faced a ""difficult period ahead"", but that the interventions were necessary. However, she said the executive had not reached agreement on whether GCSE or A-level exams should go ahead, and that further meetings would need to take place later this week. ""We will also have an urgent meeting convened tomorrow with faith groups, hopefully moving them all to online services,"" she added. Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be reduced from 15 people to six and only from two households, which will include children under 12 - exemptions will apply such as support bubbles. People will no longer be allowed to meet with other households in private gardens, although similar exemptions will apply there too. However, people will be allowed to take exercise outdoors with one person from another household. The executive also supported a proposal from the health minister to make it a requirement for all employers to conduct a risk assessment where employees are required to work away from their home. Ministers agreed the measures will last until 6 February, and be reviewed along with other lockdown measures on 21 January. Many pupils willnot return to school until after the half-term breakin mid-February, with nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until then. However, ministers agreed that special schools will remain open as usual. Vulnerable children and children of key workers will have access to schools for supervised learning. Childcare settings will be allowed to remain open and childminders can continue their services. Payments to parents of children who receive free school meals will also continue, the Department of Education has confirmed. Discussions on exams took place, but ministers agreed to revisit this issue. Education Minister Peter Weir said: ""Work is ongoing on this issue as a matter of urgency and I intend to provide further clarity in the next couple of days. ""Until and unless any announcement is made, students should expect to continue to sit scheduled examinations."" On Tuesday evening, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said ""further flexibilities"" would be put in place for January exams and assessments, particularly in relation to BTecs. She said: ""Learning centres, including further education colleges, schools and training providers, will be afforded additional discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for learners to sit the scheduled BTec exams in January, taking into consideration a range of factors including health and safety and the personal circumstances of their learners."" It has also been confirmed thatpost-primary school transfer tests have been cancelledthis month due to the surge in the number of coronavirus cases. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, was due to take place on Saturday. But the Association for Quality Education (AQE) later announced that a single transfer test would be held on Saturday 27 February. The guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable - and had to shield during the first lockdown in March - is not expected to change. Ministers are due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday. England and Scotland begin new lockdowns How quickly can we jab our way out of lockdown? On Tuesday, a further 18 coronavirus-related deaths - 11 in the past 24 hours and seven in the past week - were recorded by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 1,384. The department recorded a further 1,378 cases of the virus, with 577 confirmed patients in hospital, 45 of whom are in intensive care. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the previous week. A vaccination programme started in Northern Ireland in December Northern Ireland's director of the Royal College of Surgeons warned the health service could soon struggle to deal with the number of people needing treatment. ""That's not just the Covid patients - it's the patients who have a heart attack, a stroke, the people who fall and break their hip,"" said Dr Mark Taylor. ""But the difficulty is the more the system is pulled to deal with Covid, the less ability we have to deal with other aspects. ""The more Covid overwhelms the intensive care units then we're into really difficult ethical decisions... which no doctor wants to make in terms of who requires that ventilator.""

US intelligence accuses Russia of cyber-hackPresident Trump initially accused China of the hack against US government agencies in December.Technology,"US intelligence agencies have said they believe Russia was behind the ""serious"" cyber compromise revealed in December. President Trump had previously suggested China might have been behind the hack, although other members of his administration had pointed the finger at Moscow. In a joint statement, the intelligence bodies say they currently believe fewer than 10 US government agencies saw their data compromised, although other organisations outside of government were also affected. They say work is still going on to understand the scope of the incident, which appears to have been aimed at gathering intelligence and which they say is ""ongoing"" a month after details first emerged. The update on the investigation came in a statement from a task force called the Cyber Unified Coordination Group which was set up to deal with the incident. It comprises intelligence and law enforcement agencies including the FBI and NSA. The group said it was still working to understand the scope of what had taken place. SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters Five Russian hacks that transformed US cyber-security 'Don't weaponise the net' warns former cyber-chief Eighteen thousand customers who used Orion product from the company Solar Winds were exposed but US intelligence says it believes a much smaller number saw follow-on activity from the hackers in which they stole data. The US Treasury was among those which previously acknowledged being targeted. ""This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,"" the statement said. Many organisations are having to scour their systems for signs that they may have been compromised. The incident sent shockwaves across the US partly because the breach was undiscovered for many months and was potentially far-reaching in terms of who it might have affected. It also suggested a degree of sophistication and stealth which was widely seen as a trademark of hackers from the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. This video can not be played Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody Soon after the incident was revealed, President Trump raised the possibility that China might be responsible, but members of his own administration including the secretary of state and attorney general pointed the finger at Moscow. The latest statement shows the assessment of US intelligence agencies is that Russia was behind it, although it does not go so far as accusing the Russian state itself, saying only that the actor was ""likely Russian in origin"". Moscow has denied playing any part. President-elect Joe Biden has previously said it was important to take ""meaningful steps"" to hold those responsible to account. It is not yet clear, though, what that might involve. While some US politicians suggested the breach might even be compared to an ""act of war"", most cyber-experts disputed this and the US intelligence community has now played down suggestions that it could have had destructive impact. Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now US cyber-security firm hit by 'state-sponsored' attack ""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort,"" the latest statement says. This is significant since it suggests no evidence has been found that this was preparatory activity for a more destructive cyber-attack which might switch off systems. This may limit the US response since espionage operations do not breach the cyber norms the US itself promotes (largely because it too carries out such intelligence-gathering operations against other nations). In December UK officials say they believed a small number of UK organisations were affected but said they did not believe they were in the public sector.

Schools in Wales stay shut until 18 January,"Classrooms in Wales will remain empty until 18 January at the earliest All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales. Some schools had been due to open on Wednesdayand others by 11 January withdecisions made by local authorities. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru. Teaching unions had called for a delayed start to termamid concerns about thecoronavirus variant. However, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans. Ms Williams said: ""As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term. ""This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information."" How many have died with Covid in Wales? 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins Education Minister Kirsty Williams made a video announcement Schools and colleges would remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments All childcare settings can remain open Universities in Wales have already agreed a staggered start to term Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed The announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increasedthe Covid threat level to five - its highest level. Level five warns of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"", according to theUK government's website,external. Wales has been under ""stay-at-home""lockdown restrictionssince 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, withmore than 31,000 casesin the two weeks over the Christmas period. A""flexible"" agreementon reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities. However, that decision has changed following the latest announcement. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: ""It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people. ""Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the ""best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus"". Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and ""not set in stone"". Laura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought ""much-needed clarity"". ""The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,"" she said. ""Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions."" Claire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was ""really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward"" although ""it's not the ideal"". Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left ""little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances"". ""It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,"" she said. There are more Covid patients in hospital beds than ever before - 2,688 on Sunday - which included a record number of more than 900 recovering patients too ill to be discharged There were also 136 patients in critical care with Covid, getting closer to the peak seen during the first wave in April Case rates have been falling on average in Wales in recent days, although there is some caution due to a fall in tests over the Christmas period.Wrexham and other parts of north east Wales have nevertheless reached their highest levels yet Bridgend has the highest case rate in Wales. Although falling, its proportion of positive cases - 36.5% - remains the highest in the UK Another25 deaths were reported by Public Health Wales,with the average of deaths running at around 34 a day in the most recent week Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties. It went into alevel four national lockdown on 20 December. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales New lockdown for England as cases surge Covid deniers removed from 'at capacity' hospital However, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. This delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day. And that's something the opposition parties have picked up on. With all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th. I'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set ofnew national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a""confusing picture""with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected. Schools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online. Scotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Most pupils in Northern Ireland werenot expected to return to schoolthis week as had been planned. Earlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a""last resort"".

Park stabbing murders 'acts of religious jihad',"Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A man who stabbed three people to death in a Reading park believed he was carrying out ""an act of religious jihad"", a court has heard. Khairi Saadallah, 26, stabbed to death James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, during the attack in Forbury Gardens in June. As part of his sentencing, a hearing will decide if he was motivated by a religious or ideological cause. The prosecution claim the stabbing spree was a terror attack. Saadallah has admitted three counts of murder and attempted murder, but denies he was motivated by an ideology. Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC told the court he ""executed"" his victims and intended to ""kill as many people as he could"" in the name of violent jihad. She said: ""In less than a minute, shouting Allahu Akhbar the defendant carried out a lethal attack with a knife, killing all three men before they had a chance to respond and try to defend themselves. ""Within the same minute, the defendant went on to attack others nearby, stabbing three more people, Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, causing them significant injuries."" The court was shown CCTV footage of Saadallah in Morrisons buying the knife he used in the attack Saadallah was captured on CCTV leaving his flat on the day of the attack Stating the prosecution's case she said the attack was ""carefully planned and executed"" by the defendant with ""determination and precision"". She added: ""The defendant believed that in carrying out this attack he was acting in pursuit of his extreme ideology, an ideology he appears to have held for some time. ""He believed that in killing as many people as possible that day he was performing an act of religious jihad."" After the attack Sadallah fled but was chased down by police, and later admitted the attacks in his cell, the court heard. In interviews with police he ""howled like a dog"" and claimed to have magic powers, which the prosecution said was a ""disingenuous"" attempt to suggest he had a mental disorder. ""After a careful period of assessment and treatment at Belmarsh prison, it is clear that he does not have a major mental illness"", a report by a psychiatrist read out in court said. This video can not be played A friend of the victims, Michael Main, said: ""They were always happy"" Saadallah arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in 2012, having fled the civil war in his home country of Libya in North Africa. The court heard the defendant, who had been refused asylum, had been involved with militias as part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. Between 2013 and 2020 he was repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences in the UK. While in HMP Bullingdon, Saadallah was observed to be keen to interact with radical preacher Omar Brooks - associated with banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun - who was also at the jail at the time, the court heard. He was released from the prison in June, days before the attack. Saadallah had been due to be deported, but was told by the government circumstances in Libya at the time were a ""legal barrier"". The court was told he had also searched on the internet ""how to disappear with magic"" and accessed a website with the flag associated with Islamic State. 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Victims of Reading stabbings 'died of neck wounds' Reading attack suspect 'known to MI5' A probation officer who had contact with Saadallah flagged his concerns about his mental health, but a psychiatrist has since concluded the attack on June 20 was ""unrelated to the effects of either mental disorder or substance misuse"". Saadallah, of Basingstoke Road in Reading, launched his attack as people enjoyed a summer Saturday evening in Forbury Gardens on 20 June. Eyewitnesses said he walked along a footpath when he suddenly ran towards a group of men sitting on the grass. History teacher Mr Furlong and Mr Ritchie-Bennett, a US citizen, were both stabbed once in the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed in the back. All three were pronounced dead at the scene. Three others - their friend Stephen Young, as well as Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting in a nearby group - were also injured by Saadallah. The sentencing before Mr Justice Sweeney is expected to conclude on January 11.

Business offered new grants to survive lockdown,"Businesses in retail, hospitality and leisure will receive new grants to help them keep afloat until spring, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The grants will be worth up to Â£9,000 per property, the Treasury says. Mr Sunak told the BBC he was ""committed to protecting jobs and supporting businesses"". Business groups welcomed the new help as a good start but warned the money still wouldn't be enough to save many firms from collapse. The help is in addition to business rates relief and the furlough scheme, which has been extended until the end of April. Firms do not have to pay the grant money back. Mr Sunak said he would consider whether or how to extend support packages in its Budget on 3 March. ""The Budget early in March is an excellent opportunity to take stock of the range of support we have put in place and set out the next stage of our economic response,"" he said. England and Scotland begin new lockdowns What are the rules where you live? Cambridgeshire businesses on what the grants will mean The director general of the CBI business group, Tony Danker, earlier warned leaving additional support until the Budget could be too late for many firms, saying. ""the comprehensive restrictions required a new comprehensive response"". It was a fear echoed by other business groups, the BCC and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). BCC director general, Adam Marshall, warned many smaller firms would not qualify for help and ""will be left struggling to see how this new top-up grant will help them out of their cashflow problems."" He also called for the support to be extended to firms in other sectors ""who are also feeling the devastating impacts of these restrictions."" FSB chair Mike Cherry also said the funds would be a lifeline to many, but ""do not go far enough to match the scale of the crisis that small firms are facing."" The British Beer & Pub Association described the grants as a ""lifeline"", but added that companies on which pubs rely, such as breweries, would also need help. Seb Heeley, owner of distillery Manchester Gin, says he needs dates to plan around Seb Heeley, owner of distillery Manchester Gin, told the BBC that fixed dates to aim for are crucial for his business. ""We need a date to work towards and we don't have that so, again, we're in limbo,"" he said. ""It takes three or four weeks"" to prepare, including retraining staff, he added. His business has been closed since October because of restrictions in the Manchester area. It borrowed money under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). ""We start repayment in June and there's good chance we won't be open, so they are going to have to extend that,"" he said. He said much of the Â£9,000 grant will be taken up by the Â£6,000 a month his business owes in pension contributions and national insurance alone. Mr Sunak said the new support would ""help businesses to get through the months ahead - and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen"". Businesses such as cafes, restaurants, leisure centres and shops that do not sell essentials have been particularly hard hit by coronavirus lockdown measures as people are told to stay at home. All non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues are now closed, with pubs and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks only. The new measures contained no additional support for self-employed people. Mel Stride, chair of parliament's Treasury Committee, which scrutinises the finance department's work, warned the chancellor ""must not forget those who have fallen through the gaps around previous support packages."" While this is welcome and essential support, it is now clear that the most optimistic timetable for economic lift-off from the pandemic is going to be put back. This raises questions about the length of the furlough scheme, and government-guaranteed loans. Before this, the best-case scenario was that mass vaccination, enabling a confident reopening of the economy, would allow furloughed workers to go straight back to their jobs in late spring. This was never the government's central forecast, but looked possible amid optimism about the vaccine last month. Even if all vulnerable people can be vaccinated by March, the first three months of the year will see school lockdowns which will harm growth, and therefore a possible double dip recession. Business groups which welcomed this support say they now need a clear long-term plan. They want to know that current levels of support will stay in place until most of the population is vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of self-employed workers who fell through the gaps of support remain under huge pressure, particularly ahead of the self assessment tax deadline. A decision on extending the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit will also be required. England's lockdown rules are due to be reviewed on 15 February while Scotland's will be reviewed at the end of January. In the UK, the unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. The Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, predicts the UK economy will have shrunk by 11.3% in 2020 - the biggest decline in 300 years.

Nigeria has introduced restrictions to try and contain the virus Police in Nigeriaâs Lagos state have raided several nightclubs, arresting 71 people for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols. The police say the raids happened in the Lekki and Surulere areas of Lagos city and the suspects will be prosecuted for allegedly violating guidelines put in place in an attempt to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Lagos state police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi told the BBC that the club-goers had allegedly violated a ban on large gatherings and the reopening of clubs and had broken a midnight to 04:00 curfew in the state. The authorities say they will intensify such raids to ensure ââtotal complianceââ with Covid-19 protocols. The arrests come as Nigeria continues to record a surge in coronavirus infections amid fears of a second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control announced 1,204 new infections - the countryâs highest confirmed daily cases so far. Nigeria has recorded 91,351 cases, with 75,699 recoveries and 1,318 deaths from the virus. Lagos state is the countryâs epicentre of the disease.

He said there were ""serious questions for the government to answer"" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but added that his party would support the restrictions - which MPs are due to vote on this Wednesday.

This was not the plan. At least not at the start of Monday. In the space of 36 hours, the government went from urging parents of primary pupils in England to send their children back to school - to shutting classrooms for almost all children for at least seven weeks and telling everyone to stay at home. So what changed? Find out from our political correspondent Nick Eardleyhere. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm There are continuing problems for people travelling from the UK to Sweden - Swedish
border police have confirmed to the BBC that 58 people making the journey have been turned away since the New Year, including 28 British
citizens. The release
of the figures follows days of travel confusion for Britons who are resident in
Sweden. They face extra hurdles returning to their Swedish base, due to a new
requirement to provide a negative coronavirus test result from 1 January,
alongside post-Brexit paperwork required to prove their right of residence in
Sweden. On Sunday
it emerged that some British passengers arriving with negative coronavirus
tests had nevertheless been told to return to the UK, while others refused and
spent the night on the floor or on plastic chairs at Gothenburgâs Landvetter
Airport. The UKâs Ambassador to Sweden Judith Gough raised concerns that there
was a need for âgreater clarity and consistencyâ over which types of Covid-19
tests were valid, and dispatched embassy staff to the airport on Monday. The
travellers were allowed to enter Sweden shortly afterwards. Swedish
border police have told the BBC that of the 28 British citizens turned away
since 1 January, 13 were registered residents of Sweden who did not have a
valid negative coronavirus test and five were not registered as living in
Sweden. Police were unable to provide firm information on the reason for the
denial of the other ten travellers.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that new restrictions to reduce contact will be introduced in order to curb rising infections. Nationwide measures, including closing schools and non-essential businesses were introduced in mid-December and were due to continue until 10 January. Germany has recorded more than 1.8 million coronavirus cases and 36,000 deaths since the pandemic began, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Ambulance workers in Los Angeles County, California, have been told not to transport hospital patients who have extremely low chances of survival. The directive comes as officials say the region could soon hit more than 1,000 Covid-related deaths per day, and hospitals are overrun with patients. Emergency workers have also been told to ration oxygen, which is in short supply due to the pandemic. Hospital beds in LA are running low and officials fear a post-holiday spike. New York City issued a similar directive to ambulance workers last April at the height of the city's Covid outbreak, instructing them not to bring in patients who could not be resuscitated at the scene. The LA County Department of Public Health reported 9,142 new Covid cases on Monday, and an additional 77 deaths. The county, which is the worst hit in the US, has recorded 818,000 coronavirus cases and more than 10,700 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Read morehere.

Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News If you're a reality television fan who follows your favourite stars online, chances are you have seen some of them jetting off to luxury destinations in recent weeks - despite rising infection rates and restrictions across the UK. With much of England first plunged into tier four and now lockdown, many seem to be wondering how all of these glamorous breaks have been able to go ahead at a time when millions are being told to stay at home. From a Love Island star facing charges for alleged Covid breaches in Barbados, to the Celtic football team drawing Scottish government criticism for travelling to Dubai for training - tabloids and social media have been full of scrutiny of these trips in recent days. So, what is going on and what do the rules say? BBC reporter Kelly-Leigh Cooper takes a closer look here. With the announcement of another lockdown and schools moving to remote learning the BBC is launching the biggest education offer in its history. Starting on Monday, each week day CBBC will have a three-hour block of primary school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, as well as other educational programming such as Our School and Celebrity Supply Teacher. Meanwhile, BBC Two will cater for secondary students with programming to support the GCSE curriculum, with a least two hours of content each weekday. The content will also be available on demand on theiPlayer. BBC director general Tim Davie says: ""Education is absolutely vital - the BBC is here to play its part and Iâm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly. On the UK's High Street, Topshop's store in Oxford Street is set to close its doors after 27 years. The High Street chain's owner Arcadia went into administration in November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. News of the sale of the three-storey building has prompted an outpouring of emotion on social media, with shoppers recounting how important the flagship store was to them. The store, which boasted a DJ booth, nail bar and food stalls, was a retail sensation when it opened in 1994. The sale of 214 Oxford Street, managed by agents Savills and Eastdil, follows the failure of Sir Philip Green's retail empire to secure funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. You can read the full story and see some of the farewell tributes being paid to the store here. Here's a reminder of the key points from today's briefing, as daily case figures in the UK rise above 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic began: The last question is from Dominic Yeatman from the Metro newspaper, whose reporter asks the PM whether he regrets allowing millions of children to go to school on Monday and delaying the lockdown by 24 hours. The PM says he wanted to keep children in school but the data he received on Monday about infection levels no longer supported it. Mr Johnson is also pressed on the cost to families of home learning amid claims some people are being charged up to Â£100 to access websites via pay-as-you-go mobile phones. The PM says the government will look at the costs involved and he wants to do everything he can to help parents. He then sums up the position the country finds itself in, saying the winter has been made much more difficult by the new variant and it is vital that people stick to the rules to help the country cope as the vaccination programme gathers pace. He closes by repeating the basic message that people must stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Prof Chris Whitty is asked whether the lockdown will be enough to reverse the spread of the virus. He says if everyone sticks to the rules ""really strongly"" and the NHS is vaccinating as fast as it can âthen our hope is the lockdown
will be enoughâ. But he says this will require a ""collective effort"", with everyone ""buying into this really seriously"". In the longer term, the chief medical officer says we all hope the vaccination programme will mean we donât need restrictions in the future. But he warns the virus ""is not going to go away"", saying we ""shouldnât kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring"" - although the risks will go down. âHopefully weâll have spring, summer, autumn, possibly winter
as well, with almost nothing in place, once the full vaccination programme is
through. But we just need to be aware of the fact this is not a problem
that just disappears.â Andy Woodcock from the Independent asks about testing for people arriving into the UK from abroad and why it wasn't done sooner. The prime minister says the government will be bringing in measures to ""ensure that we test people coming into this country and preventing the virus from being readmitted"". Responding to a second question on schools and whether teachers and pupils should be vaccinated, Prof Chris Whitty says there is no evidence of hospitals filling up with children and it appears, that even with the new variant, ""children are relatively much less affected than other groups"". He says from a clinical point of view the real priority is to vaccinate the people that we know ""are by far the most likely to die and by far most likely to end up in hospital"". He adds there will have to be decisions made once the most vulnerable groups are vaccinated but we are not yet at that stage. The chief medical officer adds that neither vaccine currently in use in the UK has been licensed for children yet. The prime minister is asked by Jason Groves from the Daily Mail what needs to happen to ensure the government meets its commitment to vaccinate around 13 million people in the next six weeks. Boris Johnson says this will be ""a huge effort"" and will require groups such as the NHS, the armed forces and every aspect of government to work together ""absolutely flat out"". âThe rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure we
can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough,"" he says. He adds that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine needs to be properly batch-tested and approved before it can be given to people, which takes time. Sky's Sam Coates asks the PM if he ""can look parents in the eye"" and tell them their children will be back in classrooms by the summer. Johnson says he shares the ""optimism and fundamental hope"" expressed by Chris Whitty earlier. He says a ""huge amount"" can be done to immunise the vulnerable and therefore speed-up school openings and other ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"". ""Things will be very different by spring and that is what I would say to every parent in the land."" On a separate question about the new variant, Chris Whitty says the threat at the moment is ""extraordinarily high"" if people do not adhere to the lockdown rules. He says vaccinations will reduce the risk going forward but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". Some curbs may be needed next winter,  he adds, citing the number of people who die each year from flu. It will be up to the government to decide what level of risk is tolerable going forward, he adds, suggesting that will ultimately be a political rather than a societal decision. Â© 2025 BBC.

"1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccineThat includes some of the most vulnerable patients who should soon have ""significant"" protection against the virus.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government. In England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a ""significant degree of immunity"" to the virus. He said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. The ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations. He defended the UK's policy of immunising more people with one dose immediately - rather than holding some stock back to give people a second booster shot - in order to save ""the most lives the fastest"".

How will the UK jab millions of people? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? Both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection. Initially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose. But when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the policy would now change - the new priority would be to give as many people a first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible. Everyone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that extending the gap between the first and second jabs would mean the number of people vaccinated can be doubled over three months. ""If over that period there is more than 50% protection then you have actually won. More people will have been protected than would have been otherwise. ""Our quite strong view is that protection is likely to be lot more than 50%."" Asked whether the longer gap could lead to an increase risk of the virus mutating into a version that could escape the vaccine, he said it was a worry, but a small one. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccines would probably need to be changed further down the line to continue to be a good match for the virus - but that this was relatively quick to do.

1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government. In England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a ""significant degree of immunity"" to the virus. He said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. The ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations.

Starmer calls for 'round the clock' vaccinations,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer: ""If we pull together as a nation, we can win"" Sir Keir Starmer has called for a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases. As part of a televised speech, the Labour leader said the government needed to deliver ""millions of doses a week by the end of the month"". He said there were ""serious questions for the government to answer"" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but Labour would support the restrictions. Boris Johnson said daily vaccination figures would be published from Monday. The prime minister has also said the four most vulnerable groups of people across the UK should receive their first dose by mid-February. Both the PM and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have announced lockdowns this week. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first time England's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. The restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. On Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. In an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a ""critical moment in our fight against coronavirus"". The Labour leader said people were ""angry at the mistakes the government has made"" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. He stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: ""Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together. ""At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives."" Sir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and ""join in this national effort"". But he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish ""a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme"" to ""deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery"". The Labour leader added: ""This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win. ""We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine."" Earlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save ""the most lives the fastest"". The PM said there will ""still be long weeks ahead"", but that he wanted to give ""maximum possible transparency"" about the vaccination roll-out. More details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, ""so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making"", he added. Asked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was ""realistic but not easy"".

BBC to put lessons on TV during lockdown,"Kate Thistleton will front new content from Bitesize Daily BBC TV is to help children keep up with their studies during the latest lockdown by broadcasting lessons on BBC Two and CBBC, as well as online. Schools have been closed to most children across the UK as part of tougher measures to control Covid-19. The BBC will show curriculum-based programmes on TV from Monday. They will include  three hours of primary school programming every weekday on CBBC, and at least two hours for secondary pupils on BBC Two. During the first lockdown in the spring, lessons were available on iPlayer, red button and online, but not on regular TV channels. The move comes amid concerns that low-income families may struggle to afford data packages for their children to take part in online learning. Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data fees Schools closed with heaviest of hearts, says Gove Joe Wicks online PE classes to return next week Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised the BBC's ""fantastic"" plans on Tuesday. BBC Director-General Tim Davie said ""education is absolutely vital"". He continued: ""The BBC is here to play its part and I'm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly."" The primary programmes, which will be broadcast on CBBC from 09:00 every day, will include BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily as well as Our School, Celebrity Supply Teacher, Horrible Histories and Operation Ouch. BBC Two will cater for secondary students with programming to support the GCSE curriculum, including adaptations of Shakespeare plays alongside science, history and factual titles. Bitesize Daily primary and secondary will also air every day on the red button as well as episodes being available on demand on iPlayer. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the BBC ""has helped the nation through some of the toughest moments of the last century"".

YouTube kicks TalkRadio off its platform,"YouTube has reinstated TalkRadio's channel on its platform hours after saying it had been ""terminated"" for breaking the tech firm's rules. It said the broadcaster had posted material that contradicted expert advice about the coronavirus pandemic. But it explained its U-turn saying it sometimes made exceptions to guidelines that state repeat offenders face a permanent ban. TalkRadio said it had yet to be given a full explanation for the affair. The decision to ban TalkRadio had appalled digital rights campaigners, with one group - Big Brother Watch - claiming it was evidence that ""big tech censorship is spiralling out of control"". The Google-owned service has issued a brief statement explaining its actions. ""TalkRadio's YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,"" it said. ""We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case."" YouTube has not published details of the offending posts. But independent fact-checkers haverepeatedly challenged,externalsome of theclaims made by interviewees,externalfeatured by the London-based radio station. YouTube operates a ""three strikes"" policy, whereby channels that break its community guidelines three times within a 90-day period can bepermanently banned,external, but other infractions lead to temporary restrictions. Prohibited content includes""medically unsubstantiated claims"" relating to Covid-19, and videos that contradictexpert consensus from local health authoritiessuch as the NHS. ""YouTube is making decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, even when they are sourced to responsible and regulated new providers,"" TalkRadiosaid in a statement this evening,external. ""This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate."" The broadcaster tweeted the statement minutes after YouTube's change of heart. It did not appear to be aware that its channel had been reinstated at the time, but hassince acknowledged the move,external. TalkRadio has about 424,000 listeners,external, according to the latest figures from market research provider Rajar. It uses YouTube as a means to livestream shows from its studios and to provide an archive of past broadcasts. Its channel on the platform has 242,000 subscribers. YouTube's action had meant that TalkRadio's website had featured articles featuring broken embedded clips for most of the day, and that users who had shared its clips would have been unable to view them. The US firm has previously imposed a permanent ban againstconspiracy theorist David Icke, and a one-week video suspension ofright-wing outlet One America News Network's ability to publish new clips - in both cases for breaches of its Covid rules.  It's pretty clear something has gone wrong at YouTube in the last 24 hours. It appeared as though TalkRadio had been banned for good on YouTube - or ""terminated"" as the company put it. YouTube is now saying it was a short suspension, which certainly seems like a backtrack. Even now, it's not obvious what the offending material was that caused this action. The whole process reinforces the idea that YouTube's moderation policies - where it draws the line between freedom of expression and clamping down on misinformation - can be messy and inconsistent. And when YouTube takes such an action without giving full details, it rains controversy down on its own head. This plays to a broader movement by YouTube and other social media companies to take a harder line on disinformation. Joe Biden is about to become US President - and he wants social media companies to do more to remove fake news. But as they are increasingly finding out, refereeing their own platforms can be hugely difficult, and this highlights the need for greater transparency about moderation decisions.

Urgent cancer ops cancelled in parts of London,"Potentially life-saving cancer operations have been put on hold at a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. King's College Hospital Trust has cancelled all ""Priority 2"" operations - those doctors judge need to be carried out within 28 days. Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country. And surgery has not been stopped on the same scale as during the first wave. Rebecca Thomas, who has had her bowel cancer surgery at King's College Hospital ""cancelled indefinitely"", told the BBC she felt like she had been left ""in limbo"". Until she has surgery her tumour cannot be studied to see how aggressive it is, and so she won't know until then how significant this wait will turn out to be. A spokesperson for the Trust, which mainly serves patients in south London, said: ""Due to the large increase in patients being admitted with Covid-19, including those requiring intensive care, we have taken the difficult decision to postpone all elective procedures, with the exception of cases where a delay would cause immediate harm. ""A small number of cancer patients due to be operated on this week have had their surgery postponed, with patients being kept under close review by senior doctors."" Prof Neil Mortensen, President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said he had heard from members that ""hospitals across London are having to cancel cancer surgeries as a result of the huge number of Covid-19 patients being hospitalised."" But it hasn't yet emerged as an issue affecting hospitals outside London. When Covid-19 hit last March, NHS England developed guidance on prioritising patients who needed operations, with emergency procedures that needed to be carried out within 24 hours coming first. These life-saving operations have continued throughout the pandemic and there is no prospect of that stopping. However, patients in the ""priority 2"" category - who should have surgery within 28 days, to save their life or stop their disease progressing ""beyond operability"" - have found their operations being cancelled at King's. The 28-day guideline is based on the patient's individual symptoms and the expected growth rate of their particular cancer. ""Delays further than that could have a negative impact on that person's chance of survival,"" according to Kruti Shrotri at Cancer Research UK. And delays in diagnosis and treatment in general can lead to worsening chances of recovery, she said. This will vary dramatically by person and cancer type, but in some cases, a matter of a few weeks can make the difference between a cancer that can be survived or not. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive at Bowel Cancer UK, said research showed ""even a month's delay to cancer treatment can increase a person's risk of dying by up to 13% - a risk that keeps rising the longer their treatment is delayed"". Cancer scan backlog raises late detection fears âI was desperate for a cancer manual â but there isnât oneâ While this was ""really concerning to hear,"" she said, ""it's not by and large something we've heard is happening widespread across the country"". This is an improvement from the first wave of Covid-19 when the NHS had to put a near-blanket ban on non-urgent surgery. But for those patients who are affected, this news will be ""incredibly hard,"" and Ms Shrotri stressed that patients with any symptoms that could be cancer should not put off going to see their GP. ""The NHS is open,"" she said. Surgery is most at risk because of the shortage of intensive care beds - but other forms of cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, should continue. NHS Providers, which represents hospital bosses in England, said trusts were doing all they could to ""prioritise on the basis of clinical need"".

Naked fugitive rescued by Australian fishermen,"Kev Joiner and Cam Faust heard the man crying for help while they were laying crab traps near Darwin Two fishermen have rescued a naked fugitive who they found clinging to trees over a crocodile-infested swamp in northern Australia. Kev Joiner and Cam Faust stumbled across the man in East Point near the city of Darwin on Sunday. The friends were laying crab traps when they heard the man crying for help, clinging to the branches of mangroves. They said the man begged them for water and said he had been out there for four days, living off snails. Australian TV network 9News said the 40-year-old man had allegedly breached bail for armed robbery. ""We didn't believe him at first,"" Mr Faust told the BBC. ""Then we realised he was in a bad way and done himself a mischief and were like oh, we better help him."" The man told the friends he had been out there for four days, living off snails Mr Faust said the man told them he went out on New Year's Eve to a concert, adding ""we thought he had a big night"". The fishermen allowed the man to hop on board their boat, with Mr Faust offering him his shorts to cover his modesty. ""He had scratches all over him, he was completely covered in mosquito bites, mud all over his face and his chest,""Mr Joiner told 9News,external. ""He was suffering pretty bad."" The fishermen shared a beer with the man as they ferried him to safety The friends said the man was lucky they found him, as the mangroves in East Point can be dangerous. Crocodiles are known to inhabit the swamps around Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. While ferrying him to shore, the fishermen shared a beer with the man and called an ambulance, which met them at a boat ramp. The fishermen called an ambulance for the man, who was later taken into custody Police confirmed to Australian media that the man was a fugitive who had escaped custody days earlier. He was arrested and is being treated for exposure at Royal Darwin Hospital. ""He's in hospital with handcuffs on with two cops babysitting him,"" Mr Faust told 9News.

Paperchase on the brink of administration,"Stationery chain Paperchase is on the brink of administration after most of its stores were forced to close over the Christmas period. The firm has filed a notice to appoint administrators, a move that will give it breathing space from its creditors while it works out a rescue plan. The company has 127 stores and about 1,500 employees. The second lockdown in November came at a crucial period for the firm, which makes a high proportion of sales then. Just under half its sales, 40%, come from trade in November and December. Paperchase said: ""The cumulative effects of lockdown one, lockdown two - at the start of the Christmas shopping period - and now the current restrictions have put unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country."" The company went through an insolvency process, known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement or CVA, almost two years ago to cut costs. The chain now has 10 working days to find a solution. Paperchase said its strong online trading had not made it ""immune"" from the impact of shop closures across the country. ""Out of lockdown we've traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase,"" it added. ""We are working hard to find that solution and this [notice of administration] is a necessary part of this work. This is not the situation we wanted to be in. The chain is the latest of a string of high-profile retailers to hit trouble in the past year. The sector was already battling with the shift to online sales, coupled with rising costs, including rents and higher minimum wages. Coronavirus restrictions which shut non-essential shops piled on the pressure. Others that have run into trouble recently include Debenhams, which last month said it would cease trading putting 12,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, has also gone into administration, putting a further 13,000 jobs at risk. Meanwhile, Edinburgh Woollen Mills' brands Peacocks and Jaeger also fell into administration in November, putting 21,000 jobs at risk. And earlier last year, Oasis and Warehouse fell into administration in mid-April after failing to find buyers, and online fashion group Boohoo said in June it was buying the brands but closing all stores.

"Starmer calls for 'round the clock' vaccinationsIn a TV address, Labour's leader says millions of doses need to be given each week by the end of January.UK Politics","This video can not be played Keir Starmer: ""If we pull together as a nation, we can win"" Sir Keir Starmer has called for a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases. As part of a televised speech, the Labour leader said the government needed to deliver ""millions of doses a week by the end of the month"". He said there were ""serious questions for the government to answer"" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but Labour would support the restrictions. Boris Johnson said daily vaccination figures would be published from Monday. The prime minister has also said the four most vulnerable groups of people across the UK should receive their first dose by mid-February. Both the PM and Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, have announced lockdowns this week. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. 1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccine When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first time England's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. The restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. On Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. In an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a ""critical moment in our fight against coronavirus"". The Labour leader said people were ""angry at the mistakes the government has made"" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. He stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: ""Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together. ""At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives."" Sir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and ""join in this national effort"". But he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish ""a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme"" to ""deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery"". The Labour leader added: ""This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win. ""We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine."" Earlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save ""the most lives the fastest"". The PM said there will ""still be long weeks ahead"", but that he wanted to give ""maximum possible transparency"" about the vaccination roll-out. More details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, ""so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making"", he added. Asked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was ""realistic but not easy"".

""There are 25 million pay-as-you go customers in the UK, and about seven million of those struggle with the cost of topping up their data,"" commented Chris Thorpe from the Centre For The Acceleration Of Social Technology charity.

Park stabbing murders 'acts of religious jihad'A hearing will decide whether Khairi Saadallah was motivated by a religious or ideological cause.Berkshire,"Khairi Saadallah admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A man who stabbed three people to death in a Reading park believed he was carrying out ""an act of religious jihad"", a court has heard. Khairi Saadallah, 26, stabbed to death James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, during the attack in Forbury Gardens in June. As part of his sentencing, a hearing will decide if he was motivated by a religious or ideological cause. The prosecution claim the stabbing spree was a terror attack. Saadallah has admitted three counts of murder and attempted murder, but denies he was motivated by an ideology. Prosecutor Alison Morgan QC told the court he ""executed"" his victims and intended to ""kill as many people as he could"" in the name of violent jihad. She said: ""In less than a minute, shouting Allahu Akhbar the defendant carried out a lethal attack with a knife, killing all three men before they had a chance to respond and try to defend themselves. ""Within the same minute, the defendant went on to attack others nearby, stabbing three more people, Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, causing them significant injuries."" The court was shown CCTV footage of Saadallah in Morrisons buying the knife he used in the attack Saadallah was captured on CCTV leaving his flat on the day of the attack Stating the prosecution's case she said the attack was ""carefully planned and executed"" by the defendant with ""determination and precision"". She added: ""The defendant believed that in carrying out this attack he was acting in pursuit of his extreme ideology, an ideology he appears to have held for some time. ""He believed that in killing as many people as possible that day he was performing an act of religious jihad."" After the attack Sadallah fled but was chased down by police, and later admitted the attacks in his cell, the court heard. In interviews with police he ""howled like a dog"" and claimed to have magic powers, which the prosecution said was a ""disingenuous"" attempt to suggest he had a mental disorder. ""After a careful period of assessment and treatment at Belmarsh prison, it is clear that he does not have a major mental illness"", a report by a psychiatrist read out in court said. This video can not be played A friend of the victims, Michael Main, said: ""They were always happy"" Saadallah arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker in 2012, having fled the civil war in his home country of Libya in North Africa. The court heard the defendant, who had been refused asylum, had been involved with militias as part of the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi. Between 2013 and 2020 he was repeatedly arrested and convicted of various offences in the UK. While in HMP Bullingdon, Saadallah was observed to be keen to interact with radical preacher Omar Brooks - associated with banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun - who was also at the jail at the time, the court heard. He was released from the prison in June, days before the attack. Saadallah had been due to be deported, but was told by the government circumstances in Libya at the time were a ""legal barrier"". The court was told he had also searched on the internet ""how to disappear with magic"" and accessed a website with the flag associated with Islamic State. 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Victims of Reading stabbings 'died of neck wounds' Reading attack suspect 'known to MI5' A probation officer who had contact with Saadallah flagged his concerns about his mental health, but a psychiatrist has since concluded the attack on June 20 was ""unrelated to the effects of either mental disorder or substance misuse"". Saadallah, of Basingstoke Road in Reading, launched his attack as people enjoyed a summer Saturday evening in Forbury Gardens on 20 June. Eyewitnesses said he walked along a footpath when he suddenly ran towards a group of men sitting on the grass. History teacher Mr Furlong and Mr Ritchie-Bennett, a US citizen, were both stabbed once in the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed in the back. All three were pronounced dead at the scene. Three others - their friend Stephen Young, as well as Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting in a nearby group - were also injured by Saadallah. The sentencing before Mr Justice Sweeney is expected to conclude on January 11.

Firms cancel holiday bookings as lockdown begins,"Virgin Holidays has become the latest travel firm to cancel holidays after new coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed. It said schedules will be cancelled until mid-February, joining similar moves by Tui, Jet2 and Thomas Cook. The companies said customers would be contacted about their future travel options during what Virgin described as ""these extraordinary circumstances"". Thomas Cook said it will call customers to offer refunds or rebooking. Tui said it was ""cancelling all holidays in line with international travel restrictions"". It added that said customers due to depart from England, Scotland and Wales would be contacted to discuss options. The company said that customers due to travel from an English airport before mid-February, or from a Scottish or Welsh airport up to 31 January, would not be able to do so. Those customers will be contacted ""in departure date order to discuss their options"", Tui said, which include rebooking ""with an incentive"", getting a credit note, or a full refund. ""Customers currently overseas can continue to enjoy their holidays as planned and we will update them directly if there are any changes to their holidays,"" Tui added. Tui cancelled a flight to St Lucia on Tuesday In a statement, Virgin said: ""In line with the new national lockdown restrictions we have reviewed the upcoming holiday schedule and will be cancelling all holidays up to and including 14 February 2021. ""To simplify the options and to provide immediate peace of mind for customers whose holidays will no longer be going ahead, we're automatically providing a digital voucher for the value of their trip, redeemable up until 30 September 2021, which they can use to rebook a holiday, departing any time before 31 December 2022."" Virgin added that customers ""may also request a refund"". Meanwhile, Jet2 said it was extending ""the suspension of flights and holidays up to and including 11 February 2021"". A spokesman said: ""For customers due to travel from 12th February onwards, we will provide another update closer to the time."" Thomas Cook, which became an online-only travel brand in September after its earlier collapse, said: ""Following the announcement of the latest lockdown, we are calling our customers to offer refunds or move their holidays to a later date."". Chief executive Alan French said: ""We've seen over the festive period that customers are looking ahead to the summer and beginning to book in earnest for those important summer weeks in the sun. ""I am sure that after many more weeks spent at home - and with the progress of the vaccine rollout - we will see an even bigger demand for people to escape to the beach this summer."" Last month, a number of countries suspended routes to the UK due to the rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus. The blanket travel ban to the EU was then lifted, but withrules varying from country to country. The suspension of flights between the UK and China remains in place. Last year Tui was investigated by competition authorities aftercomplaints that it had not given prompt refunds. British Airways Holidays, part of Britain's biggest airline, said it would be offering refunds if customers are no longer allowed travel. The firm said in a statement: ""We are contacting all affected British Airways Holidays customers following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions. ""Customers due to depart by 12 February 2021 will be offered a refund for their holiday. Our teams continue to monitor the situation and update our policy accordingly.""

"1.3 million in UK have had their Covid vaccineThat includes some of the most vulnerable patients who should soon have ""significant"" protection against the virus.Health","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" Some 1.3 million people in the UK have now received their first dose of a Covid vaccine, says the government. In England, that includes nearly a quarter of the most elderly, vulnerable patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it meant that within a two to three weeks they should have a ""significant degree of immunity"" to the virus. He said there would be a ramping up to get more people immunised - up to 2 million a week. The ambition is to vaccinate all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February. That will require around 13 million vaccinations. He defended the UK's policy of immunising more people with one dose immediately - rather than holding some stock back to give people a second booster shot - in order to save ""the most lives the fastest"". US regulators have questioned the policy, saying it is premature without more trial evidence, but the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency says it is a pragmatic decision to protect more people. How will the UK jab millions of people? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Covid vaccine: When will you be eligible? Both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection. Initially, the strategy for the Pfizer vaccine was to offer people the second dose 21 days after their initial jab - full immunity starts seven days after the second dose. But when approval was announced for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on 30 December, it was also announced that the policy would now change - the new priority would be to give as many people a first shot of either vaccine, rather than providing the required two doses in as short a time as possible. Everyone will still receive their second dose, but this will now be within 12 weeks of their first. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty told the Downing Street press conference that extending the gap between the first and second jabs would mean the number of people vaccinated can be doubled over three months. ""If over that period there is more than 50% protection then you have actually won. More people will have been protected than would have been otherwise. ""Our quite strong view is that protection is likely to be lot more than 50%."" Asked whether the longer gap could lead to an increase risk of the virus mutating into a version that could escape the vaccine, he said it was a worry, but a small one. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccines would probably need to be changed further down the line to continue to be a good match for the virus - but that this was relatively quick to do. One of the exciting things about the science of the RNA vaccines is that they are incredibly fast to make in response to new mutations, he said.

"Schools closed with heaviest of hearts, says GoveGCSE and A-level exams are cancelled, but BTecs due to be taken this week are to go ahead.Family & Education","Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the replacement for exams needed to be ""as fair as possible"" The government closed schools in England with ""the heaviest of hearts"", Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said, as he confirmed this year's GCSE and A-level exams have been cancelled. The decision was made after the UK's chief medical officers recommended a move to Covid threat level five. Mr Gove said teacher-led assessments would have to be used and efforts would be made to ensure grades are fair. However, there are growing calls for vocational exams to be cancelled. Many BTecs and technical exams are due to take place in the coming days, but head teachers and college leaders say it would be impossible to hold them and unfair to candidates. The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region also called for the exams to be binned. In a statement, they said: ""It is unfair to ask these students to go into colleges when everyone else is being told to stay at home and schools and colleges are closed to the majority of students. ""This will cause unnecessary anxiety and concern just when they need to be able to focus. ""Secondly, students in the Liverpool and Greater Manchester City Regions have faced restrictions for far longer, with more time being spent out of college, than students in other parts of the country, therefore these exams will not be a level playing field."" All primary and secondary schools are closed to pupils, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, for the next six weeks. Teaching will continue remotely. But nurseries and early years settings are being told to remain open. Providers says they are concerned about the risk to staff and the wider community. One head teacher, Neil Strowger from Bohunt School in Hampshire, said he was ""bitterly disappointed and quite upset"" for students who have suffered so much disruption this year and ""fearful"" about what it would mean for them.

Mr Gove said the Department for Education was working with exams regulator Ofqual, to find a way to assess students that is fair, Education secretary Gavin Williamson is expected to make a statement on exams in Wednesday, but it is understood that work is ongoing to plan for what will replace them. Summer exams were cancelled weeks ago on Scotland and Wales, with a range of methods of internal school assessment to be used instead to judge pupils' progress. Some exams are due to go ahead in Northern Ireland. By Hannah Richardson, BBC News education reporter It was the step the government said it would never take - closing schools again in England to all but a small number of children. Again and again we were told education was the priority and schools would remain fully open. The Department for Education stood firm against a crescendo of calls for a circuit-breaker during the October half-term, then against an early holiday in December. Self-isolating teachers were going to extraordinary lengths to teach remotely from home, while heads created one-way systems, sanitiser stations and installed temperature scanners in school receptions. But the attendance figures were showing week after week how the virus was impacting on pupils' ability to show up. For a while, mass testing of pupils seemed to be the answer, but the short time available for head teachers to set this up made it a non-starter. In the end it was the pressure on the NHS, caused by the new, more contagious variant of coronavirus, which sounded the closing bell for schools. To shut them was the only lever government had left to pull to try to turn the tanker as a new tide of Covid cases began sweeping the nation. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be unfair to run the vocational exams. And the Association of Colleges, which represents further education colleges where many exams are due to be taken, has written to the government calling for vocational and technical exams to be cancelled ""without delay"". It also argued there may be difficulties in finding invigilators to actually run the exams. And nursery providers are questioning how it can be safe to open early years settings, but not schools. Neil Leitch, chief executive of Early Years Alliance, said: ""Many of those working in the early years feel terrified and abandoned by the government. They are being asked to remain on the frontline during the most worrying period of a global pandemic with no PPE, no testing and no access to vaccinations.""

She said: ""A lot of pupils still don't have laptops. They are surviving on broken phones - those children now need to be seen as a priority to get into the classroom and deemed to be a vulnerable child."" It is understood Ofsted inspectors may be asked to monitor how well schools are providing remote learning. Technology companies and broadband providers needed to ""step up""and address the cost of data for remote learning, which was another obstacle for some families, Ms Longfield said.

Why did schools reopen for a day?,"England is under a third national lockdown to try to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed, amid high coronavirus infections. The decision came after UK chief medical officers recommended that the Covid threat level be increased to five - the maximum level. The government has publisheddetails about things you can and can't do,external- which have prompted a number of questions. The government has decided to close both primary and secondary schools, but not nurseries. At a briefing, Boris Johnson was asked by a member of the public why this was the case. The Prime Minister said he believed ""all places of education are safe"" but that there were ""very, very important reasons"" to keep early years provision open, because it would help key workers and vital services to continue. But all educational settings remain open to key workers, including primary and secondary schools. When asked a similar question by the BBC on Monday, Chris Whitty gave a broader answer, saying, ""The reason that nursery schools are open is to allow people who need to go to work or need to do particular activities, to do so. And we all do know that children are very, very low risk of this virus relative to other ages, so it's not zero risks but it's a very low risk."" The government has been advised younger children are less likely to pass on coronavirus than older children. In theSage minutes from 22 December,external, the scientific advisers say the ""closure of secondary schools [is] likely to have a greater effect than closure of primary schools"". But outbreaks have been linked to nurseries. Since September, 10% of coronavirus outbreaks or clusters in educational settings have taken place in an early years setting,according to Public Health England.,external Coronavirus poses amuch lower risk to younger childrenand there is limited evidence it spreads in that age group. Scientists are still investigating the new variant, but there is no evidence it causes more severe illness in any age group. Primary schools in many parts of the country welcomed pupils back on the Monday after the holidays. But after one day of in-person teaching they closed again to the majority of children, who are now learning remotely. The prime minister said in his statement on the Monday evening: ""Parents whose children were in school today may reasonably ask why we did not take this decision sooner."" He stressed that children would still be safe at school, but that they were being closed because they could ""act as vectors for transmission, causing the virus to spread between households"". But on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday - the day before - Mr Johnson said: ""There is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe and that education is a priority,"" and urged parents of primary school children to take them to school if their schools were opening. The government says it had to act after thecoronavirus risk was raised to level fivethe day that schools reopened. This had never happened before and indicates there is a risk of the health service being overwhelmed. At his press conference on the Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he had wanted to do everything possible to keep schools open, ""but, alas yesterday, it became clear that the data simply was not going to support that"". Scientists and governments understand more about the transmission risks posed by different settings than they did last spring. But the rationale for why some activities and services thought too risky during the first lockdown are still allowed, remains unclear. We asked the Cabinet Office to explain, but it directed us back to the prime minister's lockdown speech. What are England's lockdown rules? While indoor and outdoor sports facilities are closed to almost all of the general public, elite sport will be allowed to continue. Elite sportspeople and those on official elite pathway programmes can continue to train, and will compete behind closed doors. Mr Johnson said last spring that the decision to allow elite sport to resume would ""provide a much-needed boost to national morale"". Broadcasting sporting events undoubtedly provides a boost to fans, who can watch from their own homes, while athletes are being regularly tested for coronavirus. But there have been numerous incidents of Premiership football players reportedly breaking coronavirus restrictions, and of matches having to be postponed after players tested positive. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport told us that ""rigorous protocols"" have been put in place by sport governing bodies, and that when elite athletes are not training or competing ""they must adhere to wider public guidance"". Unlike in March, places of worship are also allowed to open in England, although they are closed in Scotland. Places of worship provide spiritual leadership for many and bring communities together, but their ""communal nature"" also makes them  ""vulnerable to the spread of coronavirus"", the government says in itsguidance for England,external. However, when the lockdown was announced, the Archbishop of Canterbury tweeted: ""The government hasn't suspended public worship, but some may feel it better not to attend in person, and some parishes are expected to offer online services only for now."" Sage haspreviously suggested,externalthat closing places of worship would only have a low-to-moderate impact on overall coronavirus transmission, but that the setting posed a high risk to vulnerable groups. During this lockdown, the law says people must only leave their homes for a ""reasonable excuse"" - such as to exercise or do essential shopping. Breaching this could result in a fine of Â£200 for the first offence, doubling for further offences up to a maximum of Â£6,400. The Metropolitan Policehas said that,externalLondoners breaching the Covid restrictions will be more likely to face fines in this lockdown, having instructed officers ""to issue fines more quickly to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches"". It says this means that people attended illegal gatherings or parties can expect to be fined instead of just the organisers and ""those not wearing masks where they should be and without good reason can expect to be fined - not reasoned with"". Since March, at least 25,000 fines have been given out in England and Wales, with most of these during the first lockdown for leaving home without a reasonable excuse. Fines were used far less over the course of the second lockdown. A return of tougher rules (with fewer ""reasonable excuses"") could see these fines increase again. However, the Police Federation has warned that during this lockdown, there could be added pressure on policing due to officers being off sick or self-isolating - affecting up to 15% of some police forces.

Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April.

However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

""You have to be on red alert. It's quite nerve-wracking,"" she added. Nigeria has introduced restrictions to try and contain the virus Police in Nigeriaâs Lagos state have raided several nightclubs, arresting 71 people for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols. The police say the raids happened in the Lekki and Surulere areas of Lagos city and the suspects will be prosecuted for allegedly violating guidelines put in place in an attempt to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Lagos state police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi told the BBC that the club-goers had allegedly violated a ban on large gatherings and the reopening of clubs and had broken a midnight to 04:00 curfew in the state. The authorities say they will intensify such raids to ensure ââtotal complianceââ with Covid-19 protocols. The arrests come as Nigeria continues to record a surge in coronavirus infections amid fears of a second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control announced 1,204 new infections - the countryâs highest confirmed daily cases so far. Nigeria has recorded 91,351 cases, with 75,699 recoveries and 1,318 deaths from the virus. Lagos state is the countryâs epicentre of the disease. This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer backs England lockdown Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases. As part of a televised speech on BBC One, he called on the government to use the lockdown in England to establish ""a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme"" to ""deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery"". He said there were ""serious questions for the government to answer"" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but added that his party would support the restrictions - which MPs are due to vote on this Wednesday. The Labour leader said the UK had reached a ""critical moment in our fight against coronavirus, but added: ""Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together. ""At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month, MPs are told. The House of Commons culture select committeeis carrying out an inquiry into the viability of this summer's events,external, after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the 2020 festival season. Tuesday's hearing came a day after Glastonbury festival organiserEmily Eavis assured fans,externalthe 2021 event hasn't been cancelled. The committee has been told the government needs to introduce Covid cancellation insurance for live events and an extension to the current VAT cut on concert tickets. The UK live music industry was worth Â£1.3bn in 2019 - but it has been hit hard by the pandemic, with more than 90% of the gigs planned for 2020 cancelled. Before Tuesday's hearing, music industry trade body UK Music called on MPs to name a ""restart date"" after which gigs can go ahead. The lack of coronavirus insurance is the ""biggest barrier"" to events resuming, it says, pointing out Germany has recently announced a Â£2.3bn event cancellation fund, in line with several other European countries.

As we heard earlier in today's briefing, Prof Chris Whitty warned of the risks posed by the new coronavirus variant if people do not adhere to newly imposed lockdown rules. Professor Whitty said the element of risk will reduce as people continue to get vaccinated but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". This video can not be played Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent We are used to events moving quickly in this pandemic, but how did we get from Boris Johnson urging parents to send their children back to school, to announcing a strict lockdown for England the next day? This was not the plan. At least not at the start of Monday. In the space of 36 hours, the government went from urging parents of primary pupils in England to send their children back to school - to shutting classrooms for almost all children for at least seven weeks and telling everyone to stay at home. So what changed? Find out from our political correspondent Nick Eardleyhere. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm There are continuing problems for people travelling from the UK to Sweden - Swedish
border police have confirmed to the BBC that 58 people making the journey have been turned away since the New Year, including 28 British
citizens. The release
of the figures follows days of travel confusion for Britons who are resident in
Sweden. They face extra hurdles returning to their Swedish base, due to a new
requirement to provide a negative coronavirus test result from 1 January,
alongside post-Brexit paperwork required to prove their right of residence in
Sweden. On Sunday
it emerged that some British passengers arriving with negative coronavirus
tests had nevertheless been told to return to the UK, while others refused and
spent the night on the floor or on plastic chairs at Gothenburgâs Landvetter
Airport. The UKâs Ambassador to Sweden Judith Gough raised concerns that there
was a need for âgreater clarity and consistencyâ over which types of Covid-19
tests were valid, and dispatched embassy staff to the airport on Monday. The
travellers were allowed to enter Sweden shortly afterwards. Swedish
border police have told the BBC that of the 28 British citizens turned away
since 1 January, 13 were registered residents of Sweden who did not have a
valid negative coronavirus test and five were not registered as living in
Sweden. Police were unable to provide firm information on the reason for the
denial of the other ten travellers.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that new restrictions to reduce contact will be introduced in order to curb rising infections. Nationwide measures, including closing schools and non-essential businesses were introduced in mid-December and were due to continue until 10 January. Germany has recorded more than 1.8 million coronavirus cases and 36,000 deaths since the pandemic began, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Ambulance workers in Los Angeles County, California, have been told not to transport hospital patients who have extremely low chances of survival. The directive comes as officials say the region could soon hit more than 1,000 Covid-related deaths per day, and hospitals are overrun with patients. Emergency workers have also been told to ration oxygen, which is in short supply due to the pandemic. Hospital beds in LA are running low and officials fear a post-holiday spike. New York City issued a similar directive to ambulance workers last April at the height of the city's Covid outbreak, instructing them not to bring in patients who could not be resuscitated at the scene. The LA County Department of Public Health reported 9,142 new Covid cases on Monday, and an additional 77 deaths. The county, which is the worst hit in the US, has recorded 818,000 coronavirus cases and more than 10,700 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Read morehere. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Buckingham Palace says there will be no garden parties this year - in either London or Edinburgh. The social events are normally staged at Buckingham Palace in London and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and the decision comes as England enters its third national lockdown and mainland Scotland sees the introduction of similar restrictions. A palace spokesman says: ""The decision has been taken that garden parties will not take place in 2021."" Garden parties were cancelled during 2020 following the first UK lockdown. Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News If you're a reality television fan who follows your favourite stars online, chances are you have seen some of them jetting off to luxury destinations in recent weeks - despite rising infection rates and restrictions across the UK. With much of England first plunged into tier four and now lockdown, many seem to be wondering how all of these glamorous breaks have been able to go ahead at a time when millions are being told to stay at home. From a Love Island star facing charges for alleged Covid breaches in Barbados, to the Celtic football team drawing Scottish government criticism for travelling to Dubai for training - tabloids and social media have been full of scrutiny of these trips in recent days. So, what is going on and what do the rules say? BBC reporter Kelly-Leigh Cooper takes a closer look here. With the announcement of another lockdown and schools moving to remote learning the BBC is launching the biggest education offer in its history. Starting on Monday, each week day CBBC will have a three-hour block of primary school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, as well as other educational programming such as Our School and Celebrity Supply Teacher. Meanwhile, BBC Two will cater for secondary students with programming to support the GCSE curriculum, with a least two hours of content each weekday. The content will also be available on demand on theiPlayer. BBC director general Tim Davie says: ""Education is absolutely vital - the BBC is here to play its part and Iâm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly. On the UK's High Street, Topshop's store in Oxford Street is set to close its doors after 27 years. The High Street chain's owner Arcadia went into administration in November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. News of the sale of the three-storey building has prompted an outpouring of emotion on social media, with shoppers recounting how important the flagship store was to them. The store, which boasted a DJ booth, nail bar and food stalls, was a retail sensation when it opened in 1994. The sale of 214 Oxford Street, managed by agents Savills and Eastdil, follows the failure of Sir Philip Green's retail empire to secure funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. You can read the full story and see some of the farewell tributes being paid to the store here. Here's a reminder of the key points from today's briefing, as daily case figures in the UK rise above 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic began: The last question is from Dominic Yeatman from the Metro newspaper, whose reporter asks the PM whether he regrets allowing millions of children to go to school on Monday and delaying the lockdown by 24 hours. The PM says he wanted to keep children in school but the data he received on Monday about infection levels no longer supported it. Mr Johnson is also pressed on the cost to families of home learning amid claims some people are being charged up to Â£100 to access websites via pay-as-you-go mobile phones. The PM says the government will look at the costs involved and he wants to do everything he can to help parents. He then sums up the position the country finds itself in, saying the winter has been made much more difficult by the new variant and it is vital that people stick to the rules to help the country cope as the vaccination programme gathers pace. He closes by repeating the basic message that people must stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Prof Chris Whitty is asked whether the lockdown will be enough to reverse the spread of the virus. He says if everyone sticks to the rules ""really strongly"" and the NHS is vaccinating as fast as it can âthen our hope is the lockdown
will be enoughâ. But he says this will require a ""collective effort"", with everyone ""buying into this really seriously"". In the longer term, the chief medical officer says we all hope the vaccination programme will mean we donât need restrictions in the future. But he warns the virus ""is not going to go away"", saying we ""shouldnât kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring"" - although the risks will go down. âHopefully weâll have spring, summer, autumn, possibly winter
as well, with almost nothing in place, once the full vaccination programme is
through. But we just need to be aware of the fact this is not a problem
that just disappears.â Andy Woodcock from the Independent asks about testing for people arriving into the UK from abroad and why it wasn't done sooner. The prime minister says the government will be bringing in measures to ""ensure that we test people coming into this country and preventing the virus from being readmitted"". Responding to a second question on schools and whether teachers and pupils should be vaccinated, Prof Chris Whitty says there is no evidence of hospitals filling up with children and it appears, that even with the new variant, ""children are relatively much less affected than other groups"". He says from a clinical point of view the real priority is to vaccinate the people that we know ""are by far the most likely to die and by far most likely to end up in hospital"". He adds there will have to be decisions made once the most vulnerable groups are vaccinated but we are not yet at that stage. The chief medical officer adds that neither vaccine currently in use in the UK has been licensed for children yet. The prime minister is asked by Jason Groves from the Daily Mail what needs to happen to ensure the government meets its commitment to vaccinate around 13 million people in the next six weeks. Boris Johnson says this will be ""a huge effort"" and will require groups such as the NHS, the armed forces and every aspect of government to work together ""absolutely flat out"". âThe rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure we
can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough,"" he says. He adds that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine needs to be properly batch-tested and approved before it can be given to people, which takes time. Sky's Sam Coates asks the PM if he ""can look parents in the eye"" and tell them their children will be back in classrooms by the summer. Johnson says he shares the ""optimism and fundamental hope"" expressed by Chris Whitty earlier. He says a ""huge amount"" can be done to immunise the vulnerable and therefore speed-up school openings and other ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"". ""Things will be very different by spring and that is what I would say to every parent in the land."" On a separate question about the new variant, Chris Whitty says the threat at the moment is ""extraordinarily high"" if people do not adhere to the lockdown rules. He says vaccinations will reduce the risk going forward but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". Some curbs may be needed next winter,  he adds, citing the number of people who die each year from flu. It will be up to the government to decide what level of risk is tolerable going forward, he adds, suggesting that will ultimately be a political rather than a societal decision. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first timeThe government announces 60,916 new confirmed cases in the UK, and a further 830 deaths.","The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday,,externalthe number of people who tested positive was 60,916. One in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data. A further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. It comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home. What the rules where you live? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? When will you be eligible for the vaccine? At a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million peoplehad now been vaccinatedin the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people. But he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited theOffice for National Statistics' random sampling data,externalfor England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" The number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December. Back in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. However, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. Hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show. At a hospital in Lincolnshire, a ""critical"" incidenthas been declaredafter a sharp rise in patients requiring admission. This video can not be played How NHS nurses and doctors are struggling to cope with Covid as cases continue to rise in England And potentially life-saving cancer operationshave been put on holdat a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. However, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country. In a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was ""highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter"". After seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise. It will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt. And all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones. The figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. Some of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions. About three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are. Hospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment. Boris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. Restrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland,and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday. In a televised address to the nation,Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to use the lockdown to create a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme. He also called on people to ""recapture the spirit"" of the beginning of the pandemic. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters At the press conference on Tuesday, Mr Johnson repeated his suggestion that there is a ""prospect"" of the lockdown being eased in mid-February. ""But you will also appreciate there are a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that, the most important of which is that we all now follow the guidance,"" he said. Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, but ""as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all"". Mr Whitty said the virus ""is not going to go away, just as flu doesn't go away, just as many other viruses don't go away"". ""We shouldn't kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring,"" he said. Mr Whitty said although hopefully there would be nearly no measures needed from the spring onwards, the government might have to bring in a few restrictions next winter. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" On Monday the UK's chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.

YouTube kicks TalkRadio off its platformThe Google-owned video-hosting service has yet to give a reason for its action.Technology,"YouTube has reinstated TalkRadio's channel on its platform hours after saying it had been ""terminated"" for breaking the tech firm's rules. It said the broadcaster had posted material that contradicted expert advice about the coronavirus pandemic. But it explained its U-turn saying it sometimes made exceptions to guidelines that state repeat offenders face a permanent ban. TalkRadio said it had yet to be given a full explanation for the affair. The decision to ban TalkRadio had appalled digital rights campaigners, with one group - Big Brother Watch - claiming it was evidence that ""big tech censorship is spiralling out of control"". The Google-owned service has issued a brief statement explaining its actions. ""TalkRadio's YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,"" it said. ""We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case."" YouTube has not published details of the offending posts. But independent fact-checkers haverepeatedly challenged,externalsome of theclaims made by interviewees,externalfeatured by the London-based radio station. YouTube operates a ""three strikes"" policy, whereby channels that break its community guidelines three times within a 90-day period can bepermanently banned,external, but other infractions lead to temporary restrictions. Prohibited content includes""medically unsubstantiated claims"" relating to Covid-19, and videos that contradictexpert consensus from local health authoritiessuch as the NHS. ""YouTube is making decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, even when they are sourced to responsible and regulated new providers,"" TalkRadiosaid in a statement this evening,external. ""This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate."" The broadcaster tweeted the statement minutes after YouTube's change of heart. It did not appear to be aware that its channel had been reinstated at the time, but hassince acknowledged the move,external. TalkRadio has about 424,000 listeners,external, according to the latest figures from market research provider Rajar. It uses YouTube as a means to livestream shows from its studios and to provide an archive of past broadcasts. Its channel on the platform has 242,000 subscribers. YouTube's action had meant that TalkRadio's website had featured articles featuring broken embedded clips for most of the day, and that users who had shared its clips would have been unable to view them. The US firm has previously imposed a permanent ban againstconspiracy theorist David Icke, and a one-week video suspension ofright-wing outlet One America News Network's ability to publish new clips - in both cases for breaches of its Covid rules.  It's pretty clear something has gone wrong at YouTube in the last 24 hours. It appeared as though TalkRadio had been banned for good on YouTube - or ""terminated"" as the company put it. YouTube is now saying it was a short suspension, which certainly seems like a backtrack. Even now, it's not obvious what the offending material was that caused this action. The whole process reinforces the idea that YouTube's moderation policies - where it draws the line between freedom of expression and clamping down on misinformation - can be messy and inconsistent. And when YouTube takes such an action without giving full details, it rains controversy down on its own head. This plays to a broader movement by YouTube and other social media companies to take a harder line on disinformation. Joe Biden is about to become US President - and he wants social media companies to do more to remove fake news. But as they are increasingly finding out, refereeing their own platforms can be hugely difficult, and this highlights the need for greater transparency about moderation decisions.

"UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first timeThe government announces 60,916 new confirmed cases in the UK, and a further 830 deaths.UKConjoined twins, 4, 'making friends at school'It's been a ""Herculean achievement"" for Marieme and Ndeye, who survived against the odds.Wales","The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday,,externalthe number of people who tested positive was 60,916. One in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data. A further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. It comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home. What the rules where you live? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? When will you be eligible for the vaccine? At a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million peoplehad now been vaccinatedin the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people. But he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited theOffice for National Statistics' random sampling data,externalfor England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" The number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December. Back in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. However, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. Hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show. At a hospital in Lincolnshire, a ""critical"" incidenthas been declaredafter a sharp rise in patients requiring admission. This video can not be played How NHS nurses and doctors are struggling to cope with Covid as cases continue to rise in England And potentially life-saving cancer operationshave been put on holdat a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. However, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country. In a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was ""highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter"". After seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise. It will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt. And all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones. The figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. Some of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions. About three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are. Hospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment. Boris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. Restrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland,and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday. In a televised address to the nation,Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to use the lockdown to create a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme. He also called on people to ""recapture the spirit"" of the beginning of the pandemic. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters At the press conference on Tuesday, Mr Johnson repeated his suggestion that there is a ""prospect"" of the lockdown being eased in mid-February. ""But you will also appreciate there are a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that, the most important of which is that we all now follow the guidance,"" he said. Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, but ""as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all"". Mr Whitty said the virus ""is not going to go away, just as flu doesn't go away, just as many other viruses don't go away"". ""We shouldn't kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring,"" he said. Mr Whitty said although hopefully there would be nearly no measures needed from the spring onwards, the government might have to bring in a few restrictions next winter. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" On Monday the UK's chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. Although the new variant is now spreading more rapidly than the original version, it is not believed to be more deadly.

"Conjoined twins, 4, 'making friends at school'It's been a ""Herculean achievement"" for Marieme and Ndeye, who survived against the odds.Wales","This video can not be played The twins' father says what they have achieved is a 'herculean achievement' Conjoined twins who were expected to die within days when they were born are nearly four years later said to be settling in at their Cardiff school. Marieme and Ndeye Ndiaye werebrought to the UK from Senegal in 2017 by their father Ibrahimafor treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. The girls, now four, are learning to stand and their father said their progress was ""a Herculean achievement"". Their head teacher said the girls had made friends and were ""laughing a lot"". The girls, who have separate hearts and spines but share a liver, bladder and digestive system, have conditions which put them at higher risk of complications from Covid. However, Mr Ndiaye said he had wanted them to start school for their development. ""When you look in the rear view mirror, it was an unachievable dream,"" he said. ""From now, everything ahead will be a bonus to me. My heart and soul is shouting out loud, 'Come on! Go on girls! Surprise me more!'."" Conjoined twins: Two girls, one body WATCH: Conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye Ndiaye living in UK WATCH: Marieme and Ndeye continue to surprise doctors Mr Ndiaye brought the girls to the UK through funding from a charitable foundation run by Senegal's first lady Marieme Faye Sall, before he sought asylum. In March 2018, the family were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff as asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK and they now have discretionary leave to remain. In 2019, Great Ormond Street surgeons considered attempting separation but it was something Mr Ndiaye did not want because of the risks involved. The girls have such complex circulatory systems medics now believe they would not survive being separated Since then, doctors have found the girls' circulatory systems to be more closely linked than previously thought and neither would survive without the other, making separation now impossible. The girls' head teacher Helen Borley said they were learning well since starting reception in September and had made new friends. She said: ""Children either say, 'I'm Marieme's friend' or 'I'm Ndeye's friend' - they don't say, 'I'm the twins' friend'. Children very much identify as being one person's friend or another - because the girls are very different characters. ""They are laughing a lot - which is always a good sign, isn't it? Any child that is laughing a lot is a happy child."" Marieme receives oxygen from Ndeye's stronger heart and food via their linked stomachs For the twins, school needs to fit around hospital visits. In October, the girls needed surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Dr Gillian Body, a paediatric consultant at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, said the procedure was important, despite the risks. She said: ""The girls have complex anatomies and that makes them prone to infections and potentially sepsis. ""One of the challenges we had was getting antibiotics into them quickly, and this tube or cannula they've had fitted, means we can get them into them more quickly with less distress to the girls."" The girls have been experiencing the feeling of standing, at children's hospice Ty Hafan She said Marieme's heart was complex with lots of abnormalities that cause her problems with doing exercise and can lead to breathlessness. At children's' hospice Ty Hafan in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, the girls have been learning what it feels like to stand. A special frame gives them the experience of being upright, helping build strength in their legs. Physiotherapist Sara Wade-West said it had been hard for them. ""It's a really different sensation when you're used to being sat down, to be upright can be scary,"" she said. ""To start with, particularly Ndeye wasn't very keen. We try and sneak the therapy in around the play, encouraging them to reach for toys to make them work a bit harder, but if they know it's therapy it's not so fun. ""Because of their cardiac function we can't push them too much so it's finding that balance - challenging them to get stronger but not exhausting them."" The twins' father Ibrahima Ndiaye said they were his ""warriors"" Watching his daughters stand is more than just a breakthrough for their father. ""They are showing that they don't only want to live, but be active and play their part in society,"" he said. ""All these achievements bring light and hopes for the future. But I know how fragile, complex and unpredictable their lives can be."" Mr Ndiaye said his hopes were ""parallel to my fears"" as the girls had ""so many times come close to the worst"". ""But the very least I can do for the girls is figure out my hopes for them,"" he said. ""The most I can do is to be beside them and live inside that hope and never allow anything to take that hope away. ""They are my warriors.

"UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first timeThe government announces 60,916 new confirmed cases in the UK, and a further 830 deaths.UK","The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday,,externalthe number of people who tested positive was 60,916. One in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data. A further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. It comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home. What the rules where you live? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? When will you be eligible for the vaccine? At a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million peoplehad now been vaccinatedin the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people. But he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited theOffice for National Statistics' random sampling data,externalfor England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" The number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December. Back in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. However, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. Hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show. At a hospital in Lincolnshire, a ""critical"" incidenthas been declaredafter a sharp rise in patients requiring admission. This video can not be played How NHS nurses and doctors are struggling to cope with Covid as cases continue to rise in England And potentially life-saving cancer operationshave been put on holdat a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. However, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country. In a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was ""highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter"". After seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise. It will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt. And all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones. The figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. Some of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions. About three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are. Hospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment. Boris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. Restrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland,and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday.

Topshop's Oxford Street store set to close,"The 90,000 sq ft store is a familiar sight for commuters coming out of Oxford Circus Tube station The building that houses Topshop's Oxford Street store is up for sale. The High Street chain's owner Arcadia went into administration in November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. News of the sale of the three-storey building has prompted an outpouring of emotion on social media, with shoppers recounting how important the flagship store is to them. The store, which boasted a DJ booth, nail bar and food stalls, was a retail sensation when it opened in 1994. Huge crowds gathered at the store for the launch of Kate Moss's Topshop collection in 2014 Arcadia - which owns Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins - entered administration on 30 November The sale of 214 Oxford Street, managed by agents Savills and Eastdil, follows the failure of Sir Philip Green's retail empire to secure funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. The Oxford Street building also houses Nike and Vans stores. Arcadia said that although it was in administration, and so all its assets are to be sold, that did not mean the shops in the building would have to close. A brief history of Topshop Four reasons Topshop is not the brand it once was People have been sharing their feelings about the London landmark, which was often used as a meeting point for friends and was a must-visit for fashion-loving tourists.

Arcadia, which also owns Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins and Burton, had already closed other Topshop stores across the UK, citing the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Its brands were struggling before the pandemic, partly due to competition from online-only fashion retailers such as Asos, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing.

Can we really jab our way out of lockdown?,"With the country in lockdown and a new faster-spreading variant of coronavirus rampant, it's clear the UK is in a race to vaccinate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants all the over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers to be offered a jab by mid-February, to allow the restrictions to be eased. That requires about 13 million people to be given the opportunity to be vaccinated - but so far only one million have been. And ensuring a quick rollout to the rest is fraught with difficulties. There is enough vaccine in the country, BBC News has learned, but getting it into people's arms could be hampered by: a global shortage of glass vials to package up the vaccines long waits for safety checks the process of ensuring there are enough vaccinators Two Covid vaccines have now been approved - one produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and another made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The UK government has ordered 140 million doses - enough for the whole population. The first hurdle is manufacture of the vaccine. This involves two crucial stages - the production of the substance and then a process called fill and finish whereby the vaccine is put into vials and packaged up for use. And there is already a concern about the latter stage, with the availability of key ingredients and equipment including glass vials a key issue. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam says fill and finish was a ""critically short resource across the globe"". That is part of the reason why the amount of the two vaccines ready to go is more limited than ministers had hoped. UK plants have made somewhere around 15 million or so doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - that in itself is less than ministers said would be made at this stage (early in the pandemic they said there would be 30 million by the autumn). But only four million have been through the fill-and-finish process. The UK has used plants in Germany and the Netherlands to do some of this for the early batches. But the government has also invested in a plant in Wrexham to ensure there is domestic capacity. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, meanwhile, is made outside of the UK - it comes from a plant in Belgium. When it arrives in the UK, it has already been placed into vials. But so far, fewer than five million doses have been delivered - less than half the number that should have been - because of problems with manufacture, including the fill-and-finish process. However, the Department of Health and Social Care said it had been monitoring the supply chain for ""some time"" and was confident the arrangements in place for the supply and onward deployment of vaccines were sufficient. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? Even once a vaccine is in the vials though, there is still one more step before the NHS can start using it. Each batch has to be checked and certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products regulatory Agency. And it can be several weeks before the vaccine can be given to the NHS to put in people's arms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has called this a ""rate-limiting factor"". About four million doses of the Oxford vaccine have been available for some weeks - they were put into vials last year - but as yet only just over 500,000 have been certified as safe to use. Sources close to the NHS vaccination programme said this had been one of the key frustrations - saying it was taking up to 20 days for batches to be tested and released. The MHRA said each batch had to be biologically tested for quality, while the manufacturer's documentation describing its production and quality-control testing process was reviewed. Those close to the process say it does take a couple of weeks - and with more vaccine being produced, there is increased demand on the labs that do the work. ""You have to remember this is being injected into people,"" they said. ""We cannot rush this."" Both vaccines have to go through this process. Once batches have been certified, they are ready to be distributed to the NHS vaccination centres. Eventually, there will be a network of more than 1,000 local centres across the UK. Currently, just over 700 are up and running. These are being run from a wide variety of venues, from hospitals and large GP centres to community venues, racecourses and, perhaps in the future, conference centres and sports stadiums. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? The instability of the Pfizer-BioNTech has been well documented. It has to be kept in ultra-cold storage and, once thawed, used within five days. This has meant it is stored at major hospitals and gives the local vaccination centres just days to use up batches after they are delivered. The Oxford vaccine, meanwhile, can be stored at fridge temperature, which makes it easier to distribute. But even once they are at these vaccination centres, delivery of both vaccines is dependent on having the right numbers of staff available. Currently, GPs, nurses, healthcare assistants and pharmacists are giving the vaccines. But as the vaccination campaign ramps up, these will need to be supplemented by additional vaccinators. Provision has been made to train other health professionals, from physiotherapists and dentists to dieticians. But there are reports an ""overload of bureaucracy"" - including mandatory courses in fire safety and preventing radicalisation - is slowing down this training. Ministers have said they will try to reduce the bureaucracy - amid warnings by the National Audit Office an army of nearly 50,000 vaccinators will be needed. Although at the moment, there are thought to be enough staff to cope with the limited amount of vaccines available. British Medical Association GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey said: ""We will need support eventually but not now. ""At the moment, the biggest issue is the NHS having enough supply of the vaccine to give."" Nearly a million doses have been given since people started to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, in early December, which puts the UK third globally in the most vaccinations done per head. And with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine being used from this week, the NHS is hoping to double that number in the next seven days. Government sources said there would be disappointment if it did not reach two million doses a week by late January. That - and a little bit more - will be needed to hit the mid-February target. But even then, and assuming most people in these priority groups have come forward, the impact would not be immediate. It takes a few weeks for the immune response to kick in. So it would be early March before the full impact of the vaccination of these priority groups is felt. Then, however, it could have a significant effect. Close to nine in 10 Covid deaths have been in these priority groups. They will have had only one dose, which, for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, is effective at preventing 70% of infections. But the evidence suggests this will be enough to stop serious illness. So if all goes to plan, the pathway to significantly easing restrictions comes into view. But the complex nature of the supply chain coupled with the complexity of delivering vaccines to large numbers of people means it will take just one thing to go wrong to cause serious problems getting the UK out of this lockdown in the timeframe hoped.

Nigeria has introduced restrictions to try and contain the virus Police in Nigeriaâs Lagos state have raided several nightclubs, arresting 71 people for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols. The police say the raids happened in the Lekki and Surulere areas of Lagos city and the suspects will be prosecuted for allegedly violating guidelines put in place in an attempt to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Lagos state police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi told the BBC that the club-goers had allegedly violated a ban on large gatherings and the reopening of clubs and had broken a midnight to 04:00 curfew in the state. The authorities say they will intensify such raids to ensure ââtotal complianceââ with Covid-19 protocols. The arrests come as Nigeria continues to record a surge in coronavirus infections amid fears of a second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control announced 1,204 new infections - the countryâs highest confirmed daily cases so far. Nigeria has recorded 91,351 cases, with 75,699 recoveries and 1,318 deaths from the virus. Lagos state is the countryâs epicentre of the disease.

This was not the plan. At least not at the start of Monday. In the space of 36 hours, the government went from urging parents of primary pupils in England to send their children back to school - to shutting classrooms for almost all children for at least seven weeks and telling everyone to stay at home. So what changed? Find out from our political correspondent Nick Eardleyhere. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm There are continuing problems for people travelling from the UK to Sweden - Swedish
border police have confirmed to the BBC that 58 people making the journey have been turned away since the New Year, including 28 British
citizens. The release
of the figures follows days of travel confusion for Britons who are resident in
Sweden. They face extra hurdles returning to their Swedish base, due to a new
requirement to provide a negative coronavirus test result from 1 January,
alongside post-Brexit paperwork required to prove their right of residence in
Sweden. On Sunday
it emerged that some British passengers arriving with negative coronavirus
tests had nevertheless been told to return to the UK, while others refused and
spent the night on the floor or on plastic chairs at Gothenburgâs Landvetter
Airport. The UKâs Ambassador to Sweden Judith Gough raised concerns that there
was a need for âgreater clarity and consistencyâ over which types of Covid-19
tests were valid, and dispatched embassy staff to the airport on Monday. The
travellers were allowed to enter Sweden shortly afterwards. Swedish
border police have told the BBC that of the 28 British citizens turned away
since 1 January, 13 were registered residents of Sweden who did not have a
valid negative coronavirus test and five were not registered as living in
Sweden. Police were unable to provide firm information on the reason for the
denial of the other ten travellers.

Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that new restrictions to reduce contact will be introduced in order to curb rising infections. Nationwide measures, including closing schools and non-essential businesses were introduced in mid-December and were due to continue until 10 January. Germany has recorded more than 1.8 million coronavirus cases and 36,000 deaths since the pandemic began, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Ambulance workers in Los Angeles County, California, have been told not to transport hospital patients who have extremely low chances of survival. The directive comes as officials say the region could soon hit more than 1,000 Covid-related deaths per day, and hospitals are overrun with patients. Emergency workers have also been told to ration oxygen, which is in short supply due to the pandemic. Hospital beds in LA are running low and officials fear a post-holiday spike. New York City issued a similar directive to ambulance workers last April at the height of the city's Covid outbreak, instructing them not to bring in patients who could not be resuscitated at the scene. The LA County Department of Public Health reported 9,142 new Covid cases on Monday, and an additional 77 deaths. The county, which is the worst hit in the US, has recorded 818,000 coronavirus cases and more than 10,700 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Read morehere. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Buckingham Palace says there will be no garden parties this year - in either London or Edinburgh. The social events are normally staged at Buckingham Palace in London and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and the decision comes as England enters its third national lockdown and mainland Scotland sees the introduction of similar restrictions. A palace spokesman says: ""The decision has been taken that garden parties will not take place in 2021."" Garden parties were cancelled during 2020 following the first UK lockdown. Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News If you're a reality television fan who follows your favourite stars online, chances are you have seen some of them jetting off to luxury destinations in recent weeks - despite rising infection rates and restrictions across the UK. With much of England first plunged into tier four and now lockdown, many seem to be wondering how all of these glamorous breaks have been able to go ahead at a time when millions are being told to stay at home. From a Love Island star facing charges for alleged Covid breaches in Barbados, to the Celtic football team drawing Scottish government criticism for travelling to Dubai for training - tabloids and social media have been full of scrutiny of these trips in recent days. So, what is going on and what do the rules say? BBC reporter Kelly-Leigh Cooper takes a closer look here. With the announcement of another lockdown and schools moving to remote learning the BBC is launching the biggest education offer in its history. Starting on Monday, each week day CBBC will have a three-hour block of primary school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, as well as other educational programming such as Our School and Celebrity Supply Teacher. Meanwhile, BBC Two will cater for secondary students with programming to support the GCSE curriculum, with a least two hours of content each weekday. The content will also be available on demand on theiPlayer. BBC director general Tim Davie says: ""Education is absolutely vital - the BBC is here to play its part and Iâm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly. On the UK's High Street, Topshop's store in Oxford Street is set to close its doors after 27 years. The High Street chain's owner Arcadia went into administration in November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. News of the sale of the three-storey building has prompted an outpouring of emotion on social media, with shoppers recounting how important the flagship store was to them. The store, which boasted a DJ booth, nail bar and food stalls, was a retail sensation when it opened in 1994. The sale of 214 Oxford Street, managed by agents Savills and Eastdil, follows the failure of Sir Philip Green's retail empire to secure funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. You can read the full story and see some of the farewell tributes being paid to the store here. Here's a reminder of the key points from today's briefing, as daily case figures in the UK rise above 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic began: The last question is from Dominic Yeatman from the Metro newspaper, whose reporter asks the PM whether he regrets allowing millions of children to go to school on Monday and delaying the lockdown by 24 hours. The PM says he wanted to keep children in school but the data he received on Monday about infection levels no longer supported it. Mr Johnson is also pressed on the cost to families of home learning amid claims some people are being charged up to Â£100 to access websites via pay-as-you-go mobile phones. The PM says the government will look at the costs involved and he wants to do everything he can to help parents. He then sums up the position the country finds itself in, saying the winter has been made much more difficult by the new variant and it is vital that people stick to the rules to help the country cope as the vaccination programme gathers pace. He closes by repeating the basic message that people must stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Prof Chris Whitty is asked whether the lockdown will be enough to reverse the spread of the virus. He says if everyone sticks to the rules ""really strongly"" and the NHS is vaccinating as fast as it can âthen our hope is the lockdown
will be enoughâ. But he says this will require a ""collective effort"", with everyone ""buying into this really seriously"". In the longer term, the chief medical officer says we all hope the vaccination programme will mean we donât need restrictions in the future. But he warns the virus ""is not going to go away"", saying we ""shouldnât kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring"" - although the risks will go down. âHopefully weâll have spring, summer, autumn, possibly winter
as well, with almost nothing in place, once the full vaccination programme is
through. But we just need to be aware of the fact this is not a problem
that just disappears.â Andy Woodcock from the Independent asks about testing for people arriving into the UK from abroad and why it wasn't done sooner. The prime minister says the government will be bringing in measures to ""ensure that we test people coming into this country and preventing the virus from being readmitted"". Responding to a second question on schools and whether teachers and pupils should be vaccinated, Prof Chris Whitty says there is no evidence of hospitals filling up with children and it appears, that even with the new variant, ""children are relatively much less affected than other groups"". He says from a clinical point of view the real priority is to vaccinate the people that we know ""are by far the most likely to die and by far most likely to end up in hospital"". He adds there will have to be decisions made once the most vulnerable groups are vaccinated but we are not yet at that stage. The chief medical officer adds that neither vaccine currently in use in the UK has been licensed for children yet. The prime minister is asked by Jason Groves from the Daily Mail what needs to happen to ensure the government meets its commitment to vaccinate around 13 million people in the next six weeks. Boris Johnson says this will be ""a huge effort"" and will require groups such as the NHS, the armed forces and every aspect of government to work together ""absolutely flat out"". âThe rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure we
can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough,"" he says. He adds that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine needs to be properly batch-tested and approved before it can be given to people, which takes time. Sky's Sam Coates asks the PM if he ""can look parents in the eye"" and tell them their children will be back in classrooms by the summer. Johnson says he shares the ""optimism and fundamental hope"" expressed by Chris Whitty earlier. He says a ""huge amount"" can be done to immunise the vulnerable and therefore speed-up school openings and other ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"". ""Things will be very different by spring and that is what I would say to every parent in the land."" On a separate question about the new variant, Chris Whitty says the threat at the moment is ""extraordinarily high"" if people do not adhere to the lockdown rules. He says vaccinations will reduce the risk going forward but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". Some curbs may be needed next winter,  he adds, citing the number of people who die each year from flu. It will be up to the government to decide what level of risk is tolerable going forward, he adds, suggesting that will ultimately be a political rather than a societal decision. Â© 2025 BBC.

The LA County Department of Public Health reported 9,142 new Covid cases on Monday, and an additional 77 deaths. The county, which is the worst hit in the US, has recorded 818,000 coronavirus cases and more than 10,700 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Read morehere. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Buckingham Palace says there will be no garden parties this year - in either London or Edinburgh. The social events are normally staged at Buckingham Palace in London and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and the decision comes as England enters its third national lockdown and mainland Scotland sees the introduction of similar restrictions. A palace spokesman says: ""The decision has been taken that garden parties will not take place in 2021."" Garden parties were cancelled during 2020 following the first UK lockdown. Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News If you're a reality television fan who follows your favourite stars online, chances are you have seen some of them jetting off to luxury destinations in recent weeks - despite rising infection rates and restrictions across the UK. With much of England first plunged into tier four and now lockdown, many seem to be wondering how all of these glamorous breaks have been able to go ahead at a time when millions are being told to stay at home. From a Love Island star facing charges for alleged Covid breaches in Barbados, to the Celtic football team drawing Scottish government criticism for travelling to Dubai for training - tabloids and social media have been full of scrutiny of these trips in recent days. So, what is going on and what do the rules say? BBC reporter Kelly-Leigh Cooper takes a closer look here. With the announcement of another lockdown and schools moving to remote learning the BBC is launching the biggest education offer in its history. Starting on Monday, each week day CBBC will have a three-hour block of primary school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, as well as other educational programming such as Our School and Celebrity Supply Teacher. Meanwhile, BBC Two will cater for secondary students with programming to support the GCSE curriculum, with a least two hours of content each weekday. The content will also be available on demand on theiPlayer. BBC director general Tim Davie says: ""Education is absolutely vital - the BBC is here to play its part and Iâm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly. On the UK's High Street, Topshop's store in Oxford Street is set to close its doors after 27 years. The High Street chain's owner Arcadia went into administration in November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. News of the sale of the three-storey building has prompted an outpouring of emotion on social media, with shoppers recounting how important the flagship store was to them. The store, which boasted a DJ booth, nail bar and food stalls, was a retail sensation when it opened in 1994. The sale of 214 Oxford Street, managed by agents Savills and Eastdil, follows the failure of Sir Philip Green's retail empire to secure funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. You can read the full story and see some of the farewell tributes being paid to the store here. Here's a reminder of the key points from today's briefing, as daily case figures in the UK rise above 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic began: The last question is from Dominic Yeatman from the Metro newspaper, whose reporter asks the PM whether he regrets allowing millions of children to go to school on Monday and delaying the lockdown by 24 hours. The PM says he wanted to keep children in school but the data he received on Monday about infection levels no longer supported it. Mr Johnson is also pressed on the cost to families of home learning amid claims some people are being charged up to Â£100 to access websites via pay-as-you-go mobile phones. The PM says the government will look at the costs involved and he wants to do everything he can to help parents. He then sums up the position the country finds itself in, saying the winter has been made much more difficult by the new variant and it is vital that people stick to the rules to help the country cope as the vaccination programme gathers pace. He closes by repeating the basic message that people must stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Prof Chris Whitty is asked whether the lockdown will be enough to reverse the spread of the virus. He says if everyone sticks to the rules ""really strongly"" and the NHS is vaccinating as fast as it can âthen our hope is the lockdown
will be enoughâ. But he says this will require a ""collective effort"", with everyone ""buying into this really seriously"". In the longer term, the chief medical officer says we all hope the vaccination programme will mean we donât need restrictions in the future. But he warns the virus ""is not going to go away"", saying we ""shouldnât kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring"" - although the risks will go down. âHopefully weâll have spring, summer, autumn, possibly winter
as well, with almost nothing in place, once the full vaccination programme is
through. But we just need to be aware of the fact this is not a problem
that just disappears.â Andy Woodcock from the Independent asks about testing for people arriving into the UK from abroad and why it wasn't done sooner. The prime minister says the government will be bringing in measures to ""ensure that we test people coming into this country and preventing the virus from being readmitted"". Responding to a second question on schools and whether teachers and pupils should be vaccinated, Prof Chris Whitty says there is no evidence of hospitals filling up with children and it appears, that even with the new variant, ""children are relatively much less affected than other groups"". He says from a clinical point of view the real priority is to vaccinate the people that we know ""are by far the most likely to die and by far most likely to end up in hospital"". He adds there will have to be decisions made once the most vulnerable groups are vaccinated but we are not yet at that stage. The chief medical officer adds that neither vaccine currently in use in the UK has been licensed for children yet. The prime minister is asked by Jason Groves from the Daily Mail what needs to happen to ensure the government meets its commitment to vaccinate around 13 million people in the next six weeks. Boris Johnson says this will be ""a huge effort"" and will require groups such as the NHS, the armed forces and every aspect of government to work together ""absolutely flat out"". âThe rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure we
can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough,"" he says. He adds that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine needs to be properly batch-tested and approved before it can be given to people, which takes time. Sky's Sam Coates asks the PM if he ""can look parents in the eye"" and tell them their children will be back in classrooms by the summer. Johnson says he shares the ""optimism and fundamental hope"" expressed by Chris Whitty earlier. He says a ""huge amount"" can be done to immunise the vulnerable and therefore speed-up school openings and other ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"". ""Things will be very different by spring and that is what I would say to every parent in the land."" On a separate question about the new variant, Chris Whitty says the threat at the moment is ""extraordinarily high"" if people do not adhere to the lockdown rules. He says vaccinations will reduce the risk going forward but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". Some curbs may be needed next winter,  he adds, citing the number of people who die each year from flu. It will be up to the government to decide what level of risk is tolerable going forward, he adds, suggesting that will ultimately be a political rather than a societal decision. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK records more than 60,000 new coronavirus casesThe government announces 60,916 new confirmed cases in the UK, and a further 830 deaths.UKConjoined twins, 4, 'making friends at school'It's been a ""Herculean achievement"" for Marieme and Ndeye, who survived against the odds.Wales","The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday,,externalthe number of people who tested positive was 60,916. One in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data. A further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. It comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home. What the rules where you live? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? When will you be eligible for the vaccine? At a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million peoplehad now been vaccinatedin the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people. But he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited theOffice for National Statistics' random sampling data,externalfor England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" The number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December. Back in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. However, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. Hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show. At a hospital in Lincolnshire, a ""critical"" incidenthas been declaredafter a sharp rise in patients requiring admission. This video can not be played How NHS nurses and doctors are struggling to cope with Covid as cases continue to rise in England And potentially life-saving cancer operationshave been put on holdat a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. However, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country. In a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was ""highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter"". After seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise. It will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt. And all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones. The figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. Some of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions. About three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are. Hospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment. Boris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. Restrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland,and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday. In a televised address to the nation,Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to use the lockdown to create a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme. He also called on people to ""recapture the spirit"" of the beginning of the pandemic. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters At the press conference on Tuesday, Mr Johnson repeated his suggestion that there is a ""prospect"" of the lockdown being eased in mid-February. ""But you will also appreciate there are a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that, the most important of which is that we all now follow the guidance,"" he said. Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, but ""as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all"". Mr Whitty said the virus ""is not going to go away, just as flu doesn't go away, just as many other viruses don't go away"". ""We shouldn't kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring,"" he said. Mr Whitty said although hopefully there would be nearly no measures needed from the spring onwards, the government might have to bring in a few restrictions next winter. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" On Monday the UK's chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.

"Conjoined twins, 4, 'making friends at school'It's been a ""Herculean achievement"" for Marieme and Ndeye, who survived against the odds.WalesBreaking|Breaking newsUK records more than 60,000 new coronavirus casesThe government announces 60,916 new confirmed cases in the UK, and a further 830 deaths.UK","This video can not be played The twins' father says what they have achieved is a 'herculean achievement' Conjoined twins who were expected to die within days when they were born are nearly four years later said to be settling in at their Cardiff school. Marieme and Ndeye Ndiaye werebrought to the UK from Senegal in 2017 by their father Ibrahimafor treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. The girls, now four, are learning to stand and their father said their progress was ""a Herculean achievement"". Their head teacher said the girls had made friends and were ""laughing a lot"". The girls, who have separate hearts and spines but share a liver, bladder and digestive system, have conditions which put them at higher risk of complications from Covid. However, Mr Ndiaye said he had wanted them to start school for their development. ""When you look in the rear view mirror, it was an unachievable dream,"" he said. ""From now, everything ahead will be a bonus to me. My heart and soul is shouting out loud, 'Come on! Go on girls! Surprise me more!'."" Conjoined twins: Two girls, one body WATCH: Conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye Ndiaye living in UK WATCH: Marieme and Ndeye continue to surprise doctors Mr Ndiaye brought the girls to the UK through funding from a charitable foundation run by Senegal's first lady Marieme Faye Sall, before he sought asylum. In March 2018, the family were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff as asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK and they now have discretionary leave to remain. In 2019, Great Ormond Street surgeons considered attempting separation but it was something Mr Ndiaye did not want because of the risks involved. The girls have such complex circulatory systems medics now believe they would not survive being separated Since then, doctors have found the girls' circulatory systems to be more closely linked than previously thought and neither would survive without the other, making separation now impossible. The girls' head teacher Helen Borley said they were learning well since starting reception in September and had made new friends. She said: ""Children either say, 'I'm Marieme's friend' or 'I'm Ndeye's friend' - they don't say, 'I'm the twins' friend'. Children very much identify as being one person's friend or another - because the girls are very different characters. ""They are laughing a lot - which is always a good sign, isn't it? Any child that is laughing a lot is a happy child."" Marieme receives oxygen from Ndeye's stronger heart and food via their linked stomachs For the twins, school needs to fit around hospital visits. In October, the girls needed surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Dr Gillian Body, a paediatric consultant at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, said the procedure was important, despite the risks. She said: ""The girls have complex anatomies and that makes them prone to infections and potentially sepsis. ""One of the challenges we had was getting antibiotics into them quickly, and this tube or cannula they've had fitted, means we can get them into them more quickly with less distress to the girls."" The girls have been experiencing the feeling of standing, at children's hospice Ty Hafan She said Marieme's heart was complex with lots of abnormalities that cause her problems with doing exercise and can lead to breathlessness. At children's' hospice Ty Hafan in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, the girls have been learning what it feels like to stand. A special frame gives them the experience of being upright, helping build strength in their legs. Physiotherapist Sara Wade-West said it had been hard for them. ""It's a really different sensation when you're used to being sat down, to be upright can be scary,"" she said. ""To start with, particularly Ndeye wasn't very keen. We try and sneak the therapy in around the play, encouraging them to reach for toys to make them work a bit harder, but if they know it's therapy it's not so fun. ""Because of their cardiac function we can't push them too much so it's finding that balance - challenging them to get stronger but not exhausting them."" The twins' father Ibrahima Ndiaye said they were his ""warriors"" Watching his daughters stand is more than just a breakthrough for their father. ""They are showing that they don't only want to live, but be active and play their part in society,"" he said. ""All these achievements bring light and hopes for the future. But I know how fragile, complex and unpredictable their lives can be."" Mr Ndiaye said his hopes were ""parallel to my fears"" as the girls had ""so many times come close to the worst"". ""But the very least I can do for the girls is figure out my hopes for them,"" he said. ""The most I can do is to be beside them and live inside that hope and never allow anything to take that hope away. ""They are my warriors. They have proved they will never surrender without fighting. It is not yet over."" Meet conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye.

Kuenssberg: An echo of March,"By 8pm on Monday it felt inevitable. But it doesn't mean that a national instruction to close the doors was automatic. Or indeed that new lockdowns in England and Scotland aren't still dramatic and painful. With tightening up in Wales and Northern Ireland too, the spread of coronavirus this winter has been faster than governments' attempts to keep up with it - leaving leaders with little choice but to take more of our choices away. There is much that's an echo of March. Work, school, life outside the home will be constrained in so many ways, with terrible and expensive side-effects for the economy. This time, it's already spluttering - restrictions being turned on and off for months have starved so much trade of vital business. But there's a lot that's different too. After so long, the public is less forgiving of the actions taken, and there is frustration particularly over last-minute changes for schools; fatigue too with having to live under such limits. By now, Boris Johnson's opponents, inside and outside the Tory party, have plenty of evidence to suggest that he would rather put off difficult decisions. But there is another profound change, that the prime minister was unsurprisingly keen to point out on live TV, where the UK, at the moment, has a leading reputation. Vaccines exist, partly due to UK science, and are being injected into willing arms already. The scientific triumph still needs to be turned into a logistical victory. But if around 13 million vaccines can be offered over the next six weeks, we may be on the way. One member of the cabinet told me: ""We should do absolutely nothing but this, the vaccine - it should be the entire focus of the government; every government shoulder should be put to every government wheel."" It's not just the country's health and economic fortunes riding on hitting that stretching target, but the government's reputation too.

Music festivals 'could be cancelled this month',"The Cure were the last band to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2019 - with last year's festival called off Some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month, MPs have been told. Events are ""rapidly approaching the determination point"", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals. Organisers will be in ""absolutely dire straits"" financially if the season is cancelled, added Anna Wade, of Winchester's Boomtown Fair. They were speaking to MPs examining the plight of music festivals in the UK. The House of Commons culture select committeeis carrying out an inquiry into the viability of this summer's events,external, after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the 2020 festival season. Tuesday's hearing came a day after Glastonbury festival organiserEmily Eavis assured fans,externalthey ""haven't cancelled"" the 2021 event. But the committee was told that the government needs to introduce Covid cancellation insurance for live events and an extension to the current VAT cut on concert tickets. ""If the government don't help with insurance, then the smaller festivals are going to drop away,"" said Sacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife Festival. He added that vaccinations and mass testing were essential to ensure the future of live music. ""Social distancing does not work at any of these events,"" he told MPs. ""It's a festival. You just cannot put social distancing in place, so we are anticipating that we will be operating at 100% [capacity]."" Wade pointed out that rapid-turnaround testing would place another financial burden on festival organisers. Testing kits are currently Â£10 each, she said, potentially meaning an outlay of Â£660,000 for her 66,000 attendees. Will concerts come back in 2021? Glastonbury 2021: 'We're doing everything we can' Music touring proposals were 'rejected by the EU' However, Lord, who is also night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, said he was optimistic that festivals would ""bounce back"" once the virus was under control. ""People want to go to a gig, whether it's a festival or a small grassroots venue,"" he said. ""The appetite is out there."" Steve Heap, general secretary of the Association of Festival Organisers, said that while major festivals would have to make a decision this month, smaller events had until April. ""If we get as far as Easter and we still don't know that crowds can gather at festivals, however large or small, then we are in a catastrophic situation with this year's season,"" he said. The UK live music industry was worth Â£1.3bn in 2019 - but it has been hit hard by the pandemic, with more than 90% of the gigs planned for 2020 cancelled. Before Tuesday's hearing, music industry trade body UK Music called on MPs to name a ""restart date"" after which gigs can go ahead. The lack of coronavirus insurance was the ""biggest barrier"" to events resuming, it said, pointing out that Germany had recently announced a Â£2.3bn event cancellation fund, in line with several other European countries. Such a situation puts the UK at a ""competitive disadvantage"", UK Music's chief executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin warned. ""The real danger here is that, if we see a lot of countries - particularly in Europe and closer to home - protecting their festival seasons, you could almost have a talent transfer,"" he told the committee. ""We don't want to have a situation where musicians, crews, technicians - people who should be working in the UK festival scene - are looking to the continent and thinking, actually, if there's going to be live music happening there in 2021, that's where we're going to be going."" UK Music's call to action came in a report called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running. In a statement, Mr Njoku-Goodwin said that even with the roll-out of vaccines, ""lack of notice and available insurance options will mean much of the 2021 summer music season can't go ahead"". Responding to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it. ""Our Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than Â£1bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock.""

Worker jailed for Buckingham Palace thefts,"Adamo Canto had worked as a catering assistant at the palace's Royal Mews since 2015 A Buckingham Palace catering assistant who stole medals and photographs from the Queen's residence has been jailed. Adamo Canto, 37, stole items including signed photos of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a photo album of US President Donald Trump's UK visit. Police said some of the goods, worth between Â£10,000 and Â£100,000, had been listed for sale on eBay. Canto, from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, was jailed for eight months after he admitted stealing the items. More news from across Yorkshire Southwark Crown Court heard police recovered a ""significant quantity"" of stolen items when they searched his quarters at the palace's Royal Mews, where he had worked as a catering assistant since 2015. Canto stole an album of photos from US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK A total of 37 items were offered for sale ""well under"" their true value, with Canto making Â£7,741. One item was a photo album of US President Donald Trump's visit to the UK, worth Â£1,500. Canto also took official signed photographs of the Duke of Sussex and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Some 77 items were taken from the palace shop, while others were stolen from staff lockers, the Queen's Gallery shop and the Duke of York's storeroom. Canto also admitted stealing a Companion of Bath medal belonging to the Master of the Household, which was sold online for Â£350, and a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order medal from the locker of former British Army officer Maj Gen Richard Sykes. Canto pleaded guilty to three counts of theft by an employee at a hearing in November and was jailed on Monday. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data fees,"Internet providers are under pressure to do more to help low-income families afford data packages for their children to take part in remote learning. It follows adecision to close UK schools to most pupilsto enforce new coronavirus lockdowns. The children's commissioner for England told the BBC that ""broadband companies really need to step up"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer added he thought the cost of data was ""a big problem"". ""We're asking people to endure very tough restrictions. And there has to be the other side of that contract,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Everybody needs to try and make this work. And that includes the companies that can take away the charging for data. It's a serious situation."" When questioned about the topic at a Downing Street press conference, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We are looking at... the potential costs to parents of online teaching, and we're going to do our best to support them in any way that we can and to work with the internet companies."" There is concern that some disadvantaged pupils are currently dependent on pay-as-you-go or monthly mobile phone subscriptions that only include a small data allowance because their families cannot afford or otherwise obtain a separate fixed broadband connection. ""There are 25 million pay-as-you go customers in the UK, and about seven million of those struggle with the cost of topping up their data,"" commented Chris Thorpe from the Centre For The Acceleration Of Social Technology charity. Many schools are using video-chat software including Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Google Meet to live-stream classes, assemblies and other activities, which all benefit from a fast, stable connection and can consume a lot of data. In addition, other tools including Google Classroom, Tapestry and Class Dojo are used by pupils to submit schoolwork and receive marks and other feedback. The situation became more pressing after the prime minister announced last night that England's lockdown would mean schools and colleges would remain closed to most pupils until at least the February half-term. Schools to close and exams facing axe in England Scotland's 'stay at home' lockdown order comes into force 'Grave consequences' in closing Wales' schools Northern Ireland's stay-at-home order set to be given legal force Tech for UK - a coalition of technologists and other concerned business leaders - has suggested one way forward would be for internet providers to ""zero rate"" edtech apps and websites, so that their data use would be deducted from a mobile subscriber's monthly allowance. However, it acknowledges the challenge in doing so is to pick which platforms to support without giving some providers an unfair advantage over others. The Department for Education alreadyruns a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection,externalto temporarily increase their mobile data allowance. In some cases, this involves an extra 20 gigabytes a month. In others - such as Three - it provides an ""unlimited"" data upgrade. Schools, trusts and local authorities need to request the support on a pupil's behalf. The networks involved in the initiative include: EE Three Virgin Mobile Smarty Tesco Mobile Sky Mobile In cases when this is not available, thegovernment offers 4G wireless routers,external- which use mobile networks to offer a wi-fi connection - as an alternative. In addition,Vodafone provided 350,000,external""free data"" Sim cards to thousands of primary and secondary schools and colleges in November. ""We are actively considering what to do now about this new situation,"" it said. O2 pledged in Octoberto donate 10,000 devices and 12 months of free data,externalto ""vulnerable individuals"". And Virgin Media noted it had launched adiscounted home broadband service,externalfor families facing financial difficulties and receiving universal credit. BT says ithas already removed all caps on its home broadband plans,externalto help ensure children can stay connected to their schools. Anne Longfield, the children's commissioner for England, said she was also concerned about the provision of devices. ""A lot of children still don't have laptops. They're surviving on broken phones,"" she told the Today programme. The Department for Education said it had delivered more than 560,000 devices to schools and councils in England between the start of the pandemic and the end of last year. In addition, it aims to have delivered a further 100,000 laptops and tablets to schools by the end of this week to help get closer to its overalltarget of one million devices,external. However, teaching groups have raised concerns about the rollout. Some children are being provided with tablets to keep them connected to their schools ""We must hear no more of rationing of equipment, as we did late last year,"" Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU) told the BBC. ""If the stockpiles exist, as the Department for Education claim they do, then they must be distributed urgently. We have heard too many stories of requests from schools not being met, or not being fully met."" Steven George of head teachers' union, NAHT added that a website used to order laptops had been inaccessible over the Christmas break, so some members had been unable to make requests. In addition, the Association of School and College Leaders suggested the government had ""never really got to grips"" with the issue. ""It is certainly sending out lots of laptops for disadvantaged children to schools. But there's clearly still a gap, not just in terms of the number of devices that are required but also in terms of whether families have sufficient connectivity,"" said general secretary Geoff Barton. ""This has happened because it is a crisis situation, and there hasn't been a great deal of time in which to properly assess the level of need that exists, but it does expose the fact that pre-crisis, there hadn't been a properly joined-up national strategy on digital learning."" Others have noted that the device allocation scheme does not extend to printers - which are needed for worksheets and other materials sent by teachers - putting low-income families at a further disadvantage.

Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas sales,"Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it saw a shift in shoppers' behaviour in the run-up to Christmas as a result of Covid-19 restrictions. It said that customers started shopping early to secure their festive treats, with traditional Christmas goods in strong demand. Champagne sales jumped 64% over the key Christmas trading period, while sales of whole salmon increased by 40%. Morrisons also said it would offer its car parks to host vaccination centres. The supermarket's chief executive, David Potts, saidthree of its supermarket car parks would be hosting coronavirus vaccinations from Monday, and it would offer another 47 locations to help with the vaccine rollout. Overall sales at Morrisons rose by 9.3% in the three weeks to 3 January, compared with the same period last year. ""The pandemic has had a severe effect on people and communities around Britain for nine months now but it has been especially hard at Christmas time,"" Mr Potts said. ""I'm very pleased with the way the Morrisons team has helped our customers across the nation enjoy their Christmas in the best way they could."" Supermarket websites feel the strain of new lockdown Christmas comes early with 'record' grocery sales Spent less, saved more: What we bought in 2020 The supermarket also suggested that festive sales had been driven by the fact that rules around larger family gatherings changed in England, meaning customers had to buy for last-minute smaller festivities. In the nine weeks to 3 January, like-for-like sales, stripping out the effect of new shops opening and fuel sales, were up 8.5% and in the six months to the same date they rose 8.1% compared with a year ago, boosted by strong online sales and that of its wholesale business. Morrisons said it had also benefitted from out-of-home eating and drinking being restricted by strict Covid-19 regulations. Supermarkets were classified as essential retailers in England's second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December, while restaurants and cafes could only operate takeaway services. According to new figures from market research firm Kantar, British people forked out Â£11.7bn in supermarkets throughout December in the sector's busiest month on record. Christmas food sales soared with many hospitality venues shut except for takeaways in December Supermarket trading was boosted by the Â£4bn that would normally have been spent on food and drink outside the home over the Christmas season, it said. ""While celebrations may have been more low key, there were also signs of consumers keeping merry and indulging after a tough year"", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Cheese sales, for example, increased by 17% and chilled desserts by 15%. Meanwhile, alcohol sales rose by Â£310m, with options to drink in pubs, bars and restaurants limited. The firm also found that online grocery sales accounted for 12.6% of total spend in December, compared with 7.4% in 2019. December is always busy for the supermarkets but this one has been the busiest on record. With all the restrictions and the closure of pubs and restaurants across much of the UK, people have had to eat and drink at home instead. According to Kantar, we spent Â£12bn last month, the highest amount of groceries sales ever. It's been a Christmas like no other but it seems we were determined to enjoy it. Aldi reported exceptional demand for its premium products yesterday. Morrisons says champagne sales were up 64% on last year. All the supermarkets will be toasting bumper festive sales this year and with another national lockdown in place, they're set to enjoy continuing increased demand for another few months. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Morrisons' trading update marked a ""significant milestone"" for the supermarket chain. ""Morrisons is an underdog in some ways, especially when looking at the online business, which is smaller than some rivals. ""The pandemic has given the group a chance to address this, and digital sales have more than tripled so far this quarter. ""The question now is if Morrisons can keep a firm grasp on that momentum, and push growth long and hard enough to give its competitors something to worry about,"" she added. Separately, clothing and homeware retailer Next reported a big uplift in online sales over the festive period. Online sales saw a jump of 36% in the nine weeks to 26 December compared with the same period last year, off-setting the 43% fall seen in stores. As a result, sales were 1.1% lower overall. The retailer said shoppers had shunned party outfits and work clothes in favour of loungewear. Next boss Simon Wolfson said that profits from better-than-expected sales in November and December would, however, be wiped out by fresh lockdown restrictions in England that would force 90% of its stores to close. It also has to account for additional costs stemming from disruption to its traditional Boxing Day sale and clearing stock leftover in its shops. Despite lockdown restrictions, Next is ""likely to flourish as we emerge from this pandemic"", said Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultant Begbies Traynor. She added that the recent administrations of the Arcadia Group and Debenhams might drive more shoppers to the retailer, as they turn to other familiar British brands. ""However, with no assurances of how long social distancing measures will be implemented and consumers now shopping for a purpose, not a pastime, the business must continue to manage costs and innovate if it is to take full advantage of these opportunities.""

Firms cancel holiday bookings as lockdown beginsTui and Thomas Cook cancel holidays after new coronavirus restrictions are imposed.BusinessComments,"Virgin Holidays has become the latest travel firm to cancel holidays after new coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed. It said schedules will be cancelled until mid-February, joining similar moves by Tui, Jet2 and Thomas Cook. The companies said customers would be contacted about their future travel options during what Virgin described as ""these extraordinary circumstances"". Thomas Cook said it will call customers to offer refunds or rebooking. Tui said it was ""cancelling all holidays in line with international travel restrictions"". It added that said customers due to depart from England, Scotland and Wales would be contacted to discuss options. The company said that customers due to travel from an English airport before mid-February, or from a Scottish or Welsh airport up to 31 January, would not be able to do so. Those customers will be contacted ""in departure date order to discuss their options"", Tui said, which include rebooking ""with an incentive"", getting a credit note, or a full refund. ""Customers currently overseas can continue to enjoy their holidays as planned and we will update them directly if there are any changes to their holidays,"" Tui added. Tui cancelled a flight to St Lucia on Tuesday In a statement, Virgin said: ""In line with the new national lockdown restrictions we have reviewed the upcoming holiday schedule and will be cancelling all holidays up to and including 14 February 2021. ""To simplify the options and to provide immediate peace of mind for customers whose holidays will no longer be going ahead, we're automatically providing a digital voucher for the value of their trip, redeemable up until 30 September 2021, which they can use to rebook a holiday, departing any time before 31 December 2022."" Virgin added that customers ""may also request a refund"". Meanwhile, Jet2 said it was extending ""the suspension of flights and holidays up to and including 11 February 2021"". A spokesman said: ""For customers due to travel from 12th February onwards, we will provide another update closer to the time."" Thomas Cook, which became an online-only travel brand in September after its earlier collapse, said: ""Following the announcement of the latest lockdown, we are calling our customers to offer refunds or move their holidays to a later date."". Chief executive Alan French said: ""We've seen over the festive period that customers are looking ahead to the summer and beginning to book in earnest for those important summer weeks in the sun. ""I am sure that after many more weeks spent at home - and with the progress of the vaccine rollout - we will see an even bigger demand for people to escape to the beach this summer."" Last month, a number of countries suspended routes to the UK due to the rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus. The blanket travel ban to the EU was then lifted, but withrules varying from country to country. The suspension of flights between the UK and China remains in place. Last year Tui was investigated by competition authorities aftercomplaints that it had not given prompt refunds. British Airways Holidays, part of Britain's biggest airline, said it would be offering refunds if customers are no longer allowed travel. The firm said in a statement: ""We are contacting all affected British Airways Holidays customers following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions. ""Customers due to depart by 12 February 2021 will be offered a refund for their holiday. Our teams continue to monitor the situation and update our policy accordingly.""

"Naked fugitive rescued by Australian fishermenThe man told the fishermen he had been stuck for days over a swamp near Darwin, living off snails.","Kev Joiner and Cam Faust heard the man crying for help while they were laying crab traps near Darwin Two fishermen have rescued a naked fugitive who they found clinging to trees over a crocodile-infested swamp in northern Australia. Kev Joiner and Cam Faust stumbled across the man in East Point near the city of Darwin on Sunday. The friends were laying crab traps when they heard the man crying for help, clinging to the branches of mangroves. They said the man begged them for water and said he had been out there for four days, living off snails. Australian TV network 9News said the 40-year-old man had allegedly breached bail for armed robbery. ""We didn't believe him at first,"" Mr Faust told the BBC. ""Then we realised he was in a bad way and done himself a mischief and were like oh, we better help him."" The man told the friends he had been out there for four days, living off snails Mr Faust said the man told them he went out on New Year's Eve to a concert, adding ""we thought he had a big night"". The fishermen allowed the man to hop on board their boat, with Mr Faust offering him his shorts to cover his modesty. ""He had scratches all over him, he was completely covered in mosquito bites, mud all over his face and his chest,""Mr Joiner told 9News,external. ""He was suffering pretty bad."" The fishermen shared a beer with the man as they ferried him to safety The friends said the man was lucky they found him, as the mangroves in East Point can be dangerous. Crocodiles are known to inhabit the swamps around Darwin in Australia's Northern Territory. While ferrying him to shore, the fishermen shared a beer with the man and called an ambulance, which met them at a boat ramp. The fishermen called an ambulance for the man, who was later taken into custody Police confirmed to Australian media that the man was a fugitive who had escaped custody days earlier. He was arrested and is being treated for exposure at Royal Darwin Hospital. ""He's in hospital with handcuffs on with two cops babysitting him,"" Mr Faust told 9News.

"Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas salesThe supermarket saw strong trading over the key Christmas period, with a jump in sales of salmon too.BusinessComments","Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it saw a shift in shoppers' behaviour in the run-up to Christmas as a result of Covid-19 restrictions. It said that customers started shopping early to secure their festive treats, with traditional Christmas goods in strong demand. Champagne sales jumped 64% over the key Christmas trading period, while sales of whole salmon increased by 40%. Morrisons also said it would offer its car parks to host vaccination centres. The supermarket's chief executive, David Potts, saidthree of its supermarket car parks would be hosting coronavirus vaccinations from Monday, and it would offer another 47 locations to help with the vaccine rollout. Overall sales at Morrisons rose by 9.3% in the three weeks to 3 January, compared with the same period last year. ""The pandemic has had a severe effect on people and communities around Britain for nine months now but it has been especially hard at Christmas time,"" Mr Potts said. ""I'm very pleased with the way the Morrisons team has helped our customers across the nation enjoy their Christmas in the best way they could."" Supermarket websites feel the strain of new lockdown Christmas comes early with 'record' grocery sales Spent less, saved more: What we bought in 2020 The supermarket also suggested that festive sales had been driven by the fact that rules around larger family gatherings changed in England, meaning customers had to buy for last-minute smaller festivities. In the nine weeks to 3 January, like-for-like sales, stripping out the effect of new shops opening and fuel sales, were up 8.5% and in the six months to the same date they rose 8.1% compared with a year ago, boosted by strong online sales and that of its wholesale business. Morrisons said it had also benefitted from out-of-home eating and drinking being restricted by strict Covid-19 regulations. Supermarkets were classified as essential retailers in England's second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December, while restaurants and cafes could only operate takeaway services. According to new figures from market research firm Kantar, British people forked out Â£11.7bn in supermarkets throughout December in the sector's busiest month on record. Christmas food sales soared with many hospitality venues shut except for takeaways in December Supermarket trading was boosted by the Â£4bn that would normally have been spent on food and drink outside the home over the Christmas season, it said. ""While celebrations may have been more low key, there were also signs of consumers keeping merry and indulging after a tough year"", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Cheese sales, for example, increased by 17% and chilled desserts by 15%. Meanwhile, alcohol sales rose by Â£310m, with options to drink in pubs, bars and restaurants limited. The firm also found that online grocery sales accounted for 12.6% of total spend in December, compared with 7.4% in 2019. December is always busy for the supermarkets but this one has been the busiest on record. With all the restrictions and the closure of pubs and restaurants across much of the UK, people have had to eat and drink at home instead. According to Kantar, we spent Â£12bn last month, the highest amount of groceries sales ever. It's been a Christmas like no other but it seems we were determined to enjoy it. Aldi reported exceptional demand for its premium products yesterday. Morrisons says champagne sales were up 64% on last year. All the supermarkets will be toasting bumper festive sales this year and with another national lockdown in place, they're set to enjoy continuing increased demand for another few months. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Morrisons' trading update marked a ""significant milestone"" for the supermarket chain. ""Morrisons is an underdog in some ways, especially when looking at the online business, which is smaller than some rivals. ""The pandemic has given the group a chance to address this, and digital sales have more than tripled so far this quarter. ""The question now is if Morrisons can keep a firm grasp on that momentum, and push growth long and hard enough to give its competitors something to worry about,"" she added. Separately, clothing and homeware retailer Next reported a big uplift in online sales over the festive period. Online sales saw a jump of 36% in the nine weeks to 26 December compared with the same period last year, off-setting the 43% fall seen in stores. As a result, sales were 1.1% lower overall. The retailer said shoppers had shunned party outfits and work clothes in favour of loungewear. Next boss Simon Wolfson said that profits from better-than-expected sales in November and December would, however, be wiped out by fresh lockdown restrictions in England that would force 90% of its stores to close. It also has to account for additional costs stemming from disruption to its traditional Boxing Day sale and clearing stock leftover in its shops. Despite lockdown restrictions, Next is ""likely to flourish as we emerge from this pandemic"", said Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultant Begbies Traynor. She added that the recent administrations of the Arcadia Group and Debenhams might drive more shoppers to the retailer, as they turn to other familiar British brands. ""However, with no assurances of how long social distancing measures will be implemented and consumers now shopping for a purpose, not a pastime, the business must continue to manage costs and innovate if it is to take full advantage of these opportunities.""

"Worker jailed for Buckingham Palace theftsFormer Buckingham Palace caterer Adamo Canto attempted to sell some items on eBay, a court hears.","Adamo Canto had worked as a catering assistant at the palace's Royal Mews since 2015 A Buckingham Palace catering assistant who stole medals and photographs from the Queen's residence has been jailed. Adamo Canto, 37, stole items including signed photos of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and a photo album of US President Donald Trump's UK visit.

YouTube kicks TalkRadio off its platformThe Google-owned video-hosting service has yet to give a reason for its action.,"YouTube has reinstated TalkRadio's channel on its platform hours after saying it had been ""terminated"" for breaking the tech firm's rules. It said the broadcaster had posted material that contradicted expert advice about the coronavirus pandemic. But it explained its U-turn saying it sometimes made exceptions to guidelines that state repeat offenders face a permanent ban. TalkRadio said it had yet to be given a full explanation for the affair. The decision to ban TalkRadio had appalled digital rights campaigners, with one group - Big Brother Watch - claiming it was evidence that ""big tech censorship is spiralling out of control"". The Google-owned service has issued a brief statement explaining its actions. ""TalkRadio's YouTube channel was briefly suspended, but upon further review, has now been reinstated,"" it said. ""We quickly remove flagged content that violate our community guidelines, including Covid-19 content that explicitly contradict expert consensus from local health authorities or the World Health Organization. We make exceptions for material posted with an educational, documentary, scientific or artistic purpose, as was deemed in this case."" YouTube has not published details of the offending posts. But independent fact-checkers haverepeatedly challenged,externalsome of theclaims made by interviewees,externalfeatured by the London-based radio station. YouTube operates a ""three strikes"" policy, whereby channels that break its community guidelines three times within a 90-day period can bepermanently banned,external, but other infractions lead to temporary restrictions. Prohibited content includes""medically unsubstantiated claims"" relating to Covid-19, and videos that contradictexpert consensus from local health authoritiessuch as the NHS. ""YouTube is making decisions about which opinions the public are allowed to hear, even when they are sourced to responsible and regulated new providers,"" TalkRadiosaid in a statement this evening,external. ""This sets a dangerous precedent and is censorship of free speech and legitimate national debate."" The broadcaster tweeted the statement minutes after YouTube's change of heart. It did not appear to be aware that its channel had been reinstated at the time, but hassince acknowledged the move,external. TalkRadio has about 424,000 listeners,external, according to the latest figures from market research provider Rajar. It uses YouTube as a means to livestream shows from its studios and to provide an archive of past broadcasts. Its channel on the platform has 242,000 subscribers. YouTube's action had meant that TalkRadio's website had featured articles featuring broken embedded clips for most of the day, and that users who had shared its clips would have been unable to view them. The US firm has previously imposed a permanent ban againstconspiracy theorist David Icke, and a one-week video suspension ofright-wing outlet One America News Network's ability to publish new clips - in both cases for breaches of its Covid rules.  It's pretty clear something has gone wrong at YouTube in the last 24 hours. It appeared as though TalkRadio had been banned for good on YouTube - or ""terminated"" as the company put it. YouTube is now saying it was a short suspension, which certainly seems like a backtrack. Even now, it's not obvious what the offending material was that caused this action. The whole process reinforces the idea that YouTube's moderation policies - where it draws the line between freedom of expression and clamping down on misinformation - can be messy and inconsistent. And when YouTube takes such an action without giving full details, it rains controversy down on its own head. This plays to a broader movement by YouTube and other social media companies to take a harder line on disinformation. Joe Biden is about to become US President - and he wants social media companies to do more to remove fake news. But as they are increasingly finding out, refereeing their own platforms can be hugely difficult, and this highlights the need for greater transparency about moderation decisions.

Post-primary transfer tests cancelled in NI,"Transfer tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools Post-primary transfer tests have been cancelled in Northern Ireland amid a Covid-19 surge. The decision was announced just four days before thousands of pupils were due to sit the first of a series of exams on Saturday. The tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools. It comes as schools are likely to shut until after the half-term break in mid-February as part of efforts to stem the soaring number of coronavirus cases. Northern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. With more than 12,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last seven days,further restrictions are comingand Stormont ministers are meeting later to discuss them. Parents angry at 'eleventh hour' move on tests On Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 1,378 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. There have also been 18 more Covid-19 related deaths. The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK hastopped 60,000 for the first timesince the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday, the number of people who have tested positive reached 60,916. COVIDCare NI Mobile App is now providingdaily updates of the latest statistics related to coronavirus,external. The transfer tests are run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) and the Post Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC). The AQE tests were due to go ahead on 9, 16 and 23 January. The PPTC test was due to take place on Saturday 30 January with a supplementary test on Saturday 6 February. LIVE: Follow rolling coverage of Tuesday's coronavirus news Stay-at-home order set to be given legal force NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered In a statement to BBC News NI, AQE said the tests would not take place in January due to the executive's decision to close schools. It said it would now consult with the 34 grammar schools that use its tests about a way forward. Schools in England, Scotland and Wales have also been closed to most pupils The PPTC said an expected announcement by the executive that schools would move to remote learning for many pupils until late February meant their tests would not proceed. ""If no pupils are able to sit the Entrance Assessment on 30 January 2021 because of Covid restrictions, and these restrictions would not have ended before 6 February 2021 then PPTC will be unable to provide an assessment for any pupils,"" said a PPTC statement. ""The responsibility falls on PPTC schools to ensure that their admissions criteria cover this contingency. ""PPTC accept that this decision may be disappointing to many children who would have welcomed the opportunity to take the assessment."" Some grammar schools had already outlined how they would admit pupilsusing ""Covid-19 criteria"" if transfer tests were cancelled. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, whose party Sinn FÃ©in is opposed to the transfer test, was among those who had been calling for the exams to be cancelled. Shetweeted,external: ""The decision to cancel transfer tests due to take place this week is welcome. ""This year has been emotionally and mentally challenging enough for children without the burden of these exams. ""DUP minister now needs to provide clarity on other exams."" Colin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, said the decision to cancel at such a late stage was ""shocking"" but it was the right decision. ""Children have been put through 12 months of all that hard work only to have it all called off at the last minute,"" he said. ""They have worked over Christmas, they have worked over holidays and this really should have all been sorted in May."" The executive is to meet later to discuss more Covid-19 restrictionsincluding arrangements for schools. The Department for Education (DE) is proposing many pupils should switch to remote learning for a prolonged period. But schools will be expected to remain open to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers. It is also likely that nursery schools and pre-school settings will close although they are likely also to be asked to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers. But whether special schools should remain open to all pupils is among the measures as yet undecided, BBC News NI understands. Ms O'Neill saiddetails of what the executive agreed on Mondaywould be formalised at an executive meeting on Tuesday, where the health and education ministers will bring separate papers. Ministers are then due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday. Northern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announceda staggered return to school for pupilsduring the month of January. Schools in England, Scotland and Wales are closed to most pupils, and the government in the Republic of Ireland is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January. Alternative arrangements for GCSE, AS, A-level and vocational exams will also be discussed by the executive on Tuesday. There have already been a number of changes, includingfewer exams and reduced content in many courses. However, the government in England announced on Tuesday that GCSE and A-level exams would be cancelled there. It is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be put in place in England, with the Education Minister Gavin Williamsonto make an announcement on that on Wednesday. The Scottish and Welsh governments announced last month that they would scrap the exams in 2021. Justin McCamphill, of teachers' union the NASUWT, said the education minister should scrap GCSEs and A-level exams in Northern Ireland. ""If GCSEs and A-levels can't run in England I really don't see why they would continue to run here,"" said Mr McCamphill. ""We are not going to be looking at a level playing field and it would not be good for our young people if they were being judged by a different system than children across the rest of UK.""

Calls for a new non-fatal strangulation offence,"""It could be something as simple as: 'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation"" A fresh move is under way to make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence in England and Wales, after the House of Lords debated the Domestic Abuse Bill. The government has said it has no plans to change the law, arguing that non-fatal strangulation is already covered by existing legislation. However, campaigners say abusers who use non-fatal strangulation are telling their victims: ""I am controlling you and I can kill you"" - but too often are charged only with common assault. Lockdown exit must consider rise in abuse - May Change in strangling law 'would save lives' This is what happened in Jenny's case. Her abusive partner used non-fatal strangulation as a means of control throughout the five years they were together. ""It was like his favourite thing to do,"" says Jenny, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. ""That sounds really awful and trivial but that is how it becomes as an abuse victim. You learn to accept that is part of your life. It was like something I had to manage."" ""We would wake up in the morning and he would be in one of those moods, and I would see it in his eyes and I would think today's the day I'm going to get it. ""It could be something as simple as: 'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation."" This video can not be played WATCH: Domestic abuse victim - 'He threw me against the wall and strangled me' Eventually one night she did call the police during an attack. ""He chased me round the house and every time he caught me he would pin me to the floor and strangle me until I had marks. ""I had burst blood vessels. I was streaming with tears. I just kept thinking: 'This is how I am going to die.' ""The doors were locked. He'd smashed my phone. I managed to get to the window and shout and one of the neighbours called the police."" However, she was dismayed by the police response. ""I thought it was quite lax. They didn't take the strangulation as seriously as they should have."" Her partner was charged with common assault. He pleaded guilty and was given a three-month sentence, suspended for 18 months. ""Strangulation needs to be a specific offence. I think the weak police response contributed to keeping me in the relationship,"" she says. Jenny believed her partner would eventually kill her. ""I just kept looking in the mirror and thinking: you need to leave and you're the only person who can do it. ""So one day while he was asleep, I picked up whatever I could carry and I ran and got on a train."" Baroness Newlove is bringing forward an amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill in the House of Lords Politicians and campaigners tried and failed to have a new offence of non-fatal strangulation introduced in the Domestic Abuse Bill when it was going through the House of Commons. During Tuesday's debate on the bill in the Lords, the Conservative peer and former victims' commissioner, Baroness Newlove, said she intended to table an amendment to the bill when it reached the committee stage. She said non-fatal strangulation was currently not being picked up adequately by the police, as it often left no physical marks on the victim. She described it as a terrifying crime, with many victims testifying they felt as though their heads were going to explode and they were about to die. Peers from other parties also spoke in support of a new offence. Nogah Offer, a lawyer with the Centre for Women's Justice, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for a new offence, says: ""We believe this is a real opportunity to make a difference."" Common assault is a summary offence that can be charged by the police. But when it involves domestic abuse, it should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, its guidance says. In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: ""Non-fatal strangulation is a serious crime which is already covered by existing laws such as common assault and attempted murder."" A spokesperson said the government would keep this area of the law under review, but said a specific offence of attempting to choke, strangle or suffocate a person is included in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and, according to the 2015 Serious Crime Act, attempted strangulation can fall under the offence of coercive or controlling behaviour. Dr Catherine White: ""Ultimately it can lead to death"" Dr Catherine White, clinical director of St. Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, says: ""Strangulation often ends up being treated the same as a slap or a punch. ""It's a very different crime. Often there is no external injury to the neck, which is why it's a very powerful tool for the perpetrator. ""It can cause confusion but ultimately it can lead to death."" A research project led by Dr White describes non-fatal strangulation as a ""gendered crime, with nearly all the patients female and the alleged perpetrators male"". And figures from the Femicide Census, which looked at the cases of women killed by men in the UK, found that in 2018, 29% died through strangulation. Campaigners point to New Zealand and some parts of the United States and Australia, where non-fatal strangulation has become a specific offence. Meanwhile, after help from a women's centre  and counselling, Jenny now feels stronger and happier. Despite the pandemic, she says, having finally escaped her abuser: ""2020 was one of the best years of my life.""

Holiday firms cancel bookings as lockdown begins,"Virgin Holidays has become the latest travel firm to cancel holidays after new coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed. It said schedules will be cancelled until mid-February, joining similar moves by Tui, Jet2 and Thomas Cook. The companies said customers would be contacted about their future travel options during what Virgin described as ""these extraordinary circumstances"". Thomas Cook said it will call customers to offer refunds or rebooking. Tui said it was ""cancelling all holidays in line with international travel restrictions"". It added that said customers due to depart from England, Scotland and Wales would be contacted to discuss options. The company said that customers due to travel from an English airport before mid-February, or from a Scottish or Welsh airport up to 31 January, would not be able to do so. Those customers will be contacted ""in departure date order to discuss their options"", Tui said, which include rebooking ""with an incentive"", getting a credit note, or a full refund. ""Customers currently overseas can continue to enjoy their holidays as planned and we will update them directly if there are any changes to their holidays,"" Tui added. Tui cancelled a flight to St Lucia on Tuesday In a statement, Virgin said: ""In line with the new national lockdown restrictions we have reviewed the upcoming holiday schedule and will be cancelling all holidays up to and including 14 February 2021. ""To simplify the options and to provide immediate peace of mind for customers whose holidays will no longer be going ahead, we're automatically providing a digital voucher for the value of their trip, redeemable up until 30 September 2021, which they can use to rebook a holiday, departing any time before 31 December 2022."" Virgin added that customers ""may also request a refund"". Meanwhile, Jet2 said it was extending ""the suspension of flights and holidays up to and including 11 February 2021"". A spokesman said: ""For customers due to travel from 12th February onwards, we will provide another update closer to the time."" Thomas Cook, which became an online-only travel brand in September after its earlier collapse, said: ""Following the announcement of the latest lockdown, we are calling our customers to offer refunds or move their holidays to a later date."". Chief executive Alan French said: ""We've seen over the festive period that customers are looking ahead to the summer and beginning to book in earnest for those important summer weeks in the sun. ""I am sure that after many more weeks spent at home - and with the progress of the vaccine rollout - we will see an even bigger demand for people to escape to the beach this summer."" Last month, a number of countries suspended routes to the UK due to the rapid spread of a new variant of coronavirus. The blanket travel ban to the EU was then lifted, but withrules varying from country to country. The suspension of flights between the UK and China remains in place. Last year Tui was investigated by competition authorities aftercomplaints that it had not given prompt refunds. British Airways Holidays, part of Britain's biggest airline, said it would be offering refunds if customers are no longer allowed travel. The firm said in a statement: ""We are contacting all affected British Airways Holidays customers following the announcement of new national lockdown restrictions. ""Customers due to depart by 12 February 2021 will be offered a refund for their holiday. Our teams continue to monitor the situation and update our policy accordingly.""

Medics appeal for more to get higher level PPE,"Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used Early in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated. But research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. Most infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. Across the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. More sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols. In their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. But they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. The letter states: ""It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission"". Barry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. He is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. A signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it. ""There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place."" He believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients. Surgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about Â£5.00. Dr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid, He points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. ""We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us."" A few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance. It's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. One consultant, who did not want to be named, said: ""When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act."" RCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. ""While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases."" Public Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline. ""UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data. ""Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.""

Supermarket websites struggle amid new lockdown,"Supermarkets' online shopping operations have come under strain with customers rushing to book deliveries as the new coronavirus lockdown began. Within a couple of hours of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Monday, shoppers reported problems with Sainsbury's and Tesco. Sainsbury's said on Tuesday that earlier it had restricted access to its online services to manage high demand. The surge in demand echoes consumers' reaction at the start of the pandemic. Sainsbury's said: ""We temporarily limited access to our groceries online service last night so that we could manage high demand for slots and updates customers were making to existing orders. ""We're continuing to monitor the situation and are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused."" A spokeswoman said customers should now be able to use the Sainsbury's app and website ""as usual"". Lockdown: 'The road to recovery just got longer' New lockdowns begin ahead of 'hardest weeks' After the first lockdown in March, supermarkets reported panic buying and a rush to book online delivery slots despite grocers insisting there would be no shortages if consumers shopped sensibly. Shoppers used social media to vent their frustration on Monday, with Twitter user Auld Bryan saying: ""Ocado have already introduced their virtual queue process on their app. It's March 2020 all over again."" Another tweet, by Karl Dyson, said of Ocado: ""You'd think ~10 months in to this, they'd have worked on scalable infrastructure for the website?"" There were also reports of people having problems with the Tesco app and website, including when trying to check out and complete payment. However, a spokesman for Britain's biggest supermarket said on Monday evening that there had been no reports from Tesco's technical department of any website problems. The supermarket had increased the number of slots available for online delivery before the latest lockdown measures. An email from Tesco UK boss Jason Tarry already sent to customers said: ""Since March, we have more than doubled home delivery and Click+Collect slots to 1.5 million a week, with over 760,000 vulnerable customers registered with us who are eligible for priority slots."" Users complained that the Sainsbury's app was down following the prime minister's announcement on Monday. Twitter user Francesca Balgobind wrote: ""What's happening with the Sainsbury's shopping app tonight? Website is down too?"" Another social media user, Matt, said some 40 minutes after Mr Johnson had finished speaking: ""Sainsbury's app and website down"". Asda saw more demand for online shopping after the lockdown announcement, but said it had increased the number of slots available since the first two national lockdowns. Morrisons also reported a jump in the number of shoppers using its website after the announcement. However, despite the longer waiting queues, the grocer said it continued to have ""good slot availability"" for home deliveries. Throughout the pandemic, supermarkets have urged people to shop normally. Before Christmas, in the run-up to the end of the Brexit transition period, some grocers reported temporary shortages of fresh goods due to congestion at UK shipping ports.

Firms offered new grants to survive lockdown,"Businesses in retail, hospitality and leisure will receive new grants to help them keep afloat until spring, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The grants will be worth up to Â£9,000 per property, the Treasury says. Mr Sunak told the BBC he was ""committed to protecting jobs and supporting businesses"". Business groups welcomed the new help as a good start but warned the money still wouldn't be enough to save many firms from collapse. The help is in addition to business rates relief and the furlough scheme, which has been extended until the end of April. Firms do not have to pay the grant money back. Mr Sunak said he would consider whether or how to extend support packages in its Budget on 3 March. ""The Budget early in March is an excellent opportunity to take stock of the range of support we have put in place and set out the next stage of our economic response,"" he said. England and Scotland begin new lockdowns What are the rules where you live? Cambridgeshire businesses on what the grants will mean The director general of the CBI business group, Tony Danker, earlier warned leaving additional support until the Budget could be too late for many firms, saying. ""the comprehensive restrictions required a new comprehensive response"". It was a fear echoed by other business groups, the BCC and the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). BCC director general, Adam Marshall, warned many smaller firms would not qualify for help and ""will be left struggling to see how this new top-up grant will help them out of their cashflow problems."" He also called for the support to be extended to firms in other sectors ""who are also feeling the devastating impacts of these restrictions."" FSB chair Mike Cherry also said the funds would be a lifeline to many, but ""do not go far enough to match the scale of the crisis that small firms are facing."" The British Beer & Pub Association described the grants as a ""lifeline"", but added that companies on which pubs rely, such as breweries, would also need help. Seb Heeley, owner of distillery Manchester Gin, says he needs dates to plan around Seb Heeley, owner of distillery Manchester Gin, told the BBC that fixed dates to aim for are crucial for his business. ""We need a date to work towards and we don't have that so, again, we're in limbo,"" he said. ""It takes three or four weeks"" to prepare, including retraining staff, he added. His business has been closed since October because of restrictions in the Manchester area. It borrowed money under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). ""We start repayment in June and there's good chance we won't be open, so they are going to have to extend that,"" he said. He said much of the Â£9,000 grant will be taken up by the Â£6,000 a month his business owes in pension contributions and national insurance alone. Mr Sunak said the new support would ""help businesses to get through the months ahead - and crucially it will help sustain jobs, so workers can be ready to return when they are able to reopen"". Businesses such as cafes, restaurants, leisure centres and shops that do not sell essentials have been particularly hard hit by coronavirus lockdown measures as people are told to stay at home. All non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues are now closed, with pubs and restaurants allowed to offer takeaway food and non-alcoholic drinks only. The new measures contained no additional support for self-employed people. Mel Stride, chair of parliament's Treasury Committee, which scrutinises the finance department's work, warned the chancellor ""must not forget those who have fallen through the gaps around previous support packages."" While this is welcome and essential support, it is now clear that the most optimistic timetable for economic lift-off from the pandemic is going to be put back. This raises questions about the length of the furlough scheme, and government-guaranteed loans. Before this, the best-case scenario was that mass vaccination, enabling a confident reopening of the economy, would allow furloughed workers to go straight back to their jobs in late spring. This was never the government's central forecast, but looked possible amid optimism about the vaccine last month. Even if all vulnerable people can be vaccinated by March, the first three months of the year will see school lockdowns which will harm growth, and therefore a possible double dip recession. Business groups which welcomed this support say they now need a clear long-term plan. They want to know that current levels of support will stay in place until most of the population is vaccinated. Hundreds of thousands of self-employed workers who fell through the gaps of support remain under huge pressure, particularly ahead of the self assessment tax deadline. A decision on extending the Â£20 a week increase to universal credit will also be required. England's lockdown rules are due to be reviewed on 15 February while Scotland's will be reviewed at the end of January. In the UK, the unemployment rate rose to 4.9% in the three months to October, with the jobless total up to 1.7 million people. Redundancies hit a record high over the period. The Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, predicts the UK economy will have shrunk by 11.3% in 2020 - the biggest decline in 300 years.

NI stay-at-home order set to be given legal force,"Northern Ireland's lockdown is set to have further restrictions attached An order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home - to stop the spread of Covid-19 - will become legally enforceable from Friday. The executive agreed the move after it met on Tuesday and tightened other measures. It will mean people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise and work that cannot be done from home. NI is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. As it happened:Executive agrees new lockdown rules Ministers also agreed to a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to reintroduce enforcement powers for the PSNI to order people to go home if they are engaging in prohibited activity. Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Arlene Foster said people should not wait for the regulations to take effect and insisted people should already be staying at home. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland faced a ""difficult period ahead"", but that the interventions were necessary. However, she said the executive had not reached agreement on whether GCSE or A-level exams should go ahead, and that further meetings would need to take place later this week. ""We will also have an urgent meeting convened tomorrow with faith groups, hopefully moving them all to online services,"" she added. Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be reduced from 15 people to six and only from two households, which will include children under 12 - exemptions will apply such as support bubbles. People will no longer be allowed to meet with other households in private gardens, although similar exemptions will apply there too. However, people will be allowed to take exercise outdoors with one person from another household. The executive also supported a proposal from the health minister to make it a requirement for all employers to conduct a risk assessment where employees are required to work away from their home. Ministers agreed the measures will last until 6 February, and be reviewed along with other lockdown measures on 21 January. Many pupils willnot return to school until after the half-term breakin mid-February, with nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until then. However, ministers agreed that special schools will remain open as usual. Vulnerable children and children of key workers will have access to schools for supervised learning. Childcare settings will be allowed to remain open and childminders can continue their services. Payments to parents of children who receive free school meals will also continue, the Department of Education has confirmed. Discussions on exams took place, but ministers agreed to revisit this issue. Education Minister Peter Weir said: ""Work is ongoing on this issue as a matter of urgency and I intend to provide further clarity in the next couple of days. ""Until and unless any announcement is made, students should expect to continue to sit scheduled examinations."" On Tuesday evening, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said ""further flexibilities"" would be put in place for January exams and assessments, particularly in relation to BTecs. She said: ""Learning centres, including further education colleges, schools and training providers, will be afforded additional discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for learners to sit the scheduled BTec exams in January, taking into consideration a range of factors including health and safety and the personal circumstances of their learners."" It has also been confirmed thatpost-primary school transfer tests have been cancelledthis month due to the surge in the number of coronavirus cases. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, was due to take place on Saturday. But the Association for Quality Education (AQE) later announced that a single transfer test would be held on Saturday 27 February. The guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable - and had to shield during the first lockdown in March - is not expected to change. Ministers are due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday. England and Scotland begin new lockdowns How quickly can we jab our way out of lockdown? On Tuesday, a further 18 coronavirus-related deaths - 11 in the past 24 hours and seven in the past week - were recorded by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 1,384. The department recorded a further 1,378 cases of the virus, with 577 confirmed patients in hospital, 45 of whom are in intensive care. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the previous week. A vaccination programme started in Northern Ireland in December Northern Ireland's director of the Royal College of Surgeons warned the health service could soon struggle to deal with the number of people needing treatment. ""That's not just the Covid patients - it's the patients who have a heart attack, a stroke, the people who fall and break their hip,"" said Dr Mark Taylor. ""But the difficulty is the more the system is pulled to deal with Covid, the less ability we have to deal with other aspects. ""The more Covid overwhelms the intensive care units then we're into really difficult ethical decisions... which no doctor wants to make in terms of who requires that ventilator.""

Schools closed 'with heaviest of hearts' says Gove,"Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the replacement for exams needed to be ""as fair as possible"" The government closed schools in England with ""the heaviest of hearts"", Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said, as he confirmed this year's GCSE and A-level exams have been cancelled. The decision was made after the UK's chief medical officers recommended a move to Covid threat level five. Mr Gove said teacher-led assessments would have to be used and efforts would be made to ensure grades are fair. However, there are growing calls for vocational exams to be cancelled. Many BTecs and technical exams are due to take place in the coming days, but head teachers and college leaders say it would be impossible to hold them and unfair to candidates. The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region also called for the exams to be binned. In a statement, they said: ""It is unfair to ask these students to go into colleges when everyone else is being told to stay at home and schools and colleges are closed to the majority of students. ""This will cause unnecessary anxiety and concern just when they need to be able to focus. ""Secondly, students in the Liverpool and Greater Manchester City Regions have faced restrictions for far longer, with more time being spent out of college, than students in other parts of the country, therefore these exams will not be a level playing field."" All primary and secondary schools are closed to pupils, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, for the next six weeks. Teaching will continue remotely. But nurseries and early years settings are being told to remain open. Providers says they are concerned about the risk to staff and the wider community. One head teacher, Neil Strowger from Bohunt School in Hampshire, said he was ""bitterly disappointed and quite upset"" for students who have suffered so much disruption this year and ""fearful"" about what it would mean for them. 'Why haven't our BTec exams been cancelled too?' Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data fees Schools to close and exams facing axe in England England and Scotland begin new lockdowns Another head teacher Evelyn Ford, of Copthall School in north London, said school leaders had been working hard over Christmas and this week to roll out mass testing and now had to shift their focus to provide lessons remotely for the next six weeks. And, despite the government saying vocational exams such as BTec should go ahead, with some scheduled for this week, the Association of School and College Leaders said that seemed ""pretty impossible"". This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""With a heavy heart but with clear evidence we had to act."" On Sunday Boris Johnson said he had ""no doubt"" that schools were safe, but on Monday he said pupils were transmitting the virus into homes and the community. Father-of-four, Glen, told the BBC he was angry at having to now juggle home schooling with working from home. He said: ""This wasn't something unforeseen. This wasn't something that came along and hit us out of the blue."" Another mother, Camille Barbagallo, said parents ""should not have to be in this position"". ""We've been hearing of 50,000 cases plus a day, day in day out,"" she added. Another father, Emeka, was resigned to the situation, saying: ""It's a sacrifice we have to make. We take it on the chin for the country."" Former head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he did not think the education department ""was being led well at the moment"". ""If you talk to head teachersâ¦they lack confidence in the leadership they're receiving,"" he said, adding that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should ""take final accountability for what's gone on"". Mr Gove said the Department for Education was working with exams regulator Ofqual, to find a way to assess students that is fair, Education secretary Gavin Williamson is expected to make a statement on exams in Wednesday, but it is understood that work is ongoing to plan for what will replace them. Summer exams were cancelled weeks ago on Scotland and Wales, with a range of methods of internal school assessment to be used instead to judge pupils' progress. Some exams are due to go ahead in Northern Ireland. By Hannah Richardson, BBC News education reporter It was the step the government said it would never take - closing schools again in England to all but a small number of children. Again and again we were told education was the priority and schools would remain fully open. The Department for Education stood firm against a crescendo of calls for a circuit-breaker during the October half-term, then against an early holiday in December. Self-isolating teachers were going to extraordinary lengths to teach remotely from home, while heads created one-way systems, sanitiser stations and installed temperature scanners in school receptions. But the attendance figures were showing week after week how the virus was impacting on pupils' ability to show up. For a while, mass testing of pupils seemed to be the answer, but the short time available for head teachers to set this up made it a non-starter. In the end it was the pressure on the NHS, caused by the new, more contagious variant of coronavirus, which sounded the closing bell for schools. To shut them was the only lever government had left to pull to try to turn the tanker as a new tide of Covid cases began sweeping the nation. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be unfair to run the vocational exams. And the Association of Colleges, which represents further education colleges where many exams are due to be taken, has written to the government calling for vocational and technical exams to be cancelled ""without delay"". It also argued there may be difficulties in finding invigilators to actually run the exams. And nursery providers are questioning how it can be safe to open early years settings, but not schools. Neil Leitch, chief executive of Early Years Alliance, said: ""Many of those working in the early years feel terrified and abandoned by the government. They are being asked to remain on the frontline during the most worrying period of a global pandemic with no PPE, no testing and no access to vaccinations."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said that remote learning and time out of school had a ""very negative impact"" for children, and called on the government to ensure consistency in remote learning and access to technology. She said: ""A lot of pupils still don't have laptops. They are surviving on broken phones - those children now need to be seen as a priority to get into the classroom and deemed to be a vulnerable child."" It is understood Ofsted inspectors may be asked to monitor how well schools are providing remote learning. Technology companies and broadband providers needed to ""step up""and address the cost of data for remote learning, which was another obstacle for some families, Ms Longfield said.

"UK 'cannot duck' post-Covid inequalitiesA growing divide over education, jobs, and ethnicity threaten the fabric of society, says Nobel laureate's study.BusinessComments","Food banks have seen increased demand during the pandemic The UK ""cannot duck"" tackling inequalities of health, ethnicity, education and jobs post-Covid, a major review has warned. The report's chairman, Nobel laureate Sir Angus Deaton, says a lot of work to repair and rebuild the damage will be needed after the pandemic. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) Deaton Review of Inequalities warned the fabric of society was under threat. Launched 18 months ago, the review says Covid-19 worsened existing problems. The review says there is a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle the disadvantages faced by many that this pandemic has so devastatingly exposed"". ""We now face a set of challenges which we cannot duck."" Sir Angus said: ""As the vaccines should, at some point this year, take us into a world largely free of the pandemic, it is imperative to think about policies that will be needed to repair the damage and that focus on those who have suffered the most. ""We need to build a country in which everyone feels that they belong."" While the pandemic had highlighted the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups and deprived communities, it also showed that the UK's best-paid and most highly educated have been ""much better able to ride out the crisis"", the report said. Young people have been among the worst hit economically Children from poorer households found it harder to do schoolwork during lockdown and have been more likely to miss school since September, it noted. And while the biggest risk factor for coronavirus is age, younger people have been hit harder by the economic consequences of the crisis. The cost of the pandemic is ""just colossal"" IFS director Paul Johnson told the BBC's Today programme. ""We've seen the biggest reduction in national income, essentially in history, over the last year, we've seen the biggest public deficit in history outside of the two world wars, so there's no getting around the fact that the pandemic and the response to it has had a bigger effect on the economy than anything essentially in the whole of history."" The report highlighted the effects of the pandemic on different groups, including on education, which is ""probably more worrying"" than the overall economic effect, Mr Johnson said. ""The first lockdown lockdown saw a dreadful impact on the education particularly of poorer children... they were getting less in the way of online lessons from their schools. ""There's a huge private school/state school divide in this, but also a big divide within state schools between those children who had support at home, had the facilities at home - laptops and internet and so on - but who also had the support from school - so there's a big impact on education but also a very unequal one,"" he added. Redundancy plans fall after furlough extension Tesco, Pizza Hut and Superdrug in minimum wage fail The review is calling for extra support for children who have fallen behind and help for school and university leavers to find jobs. It says the welfare safety net must be adapted so it supports non-traditional forms of employment, including insecure and self-employed workers, and minority ethnic groups must be given greater economic opportunities. Progress in reducing poor mental and physical health could be ""one of the clearest indications of success of economic and social policy"", it adds. Mark Franks, director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the review, said: ""Individuals are subject to a wide range of potential vulnerabilities around dimensions including age, ethnicity, place of birth, education, income and the nature of their employment. ""Where these vulnerabilities intersect, they can amplify and reinforce one another and play a huge role in driving unequal outcomes."" However, the government said it was already spending vast sums to support people and the economy through the pandemic. A spokesman said: ""We're doing everything we can to ensure our coronavirus support reaches those who need it the most, which is why we've invested more than Â£280bn to protect the incomes, livelihoods and health of millions of people across the UK."" This included an additional Â£9bn for the welfare system and Â£2bn for the Kickstart Scheme, tripling traineeships, incentives for firms hiring apprentices and doubling the number of work coaches ""so that nobody is left without hope or opportunity"", the spokesman said.

Biden and Trump rally on eve of key Georgia poll,"This video can not be played Trump: ""If [Pence] doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much"" In duelling rallies, President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden have urged voters in Georgia to turn out for elections on Tuesday that will decide which party controls the Senate. Mr Trump, a Republican, and Mr Biden, a Democrat, said the votes for two Senate seats would shape the US for years. More than three million Georgians have already cast ballots - nearly 40% of the state's registered voters. If the Democrats win, they will control all of Congress and the White House. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? The Republican Senate incumbents in Georgia - Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue - are trying to hold off the Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock. The runoff is needed under Georgia's state election rules because none of the Senate candidates received more than 50% of the vote in November's US election. Voting begins at 07:00 (12:00 GMT) and ends about 12 hours later. The vote will decide the balance of power in the US Senate. Republicans are currently in control, holding 52 of the 100 seats. If both Democrats win on Tuesday, the Senate will be evenly split, allowing incoming Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead This would be crucial for pushing through Mr Biden's progressive agenda, including key issues such as health care and environmental regulations - issues with strong Republican opposition. The Senate also has the power to approve or reject Mr Biden's nominees for cabinet and judicial posts. If Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock both win, it will bring the White House, Senate and the House of Representatives under Democratic control for the first time since President Barack Obama's election in 2008. At a drive-in rally in Atlanta on Monday, Mr Biden told voters: ""Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you. The power is literally in your hands."" Flanked by Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock, he said: ""Unlike any time in my career, one state - one state - can chart the course, not just for the four years but for the next generation."" Mr Biden campaigned in Georgia, saying ""the power is literally in your hands"" Mr Biden also took aim at Mr Trump, accusing him of ""whining and complaining"" about November's presidential election result rather than concentrating on the Covid-19 pandemic. ""I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work,"" he said. On Monday evening at a rally in Dalton, President Trump told voters that the Georgia runoff was the ""last line of defence"" against the Democrats. In what may have been the last rally of his presidency, he told the state's voters ""the whole world is watching"" and that this was ""your last chance to save the America that we love"". The president repeated unproven allegations that he was only declared the loser in Georgia after November's White House election because of fraud. Republican officials are worried this could depress turnout among the party faithful in Tuesday's vote. Mr Trump played this down, telling voters to ""swarm it tomorrow"". This video can not be played Georgia official Gabriel Sterling urges voters to cast ballots A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years, but the party will be buoyed by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. The margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the US president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. It's just over two weeks until Joe Biden's inauguration, but the first real test of his presidency will come on Tuesday, when Georgia's two run-off Senate elections will decide which party controls the US Senate as he takes office. If Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. The narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators. It will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice. If the Republicans hold on, then Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff,launched his campaign with an endorsement from Democratic superstar and civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Mr Ossoff spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat David Perduehas served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees Reverend Raphael Warnockis a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. He helped start the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents Kelly Loefflerwas named to the US Senate in December 2019 after the sitting senator resigned. Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The league's players have called for her to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter Mr Trump - who is due to leave office on 20 January - said at his Georgia rally: ""They're not taking this White House. We're going to fight like hell."" He hinted that he wanted Vice-President Mike Pence, in his role as president of the Senate, to reject Mr Biden's win when Congress meets on Wednesday to certify the election results. ""I hope that Mike Pence comes through for us,"" Mr Trump said. ""Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much."" Some Republicans have said they will raise objections to the presidential election result in the House and Senate, requiring a debate and vote. But with other Republicans saying they will not contest Mr Biden's victory, the votes questioning it would not succeed. Trump 'just plain wrong' on Georgia claim Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Over the weekend it was revealed Mr Trump also held a controversial phone call with Georgia's top election official, secretary of state Brad Raffensperger. In a recording of the call, first published by the Washington Post newspaper on Sunday, Mr Trump pressured Mr Raffensperger to ""find"" votes that would reverse his defeat in the state. At his rally, Mr Biden did not make direct reference to the call, but alluded to Mr Trump's persistent challenges to the election results, saying that ""politicians cannot assert, take or seize power"".

"Bond girl Tanya Roberts still alive, agent says","Roberts played geologist Stacey Sutton in A View To A Kill Former Bond actress and Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts has died in hospital in Los Angeles at the age of 65. Roberts appeared with Sir Roger Moore in his final Bond film, 1985's A View To A Kill, and had a recurring role in That '70s Show. She also starred in the final series of Charlie's Angels on TV in 1980. Her death was prematurely announced on Monday, only for doctors to say she was still alive. However, her death was then confirmed on Tuesday. Roberts had collapsed while walking her dogs on 24 December and was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre. Her partner Lance O'Brien mistakenly thought she had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital. After getting a call from doctors to say she was deteriorating quickly, he went to her bedside, her eyes closed and she ""faded"",TMZ reported,external. Devastated, he walked out of the room and then the hospital without speaking to medical staff before informing Roberts' agent that he had ""just said goodbye to Tanya"". But while being interviewed for US TV show Inside Edition on Monday, Mr O'Brien got a call from the hospital to say she was alive. The moment was captured on film,external, as he picked up his phone and said: ""Now you're telling me she's alive? Thank the Lord."" However, she died on Monday night. She appeared in A View To A Kill alongside Sir Roger Moore and singer Grace Jones Born Victoria Leigh Blum in 1955, Roberts grew up in New York before moving to Hollywood in 1977. Her big break came when she replaced Shelly Hack in Charlie's Angels, joining Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd as third 'Angel' Julie. After the show's cancellation, she appeared in such fantasy adventure films as The Beastmaster and Hearts and Armour. She also played comic book heroine Sheena in a 1984 film that saw her nominated for a Golden Raspberry award for worst actress. Roberts received another Razzie nomination for her role as geologist Stacey Sutton in 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill. Roberts in the title role in Sheena: Queen of the Jungle She admitted being ""a little cautious"" about taking the role, but said it would have been ""ridiculous"" to have turned it down. Roberts' subsequent films included Night Eyes and Inner Sanctum, erotic thrillers that did little to advance her career. She went on to play Midge Pinciotti in more than 80 episodes of That '70s Show between 1998 and 2004. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Bond girl Tanya Roberts still alive, agent saysHer agent says earlier reports of the actress' death were wrong, but she is in a serious condition.","Roberts played geologist Stacey Sutton in A View To A Kill Former Bond actress and Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts has died in hospital in Los Angeles at the age of 65. Roberts appeared with Sir Roger Moore in his final Bond film, 1985's A View To A Kill, and had a recurring role in That '70s Show. She also starred in the final series of Charlie's Angels on TV in 1980. Her death was prematurely announced on Monday, only for doctors to say she was still alive. However, her death was then confirmed on Tuesday. Roberts had collapsed while walking her dogs on 24 December and was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre. Her partner Lance O'Brien mistakenly thought she had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital. After getting a call from doctors to say she was deteriorating quickly, he went to her bedside, her eyes closed and she ""faded"",TMZ reported,external. Devastated, he walked out of the room and then the hospital without speaking to medical staff before informing Roberts' agent that he had ""just said goodbye to Tanya"". But while being interviewed for US TV show Inside Edition on Monday, Mr O'Brien got a call from the hospital to say she was alive. The moment was captured on film,external, as he picked up his phone and said: ""Now you're telling me she's alive? Thank the Lord."" However, she died on Monday night. She appeared in A View To A Kill alongside Sir Roger Moore and singer Grace Jones Born Victoria Leigh Blum in 1955, Roberts grew up in New York before moving to Hollywood in 1977. Her big break came when she replaced Shelly Hack in Charlie's Angels, joining Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd as third 'Angel' Julie. After the show's cancellation, she appeared in such fantasy adventure films as The Beastmaster and Hearts and Armour. She also played comic book heroine Sheena in a 1984 film that saw her nominated for a Golden Raspberry award for worst actress. Roberts received another Razzie nomination for her role as geologist Stacey Sutton in 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill. Roberts in the title role in Sheena: Queen of the Jungle She admitted being ""a little cautious"" about taking the role, but said it would have been ""ridiculous"" to have turned it down. Roberts' subsequent films included Night Eyes and Inner Sanctum, erotic thrillers that did little to advance her career. She went on to play Midge Pinciotti in more than 80 episodes of That '70s Show between 1998 and 2004. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Medics appeal for more to get higher level PPEThe group want staff to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care.Health,"Doctors' leaders have called for urgent improvements in personal protective equipment for health workers. The British Medical Association is appealing for a higher grade of face mask to guard against coronavirus infection. It says there is 'growing evidence' that the virus is being spread through the air by aerosols. These are tiny virus particles that can build up in stuffy rooms and they have been linked to outbreaks of Covid-19. This follows an open letter from more than 1,500 health professionals for staff on general wards to be given the type of high-quality masks usually only worn in intensive care units. Public Health England (PHE) has issued guidance on what PPE staff in different settings require. It was last updatedin October 2020,external. Coronavirus: Has the NHS got enough PPE? Covid PPE: Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used Early in the pandemic, it was widely believed that to catch the disease you had to either be close to an infected person and hit by droplets from their coughs or sneezes or touch a surface they had contaminated. But research during the course of last year highlighted how it is also possible for the virus to be carried in what are called aerosols, drifting and accumulating in the air. Most infections are thought to have occurred indoors in badly ventilated rooms, and many studies have shown that the 'airborne route' can be an important factor. Across the UK, the guidance for hospital staff is to wear surgical masks in most areas. More sophisticated masks - a type known as FFP3 that includes an air filter - are only required in intensive care or when certain procedures are carried out that are known to generate aerosols. In their letter, the consultants, doctors and nurses say healthcare workers are three to four times more likely to become infected than the general population. But they point out that staff in intensive care units, who have the best level of protection, have about half the risk of catching the virus than colleagues on general wards. The letter states: ""It is now essential that healthcare workers have their PPE upgraded to protect against airborne transmission"". Barry McAree, a consultant surgeon in Northern Ireland, is one of many healthcare workers to be ill with Covid. He is self-isolating at home right after his testing positive for the second time. A signatory to the letter, he says his hospital in Antrim followed the guidance about which type of masks should be worn in which areas, but he became infected nonetheless. It is not clear how and when he caught it. ""There's so much evidence that we are talking about an airborne infection that it has to be said that it is not appropriate just to wear FFP3 in environments when aerosol generating procedures take place."" He believes that with such high levels of the virus in the community and in hospitals, staff should be wearing the higher-grade masks whenever they're close to patients. Surgical masks can be bought online for about 10p each, while the FFP3 masks are far more expensive about Â£5.00. Dr Barry Jones, a retired gastroenterologist and leading expert on aerosols, says that's nothing compared to the cost of a patient with Covid, He points to data showing that roughly a fifth of people needing hospital treatment for Covid may have acquired the infection in hospital in the first place. ""We should do everything we can to reduce that possibility - it's the air we share that's killing us."" A few hospitals have decided to break with official guidance. It's understood that hospitals in Cambridge, Plymouth and Exeter have decided to equip staff with FFP3 masks if they face patients diagnosed with Covid or suspected of having it. One consultant, who did not want to be named, said: ""When you realise patients are more infectious at an earlier stage of disease and are presenting at general wards with poorer ventilation than intensive care units and staff are wearing a poorer quality of PPE, you really want those in a position of leadership to listen and to act."" RCN General Secretary Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""Without delay, they must state whether existing PPE guidance is adequate for the new variant. ""While more research is carried out, we ask for the precautionary principle to be applied and staff to be given a higher level of PPE if working with suspected or confirmed cases."" Public Health England said this was a matter for NHS England to comment on. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The safety of NHS and social care staff has always been our top priority and we continue to work tirelessly to deliver PPE that protects those on the frontline. ""UK guidance on the safest levels of PPE is written by experts and agreed by all four chief medical officers. Our guidance is kept under constant review based on the latest evidence and data. ""Emerging evidence and data, including on variant strains, will be continually monitored and reviewed, and the guidance updated accordingly if needed.""

"Champagne puts fizz in Morrisons' Christmas salesThe supermarket saw strong trading over the key Christmas period, with a jump in sales of salmon too.","Supermarket chain Morrisons has said it saw a shift in shoppers' behaviour in the run-up to Christmas as a result of Covid-19 restrictions. It said that customers started shopping early to secure their festive treats, with traditional Christmas goods in strong demand. Champagne sales jumped 64% over the key Christmas trading period, while sales of whole salmon increased by 40%. Morrisons also said it would offer its car parks to host vaccination centres. The supermarket's chief executive, David Potts, saidthree of its supermarket car parks would be hosting coronavirus vaccinations from Monday, and it would offer another 47 locations to help with the vaccine rollout. Overall sales at Morrisons rose by 9.3% in the three weeks to 3 January, compared with the same period last year. ""The pandemic has had a severe effect on people and communities around Britain for nine months now but it has been especially hard at Christmas time,"" Mr Potts said. ""I'm very pleased with the way the Morrisons team has helped our customers across the nation enjoy their Christmas in the best way they could."" Supermarket websites feel the strain of new lockdown Christmas comes early with 'record' grocery sales Spent less, saved more: What we bought in 2020 The supermarket also suggested that festive sales had been driven by the fact that rules around larger family gatherings changed in England, meaning customers had to buy for last-minute smaller festivities. In the nine weeks to 3 January, like-for-like sales, stripping out the effect of new shops opening and fuel sales, were up 8.5% and in the six months to the same date they rose 8.1% compared with a year ago, boosted by strong online sales and that of its wholesale business. Morrisons said it had also benefitted from out-of-home eating and drinking being restricted by strict Covid-19 regulations. Supermarkets were classified as essential retailers in England's second national lockdown between 5 November and 2 December, while restaurants and cafes could only operate takeaway services. According to new figures from market research firm Kantar, British people forked out Â£11.7bn in supermarkets throughout December in the sector's busiest month on record. Christmas food sales soared with many hospitality venues shut except for takeaways in December Supermarket trading was boosted by the Â£4bn that would normally have been spent on food and drink outside the home over the Christmas season, it said. ""While celebrations may have been more low key, there were also signs of consumers keeping merry and indulging after a tough year"", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Cheese sales, for example, increased by 17% and chilled desserts by 15%. Meanwhile, alcohol sales rose by Â£310m, with options to drink in pubs, bars and restaurants limited. The firm also found that online grocery sales accounted for 12.6% of total spend in December, compared with 7.4% in 2019. December is always busy for the supermarkets but this one has been the busiest on record. With all the restrictions and the closure of pubs and restaurants across much of the UK, people have had to eat and drink at home instead. According to Kantar, we spent Â£12bn last month, the highest amount of groceries sales ever. It's been a Christmas like no other but it seems we were determined to enjoy it. Aldi reported exceptional demand for its premium products yesterday. Morrisons says champagne sales were up 64% on last year. All the supermarkets will be toasting bumper festive sales this year and with another national lockdown in place, they're set to enjoy continuing increased demand for another few months. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Morrisons' trading update marked a ""significant milestone"" for the supermarket chain. ""Morrisons is an underdog in some ways, especially when looking at the online business, which is smaller than some rivals. ""The pandemic has given the group a chance to address this, and digital sales have more than tripled so far this quarter. ""The question now is if Morrisons can keep a firm grasp on that momentum, and push growth long and hard enough to give its competitors something to worry about,"" she added. Separately, clothing and homeware retailer Next reported a big uplift in online sales over the festive period. Online sales saw a jump of 36% in the nine weeks to 26 December compared with the same period last year, off-setting the 43% fall seen in stores. As a result, sales were 1.1% lower overall. The retailer said shoppers had shunned party outfits and work clothes in favour of loungewear. Next boss Simon Wolfson said that profits from better-than-expected sales in November and December would, however, be wiped out by fresh lockdown restrictions in England that would force 90% of its stores to close. It also has to account for additional costs stemming from disruption to its traditional Boxing Day sale and clearing stock leftover in its shops. Despite lockdown restrictions, Next is ""likely to flourish as we emerge from this pandemic"", said Julie Palmer, a partner at the financial consultant Begbies Traynor. She added that the recent administrations of the Arcadia Group and Debenhams might drive more shoppers to the retailer, as they turn to other familiar British brands. ""However, with no assurances of how long social distancing measures will be implemented and consumers now shopping for a purpose, not a pastime, the business must continue to manage costs and innovate if it is to take full advantage of these opportunities.""

Stay-at-home order set to be given legal force,"Northern Ireland's lockdown is set to have further restrictions attached An order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home - to stop the spread of Covid-19 - will become legally enforceable from Friday. The executive agreed the move after it met on Tuesday and tightened other measures. It will mean people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise and work that cannot be done from home. NI is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. As it happened:Executive agrees new lockdown rules Ministers also agreed to a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to reintroduce enforcement powers for the PSNI to order people to go home if they are engaging in prohibited activity. Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Arlene Foster said people should not wait for the regulations to take effect and insisted people should already be staying at home. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland faced a ""difficult period ahead"", but that the interventions were necessary. However, she said the executive had not reached agreement on whether GCSE or A-level exams should go ahead, and that further meetings would need to take place later this week. ""We will also have an urgent meeting convened tomorrow with faith groups, hopefully moving them all to online services,"" she added. Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be reduced from 15 people to six and only from two households, which will include children under 12 - exemptions will apply such as support bubbles. People will no longer be allowed to meet with other households in private gardens, although similar exemptions will apply there too. However, people will be allowed to take exercise outdoors with one person from another household. The executive also supported a proposal from the health minister to make it a requirement for all employers to conduct a risk assessment where employees are required to work away from their home. Ministers agreed the measures will last until 6 February, and be reviewed along with other lockdown measures on 21 January. Many pupils willnot return to school until after the half-term breakin mid-February, with nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until then. However, ministers agreed that special schools will remain open as usual. Vulnerable children and children of key workers will have access to schools for supervised learning. Childcare settings will be allowed to remain open and childminders can continue their services. Payments to parents of children who receive free school meals will also continue, the Department of Education has confirmed. Discussions on exams took place, but ministers agreed to revisit this issue. Education Minister Peter Weir said: ""Work is ongoing on this issue as a matter of urgency and I intend to provide further clarity in the next couple of days. ""Until and unless any announcement is made, students should expect to continue to sit scheduled examinations."" On Tuesday evening, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said ""further flexibilities"" would be put in place for January exams and assessments, particularly in relation to BTecs. She said: ""Learning centres, including further education colleges, schools and training providers, will be afforded additional discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for learners to sit the scheduled BTec exams in January, taking into consideration a range of factors including health and safety and the personal circumstances of their learners."" It has also been confirmed thatpost-primary school transfer tests have been cancelledthis month due to the surge in the number of coronavirus cases. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, was due to take place on Saturday. But the Association for Quality Education (AQE) later announced that a single transfer test would be held on Saturday 27 February. The guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable - and had to shield during the first lockdown in March - is not expected to change. Ministers are due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday. England and Scotland begin new lockdowns How quickly can we jab our way out of lockdown? On Tuesday, a further 18 coronavirus-related deaths - 11 in the past 24 hours and seven in the past week - were recorded by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 1,384. The department recorded a further 1,378 cases of the virus, with 577 confirmed patients in hospital, 45 of whom are in intensive care. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the previous week. A vaccination programme started in Northern Ireland in December Northern Ireland's director of the Royal College of Surgeons warned the health service could soon struggle to deal with the number of people needing treatment. ""That's not just the Covid patients - it's the patients who have a heart attack, a stroke, the people who fall and break their hip,"" said Dr Mark Taylor. ""But the difficulty is the more the system is pulled to deal with Covid, the less ability we have to deal with other aspects. ""The more Covid overwhelms the intensive care units then we're into really difficult ethical decisions... which no doctor wants to make in terms of who requires that ventilator.""

Supermarket websites feel the strain of lockdown,"Supermarkets' online shopping operations have come under strain with customers rushing to book deliveries as the new coronavirus lockdown began. Within a couple of hours of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Monday, shoppers reported problems with Sainsbury's and Tesco. Sainsbury's said on Tuesday that earlier it had restricted access to its online services to manage high demand. The surge in demand echoes consumers' reaction at the start of the pandemic. Sainsbury's said: ""We temporarily limited access to our groceries online service last night so that we could manage high demand for slots and updates customers were making to existing orders. ""We're continuing to monitor the situation and are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused."" A spokeswoman said customers should now be able to use the Sainsbury's app and website ""as usual"". Lockdown: 'The road to recovery just got longer' New lockdowns begin ahead of 'hardest weeks' After the first lockdown in March, supermarkets reported panic buying and a rush to book online delivery slots despite grocers insisting there would be no shortages if consumers shopped sensibly. Shoppers used social media to vent their frustration on Monday, with Twitter user Auld Bryan saying: ""Ocado have already introduced their virtual queue process on their app. It's March 2020 all over again."" Another tweet, by Karl Dyson, said of Ocado: ""You'd think ~10 months in to this, they'd have worked on scalable infrastructure for the website?"" There were also reports of people having problems with the Tesco app and website, including when trying to check out and complete payment. However, a spokesman for Britain's biggest supermarket said on Monday evening that there had been no reports from Tesco's technical department of any website problems. The supermarket had increased the number of slots available for online delivery before the latest lockdown measures. An email from Tesco UK boss Jason Tarry already sent to customers said: ""Since March, we have more than doubled home delivery and Click+Collect slots to 1.5 million a week, with over 760,000 vulnerable customers registered with us who are eligible for priority slots."" Users complained that the Sainsbury's app was down following the prime minister's announcement on Monday. Twitter user Francesca Balgobind wrote: ""What's happening with the Sainsbury's shopping app tonight? Website is down too?"" Another social media user, Matt, said some 40 minutes after Mr Johnson had finished speaking: ""Sainsbury's app and website down"". Asda saw more demand for online shopping after the lockdown announcement, but said it had increased the number of slots available since the first two national lockdowns. Morrisons also reported a jump in the number of shoppers using its website after the announcement. However, despite the longer waiting queues, the grocer said it continued to have ""good slot availability"" for home deliveries. Throughout the pandemic, supermarkets have urged people to shop normally. Before Christmas, in the run-up to the end of the Brexit transition period, some grocers reported temporary shortages of fresh goods due to congestion at UK shipping ports.

"Schools closed ""with heaviest of hearts"" says Gove","Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the replacement for exams needed to be ""as fair as possible"" The government closed schools in England with ""the heaviest of hearts"", Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said, as he confirmed this year's GCSE and A-level exams have been cancelled. The decision was made after the UK's chief medical officers recommended a move to Covid threat level five. Mr Gove said teacher-led assessments would have to be used and efforts would be made to ensure grades are fair. However, there are growing calls for vocational exams to be cancelled. Many BTecs and technical exams are due to take place in the coming days, but head teachers and college leaders say it would be impossible to hold them and unfair to candidates. The mayors of Greater Manchester and Liverpool City Region also called for the exams to be binned. In a statement, they said: ""It is unfair to ask these students to go into colleges when everyone else is being told to stay at home and schools and colleges are closed to the majority of students. ""This will cause unnecessary anxiety and concern just when they need to be able to focus. ""Secondly, students in the Liverpool and Greater Manchester City Regions have faced restrictions for far longer, with more time being spent out of college, than students in other parts of the country, therefore these exams will not be a level playing field."" All primary and secondary schools are closed to pupils, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, for the next six weeks. Teaching will continue remotely. But nurseries and early years settings are being told to remain open. Providers says they are concerned about the risk to staff and the wider community. One head teacher, Neil Strowger from Bohunt School in Hampshire, said he was ""bitterly disappointed and quite upset"" for students who have suffered so much disruption this year and ""fearful"" about what it would mean for them. 'Why haven't our BTec exams been cancelled too?' Firms asked to rethink home-schooling data fees Schools to close and exams facing axe in England England and Scotland begin new lockdowns Another head teacher Evelyn Ford, of Copthall School in north London, said school leaders had been working hard over Christmas and this week to roll out mass testing and now had to shift their focus to provide lessons remotely for the next six weeks. And, despite the government saying vocational exams such as BTec should go ahead, with some scheduled for this week, the Association of School and College Leaders said that seemed ""pretty impossible"". This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""With a heavy heart but with clear evidence we had to act."" On Sunday Boris Johnson said he had ""no doubt"" that schools were safe, but on Monday he said pupils were transmitting the virus into homes and the community. Father-of-four, Glen, told the BBC he was angry at having to now juggle home schooling with working from home. He said: ""This wasn't something unforeseen. This wasn't something that came along and hit us out of the blue."" Another mother, Camille Barbagallo, said parents ""should not have to be in this position"". ""We've been hearing of 50,000 cases plus a day, day in day out,"" she added. Another father, Emeka, was resigned to the situation, saying: ""It's a sacrifice we have to make. We take it on the chin for the country."" Former head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, he did not think the education department ""was being led well at the moment"". ""If you talk to head teachersâ¦they lack confidence in the leadership they're receiving,"" he said, adding that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson should ""take final accountability for what's gone on"". Mr Gove said the Department for Education was working with exams regulator Ofqual, to find a way to assess students that is fair, Education secretary Gavin Williamson is expected to make a statement on exams in Wednesday, but it is understood that work is ongoing to plan for what will replace them. Summer exams were cancelled weeks ago on Scotland and Wales, with a range of methods of internal school assessment to be used instead to judge pupils' progress. Some exams are due to go ahead in Northern Ireland. By Hannah Richardson, BBC News education reporter It was the step the government said it would never take - closing schools again in England to all but a small number of children. Again and again we were told education was the priority and schools would remain fully open. The Department for Education stood firm against a crescendo of calls for a circuit-breaker during the October half-term, then against an early holiday in December. Self-isolating teachers were going to extraordinary lengths to teach remotely from home, while heads created one-way systems, sanitiser stations and installed temperature scanners in school receptions. But the attendance figures were showing week after week how the virus was impacting on pupils' ability to show up. For a while, mass testing of pupils seemed to be the answer, but the short time available for head teachers to set this up made it a non-starter. In the end it was the pressure on the NHS, caused by the new, more contagious variant of coronavirus, which sounded the closing bell for schools. To shut them was the only lever government had left to pull to try to turn the tanker as a new tide of Covid cases began sweeping the nation. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said it would be unfair to run the vocational exams. And the Association of Colleges, which represents further education colleges where many exams are due to be taken, has written to the government calling for vocational and technical exams to be cancelled ""without delay"". It also argued there may be difficulties in finding invigilators to actually run the exams. And nursery providers are questioning how it can be safe to open early years settings, but not schools. Neil Leitch, chief executive of Early Years Alliance, said: ""Many of those working in the early years feel terrified and abandoned by the government. They are being asked to remain on the frontline during the most worrying period of a global pandemic with no PPE, no testing and no access to vaccinations."" SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said that remote learning and time out of school had a ""very negative impact"" for children, and called on the government to ensure consistency in remote learning and access to technology. She said: ""A lot of pupils still don't have laptops. They are surviving on broken phones - those children now need to be seen as a priority to get into the classroom and deemed to be a vulnerable child."" It is understood Ofsted inspectors may be asked to monitor how well schools are providing remote learning. Technology companies and broadband providers needed to ""step up""and address the cost of data for remote learning, which was another obstacle for some families, Ms Longfield said.

Supermarket websites feel the strain of lockdownDemand surges as shoppers rush to secure online delivery slots following news of another lockdown.Business,"Supermarkets' online shopping operations have come under strain with customers rushing to book deliveries as the new coronavirus lockdown began. Within a couple of hours of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech to the nation on Monday, shoppers reported problems with Sainsbury's and Tesco. Sainsbury's said on Tuesday that earlier it had restricted access to its online services to manage high demand. The surge in demand echoes consumers' reaction at the start of the pandemic. Sainsbury's said: ""We temporarily limited access to our groceries online service last night so that we could manage high demand for slots and updates customers were making to existing orders. ""We're continuing to monitor the situation and are sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused."" A spokeswoman said customers should now be able to use the Sainsbury's app and website ""as usual"". Lockdown: 'The road to recovery just got longer' New lockdowns begin ahead of 'hardest weeks' After the first lockdown in March, supermarkets reported panic buying and a rush to book online delivery slots despite grocers insisting there would be no shortages if consumers shopped sensibly. Shoppers used social media to vent their frustration on Monday, with Twitter user Auld Bryan saying: ""Ocado have already introduced their virtual queue process on their app. It's March 2020 all over again."" Another tweet, by Karl Dyson, said of Ocado: ""You'd think ~10 months in to this, they'd have worked on scalable infrastructure for the website?"" There were also reports of people having problems with the Tesco app and website, including when trying to check out and complete payment. However, a spokesman for Britain's biggest supermarket said on Monday evening that there had been no reports from Tesco's technical department of any website problems. The supermarket had increased the number of slots available for online delivery before the latest lockdown measures. An email from Tesco UK boss Jason Tarry already sent to customers said: ""Since March, we have more than doubled home delivery and Click+Collect slots to 1.5 million a week, with over 760,000 vulnerable customers registered with us who are eligible for priority slots."" Users complained that the Sainsbury's app was down following the prime minister's announcement on Monday. Twitter user Francesca Balgobind wrote: ""What's happening with the Sainsbury's shopping app tonight? Website is down too?"" Another social media user, Matt, said some 40 minutes after Mr Johnson had finished speaking: ""Sainsbury's app and website down"". Asda saw more demand for online shopping after the lockdown announcement, but said it had increased the number of slots available since the first two national lockdowns. Morrisons also reported a jump in the number of shoppers using its website after the announcement. However, despite the longer waiting queues, the grocer said it continued to have ""good slot availability"" for home deliveries. Throughout the pandemic, supermarkets have urged people to shop normally. Before Christmas, in the run-up to the end of the Brexit transition period, some grocers reported temporary shortages of fresh goods due to congestion at UK shipping ports.

Proud Boys leader arrested for burning BLM flagEnrique Tarrio was detained as he entered the city ahead of a pro-Trump protest this week.US & Canada,"Enrique Tarrio says his far-right group will turn out in numbers on Wednesday The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group has been released after his arrest on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter flag last month. Enrique Tarrio faces destruction of property charges. On Tuesday, a judge ordered him to stay out of Washington. He has reportedly admitted torching a banner taken from a black church during a rally in December in the city. President Donald Trump has been urging supporters to gather in the capital this week for another demonstration. On Tuesday, a judge released him on his own recognisance pending his trial. On Wednesday, members of Congress are due to certify Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's election victory before he takes office on 20 January. Mr Tarrio has said on the social media app Parler that the Proud Boys will ""turn out in record numbers on Jan 6th"", referring to his members as ""the most notorious group of extraordinary gentlemen"". Who are Proud Boys and antifa? The National Guard has been deployed by Washington DC's mayor to assist local authorities. Officials say the troops will not be armed and will be there to assist with crowd management and traffic control. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, Dustin Sternbeck,told the Washington Post,externalon Monday that Mr Tarrio had been stopped in a vehicle shortly after it entered the district. The 36-year-old was also found during his arrest to be in unlawful possession of two devices that allow guns to hold additional bullets, a source told CBS News. The destruction of property charge relates to a protest in Washington DC on 12 December in support of the outgoing Republican president's unsubstantiated claims of systemic election fraud. Trump 'just plain wrong' on Georgia claim Pro-Trump rallies see scuffles in US cities The mostly peaceful demonstration ended in isolated scuffles as confrontations with counter-protesters broke out. Police said more than three dozen people were arrested and four churches were vandalised. Mr Tarrio - who lives in Miami, where he also reportedly runs a grassroots organisation called Latinos for Trump - told the Washington Post at the time that he had burned the Black Lives Matter flag. This video can not be played âI organised some of Londonâs biggest BLM protestsâ ""Let's make this simple,"" he said. ""I did it."" But he maintained he did not know the Asbury United Methodist Church, where the flag had reportedly flown, was predominantly attended by African American worshippers. Mr Tarrio also said Proud Boy members have had their flags and hats stolen in past demonstrations without anyone being arrested for those alleged incidents. Earlier on Monday, another black church that was vandalised during December's protest sued Mr Tarrio and the Proud Boys. Counter-demonstrators were mostly kept at a distance from Trump supporter last month by Washington DC police The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church accused the group of climbing over a fence and tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign. Kristen Clarke, head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement: ""Black churches and other religious institutions have a long and ugly history of being targeted by white supremacists in racist and violent attacks meant to intimidate and create fear. ""Our lawsuit aims to hold those who engage in such action accountable."" The city's police department said last month it had been considering a potential hate crime charge over the incident.

Fisherman dies after clash with conservationists,"Sea Shepherd is working to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise A Mexican fisherman has died after his boat collided with a larger vessel used by US conservationist group Sea Shepherd, reports say. Sea Shepherd said the clash happened after fishing boats attacked one of its vessels in the Gulf of California, where it is working to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise. It said its vessel was trying to leave when one of the boats smashed into it. The man's family allege that his boat was intentionally rammed. Health official Alonso Perez told AFP news agency on Monday that one fisherman died after sustaining serious injuries, while a second remained in a stable condition. Sea Shepherd said its Farley Mowat vessel was removing an illegal net from a protected area on 31 December when a group of people on small fishing boats launched a ""violent attack"", including throwing Molotov cocktails. ""Following routine anti-piracy procedures, the Farley Mowat undertook defensive manoeuvring to avoid the attacks. As the vessel attempted to leave the scene, one of the [boats] aggressively swerved in front of the Farley Mowat, crashing directly into the hull"" and splitting in two, it said. The group said it provided emergency first aid to the two men who had been on board the fishing boat. Conservationists working for Sea Shepherd have been attacked several times while patrolling the vaquita refuge. The group works with Mexican authorities to remove illegal gillnets used to catch totoaba fish, which are highly valued in Chinese traditional medicine. The nets are designed to trap the heads of fish but not their bodies, but are blamed for trapping and killing the endangered porpoises as well.

'Grave consequences' in closing Wales' schools,"It is back to classes at home for pupils in Wales for at least two weeks Closing schools will have ""grave consequences for children"", Wales' education minister has said. All schools and colleges in Wales have been told to move to online learning until 18 Januaryat the earliest. Kirsty Williams said the decision was ""really difficult,"" but education ""has a role in supressing the virus"". Some school leaders and opposition politicians have questioned whether a two-week classroom closure would be sufficient. Schools in Englandwill move to online teaching until February. Ms Williams told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""I'm a mother too and I'm dreading the prospect of home-schooling. The vast majority of children want to be in school as home-learning is not as good as being in front of teachers. ""But we have to understand the seriousness of the situation we face and have the confidence of staff that when they are in school, they are safe."" She said there was no evidence the new variant was more transmissible in children than adults. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Police 'must be vaccinated' to uphold Covid law Schools will only stay closed after 18 January ""if that's the only thing we can do to suppress the virus"", she added. ""Clearly any decision to close schools for face-to-face contact for the majority of children is a really really difficult decision and it's a decision which has grave consequences for children. ""Education has a role to play in helping suppress the virus and helping our NHS to cope and helping those doctors and nurses and healthcare professionals who are on the front line and struggling so hard to look after us all."" Some schools had been due to open on Wednesdayand others by 11 January withdecisions made by local authorities- nurseries and other childcare settings remain open. Teaching unions had called for a delayed start to termamid concerns about thecoronavirus variant. Plaid Cymru called for urgent help for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Education Minister Kirsty Williams made a video announcement on classrooms remaining closed Jane Jenkins, head teacher at Moorland Primary School in Splott, Cardiff, said: ""We started planning for this before Christmas. It's not really any surprise. ""We learnt a lot of lessons in the first lockdown about the difficulties some children and families had with online learning, so we've been able to tailor our support much better this time around."" Mother-of-two Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, said parents were suffering from ""exhaustion"", but it was the right decision to close schools. ""In terms of how it's going to impact on families, I just think we're all tearing our hair out. ""Trying to get our kids to actually engage with online learning is a massive task... my kids just don't want to do it, I'm the last person they want to listen to."" This video can not be played Parents and teachers say they want to know when schools will reopen in Wales Chanelle Taylor, a painter and decorator from Caerphilly, said she was worried about balancing schooling with running her business. She said: ""The most worrying concern I have is that with my daughter goes to a Welsh school and we're not Welsh speakers. ""It's made a big impact at home trying to home-school her as well as me trying to find childcare to keep my business afloat. ""At the moment I'm managing with my mum doing childcare, but it's difficult for my mum because my brother has Asperger's so she also cares for him. At the moment I'm limiting my quotations and working as much as I can without bringing more stress home for my mother."" Sara Powell-Davies, who is also from Caerphilly, said she had struggled to get childcare for her four-year-old daughter and other parents she had spoken to had been frustrated by the timing of the announcement. She said: ""You can't do things like this last minute, it's not fair on parents and it's not fair on teachers and schools. ""We've been scrambling around now trying to sort out childcare."" Sara Powell-Davies said she was ""disappointed"" with the timing of the school closure announcement Stephen Reicher, a professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of the Independent Sage advisory group, said the focus needed to shift away from keeping schools open to keeping them safe. ""A lot of the talk has been about whether schools should be open or closed. Everyone wants schools to be open. We should also be thinking about the best way of making schools safe so we can reopen them as soon as possible,"" he said. He suggested reducing class sizes, hiring more teachers and more spaces and dividing classes. Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said support needed to be made urgently available to children from disadvantaged backgrounds who ""will now fall further behind with their education"". She added: ""Hubs for vulnerable children and the children of key workers are also a necessity alongside an immunisation programme for all school staff so that schools can become a safer environment upon re-opening."" Learning will be done online until at least 18 January Schools and colleges would remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments Universities in Wales have already agreed a staggered start to term All childcare settings can remain open NAHT Cymru, which represents head teachers, welcomed the announcement, saying it had been ""inevitable for some time"". Director Laura Doel added: ""It is uncertain whether the next two weeks will be enough time to ensure a fully risk-assessed plan is put in place."" The Association of Schools and College Leaders Cymru questioned why it had taken so long for the minister to reach a decision. But Ms Williams said: ""We need to reassess the evidence, which comes through on a daily basis, which makes decision-making really hard. Sometimes, when the data arrives, you simply have to act"". How many have died with Covid in Wales? 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins The decision in Wales came as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increasedthe Covid threat level to five - its highest level. Level five warns of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"", according to theUK government's website,external.

"Bond girl Tanya Roberts still alive, agent saysHer agent says earlier reports of the actress' death were wrong, but she is in a serious condition.Entertainment & Arts","Roberts played geologist Stacey Sutton in A View To A Kill Former Bond actress and Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts has died in hospital in Los Angeles at the age of 65. Roberts appeared with Sir Roger Moore in his final Bond film, 1985's A View To A Kill, and had a recurring role in That '70s Show. She also starred in the final series of Charlie's Angels on TV in 1980. Her death was prematurely announced on Monday, only for doctors to say she was still alive. However, her death was then confirmed on Tuesday. Roberts had collapsed while walking her dogs on 24 December and was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre. Her partner Lance O'Brien mistakenly thought she had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital. After getting a call from doctors to say she was deteriorating quickly, he went to her bedside, her eyes closed and she ""faded"",TMZ reported,external. Devastated, he walked out of the room and then the hospital without speaking to medical staff before informing Roberts' agent that he had ""just said goodbye to Tanya"". But while being interviewed for US TV show Inside Edition on Monday, Mr O'Brien got a call from the hospital to say she was alive. The moment was captured on film,external, as he picked up his phone and said: ""Now you're telling me she's alive? Thank the Lord."" However, she died on Monday night. She appeared in A View To A Kill alongside Sir Roger Moore and singer Grace Jones Born Victoria Leigh Blum in 1955, Roberts grew up in New York before moving to Hollywood in 1977. Her big break came when she replaced Shelly Hack in Charlie's Angels, joining Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd as third 'Angel' Julie. After the show's cancellation, she appeared in such fantasy adventure films as The Beastmaster and Hearts and Armour. She also played comic book heroine Sheena in a 1984 film that saw her nominated for a Golden Raspberry award for worst actress. Roberts received another Razzie nomination for her role as geologist Stacey Sutton in 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill. Roberts in the title role in Sheena: Queen of the Jungle She admitted being ""a little cautious"" about taking the role, but said it would have been ""ridiculous"" to have turned it down. Roberts' subsequent films included Night Eyes and Inner Sanctum, erotic thrillers that did little to advance her career. She went on to play Midge Pinciotti in more than 80 episodes of That '70s Show between 1998 and 2004. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Singapore backtracks on Covid data privacy promiseReversing earlier assurances, officials say tracing data can be used beyond Covid for criminal investigations.Asia","Singapore's Covid app is widely used across the country Singapore has admitted data from its Covid contact tracing programme can also be accessed by police, reversing earlier privacy assurances.

Proud Boys leader arrested for burning BLM flag,"Enrique Tarrio says his far-right group will turn out in numbers on Wednesday The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group has been released after his arrest on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter flag last month. Enrique Tarrio faces destruction of property charges. On Tuesday, a judge ordered him to stay out of Washington. He has reportedly admitted torching a banner taken from a black church during a rally in December in the city. President Donald Trump has been urging supporters to gather in the capital this week for another demonstration. On Tuesday, a judge released him on his own recognisance pending his trial. On Wednesday, members of Congress are due to certify Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's election victory before he takes office on 20 January. Mr Tarrio has said on the social media app Parler that the Proud Boys will ""turn out in record numbers on Jan 6th"", referring to his members as ""the most notorious group of extraordinary gentlemen"". Who are Proud Boys and antifa? The National Guard has been deployed by Washington DC's mayor to assist local authorities. Officials say the troops will not be armed and will be there to assist with crowd management and traffic control. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, Dustin Sternbeck,told the Washington Post,externalon Monday that Mr Tarrio had been stopped in a vehicle shortly after it entered the district. The 36-year-old was also found during his arrest to be in unlawful possession of two devices that allow guns to hold additional bullets, a source told CBS News. The destruction of property charge relates to a protest in Washington DC on 12 December in support of the outgoing Republican president's unsubstantiated claims of systemic election fraud. Trump 'just plain wrong' on Georgia claim Pro-Trump rallies see scuffles in US cities The mostly peaceful demonstration ended in isolated scuffles as confrontations with counter-protesters broke out. Police said more than three dozen people were arrested and four churches were vandalised. Mr Tarrio - who lives in Miami, where he also reportedly runs a grassroots organisation called Latinos for Trump - told the Washington Post at the time that he had burned the Black Lives Matter flag. This video can not be played âI organised some of Londonâs biggest BLM protestsâ ""Let's make this simple,"" he said. ""I did it."" But he maintained he did not know the Asbury United Methodist Church, where the flag had reportedly flown, was predominantly attended by African American worshippers. Mr Tarrio also said Proud Boy members have had their flags and hats stolen in past demonstrations without anyone being arrested for those alleged incidents. Earlier on Monday, another black church that was vandalised during December's protest sued Mr Tarrio and the Proud Boys. Counter-demonstrators were mostly kept at a distance from Trump supporter last month by Washington DC police The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church accused the group of climbing over a fence and tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign. Kristen Clarke, head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement: ""Black churches and other religious institutions have a long and ugly history of being targeted by white supremacists in racist and violent attacks meant to intimidate and create fear. ""Our lawsuit aims to hold those who engage in such action accountable."" The city's police department said last month it had been considering a potential hate crime charge over the incident.

Nigeria has introduced restrictions to try and contain the virus Police in Nigeriaâs Lagos state have raided several nightclubs, arresting 71 people for allegedly violating Covid-19 protocols. The police say the raids happened in the Lekki and Surulere areas of Lagos city and the suspects will be prosecuted for allegedly violating guidelines put in place in an attempt to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Lagos state police spokesperson Olumuyiwa Adejobi told the BBC that the club-goers had allegedly violated a ban on large gatherings and the reopening of clubs and had broken a midnight to 04:00 curfew in the state. The authorities say they will intensify such raids to ensure ââtotal complianceââ with Covid-19 protocols. The arrests come as Nigeria continues to record a surge in coronavirus infections amid fears of a second wave of the pandemic. On Monday, Nigeriaâs Centre for Disease Control announced 1,204 new infections - the countryâs highest confirmed daily cases so far. Nigeria has recorded 91,351 cases, with 75,699 recoveries and 1,318 deaths from the virus. Lagos state is the countryâs epicentre of the disease. This video can not be played Labour leader Keir Starmer backs England lockdown Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases. As part of a televised speech on BBC One, he called on the government to use the lockdown in England to establish ""a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme"" to ""deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery"". He said there were ""serious questions for the government to answer"" over the timing of the lockdown in England, but added that his party would support the restrictions - which MPs are due to vote on this Wednesday. The Labour leader said the UK had reached a ""critical moment in our fight against coronavirus, but added: ""Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together. ""At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives."" Mark SavageMusic reporter, BBC News Some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month, MPs are told. The House of Commons culture select committeeis carrying out an inquiry into the viability of this summer's events,external, after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the 2020 festival season. Tuesday's hearing came a day after Glastonbury festival organiserEmily Eavis assured fans,externalthe 2021 event hasn't been cancelled. The committee has been told the government needs to introduce Covid cancellation insurance for live events and an extension to the current VAT cut on concert tickets. The UK live music industry was worth Â£1.3bn in 2019 - but it has been hit hard by the pandemic, with more than 90% of the gigs planned for 2020 cancelled. Before Tuesday's hearing, music industry trade body UK Music called on MPs to name a ""restart date"" after which gigs can go ahead. The lack of coronavirus insurance is the ""biggest barrier"" to events resuming, it says, pointing out Germany has recently announced a Â£2.3bn event cancellation fund, in line with several other European countries. You can read the full story here. As we heard earlier in today's briefing, Prof Chris Whitty warned of the risks posed by the new coronavirus variant if people do not adhere to newly imposed lockdown rules. Professor Whitty said the element of risk will reduce as people continue to get vaccinated but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". This video can not be played Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent We are used to events moving quickly in this pandemic, but how did we get from Boris Johnson urging parents to send their children back to school, to announcing a strict lockdown for England the next day? This was not the plan. At least not at the start of Monday. In the space of 36 hours, the government went from urging parents of primary pupils in England to send their children back to school - to shutting classrooms for almost all children for at least seven weeks and telling everyone to stay at home. So what changed? Find out from our political correspondent Nick Eardleyhere. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm There are continuing problems for people travelling from the UK to Sweden - Swedish
border police have confirmed to the BBC that 58 people making the journey have been turned away since the New Year, including 28 British
citizens. The release
of the figures follows days of travel confusion for Britons who are resident in
Sweden. They face extra hurdles returning to their Swedish base, due to a new
requirement to provide a negative coronavirus test result from 1 January,
alongside post-Brexit paperwork required to prove their right of residence in
Sweden. On Sunday
it emerged that some British passengers arriving with negative coronavirus
tests had nevertheless been told to return to the UK, while others refused and
spent the night on the floor or on plastic chairs at Gothenburgâs Landvetter
Airport. The UKâs Ambassador to Sweden Judith Gough raised concerns that there
was a need for âgreater clarity and consistencyâ over which types of Covid-19
tests were valid, and dispatched embassy staff to the airport on Monday. The
travellers were allowed to enter Sweden shortly afterwards. Swedish
border police have told the BBC that of the 28 British citizens turned away
since 1 January, 13 were registered residents of Sweden who did not have a
valid negative coronavirus test and five were not registered as living in
Sweden. Police were unable to provide firm information on the reason for the
denial of the other ten travellers. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Germany went into lockdown 'too late' As the UK battles its rise in cases, Germany has announced its lockdown will continue until 31 January. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that new restrictions to reduce contact will be introduced in order to curb rising infections. Nationwide measures, including closing schools and non-essential businesses were introduced in mid-December and were due to continue until 10 January. Germany has recorded more than 1.8 million coronavirus cases and 36,000 deaths since the pandemic began, figures from Johns Hopkins University show. Ambulance workers in Los Angeles County, California, have been told not to transport hospital patients who have extremely low chances of survival. The directive comes as officials say the region could soon hit more than 1,000 Covid-related deaths per day, and hospitals are overrun with patients. Emergency workers have also been told to ration oxygen, which is in short supply due to the pandemic. Hospital beds in LA are running low and officials fear a post-holiday spike. New York City issued a similar directive to ambulance workers last April at the height of the city's Covid outbreak, instructing them not to bring in patients who could not be resuscitated at the scene. The LA County Department of Public Health reported 9,142 new Covid cases on Monday, and an additional 77 deaths. The county, which is the worst hit in the US, has recorded 818,000 coronavirus cases and more than 10,700 deaths since the start of the pandemic. Read morehere. Jonny DymondBBC royal correspondent Buckingham Palace says there will be no garden parties this year - in either London or Edinburgh. The social events are normally staged at Buckingham Palace in London and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, and the decision comes as England enters its third national lockdown and mainland Scotland sees the introduction of similar restrictions. A palace spokesman says: ""The decision has been taken that garden parties will not take place in 2021."" Garden parties were cancelled during 2020 following the first UK lockdown. Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News If you're a reality television fan who follows your favourite stars online, chances are you have seen some of them jetting off to luxury destinations in recent weeks - despite rising infection rates and restrictions across the UK. With much of England first plunged into tier four and now lockdown, many seem to be wondering how all of these glamorous breaks have been able to go ahead at a time when millions are being told to stay at home. From a Love Island star facing charges for alleged Covid breaches in Barbados, to the Celtic football team drawing Scottish government criticism for travelling to Dubai for training - tabloids and social media have been full of scrutiny of these trips in recent days. So, what is going on and what do the rules say? BBC reporter Kelly-Leigh Cooper takes a closer look here. With the announcement of another lockdown and schools moving to remote learning the BBC is launching the biggest education offer in its history. Starting on Monday, each week day CBBC will have a three-hour block of primary school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, as well as other educational programming such as Our School and Celebrity Supply Teacher. Meanwhile, BBC Two will cater for secondary students with programming to support the GCSE curriculum, with a least two hours of content each weekday. The content will also be available on demand on theiPlayer. BBC director general Tim Davie says: ""Education is absolutely vital - the BBC is here to play its part and Iâm delighted that we have been able to bring this to audiences so swiftly. On the UK's High Street, Topshop's store in Oxford Street is set to close its doors after 27 years. The High Street chain's owner Arcadia went into administration in November, putting 13,000 jobs at risk. News of the sale of the three-storey building has prompted an outpouring of emotion on social media, with shoppers recounting how important the flagship store was to them. The store, which boasted a DJ booth, nail bar and food stalls, was a retail sensation when it opened in 1994. The sale of 214 Oxford Street, managed by agents Savills and Eastdil, follows the failure of Sir Philip Green's retail empire to secure funding to pay its debts after sales slumped during the pandemic. You can read the full story and see some of the farewell tributes being paid to the store here. Here's a reminder of the key points from today's briefing, as daily case figures in the UK rise above 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic began: The last question is from Dominic Yeatman from the Metro newspaper, whose reporter asks the PM whether he regrets allowing millions of children to go to school on Monday and delaying the lockdown by 24 hours. The PM says he wanted to keep children in school but the data he received on Monday about infection levels no longer supported it. Mr Johnson is also pressed on the cost to families of home learning amid claims some people are being charged up to Â£100 to access websites via pay-as-you-go mobile phones. The PM says the government will look at the costs involved and he wants to do everything he can to help parents. He then sums up the position the country finds itself in, saying the winter has been made much more difficult by the new variant and it is vital that people stick to the rules to help the country cope as the vaccination programme gathers pace. He closes by repeating the basic message that people must stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives. Prof Chris Whitty is asked whether the lockdown will be enough to reverse the spread of the virus. He says if everyone sticks to the rules ""really strongly"" and the NHS is vaccinating as fast as it can âthen our hope is the lockdown
will be enoughâ. But he says this will require a ""collective effort"", with everyone ""buying into this really seriously"". In the longer term, the chief medical officer says we all hope the vaccination programme will mean we donât need restrictions in the future. But he warns the virus ""is not going to go away"", saying we ""shouldnât kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring"" - although the risks will go down. âHopefully weâll have spring, summer, autumn, possibly winter
as well, with almost nothing in place, once the full vaccination programme is
through. But we just need to be aware of the fact this is not a problem
that just disappears.â Andy Woodcock from the Independent asks about testing for people arriving into the UK from abroad and why it wasn't done sooner. The prime minister says the government will be bringing in measures to ""ensure that we test people coming into this country and preventing the virus from being readmitted"". Responding to a second question on schools and whether teachers and pupils should be vaccinated, Prof Chris Whitty says there is no evidence of hospitals filling up with children and it appears, that even with the new variant, ""children are relatively much less affected than other groups"". He says from a clinical point of view the real priority is to vaccinate the people that we know ""are by far the most likely to die and by far most likely to end up in hospital"". He adds there will have to be decisions made once the most vulnerable groups are vaccinated but we are not yet at that stage. The chief medical officer adds that neither vaccine currently in use in the UK has been licensed for children yet. The prime minister is asked by Jason Groves from the Daily Mail what needs to happen to ensure the government meets its commitment to vaccinate around 13 million people in the next six weeks. Boris Johnson says this will be ""a huge effort"" and will require groups such as the NHS, the armed forces and every aspect of government to work together ""absolutely flat out"". âThe rate-limiting factor at the moment is making sure we
can get enough vaccine where we want it fast enough,"" he says. He adds that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine needs to be properly batch-tested and approved before it can be given to people, which takes time. Sky's Sam Coates asks the PM if he ""can look parents in the eye"" and tell them their children will be back in classrooms by the summer. Johnson says he shares the ""optimism and fundamental hope"" expressed by Chris Whitty earlier. He says a ""huge amount"" can be done to immunise the vulnerable and therefore speed-up school openings and other ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"". ""Things will be very different by spring and that is what I would say to every parent in the land."" On a separate question about the new variant, Chris Whitty says the threat at the moment is ""extraordinarily high"" if people do not adhere to the lockdown rules. He says vaccinations will reduce the risk going forward but only ""by degrees"" and the restrictions will not disappear in a ""single bound"". Some curbs may be needed next winter,  he adds, citing the number of people who die each year from flu. It will be up to the government to decide what level of risk is tolerable going forward, he adds, suggesting that will ultimately be a political rather than a societal decision. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Schools to close and exams facing axe in EnglandLockdown measures will see schools closed until half term, and GCSEs and A-levels unable to go ahead as normal.","Most pupils will be studying from home for the rest of this half term Schools and colleges in England are to be closed to most pupils until at least half term, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister said the new lockdown had to be ""tough enough"" to stop the variant virus from spreading - and teaching will go online. A-Levels and GCSEs will be cancelled, a government source confirmed to BBC News - although vocational exams will go ahead. The National Education Union accused the government of causing ""chaos"". In a television address, Mr Johnson announced the biggest changes to schools since the early days of the first lockdown in March. ""Because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow,"" said the prime minister. This means a return to online learning for pupils of all ages - apart from vulnerable children and the children of key workers who can continue to go into school. Primary schools went back today - and will then close again tomorrow ""We recognise that this will mean it's not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer, as normal,"" said Mr Johnson. It is understood that vocational exams will continue, but GCSEs and A-levels will be cancelled -  and that the exam watchdog Ofqual will make ""alternative arrangements"" for delivering results. New lockdown rules for England Thousands of primary pupils return to closed schools Scotland switches to remote learning Delay to schools opening in Wales An attempt to produce replacement exam grades last summer turned into one of the biggest U-turns of the pandemic. Teachers' unions accused the government of failing to react more swiftly to ""mounting evidence"" about Covid transmission in schools and to make preparations for remote teaching and alternatives to written exams. But Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had ""become an expert in putting his head in the sand"". Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union criticised ministers for having issued legal threats to keep schools open at the end of last term - and then ""made a series of chaotic announcements about the start of this term"". The new term, which began on Monday for primary pupils, has only lasted a day before it has been suspended. The prime minister said he hoped that schools would be ""reopening schools after the February half term"". There have been assurances that there will be a more thorough approach to home learning than in the first lockdown last year. The Department for Education has provided hundreds of thousands of computer devices - with the aim of supporting those without the equipment needed to work online from home. There have also been suggestions Ofsted inspectors will play a more active role in checking on what support schools are providing to pupils in their online learning. Universities in England had already planned a staggered return for this term - but there will now be even fewer students on campus this month. The latest lockdown guidance says university students who are taking hands-on courses such as medicine or veterinary science should return for face-to-face lessons as planned. These students will be expected to take two Covid tests or self-isolate for 10 days when they return. But students on all other courses are being told not to come back to university if possible and to start their term online ""until at least mid-February"".

Biden and Trump rally Georgia voters on eve of poll,"This video can not be played Trump: ""If [Pence] doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much"" In duelling rallies, President Donald Trump and President-elect Joe Biden have urged voters in Georgia to turn out for elections on Tuesday that will decide which party controls the Senate. Mr Trump, a Republican, and Mr Biden, a Democrat, said the votes for two Senate seats would shape the US for years. More than three million Georgians have already cast ballots - nearly 40% of the state's registered voters. If the Democrats win, they will control all of Congress and the White House. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? The Republican Senate incumbents in Georgia - Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue - are trying to hold off the Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock. The runoff is needed under Georgia's state election rules because none of the Senate candidates received more than 50% of the vote in November's US election. Voting begins at 07:00 (12:00 GMT) and ends about 12 hours later. The vote will decide the balance of power in the US Senate. Republicans are currently in control, holding 52 of the 100 seats. If both Democrats win on Tuesday, the Senate will be evenly split, allowing incoming Democratic vice-president Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead This would be crucial for pushing through Mr Biden's progressive agenda, including key issues such as health care and environmental regulations - issues with strong Republican opposition. The Senate also has the power to approve or reject Mr Biden's nominees for cabinet and judicial posts. If Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock both win, it will bring the White House, Senate and the House of Representatives under Democratic control for the first time since President Barack Obama's election in 2008. At a drive-in rally in Atlanta on Monday, Mr Biden told voters: ""Georgia, the whole nation is looking to you. The power is literally in your hands."" Flanked by Mr Ossoff and Mr Warnock, he said: ""Unlike any time in my career, one state - one state - can chart the course, not just for the four years but for the next generation."" Mr Biden campaigned in Georgia, saying ""the power is literally in your hands"" Mr Biden also took aim at Mr Trump, accusing him of ""whining and complaining"" about November's presidential election result rather than concentrating on the Covid-19 pandemic. ""I don't know why he still wants the job, he doesn't want to do the work,"" he said. On Monday evening at a rally in Dalton, President Trump told voters that the Georgia runoff was the ""last line of defence"" against the Democrats. In what may have been the last rally of his presidency, he told the state's voters ""the whole world is watching"" and that this was ""your last chance to save the America that we love"". The president repeated unproven allegations that he was only declared the loser in Georgia after November's White House election because of fraud. Republican officials are worried this could depress turnout among the party faithful in Tuesday's vote. Mr Trump played this down, telling voters to ""swarm it tomorrow"". This video can not be played Georgia official Gabriel Sterling urges voters to cast ballots A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years, but the party will be buoyed by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. The margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the US president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. It's just over two weeks until Joe Biden's inauguration, but the first real test of his presidency will come on Tuesday, when Georgia's two run-off Senate elections will decide which party controls the US Senate as he takes office. If Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. The narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators. It will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice. If the Republicans hold on, then Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff,launched his campaign with an endorsement from Democratic superstar and civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Mr Ossoff spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat David Perduehas served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees Reverend Raphael Warnockis a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. He helped start the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents Kelly Loefflerwas named to the US Senate in December 2019 after the sitting senator resigned. Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The league's players have called for her to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter Mr Trump - who is due to leave office on 20 January - said at his Georgia rally: ""They're not taking this White House. We're going to fight like hell."" He hinted that he wanted Vice-President Mike Pence, in his role as president of the Senate, to reject Mr Biden's win when Congress meets on Wednesday to certify the election results. ""I hope that Mike Pence comes through for us,"" Mr Trump said. ""Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much."" Some Republicans have said they will raise objections to the presidential election result in the House and Senate, requiring a debate and vote. But with other Republicans saying they will not contest Mr Biden's victory, the votes questioning it would not succeed. Trump 'just plain wrong' on Georgia claim Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Over the weekend it was revealed Mr Trump also held a controversial phone call with Georgia's top election official, secretary of state Brad Raffensperger. In a recording of the call, first published by the Washington Post newspaper on Sunday, Mr Trump pressured Mr Raffensperger to ""find"" votes that would reverse his defeat in the state. At his rally, Mr Biden did not make direct reference to the call, but alluded to Mr Trump's persistent challenges to the election results, saying that ""politicians cannot assert, take or seize power"".

Why is the Georgia election so important?All eyes are on Georgia as the traditionally Republican state could hand Joe Biden the US Senate.US Election 2020,"All eyes are on the southern state of Georgia, where the future of the US Senate will be decided this week. Here's all you need to know. There are two races and voting has been going on since mid-December. The outcome will be crucial to how much the incoming Democratic president, Joe Biden, will be able to achieve in his first term. Wait, another US election?  Wasn't all this done in November? OK, rewind. According to the state rules, a winning candidate needs 50% of the votes and in November no-one achieved that. So the top two go through to a 5 January replay - a so-called run-off. Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates for Georgia's seats In both races, we have a Republican incumbent up against a Democratic newcomer. Senator David Perdue, 70, v Jon Ossoff, 33 Mr Perduehas served as a Georgia senator since 2015. The former Reebok CEO was an early supporter of Donald Trump, and has remained an ally to the president. He is now facing scrutiny over multimillion dollar stock trades in companies whose business falls under his purview on Senate committees. He has denied wrongdoing. Mr Ossofflaunched his campaign with an endorsement from civil rights champion John Lewis, who died this summer. Before taking the reins of a documentary film company, Insight TWI, he spent five years working for Congressman Hank Johnson, an Atlanta Democrat. He has employed his filmmaking skills on the trail, launching campaign accounts on both Snapchat and TikTok. Senator Kelly Loeffler, 50, v Reverend Raphael Warnock, 51 Ms Loeffler, the junior Georgia senator, is still a political novice. She was named to the US Senate in December 2019 by Governor Brian Kemp after the sitting senator resigned. One of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Ms Loeffler is co-owner of the women's NBA team the Atlanta Dream. The ownership has caused a stir after the league's players called for Ms Loeffler to sell her stake over her vocal opposition to Black Lives Matter. Rev Warnockis a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr once preached. Along with Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams, he started the New Georgia Project, a voting rights organisation. The group is now under investigation by Georgia's Republican secretary of state for allegedly sending ballot applications to non-residents. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the names for the Republican Party The upper chamber of US Congress, the Senate, has been controlled by the Republican Party since 2014. It's very important in getting laws passed, Cabinet appointments confirmed and Supreme Court Justices on to the bench of the highest court. If Democrats win in Georgia, the extra two seats would give them effective control. Each party would have 50 senators and it's become increasingly rare for senators to vote against their party. US Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris held a recent rally in the state Technically, there are currently 46 Democrats and two independent Senators - Bernie Sanders and Angus King - but they typically vote with Democrats. So in a 50-50 tie, Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris would have the deciding vote in her role as Senate president. If Democrats pick up the two seats and forge a 50-50 tie in the upper chamber, it's far from certain that Biden will be able to enact the kind of sweeping legislation on the environment, healthcare and the economy that he proposed during his successful presidential campaign. The narrowness of the margin will ensure that any laws will have to be supported by centrists like Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Arizona's two senators. It will, however, give the new president a fighting chance at legislative accomplishments - and make it significantly easier for him to appoint the administration officials and federal judges of his choice. If the Republicans hold on, then that would mean two more years of divided government and, probably, legislative gridlock. Democratic hopes will rest on the whims of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of Republican moderates. A huge amount of money has poured in for all four candidates, but record-breaking numbers for the Democrats. The Loeffler-Warnock race has received more media attention, partly because it's been more feisty and vocal. She accuses him of being a ""radical liberal"" who courts Marxism and wants to defund the police. He sticks to a pretty centrist Democratic message of pandemic relief and healthcare. With his MLK Jr links, Rev Warnock is well known among African Americans and the state has a higher proportion of black voters than the average US state. This video can not be played Can Georgia's 17-year-olds change Bidenâs presidency? The state is around 52% non-Latino white and 33% black, according to 2019 census data. Black residents made up nearly half of the 1.9 million increase in Georgia's voting population since 2000, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2019, 2.5 million black voters made up a third of the total Georgia electorate. The Biden-Harris win in the state was the first time in 30 years Georgia went to a Democratic presidential candidate. On election-eve, President Donald Trump held a rally to support the two Republicans, urging them to turn out. Mr Perdue, however, participated virtually after coming into contact with a Covid-positive individual. He and his wife have tested negative, but have remained in quarantine. President-elect Joe Biden campaigned on behalf of the two Democrats on 4 January as well, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris travelling to the state a day earlier. A Democrat has not won in a Senate race in Georgia for decades so it will be an uphill struggle for them. The Republican candidates also won more votes in both races when it was a larger field in November. But Mr Biden narrowly won there in the presidential contest by tapping into an effective get-out-to-vote campaign among African Americans. The woman behind biggest surprise in Biden win Voting began weeks ago and early indications suggest a high turnout, possibly a record for a run-off in the state. Ballot counting will begin at 19:00 local time on Tuesday, once polls close, though there could be a wait for results. Polling shows a very tight contest in both races even with less than a day left, though many are looking at polls with scepticism, as they missed the mark during the presidential election. A number of big pollsters have also opted not to cover the run-off races. This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath?

"Saudi embargo on Qatar 'to be lifted'Kuwait's foreign minister says Saudi Arabia will reopen its borders with Qatar, ending a bitter row.","This video can not be played The Saudi crown prince embraced Qatar's emir at the summit Diplomatic relations have been restored between Qatar and four Arab states that imposed an embargo against it for three years, the Saudi foreign minister says. Prince Faisal bin Farhad told reporters that the countries had agreed to ""fully set our differences aside"" at a Gulf Co-operation Council summit on Tuesday. Earlier, Saudi Arabia's crown prince publicly embraced the emir of Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The tiny, gas- and oil-rich state denied the accusation and rejected the conditions for ending the partial blockade, including closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera broadcast network and curbing relations with Iran. In recent months, Kuwaiti and US mediators stepped up efforts to end the stand-off. How is Qatar coping with its economic embargo? Qatar country profile At Tuesday's summit in the Saudi heritage site of al-Ula, leaders of the six GCC member states signed an agreement that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said affirmed ""our Gulf, Arab and Islamic solidarity and stability"". ""There is a desperate need today to unite our efforts to promote our region and to confront challenges that surround us, especially the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile programme and its plans for sabotage and destruction,"" he added. Later, Prince Faisal told a news conference: ""What happened today is... the turning of the page on all points of difference and a full return of diplomatic relations."" On Monday night, Saudi Arabia agreed to reopen its land and sea borders and airspace to Qatar. The lifting of the embargo on Qatar has taken months of patient, painstaking diplomacy, mostly by Kuwait, but with increasingly urgent prodding from the White House as the Trump presidency draws to a close. The three-and-a-half year ""blockade"" has been immensely costly to both Qatar's economy and to the notion of Gulf unity. Qataris will not forgive or forget in a hurry what they see as a stab in the back by their Gulf Arab neighbours. But beyond the diplomatic rhetoric one country in particular - the UAE - has grave doubts that Qatar is actually going to change its ways. While Qatar denies supporting terrorism it has supported political Islamist movements in Gaza, Libya and elsewhere, notably the transnational Muslim Brotherhood which the UAE views as an existential threat to its monarchy. Meanwhile, the embargo has, if anything, pushed Qatar closer to Saudi Arabia's ideological enemies: Turkey and Iran. Qatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to some other Gulf states, but there are two key issues which have angered its neighbours in the past decade. One is Qatar's support for Islamists. Qatar acknowledges providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. But it denies aiding jihadist groups like al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS). Centred on its capital Doha, Qatar has a population of 2.6 million, but only about 300,000 of these are Qatari nationals The other key issue is Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. The Shia Muslim power is Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed all diplomatic and trade ties. Qatar's only land border was closed; ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports; and much of the region's airspace was closed to Qatari aircraft. The countries presented Qatar with 13 demands as conditions for ending the embargo. They included closing Al Jazeera and other Qatar-funded news outlets, downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, and ending ""interference"" in other countries' internal affairs. This video can not be played Qatar's foreign minister interviewed in 2018 Qatar refused to comply, saying it would not agree to ""surrender"" its sovereignty and that the ""blockade"" by its neighbours violated international law. The emirate quickly established new trade routes with Iran and Turkey to ensure the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million were met, and used its oil and gas wealth to prop up its economy. Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait served as a mediator in the dispute. US President Donald Trump unexpectedly sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies at the start of the dispute, denouncing Qatar as a ""funder of terror"" despite the emirate hosting the largest American military facility in the Middle East, al-Udeid airbase. But Mr Trump's aides subsequently persuaded him to take a more neutral stance, and in 2018 he praised Sheikh Tamim's work on combating terrorist financing at a White House meeting. Kuwaiti mediation efforts appeared to make little progress until late last year, when the Trump administration intensified pressure on all sides for an end to the stand-off that thwarted their efforts to assemble an alliance of Sunni-led states to counter Iran and its proxies. Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar in December, and reportedly flew to al-Ula on Monday to attend the summit. How is Qatar coping with its embargo?

England and Scotland begin new lockdowns,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces the third national lockdown The PM acted ""decisively"" in announcing a new lockdown in England ""in the face of new information"", Rishi Sunak says. People must now stay at home except for a handful of permitted reasons and schools have closed to most pupils. The chancellor said the action was ""regrettable"" but it was ""right we take these measures"", which will be reviewed on 15 February, to suppress the virus. It came after UK chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. Boris Johnson said vaccinating the top four priority groups by mid-February could allow restrictions to be eased, with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove telling Sky News the measures may remain until March. Meanwhile, the prime minister is due to hold a press conference in Downing Street at 17:00 GMT with chief medical officer for England Prof Chris Whitty and the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Tough new lockdown restrictions forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasonshave also come into forceacross the Scottish mainland. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. The UK reported a record 58,784 cases on Monday, as well as a further 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. What the rules where you live? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? 'From tier 2 to lockdown in a week is depressing' What's happening with schools now? Schools closed 'with heaviest of hearts' says Gove Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ""The four chief medical officers of the United Kingdom met and discussed the situation yesterday and their recommendation was that the country had to move to level five, the highest level available of alert that meant there was an imminent danger to the NHS of being overwhelmed unless action was taken. ""And so in the circumstances we felt that the only thing we could do was to close those primary schools that were open."" This video can not be played Gove:"" With a heavy heart but with clear evidence we had to act."" He said the action was taken ""with the heaviest of hearts"" and ""we had to act"" following that advice. ""It is a very, very difficult time for the whole country, that's why it's so important we do everything we can in government to vaccinate people,"" he said. He said a million people had been vaccinated so far ""up until the weekend"" and it was hoped that number would reach more than 13 million in February. When asked about the target of two million vaccines a week and concerns over logistics and the safety systems, Mr Gove said the vaccination process was a ""complicated exercise"" but the NHS ""has more than risen to the challenge"". The government was ""looking at further options"" to restrict international travel, he said. Mr Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, adding: ""I think it is right to say that as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all."" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove saying the lockdown may have to last to March may not come as much of a surprise to many. While the government has set a target of offering the most at-risk a jab by mid February, it will take several weeks longer for the full effect to be felt given it takes time for an immune response to kick in. The bigger question is whether or not the government could have acted earlier. It was clear before Christmas the new variant was pushing up infection rates - and that in turn would mean more hospital admissions. The delay looks costly. Since Christmas Day, the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital has risen by 50% alone - enough to fill 18 hospitals. While the government did introduce tier four the weekend before Christmas in parts of the south east of England, which banned mixing over the festive period and led to the closure of non-essential shops and gyms, most of the country were allowed to meet up on Christmas Day. Infections from Christmas Day are now being felt - the numbers have been rising sharply ever since. Some of these are next week's hospital admissions - and is why the chief medical officers warned of the risk of hospitals becoming overwhelmed, which Mr Gove said persuaded them to act on Monday. If lockdown had come earlier, it may well have been shorter. Prof Andrew Hayward - a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the lockdown measures ""will save tens of thousands of lives"". But he said ""the virus is different"" and ""it may be that the lockdown measures that we have are not enough"" ""This lockdown period we need to do more than just stay at home, wait for the vaccine, we need to be actively bearing down on it,"" he said. At Scotland's daily briefing, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called for people to hold on to the fact there was now ""a clear route out of this pandemic"". She said there had been urgent discussions between the four home nations about whether border controls should be tightened - and she hoped there would be an announcement soon. In other developments: Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced that businesses in the retail, hospitality and leisure sectorsare to be given a one-off grant worth up to Â£9,000 Mr Gove hasconfirmed GCSE and A-Level exams in England are being cancelled this yearand Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is due to make a statement in the House of Commons on Wednesday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditionsby the start of May In Northern Ireland, which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December,post-primary transfer tests have been cancelled. Train servicesare expected to be reducedduring the national lockdown in England MPs have been told that some of the UK's biggest music festivalscould be called off by the end of this month Travel firms Tui and Thomas Cookhave cancelled holidaysafter new coronavirus lockdown restrictions were imposed Buckingham Palace has announced that there will be no royal garden parties this year - in either London or Edinburgh Announcing England's lockdown on Monday, Mr Johnson said hospitals were under ""more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic"". He ordered people to stay indoors other than for limited exceptions - such as essential medical needs, food shopping, exercise and work that cannot be done at home - and said schools and colleges should move to remote teaching for the majority of students until at least half term. People who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said. While the rules become law in the early hours of Wednesday, people should follow them now, Mr Johnson added. Mr Johnsonsaid the new variant of coronavirus, which is up to 70% more transmissible, was spreading in a ""frustrating and alarming"" manner and warned that the number of Covid-19 patients in English hospitals is 40% higher than the first peak.

Covid: Schools in Wales stay shut until 18 January,"Classrooms in Wales will remain empty until 18 January at the earliest All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales. Some schools had been due to open on Wednesdayand others by 11 January withdecisions made by local authorities. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru. Teaching unions had called for a delayed start to termamid concerns about thecoronavirus variant. However, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans. Ms Williams said: ""As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term. ""This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information."" How many have died with Covid in Wales? 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins Education Minister Kirsty Williams made a video announcement Schools and colleges would remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments All childcare settings can remain open Universities in Wales have already agreed a staggered start to term Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed The announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increasedthe Covid threat level to five - its highest level. Level five warns of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"", according to theUK government's website,external. Wales has been under ""stay-at-home""lockdown restrictionssince 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, withmore than 31,000 casesin the two weeks over the Christmas period. A""flexible"" agreementon reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities. However, that decision has changed following the latest announcement. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: ""It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people. ""Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the ""best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus"". Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and ""not set in stone"". Laura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought ""much-needed clarity"". ""The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,"" she said. ""Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions."" Claire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was ""really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward"" although ""it's not the ideal"". Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left ""little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances"". ""It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,"" she said. There are more Covid patients in hospital beds than ever before - 2,688 on Sunday - which included a record number of more than 900 recovering patients too ill to be discharged There were also 136 patients in critical care with Covid, getting closer to the peak seen during the first wave in April Case rates have been falling on average in Wales in recent days, although there is some caution due to a fall in tests over the Christmas period.Wrexham and other parts of north east Wales have nevertheless reached their highest levels yet Bridgend has the highest case rate in Wales. Although falling, its proportion of positive cases - 36.5% - remains the highest in the UK Another25 deaths were reported by Public Health Wales,with the average of deaths running at around 34 a day in the most recent week Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties. It went into alevel four national lockdown on 20 December. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales New lockdown for England as cases surge Covid deniers removed from 'at capacity' hospital However, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. This delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day. And that's something the opposition parties have picked up on. With all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th. I'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set ofnew national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a""confusing picture""with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected. Schools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online. Scotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Most pupils in Northern Ireland werenot expected to return to schoolthis week as had been planned. Earlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a""last resort"". New lockdowns begin ahead of 'hardest weeks' Closing schools a last resort, says government PM set to announce new England lockdown At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Conjoined twins, 4, 'making friends at school'","This video can not be played The twins' father says what they have achieved is a 'herculean achievement' Conjoined twins who were expected to die within days when they were born are nearly four years later said to be settling in at their Cardiff school. Marieme and Ndeye Ndiaye werebrought to the UK from Senegal in 2017 by their father Ibrahimafor treatment at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. The girls, now four, are learning to stand and their father said their progress was ""a Herculean achievement"". Their head teacher said the girls had made friends and were ""laughing a lot"". The girls, who have separate hearts and spines but share a liver, bladder and digestive system, have conditions which put them at higher risk of complications from Covid. However, Mr Ndiaye said he had wanted them to start school for their development. ""When you look in the rear view mirror, it was an unachievable dream,"" he said. ""From now, everything ahead will be a bonus to me. My heart and soul is shouting out loud, 'Come on! Go on girls! Surprise me more!'."" Conjoined twins: Two girls, one body WATCH: Conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye Ndiaye living in UK WATCH: Marieme and Ndeye continue to surprise doctors Mr Ndiaye brought the girls to the UK through funding from a charitable foundation run by Senegal's first lady Marieme Faye Sall, before he sought asylum. In March 2018, the family were moved by the Home Office to Cardiff as asylum seekers can be moved anywhere in the UK and they now have discretionary leave to remain. In 2019, Great Ormond Street surgeons considered attempting separation but it was something Mr Ndiaye did not want because of the risks involved. The girls have such complex circulatory systems medics now believe they would not survive being separated Since then, doctors have found the girls' circulatory systems to be more closely linked than previously thought and neither would survive without the other, making separation now impossible. The girls' head teacher Helen Borley said they were learning well since starting reception in September and had made new friends. She said: ""Children either say, 'I'm Marieme's friend' or 'I'm Ndeye's friend' - they don't say, 'I'm the twins' friend'. Children very much identify as being one person's friend or another - because the girls are very different characters. ""They are laughing a lot - which is always a good sign, isn't it? Any child that is laughing a lot is a happy child."" Marieme receives oxygen from Ndeye's stronger heart and food via their linked stomachs For the twins, school needs to fit around hospital visits. In October, the girls needed surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital. Dr Gillian Body, a paediatric consultant at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, said the procedure was important, despite the risks. She said: ""The girls have complex anatomies and that makes them prone to infections and potentially sepsis. ""One of the challenges we had was getting antibiotics into them quickly, and this tube or cannula they've had fitted, means we can get them into them more quickly with less distress to the girls."" The girls have been experiencing the feeling of standing, at children's hospice Ty Hafan She said Marieme's heart was complex with lots of abnormalities that cause her problems with doing exercise and can lead to breathlessness. At children's' hospice Ty Hafan in Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, the girls have been learning what it feels like to stand. A special frame gives them the experience of being upright, helping build strength in their legs. Physiotherapist Sara Wade-West said it had been hard for them. ""It's a really different sensation when you're used to being sat down, to be upright can be scary,"" she said. ""To start with, particularly Ndeye wasn't very keen. We try and sneak the therapy in around the play, encouraging them to reach for toys to make them work a bit harder, but if they know it's therapy it's not so fun. ""Because of their cardiac function we can't push them too much so it's finding that balance - challenging them to get stronger but not exhausting them."" The twins' father Ibrahima Ndiaye said they were his ""warriors"" Watching his daughters stand is more than just a breakthrough for their father. ""They are showing that they don't only want to live, but be active and play their part in society,"" he said. ""All these achievements bring light and hopes for the future. But I know how fragile, complex and unpredictable their lives can be."" Mr Ndiaye said his hopes were ""parallel to my fears"" as the girls had ""so many times come close to the worst"". ""But the very least I can do for the girls is figure out my hopes for them,"" he said. ""The most I can do is to be beside them and live inside that hope and never allow anything to take that hope away. ""They are my warriors. They have proved they will never surrender without fighting. It is not yet over."" Meet conjoined twins Marieme and Ndeye.

'Let police fight crime with facial recognition',"South Wales Police piloted the use of facial recognition in Cardiff - it was later ruled unlawful Police should be allowed more access to facial recognition technology, a firm developing it for use in the private sector has said. Last year, appeal court judges ruled a trial projectto scan thousands of faces by South Wales Police was unlawful. The force did not appeal. Welsh company Credas said laws were not keeping up with the latest technology. The Home Office said it wants police to use new crime-reducing technology while ""maintaining public trust"". Credas believes such facial recognition technology could be a vital tool in fighting crime. ""Ten years ago it would have felt space age, but now it's everywhere - just logging into my phone or laptop, we're all used to it now,"" said chief executive Rhys David. ""But the legislation will never keep up with the technological advancements."" Facebook settles facial recognition dispute Five year ban considered in EU The artists trying to trick the cameras The firm, based in Penarth in the Vale of Glamorgan, works with firms to prevent crime in commercial settings, helping them confirm a client's identity. It can include estate agents, the legal sector, accountancy or gambling operations - any businesses regulated to reduce fraud and money laundering. ""There's common stories of people buying houses with someone else's identity and manipulating the paperwork so that the funds get transferred into the wrong account and it's too late then - we can't recover that,"" said Mr David. ""It's a very difficult position to be in, but technologies like ours are closing the gap."" Apps can compare people's picture to that on their passport Credas's app uses facial recognition - people take a selfie and the app compares it to a photograph of their passport to verify they are who they claim to be. Claire Williams works for FBM estate agent in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, which has been using the software for the past two years. ""Before we would take people's passports or driver's licence, they would either come into the office and we would photocopy it, or we would even accept a scanned, emailed copy. ""There would be no way of knowing whether these were legitimate passports and driver's licences. ""They might have been using fake IDs, trying to launder money through the property industry - putting money into the properties, then reselling them to launder the money."" But scanning faces to confirm details for a mortgage is a very different beast to automated facial recognition, which is what was being trialled by South Wales Police - scanning faces in a crowd, often without people's knowledge. That was ruled unlawful after a challenge by civil rights group Liberty and Ed Bridges from Cardiff. ""Real-time surveillance is considerably more complex than in the commercial space where it's a fairly static, controlled environment. But we should be adopting it and encouraging it to reduce a criminal footprint,"" added Mr David. ""I find it really sad that the police aren't encouraged to use technology like this to keep our country safe. ""Let's be honest, the police don't want to sell us trainers. They're not looking to capture our images or biometric footprints to sell us goods. It's to keep us safe, so the police can run very sophisticated facial matching programmes in real time to identify criminals."" The frustration was echoed by the surveillance camera commissioner, Tony Porter, who is the independent regulator appointed to oversee the use of camera systems in England and Wales. Following the appeal court ruling on South Wales Police in August, he said he had been ""fruitlessly and repeatedly"" callingfor an updated code the police could follow,external. While campaigners Liberty felt the court's ruling left little room for the technology to be safely used, Mr Porter disagreed, adding: ""I believe adoption of new and advancing technologies is an important element of keeping citizens safe."" He has issued new guidance,externalon the use of facial recognition in light of the case, but it remains just that - guidance, not law. It has left police forces still trying to iron out the problems raised by the Court of Appeal - the potential for gender and ethnic biases and a robust code to cover when, how and where the technology can be used, and in search of whom. Prof Martin Innes, from the Universities' Police Sciences Institute, evaluated the rollout of automatic facial recognition for South Wales Police in 2018, flagging ethical and regulatory challenges facing forces. ""If you look back at the history of new and innovative technologies in policing this is what always happens. You have to let the law catch up a little bit and find out what matters and where the key points of regulation are,"" he said. At present, different standards between the private and public sectors ""could be very, very confusing,"" he added. ""There is a risk that these technologies get introduced almost by stealth and they start popping up everywhere."" Pembrokeshire estate agent Claire Williams now uses a facial recognition app to match faces to identity In a way, some of that has already happened, from mobile phones that can detect your face to hi-tech doorbells Stopping criminal harm ""seems to be an equally justifiable reason"" to use the technology, argued Prof Innes. ""But we need to think quite carefully about how far do we want this to go, and where is it appropriate for us to introduce these technologies in our lives. ""There are issues - but there are potentially opportunities and benefits to be gained if it can be done in the right way, as well."" The Home Office and the police say they will consider any ideas that could improve the way live facial recognition technology is used. ""We want police to use new technologies, like live facial recognition, in a way that reduces crime while maintaining public trust,"" said a Home Office spokesperson. ""We are working closely with the police to ensure national College of Policing guidance complies with the Court of Appeal's request to clarify how live facial recognition will be used. ""The government committed in the Home Office Biometrics Strategy to review the Surveillance Camera Code of Practice and it will be updated in due course.""

Fisherman dies after clash with conservationistsSea Shepherd says the collision happened after it came under attack in the Gulf of California.Latin America & Caribbean,"Sea Shepherd is working to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise A Mexican fisherman has died after his boat collided with a larger vessel used by US conservationist group Sea Shepherd, reports say. Sea Shepherd said the clash happened after fishing boats attacked one of its vessels in the Gulf of California, where it is working to protect the endangered vaquita porpoise. It said its vessel was trying to leave when one of the boats smashed into it. The man's family allege that his boat was intentionally rammed. Health official Alonso Perez told AFP news agency on Monday that one fisherman died after sustaining serious injuries, while a second remained in a stable condition. Sea Shepherd said its Farley Mowat vessel was removing an illegal net from a protected area on 31 December when a group of people on small fishing boats launched a ""violent attack"", including throwing Molotov cocktails. ""Following routine anti-piracy procedures, the Farley Mowat undertook defensive manoeuvring to avoid the attacks. As the vessel attempted to leave the scene, one of the [boats] aggressively swerved in front of the Farley Mowat, crashing directly into the hull"" and splitting in two, it said. The group said it provided emergency first aid to the two men who had been on board the fishing boat. Conservationists working for Sea Shepherd have been attacked several times while patrolling the vaquita refuge. The group works with Mexican authorities to remove illegal gillnets used to catch totoaba fish, which are highly valued in Chinese traditional medicine. The nets are designed to trap the heads of fish but not their bodies, but are blamed for trapping and killing the endangered porpoises as well.

Singapore Covid tracing data available to police,"Singapore's Covid app is widely used across the country Singapore has admitted data from its Covid contact tracing programme can also be accessed by police, reversing earlier privacy assurances. Officials had previously explicitly ruled out the data would be used for anything other than the virus tracking. But parliament was told on Monday it could also be used ""for the purpose of criminal investigation"". Close to 80% of residents are signed up to the TraceTogether programme, which is used to check in to locations. The voluntary take up increased after it was announced it would soon be needed to access anything from the supermarket to your place of work. The TraceTogether programme, which uses either a smartphone app or a bluetooth token, also monitors who you have been in contact with. If someone tests positive with the virus, the data allows tracers to swiftly contact anyone that might have been infected. This prompted concerns over privacy - fears which have been echoed across the world as other countries rolled out their own tracing apps. To encourage people to enrol, Singaporean authorities promised the data would never be used for any other purpose,saying ""the data will never be accessed, unless the user tests positive for Covid-19 and is contacted by the contact tracing team"",external. But Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan told parliament on Monday that it can in fact also be used ""for the purpose of criminal investigation"", adding that ""otherwise, TraceTogether data is to be used only for contact tracing and for the purpose of fighting the Covid situation"". However,the privacy statement on the TraceTogether site was then updated,externalon the same day to state that ""the Criminal Procedure Code applies to all data under Singapore's jurisdiction"". ""Also, we want to be transparent with you,"" the statement reads. ""TraceTogether data may be used in circumstances where citizen safety and security is or has been affected. ""The Singapore Police Force is empowered under the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) to obtain any data, including TraceTogether data, for criminal investigations."" On Tuesday, the country's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Vivian Balakrishnan, clarified that it was not just TraceTogether data that was used in cases of serious criminal investigations. He said under the CPC, ""other forms of sensitive data like phone or banking records"" would also have their privacy regulations overruled in such cases. Mr Balakrishnan added that to his knowledge, police had so far only once accessed contact tracing data, in the case of a murder investigation. The minister stressed though that ""once the pandemic is over and there will no longer be a need for contact tracing, we will happily stand down the TraceTogether programme."" Monday's announcement though sparked some controversy on social media, with people calling out the government and some users posting that they had now deleted the app. Allow Twitter content?

""I'm disappointed, but not at all surprised,"" local journalist and activist Kirsten Han told the BBC. ""This is actually something that I've been flagging as a concern since the earlier days of TraceTogether - and was sometimes told that I was just a paranoid fearmonger undermining efforts to fight Covid-19. ""It doesn't feel good at all to discover I was right."" ""I think why most people are so angry about this is not that they feel like they're constantly being watched,"" one Singaporean, who did not want to be named, told the BBC. ""We already have that through other means like CCTV. ""It's more that they feel like they've been cheated. The government had assured us many times that TraceTogether would only be used for contact tracing, but now they've suddenly added this new caveat."" Another person told the BBC they wished they could delete the app, but daily life would be impossible without it. ""So I'm just going to disable my Bluetooth for TraceTogether from now on, unless I have to use it to enter somewhere. If the app is not only going to be used for contact tracing, then it's too much of an invasion of privacy."" Australian privacy watchdog Digital Rights Watch, told the BBC they were ""extremely concerned"" about the news from Singapore. ""This is the worst case scenario that privacy advocates have warned about since the start of the pandemic,"" Programme Director Lucie Krahulcova told the BBC. ""Such an approach will erode public trust in future health responses and therefore impede their efficacy."" Like most countries, Australia has rolled out its own contact tracing app but uptake has been sluggish precisely because of privacy concerns. Singapore schoolchildren must use Covid-trace tech Why Singapore turned to wearable virus-trace tech Singapore was among the first countries to introduce a contact tracing app nationally in March last year. The introduction of the token in June had sparked a rare backlash against the government over concerns the device would be mandatory.An online petition calling for it to be ditched,externalhas gathered some 55,000 signatures so far. Singapore has been been one of the most successful countries in tackling the pandemic. Despite a big outbreak among its foreign workers early on, local infection rates have for months been close to zero.

Saudi embargo on Qatar 'to be lifted',"This video can not be played The Saudi crown prince embraced Qatar's emir at the summit Diplomatic relations have been restored between Qatar and four Arab states that imposed an embargo against it for three years, the Saudi foreign minister says. Prince Faisal bin Farhad told reporters that the countries had agreed to ""fully set our differences aside"" at a Gulf Co-operation Council summit on Tuesday. Earlier, Saudi Arabia's crown prince publicly embraced the emir of Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt cut ties with Qatar in 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The tiny, gas- and oil-rich state denied the accusation and rejected the conditions for ending the partial blockade, including closing the Doha-based Al Jazeera broadcast network and curbing relations with Iran. In recent months, Kuwaiti and US mediators stepped up efforts to end the stand-off. How is Qatar coping with its economic embargo? Qatar country profile At Tuesday's summit in the Saudi heritage site of al-Ula, leaders of the six GCC member states signed an agreement that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said affirmed ""our Gulf, Arab and Islamic solidarity and stability"". ""There is a desperate need today to unite our efforts to promote our region and to confront challenges that surround us, especially the threats posed by the Iranian regime's nuclear and ballistic missile programme and its plans for sabotage and destruction,"" he added. Later, Prince Faisal told a news conference: ""What happened today is... the turning of the page on all points of difference and a full return of diplomatic relations."" On Monday night, Saudi Arabia agreed to reopen its land and sea borders and airspace to Qatar. The lifting of the embargo on Qatar has taken months of patient, painstaking diplomacy, mostly by Kuwait, but with increasingly urgent prodding from the White House as the Trump presidency draws to a close. The three-and-a-half year ""blockade"" has been immensely costly to both Qatar's economy and to the notion of Gulf unity. Qataris will not forgive or forget in a hurry what they see as a stab in the back by their Gulf Arab neighbours. But beyond the diplomatic rhetoric one country in particular - the UAE - has grave doubts that Qatar is actually going to change its ways. While Qatar denies supporting terrorism it has supported political Islamist movements in Gaza, Libya and elsewhere, notably the transnational Muslim Brotherhood which the UAE views as an existential threat to its monarchy. Meanwhile, the embargo has, if anything, pushed Qatar closer to Saudi Arabia's ideological enemies: Turkey and Iran. Qatar has long practised an ambitious foreign policy with different priorities to some other Gulf states, but there are two key issues which have angered its neighbours in the past decade. One is Qatar's support for Islamists. Qatar acknowledges providing assistance to Islamist groups designated as terrorist organisations by some of its neighbours, notably the Muslim Brotherhood. But it denies aiding jihadist groups like al-Qaeda or Islamic State (IS). Centred on its capital Doha, Qatar has a population of 2.6 million, but only about 300,000 of these are Qatari nationals The other key issue is Qatar's relations with Iran, with which it shares the world's largest gas field. The Shia Muslim power is Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia's main regional rival. In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed all diplomatic and trade ties. Qatar's only land border was closed; ships flying the Qatari flag or those serving Qatar were banned from docking at many ports; and much of the region's airspace was closed to Qatari aircraft. The countries presented Qatar with 13 demands as conditions for ending the embargo. They included closing Al Jazeera and other Qatar-funded news outlets, downgrading diplomatic ties with Iran, closing a Turkish military base in Qatar, and ending ""interference"" in other countries' internal affairs. This video can not be played Qatar's foreign minister interviewed in 2018 Qatar refused to comply, saying it would not agree to ""surrender"" its sovereignty and that the ""blockade"" by its neighbours violated international law. The emirate quickly established new trade routes with Iran and Turkey to ensure the basic needs of its population of 2.7 million were met, and used its oil and gas wealth to prop up its economy. Two states in the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council did not cut ties with Qatar - Kuwait and Oman. Kuwait served as a mediator in the dispute. US President Donald Trump unexpectedly sided with Saudi Arabia and its allies at the start of the dispute, denouncing Qatar as a ""funder of terror"" despite the emirate hosting the largest American military facility in the Middle East, al-Udeid airbase. But Mr Trump's aides subsequently persuaded him to take a more neutral stance, and in 2018 he praised Sheikh Tamim's work on combating terrorist financing at a White House meeting. Kuwaiti mediation efforts appeared to make little progress until late last year, when the Trump administration intensified pressure on all sides for an end to the stand-off that thwarted their efforts to assemble an alliance of Sunni-led states to counter Iran and its proxies. Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar in December, and reportedly flew to al-Ula on Monday to attend the summit. How is Qatar coping with its embargo?

Announcements on NI transfer tests expected,"Northern Ireland's lockdown is set to have further restrictions attached An order for people in Northern Ireland to stay at home - to stop the spread of Covid-19 - will become legally enforceable from Friday. The executive agreed the move after it met on Tuesday and tightened other measures. It will mean people can only leave home for medical or food needs, exercise and work that cannot be done from home. NI is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. As it happened:Executive agrees new lockdown rules Ministers also agreed to a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to reintroduce enforcement powers for the PSNI to order people to go home if they are engaging in prohibited activity. Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Arlene Foster said people should not wait for the regulations to take effect and insisted people should already be staying at home. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Northern Ireland faced a ""difficult period ahead"", but that the interventions were necessary. However, she said the executive had not reached agreement on whether GCSE or A-level exams should go ahead, and that further meetings would need to take place later this week. ""We will also have an urgent meeting convened tomorrow with faith groups, hopefully moving them all to online services,"" she added. Indoor and outdoor gatherings will be reduced from 15 people to six and only from two households, which will include children under 12 - exemptions will apply such as support bubbles. People will no longer be allowed to meet with other households in private gardens, although similar exemptions will apply there too. However, people will be allowed to take exercise outdoors with one person from another household. The executive also supported a proposal from the health minister to make it a requirement for all employers to conduct a risk assessment where employees are required to work away from their home. Ministers agreed the measures will last until 6 February, and be reviewed along with other lockdown measures on 21 January. Many pupils willnot return to school until after the half-term breakin mid-February, with nursery, primary and post-primary schools carrying out remote learning until then. However, ministers agreed that special schools will remain open as usual. Vulnerable children and children of key workers will have access to schools for supervised learning. Childcare settings will be allowed to remain open and childminders can continue their services. Payments to parents of children who receive free school meals will also continue, the Department of Education has confirmed. Discussions on exams took place, but ministers agreed to revisit this issue. Education Minister Peter Weir said: ""Work is ongoing on this issue as a matter of urgency and I intend to provide further clarity in the next couple of days. ""Until and unless any announcement is made, students should expect to continue to sit scheduled examinations."" On Tuesday evening, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said ""further flexibilities"" would be put in place for January exams and assessments, particularly in relation to BTecs. She said: ""Learning centres, including further education colleges, schools and training providers, will be afforded additional discretion to determine whether it is appropriate for learners to sit the scheduled BTec exams in January, taking into consideration a range of factors including health and safety and the personal circumstances of their learners."" It has also been confirmed thatpost-primary school transfer tests have been cancelledthis month due to the surge in the number of coronavirus cases. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, was due to take place on Saturday. But the Association for Quality Education (AQE) later announced that a single transfer test would be held on Saturday 27 February. The guidance for those who are clinically extremely vulnerable - and had to shield during the first lockdown in March - is not expected to change. Ministers are due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday. England and Scotland begin new lockdowns How quickly can we jab our way out of lockdown? On Tuesday, a further 18 coronavirus-related deaths - 11 in the past 24 hours and seven in the past week - were recorded by Northern Ireland's health department, bringing its death toll to 1,384. The department recorded a further 1,378 cases of the virus, with 577 confirmed patients in hospital, 45 of whom are in intensive care. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the previous week. A vaccination programme started in Northern Ireland in December Northern Ireland's director of the Royal College of Surgeons warned the health service could soon struggle to deal with the number of people needing treatment. ""That's not just the Covid patients - it's the patients who have a heart attack, a stroke, the people who fall and break their hip,"" said Dr Mark Taylor. ""But the difficulty is the more the system is pulled to deal with Covid, the less ability we have to deal with other aspects. ""The more Covid overwhelms the intensive care units then we're into really difficult ethical decisions... which no doctor wants to make in terms of who requires that ventilator.""

"Live music needs 'restart date', government told","The Cure were the last band to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2019 - with last year's festival called off Some of the UK's biggest music festivals could be called off by the end of this month, MPs have been told. Events are ""rapidly approaching the determination point"", after which they'll have to pull the plug, said the Association of Independent Festivals. Organisers will be in ""absolutely dire straits"" financially if the season is cancelled, added Anna Wade, of Winchester's Boomtown Fair. They were speaking to MPs examining the plight of music festivals in the UK. The House of Commons culture select committeeis carrying out an inquiry into the viability of this summer's events,external, after the coronavirus pandemic wiped out the 2020 festival season. Tuesday's hearing came a day after Glastonbury festival organiserEmily Eavis assured fans,externalthey ""haven't cancelled"" the 2021 event. But the committee was told that the government needs to introduce Covid cancellation insurance for live events and an extension to the current VAT cut on concert tickets. ""If the government don't help with insurance, then the smaller festivals are going to drop away,"" said Sacha Lord, co-founder of Manchester's Parklife Festival. He added that vaccinations and mass testing were essential to ensure the future of live music. ""Social distancing does not work at any of these events,"" he told MPs. ""It's a festival. You just cannot put social distancing in place, so we are anticipating that we will be operating at 100% [capacity]."" Wade pointed out that rapid-turnaround testing would place another financial burden on festival organisers. Testing kits are currently Â£10 each, she said, potentially meaning an outlay of Â£660,000 for her 66,000 attendees. Will concerts come back in 2021? Glastonbury 2021: 'We're doing everything we can' Music touring proposals were 'rejected by the EU' However, Lord, who is also night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester, said he was optimistic that festivals would ""bounce back"" once the virus was under control. ""People want to go to a gig, whether it's a festival or a small grassroots venue,"" he said. ""The appetite is out there."" Steve Heap, general secretary of the Association of Festival Organisers, said that while major festivals would have to make a decision this month, smaller events had until April. ""If we get as far as Easter and we still don't know that crowds can gather at festivals, however large or small, then we are in a catastrophic situation with this year's season,"" he said. The UK live music industry was worth Â£1.3bn in 2019 - but it has been hit hard by the pandemic, with more than 90% of the gigs planned for 2020 cancelled. Before Tuesday's hearing, music industry trade body UK Music called on MPs to name a ""restart date"" after which gigs can go ahead. The lack of coronavirus insurance was the ""biggest barrier"" to events resuming, it said, pointing out that Germany had recently announced a Â£2.3bn event cancellation fund, in line with several other European countries. Such a situation puts the UK at a ""competitive disadvantage"", UK Music's chief executive Jamie Njoku-Goodwin warned. ""The real danger here is that, if we see a lot of countries - particularly in Europe and closer to home - protecting their festival seasons, you could almost have a talent transfer,"" he told the committee. ""We don't want to have a situation where musicians, crews, technicians - people who should be working in the UK festival scene - are looking to the continent and thinking, actually, if there's going to be live music happening there in 2021, that's where we're going to be going."" UK Music's call to action came in a report called Let the Music Play: Save Our Summer 2021, which outlined a range of measures that could help the industry get back up and running. In a statement, Mr Njoku-Goodwin said that even with the roll-out of vaccines, ""lack of notice and available insurance options will mean much of the 2021 summer music season can't go ahead"". Responding to the report, a spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We know these are challenging times for the live events sector and are working flat out to support it. ""Our Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund has already seen more than Â£1bn offered to arts, heritage and performance organisations to support them through the impact of the pandemic, protecting tens of thousands of creative jobs across the UK, including festivals such as Deer Shed Festival, End of the Road and Nozstock.""

Calls for a new non-fatal strangulation offenceThere is to be a fresh move to make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence.UK,"""It could be something as simple as: 'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation"" A fresh move is under way to make non-fatal strangulation a specific criminal offence in England and Wales, after the House of Lords debated the Domestic Abuse Bill. The government has said it has no plans to change the law, arguing that non-fatal strangulation is already covered by existing legislation. However, campaigners say abusers who use non-fatal strangulation are telling their victims: ""I am controlling you and I can kill you"" - but too often are charged only with common assault. Lockdown exit must consider rise in abuse - May Change in strangling law 'would save lives' This is what happened in Jenny's case. Her abusive partner used non-fatal strangulation as a means of control throughout the five years they were together. ""It was like his favourite thing to do,"" says Jenny, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. ""That sounds really awful and trivial but that is how it becomes as an abuse victim. You learn to accept that is part of your life. It was like something I had to manage."" ""We would wake up in the morning and he would be in one of those moods, and I would see it in his eyes and I would think today's the day I'm going to get it. ""It could be something as simple as: 'I don't like what you have got on' - that would end in strangulation."" This video can not be played WATCH: Domestic abuse victim - 'He threw me against the wall and strangled me' Eventually one night she did call the police during an attack. ""He chased me round the house and every time he caught me he would pin me to the floor and strangle me until I had marks. ""I had burst blood vessels. I was streaming with tears. I just kept thinking: 'This is how I am going to die.' ""The doors were locked. He'd smashed my phone. I managed to get to the window and shout and one of the neighbours called the police."" However, she was dismayed by the police response. ""I thought it was quite lax. They didn't take the strangulation as seriously as they should have."" Her partner was charged with common assault. He pleaded guilty and was given a three-month sentence, suspended for 18 months. ""Strangulation needs to be a specific offence. I think the weak police response contributed to keeping me in the relationship,"" she says. Jenny believed her partner would eventually kill her. ""I just kept looking in the mirror and thinking: you need to leave and you're the only person who can do it. ""So one day while he was asleep, I picked up whatever I could carry and I ran and got on a train."" Baroness Newlove is bringing forward an amendment to the Domestic Abuse Bill in the House of Lords Politicians and campaigners tried and failed to have a new offence of non-fatal strangulation introduced in the Domestic Abuse Bill when it was going through the House of Commons. During Tuesday's debate on the bill in the Lords, the Conservative peer and former victims' commissioner, Baroness Newlove, said she intended to table an amendment to the bill when it reached the committee stage. She said non-fatal strangulation was currently not being picked up adequately by the police, as it often left no physical marks on the victim. She described it as a terrifying crime, with many victims testifying they felt as though their heads were going to explode and they were about to die. Peers from other parties also spoke in support of a new offence. Nogah Offer, a lawyer with the Centre for Women's Justice, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for a new offence, says: ""We believe this is a real opportunity to make a difference."" Common assault is a summary offence that can be charged by the police. But when it involves domestic abuse, it should be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service, its guidance says. In a statement, the Ministry of Justice said: ""Non-fatal strangulation is a serious crime which is already covered by existing laws such as common assault and attempted murder."" A spokesperson said the government would keep this area of the law under review, but said a specific offence of attempting to choke, strangle or suffocate a person is included in the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 and, according to the 2015 Serious Crime Act, attempted strangulation can fall under the offence of coercive or controlling behaviour. Dr Catherine White: ""Ultimately it can lead to death"" Dr Catherine White, clinical director of St. Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, says: ""Strangulation often ends up being treated the same as a slap or a punch. ""It's a very different crime. Often there is no external injury to the neck, which is why it's a very powerful tool for the perpetrator. ""It can cause confusion but ultimately it can lead to death."" A research project led by Dr White describes non-fatal strangulation as a ""gendered crime, with nearly all the patients female and the alleged perpetrators male"". And figures from the Femicide Census, which looked at the cases of women killed by men in the UK, found that in 2018, 29% died through strangulation. Campaigners point to New Zealand and some parts of the United States and Australia, where non-fatal strangulation has become a specific offence. Meanwhile, after help from a women's centre  and counselling, Jenny now feels stronger and happier. Despite the pandemic, she says, having finally escaped her abuser: ""2020 was one of the best years of my life.""

Proud Boys leader 'arrested for burning BLM flag',"Enrique Tarrio says his far-right group will turn out in numbers on Wednesday The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group has been released after his arrest on suspicion of burning a Black Lives Matter flag last month. Enrique Tarrio faces destruction of property charges. On Tuesday, a judge ordered him to stay out of Washington. He has reportedly admitted torching a banner taken from a black church during a rally in December in the city. President Donald Trump has been urging supporters to gather in the capital this week for another demonstration. On Tuesday, a judge released him on his own recognisance pending his trial. On Wednesday, members of Congress are due to certify Democratic President-elect Joe Biden's election victory before he takes office on 20 January. Mr Tarrio has said on the social media app Parler that the Proud Boys will ""turn out in record numbers on Jan 6th"", referring to his members as ""the most notorious group of extraordinary gentlemen"". Who are Proud Boys and antifa? The National Guard has been deployed by Washington DC's mayor to assist local authorities. Officials say the troops will not be armed and will be there to assist with crowd management and traffic control. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Department, Dustin Sternbeck,told the Washington Post,externalon Monday that Mr Tarrio had been stopped in a vehicle shortly after it entered the district. The 36-year-old was also found during his arrest to be in unlawful possession of two devices that allow guns to hold additional bullets, a source told CBS News. The destruction of property charge relates to a protest in Washington DC on 12 December in support of the outgoing Republican president's unsubstantiated claims of systemic election fraud. Trump 'just plain wrong' on Georgia claim Pro-Trump rallies see scuffles in US cities The mostly peaceful demonstration ended in isolated scuffles as confrontations with counter-protesters broke out. Police said more than three dozen people were arrested and four churches were vandalised. Mr Tarrio - who lives in Miami, where he also reportedly runs a grassroots organisation called Latinos for Trump - told the Washington Post at the time that he had burned the Black Lives Matter flag. This video can not be played âI organised some of Londonâs biggest BLM protestsâ ""Let's make this simple,"" he said. ""I did it."" But he maintained he did not know the Asbury United Methodist Church, where the flag had reportedly flown, was predominantly attended by African American worshippers. Mr Tarrio also said Proud Boy members have had their flags and hats stolen in past demonstrations without anyone being arrested for those alleged incidents. Earlier on Monday, another black church that was vandalised during December's protest sued Mr Tarrio and the Proud Boys. Counter-demonstrators were mostly kept at a distance from Trump supporter last month by Washington DC police The Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church accused the group of climbing over a fence and tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign. Kristen Clarke, head of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said in a statement: ""Black churches and other religious institutions have a long and ugly history of being targeted by white supremacists in racist and violent attacks meant to intimidate and create fear. ""Our lawsuit aims to hold those who engage in such action accountable."" The city's police department said last month it had been considering a potential hate crime charge over the incident.

Kuenssberg: Much is an echo of March,"By 8pm on Monday it felt inevitable. But it doesn't mean that a national instruction to close the doors was automatic. Or indeed that new lockdowns in England and Scotland aren't still dramatic and painful. With tightening up in Wales and Northern Ireland too, the spread of coronavirus this winter has been faster than governments' attempts to keep up with it - leaving leaders with little choice but to take more of our choices away. There is much that's an echo of March. Work, school, life outside the home will be constrained in so many ways, with terrible and expensive side-effects for the economy. This time, it's already spluttering - restrictions being turned on and off for months have starved so much trade of vital business. But there's a lot that's different too. After so long, the public is less forgiving of the actions taken, and there is frustration particularly over last-minute changes for schools; fatigue too with having to live under such limits. By now, Boris Johnson's opponents, inside and outside the Tory party, have plenty of evidence to suggest that he would rather put off difficult decisions. But there is another profound change, that the prime minister was unsurprisingly keen to point out on live TV, where the UK, at the moment, has a leading reputation. Vaccines exist, partly due to UK science, and are being injected into willing arms already. The scientific triumph still needs to be turned into a logistical victory. But if around 13 million vaccines can be offered over the next six weeks, we may be on the way. One member of the cabinet told me: ""We should do absolutely nothing but this, the vaccine - it should be the entire focus of the government; every government shoulder should be put to every government wheel."" It's not just the country's health and economic fortunes riding on hitting that stretching target, but the government's reputation too.

US Republican vows to carry gun to Congress,"A newly elected congresswoman has pledged to carry a Glock handgun during her term in Washington DC. In a video released on Sunday, Republican Lauren Boebert is shown loading a handgun before walking around the city. ""I will carry my firearm in DC and in Congress,"" she says in the video, which has been viewed over two million times. But the city's police chief has said he plans to speak to Ms Boebert about the strict rules on carrying firearms. Ms Boeber owns a restaurant called Shooters Grill in the town of Rifle, Colorado, where members of staff are encouraged to openly carry weapons, as is permitted under the state's laws. The issue of gun rights formed a key part of her campaign for last November's election. The women changing the face of US politics Four dates that explain the US gun debate Why is US gun lobby NRA so controversial? ""Even though I now work in one of the most liberal cities in America, I refuse to give up my rights,"" Ms Boebert says in the video posted on Twitter on Sunday. ""So as a five-foot tall, 100-pound woman I choose to protect myself legally, because I am my best security."" But police were quick to respond, with Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee III telling reporters: ""That Congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that's caught on the DC streets carrying a firearm."" While the US constitution enshrines the people's right to keep and bear arms, the rules governing this vary. Members of Congress are allowed to keep firearms in their offices and transport them in Washington DC, as long as they are not loaded. However, a permit is needed to carry a gun through the city's streets and weapons from other states must first be registered with local authorities. Last month, a group of Democratic senators proposed new legislation to tighten existing rules for members of Congress.

Scotland's 'stay at home' order comes into force,"This video can not be played Sturgeon: Vaccination programme needs to win the race Tough new lockdown restrictions forbidding people from leaving home for non-essential reasons have come into force across the Scottish mainland. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the clampdown was necessary to contain the spread of the new strain of Covid-19. People are now required by law to stay in their homes and to work from home. Outdoor gatherings have been restricted to one-on-one meet-ups, and schools will close to most pupils until February at the earliest. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs on Monday that Scotland faced an ""extremely serious"" situation, with the new, faster-spreading variant of coronavirus ""a massive blow"". Scots ordered to stay home in new Covid lockdown What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Schools will remain closed to most pupils until at least the beginning of February. The first minister has said she cannot guarantee when children will be allowed back in classrooms or when the latest lockdown restrictions will be lifted. She also told theBBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme on Tuesday that she hoped 2.7 million people in Scotland would have received one dose of the Covid vaccine by the middle of May. She said: ""I can't be definitive right now about when we will lift these restrictions. ""I have described this as a race - we've got the vaccine in one lane and we are trying to accelerate that. ""We've got the virus which has learned to run faster in the other lane and we've got to slow it down. ""Lockdown is about pushing rates of the virus back, and if we manage to do that then hopefully we will be able to start lifting restrictions while the vaccination programme is ongoing."" A government document revealed,externalthere were now more than 90 patients in intensive care units, with new modelling suggesting that figure could more than double by early February. The modelling sets out different scenarios with the most pessimistic predicting hospitals admissions could soar to more than 8,000 with over 700 patients requiring intensive care. The document also revealed that Inverclyde - which a few weeks ago had relatively low levels of Covid - now has the highest case rate,  almost 550 per 100,000 - while Dumfries and Galloway has seen its rate increase to 475 per 100,000. Dundee City, East Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and the Scottish Borders all now have case rates exceeding 300 per 100,000. Only limited data was released by the government in recent days buta full update on deaths, hospital admissions and local infection rateshas now been issued. Cases of Covid have risen sharply in recent days The new restrictions came into force at midnight and are, in effect, an enhancement to the level four curbs already in place across the mainland and Skye. They will run until at least the end of January and could yet be extended both in scope and duration. Scotland's island communities, with the exception of Skye, are to remain in level three for now, although Ms Sturgeon warned this would also remain under review. New regulations mean Scots are prohibited from leaving their homes for anything other than ""essential"" purposes - although the law provides a lengthy list ofexamples of ""reasonable excuses"",external. These include shopping for food or medical supplies, providing or accessing childcare, exercise, and participation in extended households. Anyone who can do their job from home must do so, and people in the ""shielding"" category have been advised not to go out to work at all. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces stay at home rules in new lockdown New restrictions have been placed on outdoor gatherings in level four areas, with only two people from separate households now permitted to meet up. These restrictions do not include children under the age of 12, who are still allowed to gather to play, but everyone else must abide by them or face a fixed penalty notice. Travel restrictions remain in place between local authority areas and in and out of Scotland, and people have been urged to stay as close to home as possible when going out for exercise. Schools will now operate on a remote-learning basis for the majority of pupils when the new term starts on 11 January, with only the children of key workers and vulnerable children to receive face-to-face teaching. This is to run until at least 1 February, with a review on 18 January - with Ms Sturgeon saying her ""fundamental priority"" was still to get children back in school full time as quickly as possible. The new measures are a bid to control the spread of the new variant of Covid, which is now thought to be responsible for nearly half of all new cases of the virus in Scotland. Officials believe Scotland is roughly four weeks behind London - where health services are coming under increasing pressure - and warn that hospitals could hit capacity within the month without major new curbs. Between 23 and 30 December, the average number of cases per 100,000 people in Scotland increased by 65%, from 136 to 225. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Four cleared over Â£26m raids on celebrities' homesFour people were accused of being a ""supporting cast"" for burglars who targeted west London homes.London","The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were broken into in December 2019 Four people have been cleared of being involved in a plot to raid the luxury homes of celebrities in west London. Items belonging to Frank Lampard, Tamara Ecclestone and the family of tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken during three burglaries in December 2019. Prosecutors said Maria Mester, 48, Emil Bogdan Savastru, 30, Sorin Marcovici, 53, and Alexandru Stan, 49, were a ""supporting cast"" for the burglars. But a jury found all four not guilty. Isleworth Crown Court heard the three burglaries had netted ""big money"" for the raiders, with ""fabulous jewellery"" stolen and the majority of it having never been recovered. Jay Rutland, Tamara Ecclestone and their daughter had left for Lapland on the morning of the burglary Jewellery and cash worth Â£25m was taken from Ms Ecclestone's Kensington home while she was on holiday in Lapland with her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter. Mr Lampard and his TV presenter wife Christine had about Â£60,000 in watches and jewellery stolen when they were out, while raiders also ransacked the family home of Mr Srivaddhanaprabha, who died in 2018 in a helicopter crash, the jury was told. The four defendants were accused of eight charges including conspiracy to burgle. However, each denied their involvement with the plot, saying they had no knowledge that the alleged burglars were criminals. Jurors were shown an image from Maria Mester's Facebook account, in which she was said to be wearing Tamara Ecclestone's necklace The court heard escort Ms Mester had flown into the UK from Italy on 7 December. Police described her as the plot's ""matriarch"", but the 48-year-old told jurors she was only in London after being paid Â£5,000 to accompany one of the alleged burglars for the week. Savastru was arrested at Heathrow Airport on 30 January as he prepared to leave for Japan, wearing Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's Tag watch and carrying a Louis Vuitton bag stolen from Mr Rutland. He told the court he thought the items had been left behind by the alleged burglars at the Airbnb property he had helped them rent. The four Romanian nationals were cleared of all charges apart from Savastru, who was convicted of one count of attempting to conceal criminal property. The 30-year-old will be sentenced at a later date. A group of alleged burglars, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are accused of carrying out the raids. Â£26m celebrity raids 'bound to be Hollywood film' Jurors 'not to be prejudiced' by escort revelation Escort was 'stupid chicken, not Â£25m jewel thief' Suspect 'searched for burglary news' after thefts Ecclestone raid accused 'was in London for client' Ecclestone raid accused 'went on Harrods spree' Woman arrested wearing Ecclestone's jewellery Guard denies Â£25m Ecclestone raid was inside job Stars lost Â£26m of property to 'burglary team' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Everything to know about the Silvertown Tunnel: Opening date, charges and more Police fear more âserious youth violenceâ after boy stabbed to death on Woolwich bus The biggest developments coming to Hounslow in 2025 COTW: Discover Hidden Gems of France, Spain and Portugal Cruise this March!

What is happening with schools in January?The UK alert level is going up to five. What does that mean?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants. Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Surge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes. Wherever you are in the UK, if you havesymptomsyou should book afree test online,external.

Brexit: Call for urgent action over deliveries to NIEconomy Minister Diane Dodds writes to Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove over the issue.Northern Ireland,"Economy Minister Diane Dodds has written to Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove to call for urgent action to be taken on deliveries to NI. Since Christmas some orders have been cancelled or delayed and some retailers have suspended deliveries. The problem is related to uncertainty about post-Brexit transition rules. HM Customs announced a grace period on New Year's Eve confirming most parcels from GB-NI will not need customs declarations until at least April. The problems have not affected all companies with many continuing to take orders and deliver as normal. However, some companies had already suspended deliveries, including John Lewis. The government said the three-month grace period ""recognises the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, the impacts of any disruption to parcel movements in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and specific challenges for operators moving express consignments"". A government spokesman said further details will be published in the new year, adding: ""Our priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the [Northern Ireland] Protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. ""HMRC is engaging with operators to finalise arrangements."" 'No customs declarations' for GB to NI parcels Brexit: How Northern Ireland is different Some changes have already come into effect. A Northern Ireland-based business receiving goods valued at Â£135 or more through an express carrier or Royal Mail will need to submit a customs declaration. They will need to do this within three months of receiving the goods and can use the government's Trader Support Service to do so. Excise goods, which mostly refers to alcoholic drinks, will also need a declaration when being sent from GB to NI. The government has advised retailers of those goods to contact their delivery company. It said: ""They will then tell you if they carry the type of goods you want to send and, if they do, they will ask you to provide any additional information that they need so that a declaration can be made.""
