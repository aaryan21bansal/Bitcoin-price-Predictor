Sunak: Energy bill help 'worth Â£290m to Scotland',"This video can not be played 'Every penny' of extra funds will go on energy costs Scotland will benefit from an additional Â£290m of funding to help ease the burden of rising energy bills, the Chancellor has said. The money is the result of Barnett consequentials from a council tax cut announced by Rishi Sunak in England. It will be on top of a Â£200 reduction on energy bills for customers in England, Scotland and Wales in October. Nicola Sturgeon said ""every penny"" of the Â£290m would go towards helping ease the cost of living crisis. Scotland's finance secretary, Kate Forbes, later tweeted that theadditional Â£120m allocated to councils last weekin order to avoid council tax rises would be paid for by the additional money. She said the Scottish government had been told in advance of the Chancellor's announcement that there would be additional money from Barnett, adding: ""I'll have more info in due course but as the first minister said we'll ensure that we use consequential funding to mitigate the cost of living in Scotland."" Energy bills to rise by 54% a year for millions Soaring prices: 'I may have to move in with my parents' Price inflation: The heat is on The chancellorannounced the measures to help householdsafter regulator Ofgem raised the energy price cap. Typical household energy bills will soar by Â£693 per year from April, or Â£708 for those on prepayment meters. The Bank of England has also increased interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5%, which will make borrowing money more expensive for people, but is designed to keep a lid on rising prices. Mr Sunak responded with a Â£150 rebate on council tax bands A to D in England, and a reduction of Â£200 on energy bills which will be repaid at Â£40 a year over five years from April 2023. The Chancellor said: ""The price cap has meant that the impact of soaring gas prices has so far fallen predominantly on energy companies. ""So much so that some suppliers who couldn't afford to meet those extra costs have gone out of business as a result. ""It is not sustainable to keep holding the price of energy artificially low. For me to stand here and pretend we don't have to adjust to paying higher prices would be wrong and dishonest. ""But what we can do is take the sting out of a significant price shock for millions of families by making sure that the increase in prices is smaller initially and spread over a longer period.""# Energy bills will rise by Â£693 a year from April Asked about the announcements atFirst Minister's Questions, Ms Sturgeon said: ""The chancellor announced what sounded like welcome steps to mitigate that but steps that did not go far enough."" But she said it was too early to say where money would be spent, given it was less than an hour after the announcement had been made. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""not opposed"" to Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar's calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, adding: ""We believe that those who have the broadest shoulders should pay the most. ""That certainly includes oil and gas companies who are seeing rising profits but during the pandemic other companies fall into that category as well. ""We have seen Amazon profits rise and also supermarkets, so we need to make sure we have a fair approach. The Scottish government doesn't have the power to do any of this - it would be a decision for the UK government."" In a Holyrood debate on the rising cost of living later on Thursday, Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie called on the Scottish government to spell out next week where the additional funding would be spent. She said: ""This cannot wait. There must be no excuses, no inaction, no hiding behind the constitution. ""They must act and act now in the interests of the people of Scotland."" Teacher Mog has already tightened her belt and sees more cuts to household spending coming with higher energy bills Mog, a teacher, lives in Westray, Orkney, with her three daughters. ""I worry about energy prices rising. The electricity bill is almost as much as rent and I have already made steps to reduce our outgoings. ""The children are down to a capsule wardrobe of just what they need. We are quite frugal, we have smart switches that turn things off when we leave the room and we have storage heaters which go off between Easter and October. We don't run a tumble drier and run economy loads on the washing machine. ""We sit under duvets in the living room and I have rearranged the rooms in the house. The three girls sleep in the smallest room because it is easier to keep that warm. The cosy rooms share a wall with our neighbour so we share heat. ""Things like universal credit take into account housing costs but not what you might be spending on electricity. If your bills have risen above the level of the money you are getting, then your electricity bills will come out of your disposable income. ""Higher bills will mean budgeting even more carefully."" Derek Mitchell from Citizens Advice Scotland said the ""eye-watering increase"" in energy bills was a hammer blow for consumers. He said: ""One in three of us already find bills unaffordable and, shamefully, almost half a million people in Scotland have had to cut back on food to deal with unaffordable bills. ""This simply isn't a sustainable position for people."" He said April would be a ""nightmare scenario"" as rising bills and prices in the shops collided with flat or falling incomes, adding: ""No one should be forced into the heart-breaking choice between keeping their homes warm or feeding their families. We need immediate direct interventions."" The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotland said that the announcements by the Chancellor gave no relief to the energy bills of businesses. It added: ""Ministers need to extend the support to include smaller firms. And with cash from today's announcement heading to Holyrood, we'd urge decision-makers in Edinburgh to look at what they can do to help.""

"Don't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss","This video can not be played Bank of England boss: 'Donât ask for a big pay rise' Workers should not ask for big pay rises, to try and stop prices rising out of control, the Bank of England governor has told the BBC. Prices are expected to climb faster than pay, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. Andrew Bailey said the Bankraised rates to 0.5% from 0.25%to prevent rising prices becoming ""ingrained"". Asked if the Bank was also implicitly asking workers not to demand big pay rises, he said: ""Broadly, yes"". Inflation is on course to rise above 7% this year, leaving households facing the biggest income squeeze in decades. Post-tax incomes are forecast to fall 2% this year, after taking into account the rising cost of living. This represents the biggest fall in living standards since records began in 1990. Mr Bailey said that while it would be ""painful"" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, he added that some ""moderation of wage rises"" was needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. ""In the sense of saying, we do need to see a moderation of wage rises, now that's painful. I don't want to in any sense sugar that, it is painful. But we need to see that in order to get through this problem more quickly,"" he added. Workers are currently enjoying pay rises of just below 5% on average, according to a Bank survey. However, in sectors with big labour shortages, such as IT, construction and engineering firms have started paying workers ""ad-hoc"" bonuses in order to keep them. Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices How the interest rate rise might affect you In the year from 1 March 2020, Mr Bailey was paid Â£575,538 including pension. That is more than 18 times higher than the median annual pay for full-time employees of Â£31,285 for the tax year ending 5 April 2021. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), is expected to peak at 7.25% in April, and average close to 6% in 2022. This would be the fastest price growth since 1991 and is well above the Bank's 2% target. There are also increasing signs of broader price pressures across the economy. Prices of household appliances such as fridges climbed almost 10% over the past year. Goods shortages also meant retailers were offering fewer bargains in the January sales compared with previous years. The price of services such as getting a haircut or a trip to the vet had also become more expensive as companies passed on higher wage costs to consumers, the Bank warned. Mr Bailey described the jobs market as ""extraordinarily tight"", adding that labour shortages were the ""first, second and third thing people want to talk about"" when he visited businesses across the country. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates suggested that further rate rises would be needed ""in the coming months"" if the economy continued to bounce back from the slowdown caused by the Omicron variant,. However, Mr Bailey cautioned that the economic outlook was particularly ""uncertain"" This may not necessarily be the start of a ""long march upwards"" in interest rates, he added. The worst squeeze on the income of households since 1990 is what the Bank predicts. Record energy bill rises from April will take inflation to a peak of 7.25% in April, more than treble the Bank's normal target. Some have called it ""Black Thursday"" for living standards. In raising interest rates again and signalling more rate rises in the coming months, and nearly voting for even more on Thursday, the Bank is putting the nation on the couch in an exercise in mass psychology. Inflation rises can be self-fulfilling. If workers, consumers and businesses expect 7% rises to persist, they will pre-emptively put up prices and ask for wage rises that then bring this about. What the Bank is trying to do is to confine what is happening right now to being a one-off shock. To stop the inflation becoming ""ingrained"" as Bank governor Andrew Bailey put it today. There is a presentational issue here. In ordinary circumstances interest rates are raised to temper booming or bubbly growth - to take the punch bowl away from the party. But there is no punch bowl. There is no party. In fact the Bank lowered its forecasts for growth of the economy to 3.75% from 5%, even though Omicron was not as damaging as feared. The Bank's answer is that this series of rate rises will be enough to stop a spiral of inflation, but will not go so high as to kill off the recovery. It is a delicate balancing act indeed.

NI First Minister Paul Givan announces resignation,"This video can not be played Paul Givan says being first minister has been the ""privilege of my life"" Paul Givan has announced his resignation as first minister of Northern Ireland, effective from midnight. The move is part of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protest against theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Mr Givan's resignation automatically means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, also loses her position. Sinn FÃ©in has called for an early assembly election as a result. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. DUP minister Edwin Poots ordered officials on Wednesday to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain, butthose checks were continuing on Thursday. It is understood those checks will continue until at least Monday afternoon, according to a solicitor for the Department of Agriculture addressing High Court proceedings on Thursday. Mr Givan said the power-sharing institutions were being tested once again. ""The delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew's Agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Mr Givan said. Paul Givan says the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland were being tested Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. LIVE: NI first minister's resignation sparks political crisis Paul Givan's political career Stormont in crisis - what happens now? Givan resignation: Reaction in quotes Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. It is understood other ministers will remain in place to run their respective departments. However the move will prevent the Northern Ireland Executive from functioning properly. The executive will not be able to meet as it is chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. Other ministers can remain in post, but they cannot take any new decisions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. ""I will remain in post, but the task of rebuilding our health service has been made all the more difficult,"" he said. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Read more:Analysis: A fresh political crisis In a press conference on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the DUP's actions have consequences and called for an early election. ""We cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a functioning executive and Sinn FÃ©in will not facilitate this,"" Ms McDonald said. ""In the absence of a functioning executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say. This video can not be played 'Stormont 'cannot limp on forever' ""We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre."" Ms O'Neill said the actions of the DUP were an ""act of harm towards wider society here"". ""We had huge opportunity here in prioritising the health budget and the DUP for their own selfish interests have walked away from all of that today and left such collateral damage behind them in terms of the wider community impact,"" she said. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson accused the UK government of not protecting ""Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market"". ""This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early 2020 and have participated in the political institutions since then,"" he said. ""I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's position in it."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the UK government has not honoured its commitments to Northern Ireland Alex Maskey, Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, has addressed a letter to all assembly members (MLAs), in which he explained the offices of the first and deputy first ministers were now ""vacant"". ""Therefore, the offices will have to be filled before 12.01am on Friday 11 February,"" he said. Mr Maskey also said he was aware thatlegislation due to be completed at Westminster next weekmay leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". We knew today was coming, now we must assess what it means. Paul Givan's resignation as first minster sets in train a series of events. Once he goes, it means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill loses her post. They can not continue without each other. That means that the executive can not meet. Other minsters can stay in charge of their departments, but they will be limited in what decisions they can take. Crucially, if the executive can not meet, it won't be able to approve a budget. So where does this place the long term future of power-sharing? An assembly election was due to take place on 5 May, but today's resignation has changed the atmosphere, and the political dynamic at Stormont. The chance of an early election has just increased. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments,"" adding that ""this is a very damaging move"". ""It is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the Executive is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly now as we emerge from the Covid pandemic,"" his spokesperson added. ""The protocol is part of an international treaty agreed and ratified by the UK and EU, to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. ""I would urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the decision by the DUP to withdraw from the executive was ""extremely disappointing"". ""I urge them to reinstate the first minister immediately to ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, seen here earlier this month, met virtually on Thursday Mr Å efÄoviÄ said it was essential that checks on goods entering Northern Ireland continues, and said the directive from Mr Poots to halt checks had been ""very unhelpful"". ""It creates uncertainty and unpredictability for the people and businesses in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""These checks are necessary for Northern Ireland to benefit from access to the EU's Single Market for goods."" Ms Truss said urgent progress was needed and her priority was peace and stability in Northern Ireland. The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdrawn DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks. The DUP is the biggest party in Stormont and so they are entitled to hold the first minister's post. Mr Givan was appointed first minister just over eight months ago in June 2021, during a turbulent period for the DUP, in which the party had three different leaders within a matter of weeks. He was nominated for the top job by his close ally Mr Poots, during the latter's short tenure as DUP leader. Paul Givan previously served as a special adviser to Edwin Poots and became his choice as first minister However, Mr Poots faced an internal revolt within days of taking control of the DUP andhe resigned the party leadership last June, after just 21 days in the job. Mr Poots was replaced as DUP leader by Sir Jeffrey, who allowed Mr Givan to continue as first minister. Nevertheless,since his first week in the job, Mr Givan's position as leader at Stormont has constantly been in doubt. There has been condemnation of the DUP's decision to withdraw from the executive by most of the other main assembly parties. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the people of Northern Ireland would ""suffer"" as a result of the move. ""If there's agreement reached, it's not going be because a first minister's resigned,"" he said. ""Agreement reached is because people are going to be talking and working to come up with solutions."" The move was described as ""obvious"" and ""coming for months"", by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. ""This is a stunt, it's nothing to do with the protocol, it's nothing to do with the concerns of real people out there,"" he said. ""It's an absolute betrayal of ordinary people and it won't work, in my view."" The budget implications were raised by Alliance leader Naomi Long, who said the DUP's decision was ""reprehensible and inexcusable"" and did not take into consideration vital programmes which need funding from a new budget. ""Instead the DUP decide to play a cynical and calculated game of risk with the lives and the livelihoods of the people in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The TUV leader Jim Allister said it was ""about time"" the first minister stood down, in opposition to the protocol. ""We have long said that if the price of Stormont is the implementation of the protocol that it was a price no unionist should pay, or ever should have paid,"" he said.

Space station to crash down to Earth in 2031,"Nasa plans to plunge the ISS into the Pacific Ocean in 2031 The International Space Station (ISS) will continue working until 2030, before plunging into the Pacific Ocean in early 2031, according to Nasa. In a report this week, the US space agency said the ISS would crash into a part of the ocean known as Point Nemo. This is the point furthest from land on planet Earth, also known as the spacecraft cemetery. Many old satellites and other space debris have crashed there, including the Russian space station Mir in 2001. Nasa said that in the future space activities close to Earth would be led by the commercial sector. The ISS - a joint project involving five space agencies - has been in orbit since 1998 and has been continuously crewed since 2000. More than 3,000 research investigations have taken place in its microgravity laboratory. However, it is only approved to operate until 2024 and any extension must be agreed by all partners. Nasa said the plan to retire the ISS marked a transition to the commercial sector for activities in low-Earth orbit - the area of space close to Earth. ""The private sector is technically and financially capable of developing and operating commercial low-Earth orbit destinations, with Nasa's assistance,"" said Phil McAlister, director of commercial space at Nasa Headquarters. In 2020,Nasa awarded a contract,externalto Texas-based company Axiom Space to build at least one habitable module to be attached to the ISS. It has also provided fundingto three companies,externalto develop designs for space stations and other commercial destinations in orbit. It is hoped that these new projects will be in at least partial operation before the ISS is retired. Nasa said it wanted to create a ""robust, American-led commercial economy in low-Earth orbit"". Elon Musk's SpaceX spacecraft carry crew and cargo to the ISS The commercial sector is already an important part of the US space programme, with private companies responsible for delivering crew and cargo. Russia's Soyuz and Progress spacecraft are also used. According to Nasa, it will save $1.3bn (Â£956m) by transitioning to the private sector for activities in low-Earth orbit, money which instead can be spent on deep-space exploration. The savings are anticipated because Nasa will only be paying for the services it needs, rather than for the maintenance and operations of the ISS. Nasa also points out that the private sector space stations will be newer and should require fewer spare parts. Nasa said it had analysed its ISS budget on an annual basis and that it would continue to refine its savings estimates. Thetransition report,externalpublished by Nasa this week comes after the administration of US President Joe Biden said it had committed to extend the space station's activities until 2030. However, the extension still requires the support of international partners, including Russia, and funding for the ISS is currently only approved by US Congress until 2024. In an interview with the Russian news agency Interfax in December 2021, the head of Russia's space programme, Dmitry Rogozin, indicated a willingness to work with Nasa beyond 2024. ""Actions speak louder than words,"" he said. ""This year we sent a new Nauka module to the ISS, which is expected to last at least 10 years."" The head of Roscosmos also complained that US sanctions on Russia were hurting the Russian space industry, and he has previously said Russia could end its participation in the ISS programme if the sanctions are not lifted. The US and its Western partners have threatened further sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, although the exact nature of those sanctions is not yet known. Russia has previously said that structural fatigue meant the ISS would not be capable of working beyond 2030, and warned thatoutdated equipment could lead to ""irreparable"" failures.

Amazon raises US price for Prime as profits jump,"Amazon is raising the price of its Prime service for US customers after reporting record sales and profits. The e-commerce giant said it was hiking the price by 17% to $139 for annual membership. The firm, which cited increased wage and shipping costs, said it had no announcements to make about other countries ""at this time"". It is the first increase since 2018 for Prime, which gives subscribers access to benefits like faster shipping. More than 200 million people globally pay for the service, many of them in the US. Amazon shares soared almost 15% in after hours trade on the news, which accompanied the release of its end of 2021 performance. Facebook sees daily users fall for first time ever Amazon fined $1.2bn by Italian regulators Sales for the last three months of 2021 expanded by 10% year-on-year to $137.4bn. But those gains were driven by growth in areas like its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, and advertising, while its e-commerce sales dipped from 2020, when the pandemic propelled blockbuster gains. The firm's profits in the quarter also jumped, to $14.3bn - almost double the prior year. Its investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian, which floated on the stock market in November, drove those increases. For the year, sales rose 22% to $469.8 billion, sending profits to $33.4bn. Analysts had been worried about how the firm would fare, after executives warned last year they were seeing higher costs due to supply issues and difficulty hiring workers. Amazon said those challenges had hurt - and were likely to continue this year. It forecast sales growth of 3%-8% in the first three months of 2022. ""As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labour supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron,"" chief executive Andy Jassy said. ""Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic."" The company said inflation, including higher wages, drove $4bn more in costs in the final months of 2021. With the increase in the Prime fees, the firm is moving to shift some of those costs to customers. Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said some may quit Prime due to the fee increase, which goes into effect on 18 February for new members and will apply after 25 March to existing subscribers. But he said that hadn't been a problem in the past. Consumer spending in the US has remained strong, despite prices rising at a 7% rate last year - the fastest inflation in nearly four decades.

Murdered doctor 'giant in personality' patient says,"Dr Gary Jenkins was a ""lovely, thoughtful, clever man"" As the friends of psychiatrist Gary Jenkins carried his wicker coffin from the church to the graveyard, two red kites circled high overhead. It was so apt that these beautiful birds appeared just as his coffin was being taken to its final resting place. These are the words of one of Mr Jenkins' patients, speaking after the trial and conviction of two men and a girl responsible for robbing, beating up, torturing and ultimatelymurdering the doctor in Bute Parkon the night of 20 July, 2020. The patient, who did not wish to be named, has come forward to share how his care, focus and dedication helped her through the depths of her depression. Gary loved nature. As a child he spent hours in a makeshift den with his friends, binoculars in hand watching the birds. That beautiful Monmouthshire churchyard, bathed in warm sunshine and birdsong was in stark contrast to his last conscious moments. In the transcript of the audio recording of the attack in Bute Park, Gary could be heard saying ""Why are you doing this?"" It's a question I've asked myself a hundred times since then. There is no answer. QC denies victim blaming in homophobic attack case Three guilty of homophobic murder of doctor I knew Gary, he was my psychiatrist and I like to think of him as my friend. Without him, I wouldn't be here today. That might seem like an exaggeration. But it's not. I first met him not long after I'd been the victim of repeated sexual assaults and bullying in my workplace. No one would help me. I was forced to walk away from a job I loved. I couldn't take any more. For the first year there were many days I couldn't get up, couldn't get dressed. For more than six months I couldn't leave my front door alone. The world was too hostile for me. There was a time that I was so ill that I'd planned and paid for my own funeral and the wake. I'd stockpiled pills and written goodbye notes, I was just waiting for the right time. I'd even written one for my bedroom door so that my poor other half wouldn't find me. It read ""don't open the door, just call the police. Sorry"". Dr Jenkins was attacked near the Summerhouse cafe in Bute Park Three years later, I went back to work and back to life. And that was because of Gary. So what was he like? Well, he was small in stature, but a giant in personality. Psychiatry to me, was a mixture of chemicals and kindness. He tweaked the anti-depressants and anti-anxiety drugs until the deep bleak fog of depression began to lift and then, this lovely, thoughtful, clever man began the delicate and difficult work of bringing me back into the world. Gary rallied a team to get me back on my feet including a PTSD expert who usually works with emergency service staff and a return to work consultant to deal with my employers. He supported my partner and invited him to talk about how he was coping. He was so very thoughtful. And somehow, over time, he persuaded me that the world wasn't a completely evil and horrible place. But standing in that churchyard, watching as his two daughters saw their father laid to rest, his family, friends and colleagues heartbroken, I couldn't help but think the world was truly evil. How could it be that someone so truly good and kind was taken like this? Gary's funeral was a window on a rich life well lived. Lee Strickland and Jason Edwards pleaded guilty to manslaughter and robbery but had denied murder His brave, brilliant daughters who sang and spoke, his love and talent for music and performing evident in every word they spoke, supported by their mother as they gazed at the wicker coffin garlanded with summer flowers. His childhood friends, remembering those days birdwatching from their den. His happy early days as a medical student in London, meeting his wife, becoming a dad. A dedicated parent, someone who loved life. The years of work in that most difficult of discipline, psychiatry, the tributes from colleagues who spoke of ward rounds with Gary being a memorable experience. His knowledge and expertise. He was the kind of person you'd want for a friend, a talented musician who was always ready to play the piano at a party, someone who loved good food and good conversation. Gary Jenkins worked at the Hamadryad Hospital in Cardiff Bay After the funeral, the wake was held in the pretty country pub overlooking the churchyard. Of course, Gary couldn't and didn't talk about his work to his family and friends. His best friend from childhood said it was a part of his life they knew nothing about. I was so glad to be able to tell him what a wonderful doctor he was - how kind and dedicated, funny and irreverent he could be. And how when he asked how you were, looking at you with that kind face, you knew, absolutely knew, he really cared. And that's what writing this is about - telling you about my experience of Dr Gary Jenkins. The attack happened in Cardiff's Bute Park His life is defined by so much more than simply one terrible night and writing this is the only thing I can do to say thank you. At the time of his death he was thinking about making big changes. He was hoping to reduce his working hours. He wanted to become a wildlife ranger, spending more time in his beloved nature, after years of dedicated service in the NHS. It would have meant more time with his family, his friends, more time to live the life he wanted to. But it wasn't to be. He gave so much, had so much more to give and yet it was taken away from him and that's the hardest part.

Families feel the pinch as bills to rise by 54%,"Rising heating bills means more cost cutting, said Lauren Morse ""It's crazy,"" said one mother-of-two who is worried utility prices could stretch her finances to breaking point. Lauren Morse, 34, has seen heating bills rise from Â£900 a year to Â£1,600 for her home in Cwmbran, Torfaen, on top of increases for food and petrol. She is now concerned her utility costs may top Â£2,500 after Ofgem revealedit is hiking its energy price cap. The energy regulator announced the cap will rise by Â£693, with average bills climbing to Â£1,971. Prepayment customers will see the cap rise by Â£708 to Â£2,107. Theenergy price capis the maximum amount suppliers can charge for a typical house in Great Britain. Energy bills to rise by 54% a year for millions Shoppers hit with sharpest price rises in a decade Welsh winter fuel payment to double to Â£200 Energy costs are spiralling because of the increased cost of worldwide gas prices. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced electricity bills will be discounted by Â£200 from October, with the discount to be repaid over five years. Mr Sunak's planned Â£150 council tax rebate for tax bands A to D is England-only, although the UK government says there will be Â£175m extra cash for Welsh ministers in Cardiff who run council tax in Wales. The Welsh government said it will consider what to do with the cash, amid calls for the Toriesfor the rebate to be matched. Cardiff ministers announced earlier this week they would double a fuel help scheme for people on working age benefits,from Â£100 to Â£200. Shop owner Lauren Morse said rising living costs were a ""hot topic"" Ms Morse, who runs a zero-waste store, selling foods and cleaning products, said: ""No matter how much money they earn, everybody is feeling the pinch."" The harsh reality is that when the price of energy rises, that pushes up the cost of manufacturing and distribution - making products such as food more expensive. That adds to the increase in the cost of living and squeezes the money in people's pockets. The poorest households pay a larger proportion of their money on fuel and essentials, but there are arange of schemes,externalthat help people who rely on benefits, as well as help for the elderly. Pete Harrison, 64, from Prestatyn, in Denbighshire, had to stop work about seven years ago due toCOPD,external. He gets about Â£114 per week in income support and his wife earns minimum wage at a children's nursery. Rising rent and fuel and food prices have already squeezed their budget ahead of the predicted increase in fuel bills. Pete Harrison said he has already cut back his energy usage ""to the bone"" Mr Harrison said: ""It's quite frightening now with the fuel bills. ""We're at rock bottom now, there's nothing else we can do to save power anymore. We're in a bit of a quandary really."" Mr Harrison said he only turns the heating on for two hours a day, but often wears three or four layers around the house and is in bed by about 21:00 in order to stay warm. Tracey Morgan, of Splice, a charity based in Bridgend, said the situation was ""frightening"" for families she works with. ""I think people are really worried at the moment,"" she said. ""The previous increase just before Christmas affected families massively. We saw a big increase with families needing to access our baby bank, needing extra food parcels, we were issuing e-vouchers for the food bank for them. ""It's an extremely worrying time for them at the moment."" Karen Dorling is trying to grow more of her own fruit and vegetables to cut her household bills Meanwhile, one customer at Ms Morse's store, Karen Dorling, 55, from Pontypool, said she was making cut backs. ""I've got an allotment so I'm trying to reduce what I spend on fruit and veg."" Ms Dorling has a 17-year-old son in college ""so you've got the food prices, buses, he wants to go out with his friends - everything has gone up,"" she said. She goes to a craft club which costs Â£3 a week and is a church volunteer ""so I do get out a lot without having to spend any money,"" she added. Ms Morse has also had to try and absorb increasing costs at her store, Zero Waste Torfaen. She said wholesale prices for rice had increased 50% since September, shampoo is up by 25%, 11% for toilet rolls and 10% for white vinegar used for cleaning. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? At home, her household utility bills leapt when her provider went bust due to increasing wholesale prices. Her husband Daniel, 35, now uses a motorbike to keep transport costs down on his commute to Bristol where he works as scientist. It is the rise in utility bills that the couple are dreading the most. Ms Morse said the couple were ""potentially looking at about Â£2,500 a year when eight months ago we were paying Â£900"". It all means a hoped-for caravan holiday with sons Ruben, nine and Oliver, six, ""won't happen this year"". ""It's going to mean less spending on non-essentials,"" said Ms Morse. This video can not be played ""People are having to make their choices as to whether they heat or eat"" Not only will rising prices affect domestic bills directly, but higher costs for businesses and inflation could see prices rise elsewhere. Tom Denman, the chief financial officer for the Principality building society, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Obviously [energy costs are] hitting households directly, but then you've got that background of hitting businesses and that is being passed on to consumers. ""There's lots of competing, unprecedented challenges that the authorities and us are trying to deal with, but ultimately it is going to be a squeeze for households."" Mr Denman said increasing interest rates to combat inflation was a ""well-trodden"" path, but for those not on fixed-rate mortgages, monthly repayments would go up alongside rising bills. Meanwhile, Dave Jones, who runs a renewable energy company in St Asaph, Denbighshire, said higher electricity costs would deter people from making more environmentally-friendly choices, such as electric cars and heat pumps in homes. He said his firm, Hafod Renewable Energy, bought three electric vans 18 months ago, but they would be more expensive to run than their diesel counterparts after the new cap is introduced. He added heat pumps could become ""unsustainable"" to run. ""We're pretty worried really, especially on the heat pump side,"" he said. ""I don't know what the price of gas and electricity is going to be in a year, so it's difficult to say what the best option is at the moment.""

Amazon raises price for Prime after record profit,"Amazon is raising the price of its Prime service for US customers after reporting record sales and profits. The e-commerce giant said it was hiking the price by 17% to $139 for annual membership. The firm, which cited increased wage and shipping costs, said it had no announcements to make about other countries ""at this time"". It is the first increase since 2018 for Prime, which gives subscribers access to benefits like faster shipping. More than 200 million people globally pay for the service, many of them in the US. Amazon shares soared almost 15% in after hours trade on the news, which accompanied the release of its end of 2021 performance. Facebook sees daily users fall for first time ever Amazon fined $1.2bn by Italian regulators Sales for the last three months of 2021 expanded by 10% year-on-year to $137.4bn. But those gains were driven by growth in areas like its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, and advertising, while its e-commerce sales dipped from 2020, when the pandemic propelled blockbuster gains. The firm's profits in the quarter also jumped, to $14.3bn - almost double the prior year. Its investment in electric vehicle maker Rivian, which floated on the stock market in November, drove those increases. For the year, sales rose 22% to $469.8 billion, sending profits to $33.4bn. Analysts had been worried about how the firm would fare, after executives warned last year they were seeing higher costs due to supply issues and difficulty hiring workers. Amazon said those challenges had hurt - and were likely to continue this year. It forecast sales growth of 3%-8% in the first three months of 2022. ""As expected over the holidays, we saw higher costs driven by labour supply shortages and inflationary pressures, and these issues persisted into the first quarter due to Omicron,"" chief executive Andy Jassy said. ""Despite these short-term challenges, we continue to feel optimistic and excited about the business as we emerge from the pandemic."" The company said inflation, including higher wages, drove $4bn more in costs in the final months of 2021. With the increase in the Prime fees, the firm is moving to shift some of those costs to customers. Amazon's chief financial officer, Brian Olsavsky, said some may quit Prime due to the fee increase, which goes into effect on 18 February for new members and will apply after 25 March to existing subscribers. But he said that hadn't been a problem in the past. Consumer spending in the US has remained strong, despite prices rising at a 7% rate last year - the fastest inflation in nearly four decades.

Home Office corrects migrant hotel bill to Â£4.7m,"Homes have been found for 4,000 Afghan refugees but 12,000 remained in ""bridging accommodation"", MPs were told Some 37,000 asylum seekers and Afghan refugees are living in UK hotels at a cost of Â£4.7m per day, revised Home Office figures show. A Home Office official said yesterday the total hotel bill was Â£1.2m a day but the department has since clarified the actual overall daily cost is Â£4.7m. It it understood the Â£1.2m is to accommodate Afghan refugees and another Â£3.5m a day is spent on asylum seekers. A spokesman said the use of hotels was unacceptable and a short-term solution. He insisted the Home Office was ""working hard"" to find suitable accommodation for asylum seekers and Afghan refugees, and urged councils to do all they could to help find permanent homes. It comes after the home secretary said there was a struggle to find permanent homes for thousands of refugees months after they were evacuated from Afghanistan. Priti Patel told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee the current policy was ""thoroughly inadequate"". The Home Office was developing better ways of working with local authorities to find permanent homes, MPs heard. Ms Patel said: ""We do not want people in hotels, we are looking at dispersed accommodation."" She said there were efforts under way to use Ministry of Defence buildings for more asylum accommodation. How many Afghan refugees are there and where will they go? There are 25,000 asylum seekers currently in hotels and another 12,000 people rescued from Afghanistan. Home Office Second Permanent Secretary Tricia Hayes told the committee homes had been found for 4,000 Afghan refugees so far and the 12,000 remained in ""bridging accommodation"". She said her department had been working with the Local Government Association and with councils to develop a new way of working on asylum schemes. She said there was a financial and policy imperative of ""cutting the cost that we're currently incurring in hotels, which is now racking up to about Â£1.2 million every single day"". There were now improved communication systems, such as a dedicated portal to connect people who could offer accommodation with councils and the government to help match them with families, she said. Ms Hayes added: ""We're incredibly grateful to the 300 councils that have already stepped forward to help us, but we can always do with more."" But the Home Office has since clarified that a drafting error saw Ms Hayes incorrectly give the daily hotel bill cost as Â£1.2m - rather than Â£4.7m - when arguing for the financial and policy need for cost-cutting. It is understood she has since clarified with the committee that the Â£1.2m figure was just part of the total cost. Conservative MP Tim Loughton told Ms Patel one Afghan refugee in his constituency with young children was in a hotel with ""appalling food"" and ""terrible conditions"". He said he was called a troublemaker and told to shut up and leave when he complained. Ms Patel asked him to provide her with more details, adding that it was an ""awful situation"".

"Colston statue belongs in museum, public says","The statue of Edward Colston being thrown into Bristol's harbour made headlines around the world A report commissioned after the statue of Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol has recommended that it should remain on display in the city's museum. A survey to gather views about the statue's possible future was begun after it was removed on 7 June, 2020. Nearly 14,000 people responded and 74% said they wanted the statue displayed in a museum lying down on its side. The recommendations by We Are Bristol History Commission group will be considered by the council and mayor. It also recommended the plinth and original plaques should remain in place and a new plaque be installed to explain why the statue was first put up and when it was taken down. Dr Shawn Sobers, Dr Joanna Burch-Brown and Professor Tim Cole of the We Are Bristol History Commission worked on the report The survey was undertaken in the summer with the aim of giving everyone the chance to share their opinions on what should happen to the statue and its plinth. A total of 13,984 people shared their views and the majority said they wanted to see the statue on display in a museum with the graffiti preserved, in a similar way to how it has beendisplayed in the M Shed Museum. The report said it should enter the permanent collection of the city council museums service and be presented in a ""nuanced, contextualised and engaging way"", to explain its history. Of the 16 per cent of people in Bristol who didn't want to see the statue in a city museum, around three-quarters wanted it returned to the plinth and a quarter suggested it should be destroyed or not on display. The report recommended the statue be exhibited in a similar way to how it was displayed at the M Shed Museum in Bristol Opinions were mixed on what should be done with the plinth. People were asked if they preferred for it to be used for temporary artwork or sculptures, or used for a permanent replacement or whether it should be left empty. The commission recommended the city to ""think creatively"" about the empty plinth, to seek funding to commission temporary artworks and activities, but for there to be ""periods of intentional emptiness"" at times. People were also asked how they felt about the statue being toppled - 56% of respondents said they had a positive feeling about the act and 36% had a negative feeling about it. Younger people and women felt more positive about it, while those feeling negative cited the way it was taken down as the main reason for their negative response. The bronze memorial to the 17th Century slave merchant was rolled to the harbour after being toppled Authors Dr Joanna Burch-Brown and Professor Tim Cole said there was a need to create opportunities for younger and older generations to share perspectives on the city's past, present and future. Co-chair of the We Are Bristol History Commission, Dr Burch-Brown said it was key to connect across different generations. ""Many older people have been feeling there should be more respect for law and tradition, and that the pace of change is too quick. ""Many younger people feel there is a need for change, and for more equality. ""There are positive intentions behind both views. We would love to see people of different ages coming together to spend time connecting through stories and histories,"" she said. Professor Tim Cole added their work had found there to be ""considerable shared thinking and feeling in the city."" Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Interest rates rise again in bid to cool prices,"Interest rates have risen for the second time in three months as the Bank of England tries to curb a rapid rise in the cost of living. The hike to 0.5% from 0.25% came as the Bank warned that price rises could speed up. Prices are expected to climb faster than pay, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. It comes as the chancellor unveiled a support package to help households cope with a 54% jump in energy bills. Rising gas and electricity costs are the main factors pushing up prices across the economy. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), is expected to peak at 7.25% in April, and average close to 6% in 2022. This would be the fastest price growth since 1991 and is well above the Bank's 2% target. Despite that, the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested workers need to accept pay restraint, and should not ask for higher wages, in order for inflation to be tamed more quickly. Don't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss How the interest rate rise might affect you What are interest rates and why do they matter? There are also increasing signs of broader price pressures across the economy. Prices of household appliances such as fridges climbed almost 10% over the past year. Goods shortages also meant retailers were offering fewer bargains in the January sales compared with previous years. Food prices and rents were also likely to creep up in the short term, the Bank warned. Pay increases are not expected to keep pace with rising prices. Post-tax incomes are forecast to fall 2% this year, after taking into account the rising cost of living. This represents the biggest fall in take-home pay since records began in 1990. Despite this, the Bank said there had been a ""material pick-up in pay settlements"" this year, with the average worker enjoying a 5% pay rise. ""Acute"" staff shortages in sectors such as hospitality, engineering, construction and IT also meant many employers were offering staff ""ad-hoc"" bonuses to keep them. The pandemic meant other workers had retired early, stayed in education or cut down their hours for a better work life balance. The Bank said this had created other labour shortages that could take ""many years to be resolved"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the jobs market was ""extraordinarily tight"", adding that when he speaks to businesses up and down the UK, labour shortages are the ""first, second and third thing people want to talk about"". The Bank's decision to raise interest rates will make borrowing more expensive, potentially hitting some households harder. The Bank cannot do much to ease the energy price shock or rapid price rises in some consumer goods, so it is sticking to its job by trying to keep inflation stable, the Bank's deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent said. The rates rise coupled with soaring prices will make it more difficult for some people to afford mortgage repayments. Naomi Mellor said her and her husband were ""tightening their belts"" due to rising energy costs Naomi Mellor, a vet who lives in Hatfield with her husband, sold their house in April, but their next purchase fell through, so they're renting. She said rising mortgage rates have had a big impact on what they can afford. ""We're looking at a rise in our energy bills, a rise in our fuel bills and a rise in our mortgage repayments, which altogether is going to contribute to probably Â£200 to Â£300 a month more in our monthly bills. ""We're trying to buy a house and the rising mortgage rates have had a big impact on what we can afford and how much we're going to be repaying on a monthly basis,"" she said. The Bank's rates decision will add just over Â£25 to the typical monthly repayment for people on a tracker mortgage. Those who have a standard variable rate mortgage will pay an extra Â£15 per month on average. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers will hope for higher returns, many big banks failed to pass on the full increase in December, when interest rates were increased from a record low of 0.1%. The worst squeeze on the income of households since 1990 is what the Bank predicts. Record energy bill rises from April will take inflation to a peak of 7.25% in April, more than treble the Bank's normal target. Some have called it ""Black Thursday"" for living standards. In raising interest rates again and signalling more rate rises in the coming months, and nearly voting for even more on Thursday, the Bank is putting the nation on the couch in an exercise in mass psychology. Inflation rises can be self-fulfilling. If workers, consumers and businesses expect 7% rises to persist, they will pre-emptively put up prices and ask for wage rises that then bring this about. What the Bank is trying to do is to confine what is happening right now to being a one-off shock. To stop the inflation becoming ""ingrained"" as Bank governor Andrew Bailey put it today. There is a presentational issue here. In ordinary circumstances interest rates are raised to temper booming or bubbly growth - to take the punch bowl away from the party. But there is no punch bowl. There is no party. In fact the Bank lowered its forecasts for growth of the economy to 3.75% from 5%, even though Omicron was not as damaging as feared. The Bank's answer is that this series of rate rises will be enough to stop a spiral of inflation, but will not go so high as to kill off the recovery. It is a delicate balancing act indeed. The recent rapid rise in prices led to some members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to call for a bigger rate rise. Four of the nine members voted to increase rates to 0.75% to ward off fears that price rises could become more sustained. The MPC voted unanimously to end new purchases as part of its Â£895bn bond buying programme to support the economy. The Bank also forecast that the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant will hit growth this year. The economy is forecast to stagnate in the first three months of this year, while the Bank also cut its annual growth forecast for 2022 from 5% to 3.75%. Policymakers expect the economy to grow by around 1.25% in 2023. While consumers are expected to dip into their savings to maintain living standards, this is expected to slow down later this year, weighing on growth.

âHow can we afford anything with bills this high?â,"Chris Piper has given up his car due to spiralling costs For Chris Piper, making ends meet during the pandemic has been anything but easy. Despite working full-time job in a care home near Newtown in mid-Wales, he's having to cut back on food and transport costs because his earnings aren't stretching as far as they used to. ""By the time you go to the shops, you've got no money leftâ¦ And they're putting everything up sky-high. How are we going to afford anything?"" Food and energy costs have soared recently, with consumerprices up by 5.4% in the year to December. Chris told BBC 5 Live he has had to make tough choices like giving up his car, as he could no longer afford the petrol, insurance and tax. Along with walking everywhere to save money, or borrowing his wife's car, he has also started visiting the Newtown Food Surplus project, which redistributes food that supermarkets can no longer sell, on a ""pay-as-you-feel"" basis. Without the additional help, which he describes as ""amazing"", Chris says his family would face a choice between heating or eating due to spiralling energy costs, high water bills and rising National Insurance contributions. Four things that are going up in price and why Why are prices rising so quickly? What high inflation means for you - in 90 seconds Recent polling by Savanta ComRes for BBC 5 Live suggests that about a third of adults working full-time in the UK, like Chris, are finding it hard to pay their household bills. ""People are just struggling,"" Chris says, adding that he fears he might lose his house eventually and be ""left with nothing"". In the poll of about 2,000 adults conducted in January, nearly 70% said they were worried about the cost of living. Vicky Rowe, the project manager for Newtown Food Surplus, originally set up the network to tackle food waste. But with bills rising, queues have been getting longer - even starting to form half an hour before opening. Vicky Rowe says demand for the surplus food on offer has skyrocketed. ""Many of the people that come here are in work. There's carers, there's nurses - it's all those people who do an amazing job and they are feeling the pinch because they're on those lower wages,"" she says. Unlike at a food bank, there is no criteria or referral needed to pick up a parcel. Because of that, Vicky says there is perhaps less stigma attached. She describes taking a box of surplus food to a friend on one occasion, causing them to burst into tears and admit that they too had been skipping meals. The survey conducted for BBC 5 Live suggests that 29% of UK adults had skipped meals in the last six months just to save money, while more than half had the heating on less this year. The exclusive polling coincided with the charity Citizens Advice issuing a ""red alert"" over rising costs on Wednesday. New figures recently released by the organisation showed that more people are seeking one-to-one support than at any other point during the pandemic. Referrals to food banks and advice on emergency one-off grants also reached their highest level on record, at 24,000 people in January. Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said that cost of living pressures were at ""boiling point"". ""April's price hikes haven't yet hit and already people are turning to our services in record numbers. ""Frontline advisers are hearing desperate stories of families living in just one room to keep warm, people turning off their fridges to save money and others relying on hot water bottles instead of heating, due to fears about mounting bills."" 1. Look at your monthly budget: income, spending and debt repayments Make a budget to work out how much money you have left over each month after paying your usual household bills. See if you can make savings in any areas such as subscriptions, for example 2. Make savings and increase your income You might not be able to switch energy providers, but maybe you could get a better deal on your phone or broadband? There could be ways to increase your income or benefits, or get reductions on your council tax. 3. Ask for help There are various debt charities across the UK that can help you work out the best ways to deal with your energy bills, as well as setting up repayment plans for any debt you might have. Source: StepChange debt charity Citizens Advice has called on the government to increase support for those on the lowest incomes, particularly when it comes to energy bills. The charity assisted more than 8,000 people in January as the average energy debt figure hit Â£1,450, up from Â£1,330 a year before. Trade association, Energy UK, has also previously warned that bills could rise by as much as 50% in the spring because of soaring wholesale gas prices. The government pointed to a range of support already being provided to low-income, and vulnerable households. ""We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living, which is why we are providing support worth around Â£12bn this financial year and next,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We are supporting vulnerable households through initiatives such as the Â£500m Household Support Fund and Warm Home Discount and will continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy. ""We will provide an update shortly on further help for households across the UK to meet their energy costs in the face of rising global gas prices,"" the spokesperson added.

What's the energy price cap and why is it going up?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments. In addition, suppliers must offer customers affordable payment plans or repayment holidays if they are struggling with bills. Most suppliers also offer hardship grants.

Paul Givanâs resignation from office. But a Stormont source said the decision was due to be one
of their final acts in office before both are no longer in post. The DUP has taken its decision because it has lost a unionist majority electorally and are ""not getting their own way"", Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill tells BBC Newsline. ""This is reckless by all measures, it is absolutely reckless for wider society,"" the outgoing deputy first minister says.

""That is hugely damaging to those victims who have been failed at every turn."" Ms O'Neill, who loses her position along with Paul Givan, effective from midnight, says she wants to meet party leaders on Friday to discuss fast-tracking legislation ""to protect the progress that has been made"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has ""poisoned politics"" over the past two years, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons tells BBC Newsline.

In a letter to MLAs, he writes there is ""much commentary"" around legislation which is being considered at Westminster which could allow the assembly to function for longer after the first and deputy first minister resign. At present, Paul Givan's resignation triggers a seven-day process to re-nominate. A failure to do so will leave it up to the Northern Ireland secretary to call an election. Mr Maskey says he has to work with the ""legal position which exists now"" and the vacancies are a ""serious matter for the assembly"". He continues: ""I appreciate that these matters will be a cause for concern and that all members will wish to see these issues resolved as quickly as possible.

""It is for the Irish government to explain to the people of Northern Ireland why they are continuing to ignore the concerns of unionists,"" he tells reporters. ""Why they have abandoned the principle of consensus, why they no longer take the view that significant matters that affect the future of Northern Ireland should have the consent of both unionists and nationalists."" The DUP leader's comments follow Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saying he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments"" at Stormont and his belief the DUP's action was a ""very damaging move"". Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey Donaldon's decision to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister was the ""wrong decision"".

While Robin Swann has attempted to tackle much of what was in his to-do box, due to the pandemic many issues remain unresolved. For instance, hospital waiting lists, which continue to soar. When the NI Executive was resuscitated in January 2020 the lists had increased to over 308,000. Now they are in excess of 350,000 and rising. The system needs to operate within a stable structure - not one thatâs in political limbo. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he is sorry that victims of historical institutional abuse have yet to receive an official apology. The statement was expected to be made by Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers on 11 March. ""We have supported them throughout their case, we supported them in getting a scheme that provided them with support, much needed and overdue support,"" the DUP leader continues. ""I am determined to ensure that apology is forthcoming."" Speaking to reporters outside the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Sir Jeffrey says his party is having discussions with the deputy first minister to ensure that ""decisions that were to be taken are taken"". ""It will not be the DUP who will be found wanting in putting through the measures that are required to deliver these things,"" he adds. Stephen WalkerBBC News NI Political Correspondent Sir Jeffrey's speech was a very lengthy speech, a bit like a conference speech. In many ways I thought it was an election speech. Some key points: He said the protocol represented an existential threat to the union, he used the phrase regularly in the speech ""we've had enough"", and there were quite a few digs at his political opponents. I was struck by the line when Sir Jeffrey says, ""It is time for the people across Northern Ireland to have their say"" - well that is a nod to an early election. From that point of view you have almost got Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP on the same page. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin is âdeeply concernedâ about Paul Givan's resignation. âIt is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the executive is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly now as we emerge from the Covid pandemic,â his spokesman told PA. âThe protocol is part of an international treaty agreed and ratified by the UK and EU, to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. âThe UK has an obligation under international law, and under its own domestic law, to ensure it meets is obligations under the protocol. âThe current talks between the EU and the UK and must be given every chance to succeed. The commission has put forward serious proposals which directly address the concerns about outstanding issues on implementation of the protocol. âI would urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland.â  This video can not be played Being first minister the 'privilege of my life' The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland says Paul Givan's resignation as first minister was an ""inevitable consequence"" of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It welcomes the steps taken in the past 24 hours by unionist politicians in opposition to the protocol. ""It is hoped that through these actions, the UK government and EU representatives will finally recognise, and move to resolve, the very serious concerns held by unionists,"" the organisation says. ""Collectively, unionists need to see Northern Irelandâs place in the United Kingdom restored, with unfettered access for all goods moving within the UKâs internal marketâ as well as the removal of the powers of foreign courts and legislatures in the affairs of Northern Ireland."" Paul Givan became Northern Ireland's youngest first minister in June 2021 after an internal DUP revolt. Now his time in that role is over, at least for the time being.

While Robin Swann has attempted to tackle much of what was in his to-do box, due to the pandemic many issues remain unresolved. For instance, hospital waiting lists, which continue to soar. When the NI Executive was resuscitated in January 2020 the lists had increased to over 308,000. Now they are in excess of 350,000 and rising. The system needs to operate within a stable structure - not one thatâs in political limbo. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he is sorry that victims of historical institutional abuse have yet to receive an official apology. The statement was expected to be made by Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers on 11 March. ""We have supported them throughout their case, we supported them in getting a scheme that provided them with support, much needed and overdue support,"" the DUP leader continues. ""I am determined to ensure that apology is forthcoming."" Speaking to reporters outside the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Sir Jeffrey says his party is having discussions with the deputy first minister to ensure that ""decisions that were to be taken are taken"". ""It will not be the DUP who will be found wanting in putting through the measures that are required to deliver these things,"" he adds. Stephen WalkerBBC News NI Political Correspondent Sir Jeffrey's speech was a very lengthy speech, a bit like a conference speech. In many ways I thought it was an election speech.

"As it happened: First minister's resignationThe DUP's Paul Givan has resigned, with the deputy first minister also ejected from office.","Paul Givan quit as first minister of Northern Ireland The move triggered the resignation of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill due to the power-sharing nature of the assembly Sinn FÃ©in called for assembly elections to be brought forward from May Mr Givan was appointed first minister in June 2021 when Edwin Poots was DUP leader DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson first threatened to withdraw Mr Givan as first minister in September 2021 Paul Lawlor, Chris Andrews, Judith Cummings and Luke Sproule A day can be a long time in Northern Ireland politics. At 00:01 this morning, an order to halt checks on goods entering Northern Ireland via the Irish Sea came into effect as part of the DUP's ongoing oppositon to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Friday will begin without a first or deputy first minister in post at Stormont. What it means for legislation and the possibility of an early election remains to be seen. Thank you for joining today's live coverage, with much more to follow on the BBC News NI website throughout the night. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie described the resignation of the first minister as a ""manufactured crisis"" that will lead to the ""instability of Northern Ireland"". This video can not be played Beattie reacts to Stormont crisis Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent The BBC understands that the first and deputy first
ministers are expected to sign off the appointment of a victims commissioner
later. It had been at risk of not being signed off because of
Paul Givanâs resignation from office. But a Stormont source said the decision was due to be one
of their final acts in office before both are no longer in post. The DUP has taken its decision because it has lost a unionist majority electorally and are ""not getting their own way"", Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill tells BBC Newsline. ""This is reckless by all measures, it is absolutely reckless for wider society,"" the outgoing deputy first minister says. ""I wanted to stand up on 11 March and make an apology to the victims of historical institutional abuse."" ""The DUP have taken that away from those victims,"" she continues. ""That is hugely damaging to those victims who have been failed at every turn."" Ms O'Neill, who loses her position along with Paul Givan, effective from midnight, says she wants to meet party leaders on Friday to discuss fast-tracking legislation ""to protect the progress that has been made"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has ""poisoned politics"" over the past two years, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons tells BBC Newsline. The DUP MLA says he has a list ""as long as my arm"" of businesses which have expressed concern about issues they face. ""The protocol is not working for everybody right now and it's causing problems for businesses and consumers and that is the boil that needs to be lanced,"" the minister continues. BBC News NI political editor Enda McClafferty interviews Gordon Lyons Mr Lyons says the government needs to deliver ""on what they promised"" in dealings with the EU. ""The Belfast Agreement has been torn up,"" he adds, explaining that many unionists believe their concerns are being ignored. Asked if the DUP wanted an early election, Mr Lyons says that is up to the Northern Ireland secretary, but ""we want to go to the electorate and say enough is enough"". Still hungry for more after a day which saw the resignation of the first minister and the descent of Northern Ireland into another political crisis? If so, you're in luck, The View will be live on BBC One NI from 10:35 GMT with live reaction and analysis.  This video can not be played Donaldson sorry abuse survivors yet to receive apology Speaker Alex Maskey says he will ask for a sitting of the assembly on or before 10 February to provide an opportunity for the first and deputy first minister positions to be filled. In a letter to MLAs, he writes there is ""much commentary"" around legislation which is being considered at Westminster which could allow the assembly to function for longer after the first and deputy first minister resign. At present, Paul Givan's resignation triggers a seven-day process to re-nominate. A failure to do so will leave it up to the Northern Ireland secretary to call an election. Mr Maskey says he has to work with the ""legal position which exists now"" and the vacancies are a ""serious matter for the assembly"". He continues: ""I appreciate that these matters will be a cause for concern and that all members will wish to see these issues resolved as quickly as possible. I will update the assembly as necessary."" The Irish government has taken a ""partisan"" stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has claimed. ""It is for the Irish government to explain to the people of Northern Ireland why they are continuing to ignore the concerns of unionists,"" he tells reporters. ""Why they have abandoned the principle of consensus, why they no longer take the view that significant matters that affect the future of Northern Ireland should have the consent of both unionists and nationalists."" The DUP leader's comments follow Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saying he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments"" at Stormont and his belief the DUP's action was a ""very damaging move"". Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey Donaldon's decision to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister was the ""wrong decision"". ""I don't think it will work in the long term,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""This is 3 February and we've had our first minister resign, on 3 March we will have no first minister and the protocol is likely still to be here, and every month after that."" Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey made the ""wrong decision"". Asked if the resignation might give the UK government leverage reach a fresh agreement with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol, he said: ""An agreement is reached not because a first minister has resigned. ""An agreement reached is going to be because people are working and talking to come up with a solution, and there are solutions there"".

There's undoubtedly a lot to get your head around - but we're here to help. Find out why the cost of living is soaringhere, how interest rates might affect youhere, and what help you can gethere. Today's live page was written by Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Chris Giles, Jo Couzens, Joseph Lee, Alex Kleiderman, James Harness, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee and was edited by Rob Corp. It's been a huge day for households worried about rising bills. Here's a reminder of the main developments. A little earlier we heard from Chancellor Rishi Sunak defending his plans to support households in England amid rising costs for energy bills. The Resolution Foundation - a think tank which looks at living standards for low and middle income earners - says Sunak has an ""ambitious"" plan. Butit tweeted,externalthat by opting for support for nearly everyone - instead of a targeted plan for low-income households - the number of families in fuel stress is set to double. Sunak has said because the price rises were ""so significant"" he wanted to make sure the support he provided went to all families, not just those on lower incomes. As he raised interest rates in a bid to curb inflation, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey issueda plea to workers not to ask for big pay risesto help them with increases in the cost of living. He told the BBC that it would be ""painful"" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, but said some ""moderation of wage rises"" was needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. ""I don't want to in any sense sugar that, it is painful. But we need to see that in order to get through this problem more quickly,"" he said. Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living is rising, is expected to reach an average of about 6% in 2022. We're all worried about rising bills and the growing cost of living - now research by the Liberal Democrats has revealed the areas in England that could be hit hardest by today's 54% rise in energy prices. They say the worst hit local authority areas include:  Meanwhile families living in Chancellor Rishi Sunakâs area of Richmondshire face an average energy price hike of Â£836 - the sixth highest in England. In the South East, the worst hit areas are Mole Valley (Â£767), Sevenoaks (Â£757) and Rother (Â£741). Nick JohnsonBBC News Let's get more reaction to today's warning of rising energy bills: Louise from Leicester has been telling us how she is already working out how she will use her heating during the day. Louise is part of a large family in a house with five
children. She says the rise in energy prices is going to make an already precarious situation even worse. âWeâre thinking of turning the heating on for a couple of hours in the morning and a couple of hours in the evening. So long as my grandson goes to bed warm, thatâs the most important thing.â She adds, ""weâre going to have cut back even further on foodâ and thinks âbulk cooking is going to have become something we rely upon
even moreâ. It's not just energy prices - people are being hit by rising costs in many other areas. Inflation is at its highest level for 30 years,having risen to 5.4% in the 12 months to December. Over the last year, we've seen vehicle prices go up by more than 13%, while public transport users were hit with a near 6% rise in fares. Food and clothing costs have also risen by some 4.5% over the last year. Want to escape it all with a holiday? Package deals have gone up 2.6% over the last 12 months. BBC Radio 5 Live We've been speaking to lots of people today, to find out how the energy bill price cap rise will affect them. Sue lives near Newtown in Powys and has health issues which prevent her from working. She tellsRadio 5 Livea charity has been helping feed her 10-year-old dog Dylan. ""He's a big dog with a big food bill and big vet's bill,"" she says. ""His total food bill is just shy of Â£60 a month."" ""He's my best friend and I'd be lost without him. If it was a choice between going hungry myself or not feeding Dylan, I'd feed him."" Money worries have affected Sue, with her regularly skipping two or three meals a week and avoiding turning on lights and heating in her house. ""I worry about it,"" she says. ""It's the knock on effect with my own personal mental health, worrying about the way the economic climate is going."" If you missed the chancellor's press conference on the big increases in energy bills, these were the key bits: A bit more from Labour's Nick Thomas Symonds, who says the government should have offered something more ""ambitious"" at a time when companies like Shell announced a ""momentous year"" after making $20bn in profits. He says there should be a windfall tax on profits from North Sea oil and gas to fund greater support, with Â£600 off energy bills for households that need it. Instead the government is offering a ""buy now, pay later"" scheme and giving with one hand then taking back with the other, he says. He adds that Labour would offer a long-term plan of investment in the energy sector, with Â£28bn each year for things such as insulation and renewable energy. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak on Munira Mirza resignation over PM's Savile comments During the press conference, which was intended to focus on the cost of living, the chancellor was asked several times aboutthe prime minister's debunked claimthat Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute serial sex offender Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions. One of Boris Johnson's closest aides, Munira Mirza, has resigned saying the PM should have apologised for the misleading remarks. The prime minister has since clarified the comments he made in the Commons earlier this week. He said today he had not been talking about Sir Keir's ""personal record"" when he was Director of Public Prosecutions, adding: ""I totally understand that he had nothing to do personally with those decisions. ""I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole."" So we've heard from the chancellor. Here's a take from Martin Lewis, the money saving expert who millions trust for financial advice. He warns the Â£200 rebate on energy bills in October could leave consumers worse off. ""The issue is that it is a loan and it needs repaying at Â£40 a year,"" he says. ""In effect the Chancellor has created the equivalent of a giant UK-wide energy direct debit, trying to spread the hit of a high-cost period and repay once things return to normal."" But the problem is thereâs no guarantee things will return to normal, Lewis says. ""This âwinterâ could last for years, and if that happens, an extra Â£40 on future bills will be a very high price to pay."" Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds is giving his reaction, calling the package of measures from the chancellor ""underwhelming"". He says: ""We have a chancellor who just doesnât grasp the scale of the
cost of living crisis due to his decisions."" Thomas-Symonds points to cuts to Universal Credit, rising inflation and the rise in National Insurance which is coming. He acknowledges that energy costs are going up due to global pressures, as Sunak said several times, but argues the government's energy policy has made things worse. The chancellor was also asked whether loans to energy companies to offer people a rebate on their bills that will be paid back down the line was a bail-out? ""In no way shape or form is this a bailout of energy companies,"" he responded. ""This is help to families."" He added: ""When youâre faced with a shock of this magnitude the
sensible thing for governments to do is not to pretend it doesnât exist but to
help ease the burden of it by spreading it over some years."" In that news conference, Rishi Sunak was asked if there was a point when he would step in - as a Conservative chancellor - and say people are paying too much tax. He said his mission over the remainder of this Parliament was still to cut people's taxes - and that he felt confident he could still do it. But - defending what he was doing at the moment, with a rise in National Insurance looming - he said we'd been through a once-in-a-300-year economic shock, with borrowing at the highest level since the Second World War. The press conference is now over - but we'll bring you a few more interesting things he said, as well as some reaction. The chancellor is asked about issues with people on low incomes who happen to live in properties valued 30 years ago in a higher tax band. Does he accept that it's poorly targeted as a way to support people? Sunak says he accepts that no system could be ""perfectly targeted"", but he says there is a discretionary fund of Â£150m for councils to support people in this situation. He says there are about 300,000 people living on benefits who live in houses that are rated about council tax band D, so wouldn't automatically get the Â£150 discount. But he defends using the council tax system, saying it has the advantage of working on a household basis, as energy bills do, and being quick. ""People will feel that Â£150 in April and thatâs really good,"" he says. Sunak says he still thinks it's the right thing to do. He says the country is faced with a situation where NHS backlogs are growing to unacceptable levels as a result of Covid. Everyone wants to see action on that, he says. It will get to a point where almost every family will have a someone on a waiting list and ""that's something we didn't want to see happen"". At the same time the government wanted to ""grapple"" with the challenges of fixing social care. Both are big challenges and require serious amounts of funding, he says. Rishi Sunak keeps getting asked about this, but he doesn't want to say any more. He does say though that Munira Mirza, a close adviser to the PM who has just resigned over it, was a ""valued colleague and brought a lot to the job and I'll miss working with her"". Sunak says everyone is feeling the pinch and the government wants to make sure the support provided goes to all families. The Â£150 council tax discount for households in bands A to D will benefit families in the middle too, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK approves fifth Covid-19 vaccine,"The UK has approved a fifth Covid-19 vaccine, developed by US company Novavax, which offers up to 89% protection against Covid illness. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has said it is safe as a first and second dose in adults. Millions of doses are being manufactured at a plant on Teesside. Health Secretary Sajid Javid says independent scientists on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation will now consider its use. The vaccine could then be used immediately as part of the UK vaccination programme. ""It's a testament to the country's first-rate research and development capabilities for vaccines,"" Mr Javid said, ""with tens of thousands of people taking part in clinical trials here in the UK, contributing to the invaluable research that shows our vaccines are safe and effective."" How do I book my Covid jab Novavax said it still sees a role for the jab in reaching the 16% of over-12s in the UK who have not yet had two doses. It plans to apply for extra authorisation for use in children ""in the next few weeks"", and to submit data for use as a booster jab, either immediately or as a possible fourth dose this autumn. The Novavax product - known by the brand name Nuvaxovid - was shown tobe 89% effective against catching symptomatic Covid-19in clinical trials. The original research was conducted against both the earlier Wuhan and Alpha variants of the virus. Politicians - including then Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi, Communities Minister Kemi Badenoch (pictured) and Labour MP Naz Shah - were among volunteers in the UK part of the Novavax trial In December, Novavax said two doses were also effective in generating an immune response against the now dominant Omicron variant, first identified in South Africa. The company has also started working on a version specific to Omicron. MHRA chief executive Dr June Raine, said: ""Our approval of Nuvaxovid follows a rigorous review of the safety, quality and effectiveness of this vaccine, and expert advice from the government's independent scientific advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines."" The jab, a protein adjuvant vaccine, is based on technology used for decades to protect people from diseases such as hepatitis and shingles. It delivers copies of the spike protein on the surface of the virus directly into a person's cells, stimulating the immune system to produce antibodies and T-cells. An extra ingredient, an adjuvant, then helps boost the immune response. Scientists say this approach makes it simpler to produce than some other vaccines and means it can be stored in a refrigerator. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, who chairs the independent Commission on Human Medicines, said: ""Nuvaxovid is distinct from other Covid-19 vaccines currently in use in the UK as it uses recombinant protein-based technology which has been used for many years in the development of vaccines to prevent other illnesses, for example hepatitis B."" In August 2020, the government agreed to buy 60 million doses of the jab. If it is recommended for use by the JCVI, then doses are initially likely to come from the Serum institute in India. A factory in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, has also been producing a key ingredient of the jab since February 2021, with a second site in nearby Barnard Castle expected to provide the fill-finish capacity - putting the vaccine into vials and packaging. But setbacks to the approval process around the world have led to concerns about jobs in the area. Novavax had to delay its submission to US regulators multiple times because of development and manufacturing setbacks. It was eventually filed on Monday.

Mr Givan's resignation automatically means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, also loses her position. Sinn FÃ©in has called for an early assembly election as a result. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. DUP minister Edwin Poots ordered officials on Wednesday to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain, butthose checks were continuing on Thursday. It is understood those checks will continue until at least Monday afternoon, according to a solicitor for the Department of Agriculture addressing High Court proceedings on Thursday. Mr Givan said the power-sharing institutions were being tested once again. ""The delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew's Agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Mr Givan said. Paul Givan says the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland were being tested Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. LIVE: NI first minister's resignation sparks political crisis Paul Givan's political career Stormont in crisis - what happens now? Givan resignation: Reaction in quotes Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. It is understood other ministers will remain in place to run their respective departments. However the move will prevent the Northern Ireland Executive from functioning properly. The executive will not be able to meet as it is chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. Other ministers can remain in post, but they cannot take any new decisions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. ""I will remain in post, but the task of rebuilding our health service has been made all the more difficult,"" he said. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Read more:Analysis: A fresh political crisis In a press conference on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the DUP's actions have consequences and called for an early election. ""We cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a functioning executive and Sinn FÃ©in will not facilitate this,"" Ms McDonald said. ""In the absence of a functioning executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say. This video can not be played 'Stormont 'cannot limp on forever' ""We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre."" Ms O'Neill said the actions of the DUP were an ""act of harm towards wider society here"". ""We had huge opportunity here in prioritising the health budget and the DUP for their own selfish interests have walked away from all of that today and left such collateral damage behind them in terms of the wider community impact,"" she said. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson accused the UK government of not protecting ""Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market"". ""This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early 2020 and have participated in the political institutions since then,"" he said. ""I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's position in it."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the UK government has not honoured its commitments to Northern Ireland Alex Maskey, Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, has addressed a letter to all assembly members (MLAs), in which he explained the offices of the first and deputy first ministers were now ""vacant"". ""Therefore, the offices will have to be filled before 12.01am on Friday 11 February,"" he said. Mr Maskey also said he was aware thatlegislation due to be completed at Westminster next weekmay leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". We knew today was coming, now we must assess what it means. Paul Givan's resignation as first minster sets in train a series of events. Once he goes, it means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill loses her post. They can not continue without each other. That means that the executive can not meet. Other minsters can stay in charge of their departments, but they will be limited in what decisions they can take. Crucially, if the executive can not meet, it won't be able to approve a budget. So where does this place the long term future of power-sharing? An assembly election was due to take place on 5 May, but today's resignation has changed the atmosphere, and the political dynamic at Stormont. The chance of an early election has just increased. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments,"" adding that ""this is a very damaging move"". ""It is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the Executive is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly now as we emerge from the Covid pandemic,"" his spokesperson added. ""The protocol is part of an international treaty agreed and ratified by the UK and EU, to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. ""I would urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the decision by the DUP to withdraw from the executive was ""extremely disappointing"". ""I urge them to reinstate the first minister immediately to ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, seen here earlier this month, met virtually on Thursday Mr Å efÄoviÄ said it was essential that checks on goods entering Northern Ireland continues, and said the directive from Mr Poots to halt checks had been ""very unhelpful"". ""It creates uncertainty and unpredictability for the people and businesses in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""These checks are necessary for Northern Ireland to benefit from access to the EU's Single Market for goods."" Ms Truss said urgent progress was needed and her priority was peace and stability in Northern Ireland. The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdrawn DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks. The DUP is the biggest party in Stormont and so they are entitled to hold the first minister's post. Mr Givan was appointed first minister just over eight months ago in June 2021, during a turbulent period for the DUP, in which the party had three different leaders within a matter of weeks. He was nominated for the top job by his close ally Mr Poots, during the latter's short tenure as DUP leader. Paul Givan previously served as a special adviser to Edwin Poots and became his choice as first minister However, Mr Poots faced an internal revolt within days of taking control of the DUP andhe resigned the party leadership last June, after just 21 days in the job. Mr Poots was replaced as DUP leader by Sir Jeffrey, who allowed Mr Givan to continue as first minister. Nevertheless,since his first week in the job, Mr Givan's position as leader at Stormont has constantly been in doubt. There has been condemnation of the DUP's decision to withdraw from the executive by most of the other main assembly parties. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the people of Northern Ireland would ""suffer"" as a result of the move. ""If there's agreement reached, it's not going be because a first minister's resigned,"" he said. ""Agreement reached is because people are going to be talking and working to come up with solutions."" The move was described as ""obvious"" and ""coming for months"", by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. ""This is a stunt, it's nothing to do with the protocol, it's nothing to do with the concerns of real people out there,"" he said. ""It's an absolute betrayal of ordinary people and it won't work, in my view."" The budget implications were raised by Alliance leader Naomi Long, who said the DUP's decision was ""reprehensible and inexcusable"" and did not take into consideration vital programmes which need funding from a new budget. ""Instead the DUP decide to play a cynical and calculated game of risk with the lives and the livelihoods of the people in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The TUV leader Jim Allister said it was ""about time"" the first minister stood down, in opposition to the protocol. ""We have long said that if the price of Stormont is the implementation of the protocol that it was a price no unionist should pay, or ever should have paid,"" he said.

A simple guide to the Brexit border problem,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

LiveLiveNI first minister's resignation sparks crisis7 minutes ago,"Paul Givan quit as first minister of Northern Ireland The move triggered the resignation of Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill due to the power-sharing nature of the assembly Sinn FÃ©in called for assembly elections to be brought forward from May Mr Givan was appointed first minister in June 2021 when Edwin Poots was DUP leader DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson first threatened to withdraw Mr Givan as first minister in September 2021 Paul Lawlor, Chris Andrews, Judith Cummings and Luke Sproule A day can be a long time in Northern Ireland politics. At 00:01 this morning, an order to halt checks on goods entering Northern Ireland via the Irish Sea came into effect as part of the DUP's ongoing oppositon to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Friday will begin without a first or deputy first minister in post at Stormont. What it means for legislation and the possibility of an early election remains to be seen. Thank you for joining today's live coverage, with much more to follow on the BBC News NI website throughout the night. Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie described the resignation of the first minister as a ""manufactured crisis"" that will lead to the ""instability of Northern Ireland"". This video can not be played Beattie reacts to Stormont crisis Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent The BBC understands that the first and deputy first
ministers are expected to sign off the appointment of a victims commissioner
later. It had been at risk of not being signed off because of
Paul Givanâs resignation from office. But a Stormont source said the decision was due to be one
of their final acts in office before both are no longer in post. The DUP has taken its decision because it has lost a unionist majority electorally and are ""not getting their own way"", Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill tells BBC Newsline. ""This is reckless by all measures, it is absolutely reckless for wider society,"" the outgoing deputy first minister says. ""I wanted to stand up on 11 March and make an apology to the victims of historical institutional abuse."" ""The DUP have taken that away from those victims,"" she continues. ""That is hugely damaging to those victims who have been failed at every turn."" Ms O'Neill, who loses her position along with Paul Givan, effective from midnight, says she wants to meet party leaders on Friday to discuss fast-tracking legislation ""to protect the progress that has been made"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has ""poisoned politics"" over the past two years, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons tells BBC Newsline. The DUP MLA says he has a list ""as long as my arm"" of businesses which have expressed concern about issues they face. ""The protocol is not working for everybody right now and it's causing problems for businesses and consumers and that is the boil that needs to be lanced,"" the minister continues. BBC News NI political editor Enda McClafferty interviews Gordon Lyons Mr Lyons says the government needs to deliver ""on what they promised"" in dealings with the EU. ""The Belfast Agreement has been torn up,"" he adds, explaining that many unionists believe their concerns are being ignored. Asked if the DUP wanted an early election, Mr Lyons says that is up to the Northern Ireland secretary, but ""we want to go to the electorate and say enough is enough"". Still hungry for more after a day which saw the resignation of the first minister and the descent of Northern Ireland into another political crisis? If so, you're in luck, The View will be live on BBC One NI from 10:35 GMT with live reaction and analysis.  This video can not be played Donaldson sorry abuse survivors yet to receive apology Speaker Alex Maskey says he will ask for a sitting of the assembly on or before 10 February to provide an opportunity for the first and deputy first minister positions to be filled. In a letter to MLAs, he writes there is ""much commentary"" around legislation which is being considered at Westminster which could allow the assembly to function for longer after the first and deputy first minister resign. At present, Paul Givan's resignation triggers a seven-day process to re-nominate. A failure to do so will leave it up to the Northern Ireland secretary to call an election. Mr Maskey says he has to work with the ""legal position which exists now"" and the vacancies are a ""serious matter for the assembly"". He continues: ""I appreciate that these matters will be a cause for concern and that all members will wish to see these issues resolved as quickly as possible. I will update the assembly as necessary."" The Irish government has taken a ""partisan"" stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has claimed. ""It is for the Irish government to explain to the people of Northern Ireland why they are continuing to ignore the concerns of unionists,"" he tells reporters. ""Why they have abandoned the principle of consensus, why they no longer take the view that significant matters that affect the future of Northern Ireland should have the consent of both unionists and nationalists."" The DUP leader's comments follow Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saying he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments"" at Stormont and his belief the DUP's action was a ""very damaging move"". Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey Donaldon's decision to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister was the ""wrong decision"". ""I don't think it will work in the long term,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""This is 3 February and we've had our first minister resign, on 3 March we will have no first minister and the protocol is likely still to be here, and every month after that."" Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey made the ""wrong decision"". Asked if the resignation might give the UK government leverage reach a fresh agreement with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol, he said: ""An agreement is reached not because a first minister has resigned. ""An agreement reached is going to be because people are working and talking to come up with a solution, and there are solutions there"".  BBC News NI health correspondent Marie-Louise Connolly has the latest from the British Medical Association, which says another political crisis is ""the last thing we need"" and a blow to the morale of healthcare staff.

How will Paul Givan handle the top job?,"Paul Givan first entered politics as a part-time assistant for Edwin Poots - now he has been announced as first minister by his friend and colleague Paul Givan has already boldly gone where no DUP first minister has ever gone before. He's been to a Sinn FÃ©in Ard Fheis (annual conference). The year was 2008. His friend, Edwin Poots, had just been sacked as minister for culture arts and leisure, and so Mr Givan lost his job as special adviser. He went to work for a trade organisation and ended up on one of the many stands at Sinn FÃ©in's annual conference at the RDS in Dublin. It was an unlikely place for a rising politician from the DUP's right wing to find himself. And it never happened again. He was co-opted in 2010 as an MLA for the Lagan Valley constituency, replacing the local MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Now he finds himselfon the verge of taking Stormont's top job, once more at the behest of his friend and colleague Edwin Poots. And once again he will find himself at close quarters with Sinn FÃ©in - with potentially much bigger consequences. Paul Givan has said his first contact with politics was working as a part-time assistant in Mr Poots' constituency and Stormont offices. He became involved in the DUP after listening to an Ian Paisley speech at an anti-Agreement rally in Kilkeel, County Down. He's been associated with the so-called Paisley wing of the party ever since. LIVE - DUP announces ministerial line-up DUP members 'bruised' after leadership election Paul Givan announced as new NI first minister But it was his appointment as minister for communities in May 2016 that really catapulted Paul Givan into the public eye. A keen soccer player, when Paul Givan visited a GAA club in 2016 it was the first time the sports minister had kicked a Gaelic football Hefamously visited a Lisburn GAA clubwhere the keen soccer player swapped codes to score a point for the cameras. It brought him some cross-community kudos - unlike his next big move -the highly controversial decision to cut funding for a small Irish language bursary scheme called Liofa in December 2016, during the crisis over the botched RHI scheme. The email informing employees of the decision was signed off ""Happy Christmas and Happy New Year"". It earned him thelabel ""ignoramus"" from Gerry Adamsand is said by some to have been the final straw which helped to bring down Stormont in early 2017. Paul Givan soon reversed the decision but it was too late. Martin McGuinness resigned- he probably would have done so anyway - and devolution was suspended for three years. Edwin Poots, NI's Agriculture Minister, replaced Arlene Foster as DUP leader amid tensions within the party Paul Givan has a strongly socially conservative streak in common with his new party leader. In March, he brought forward a Private Members Bill whichseeks to amend the law in Northern Ireland to prevent abortions in cases of non-fatal disabilities,including Down's Syndrome. The prospect of having to drop the bill should he be offered a ministerial post is said to have made him think twice. But it's thought there's a precedent for allowing the bill to proceed, even if it might have to be transferred to another MLA's name. There's no doubt his role as first minister will be a daunting challenge. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some believe that before Mr Givan's election can be confirmed, Sinn FÃ©in - which can block the appointment - will seek guarantees on some of the things promised in theNew Decade, New Approach dealespecially Irish language legislation. Prof Jon Tonge, of Liverpool University, said Mr Givan's ""room to manoeuvre is very limited"". ""He can't really renege on plans to introduce Irish language provisions because there's always the risk that Sinn FÃ©in would walk away from the institutions and trigger an early election,"" he said. ""The risk for Paul Givan is that he has the shortest first ministership in Northern Ireland's political history. ""Basically he will have to tango with Michelle O'Neill here if he's going to survive in office until the next assembly election."" If the polls are to be believed the DUP is highly unlikely to emerge as the largest party after that election, whenever it takes place. Paul Givan can't afford to worry about any of that right now. First he has to actually become the first minister, providing Sinn FÃ©in agrees to nominate a deputy first minister. Some, like his DUP councillor father Alan Givan, worry the role of first minister may have come too soon for Paul Givan's ""young shoulders"". And if that happens he can at least say that, at 39, he was the youngest first minister - however long he lasts in office.

This video can not be played Beattie reacts to Stormont crisis Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent The BBC understands that the first and deputy first
ministers are expected to sign off the appointment of a victims commissioner
later. It had been at risk of not being signed off because of
Paul Givanâs resignation from office. But a Stormont source said the decision was due to be one
of their final acts in office before both are no longer in post. The DUP has taken its decision because it has lost a unionist majority electorally and are ""not getting their own way"", Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill tells BBC Newsline. ""This is reckless by all measures, it is absolutely reckless for wider society,"" the outgoing deputy first minister says. ""I wanted to stand up on 11 March and make an apology to the victims of historical institutional abuse."" ""The DUP have taken that away from those victims,"" she continues. ""That is hugely damaging to those victims who have been failed at every turn.""

The Northern Ireland Protocol has ""poisoned politics"" over the past two years, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons tells BBC Newsline. The DUP MLA says he has a list ""as long as my arm"" of businesses which have expressed concern about issues they face. ""The protocol is not working for everybody right now and it's causing problems for businesses and consumers and that is the boil that needs to be lanced,"" the minister continues. BBC News NI political editor Enda McClafferty interviews Gordon Lyons Mr Lyons says the government needs to deliver ""on what they promised"" in dealings with the EU. ""The Belfast Agreement has been torn up,"" he adds, explaining that many unionists believe their concerns are being ignored. Asked if the DUP wanted an early election, Mr Lyons says that is up to the Northern Ireland secretary, but ""we want to go to the electorate and say enough is enough"".

This video can not be played Donaldson sorry abuse survivors yet to receive apology Speaker Alex Maskey says he will ask for a sitting of the assembly on or before 10 February to provide an opportunity for the first and deputy first minister positions to be filled. In a letter to MLAs, he writes there is ""much commentary"" around legislation which is being considered at Westminster which could allow the assembly to function for longer after the first and deputy first minister resign. At present, Paul Givan's resignation triggers a seven-day process to re-nominate. A failure to do so will leave it up to the Northern Ireland secretary to call an election. Mr Maskey says he has to work with the ""legal position which exists now"" and the vacancies are a ""serious matter for the assembly"". He continues: ""I appreciate that these matters will be a cause for concern and that all members will wish to see these issues resolved as quickly as possible. I will update the assembly as necessary."" The Irish government has taken a ""partisan"" stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has claimed. ""It is for the Irish government to explain to the people of Northern Ireland why they are continuing to ignore the concerns of unionists,"" he tells reporters. ""Why they have abandoned the principle of consensus, why they no longer take the view that significant matters that affect the future of Northern Ireland should have the consent of both unionists and nationalists."" The DUP leader's comments follow Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saying he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments"" at Stormont and his belief the DUP's action was a ""very damaging move"". Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey Donaldon's decision to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister was the ""wrong decision"". ""I don't think it will work in the long term,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""This is 3 February and we've had our first minister resign, on 3 March we will have no first minister and the protocol is likely still to be here, and every month after that."" Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey made the ""wrong decision"". Asked if the resignation might give the UK government leverage reach a fresh agreement with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol, he said: ""An agreement is reached not because a first minister has resigned. ""An agreement reached is going to be because people are working and talking to come up with a solution, and there are solutions there"".

Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie described the resignation of the first minister as a ""manufactured crisis"" that will lead to the ""instability of Northern Ireland"". This video can not be played Beattie reacts to Stormont crisis Jayne McCormackBBC News NI political correspondent The BBC understands that the first and deputy first
ministers are expected to sign off the appointment of a victims commissioner
later. It had been at risk of not being signed off because of
Paul Givanâs resignation from office. But a Stormont source said the decision was due to be one
of their final acts in office before both are no longer in post. The DUP has taken its decision because it has lost a unionist majority electorally and are ""not getting their own way"", Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill tells BBC Newsline. ""This is reckless by all measures, it is absolutely reckless for wider society,"" the outgoing deputy first minister says. ""I wanted to stand up on 11 March and make an apology to the victims of historical institutional abuse."" ""The DUP have taken that away from those victims,"" she continues. ""That is hugely damaging to those victims who have been failed at every turn."" Ms O'Neill, who loses her position along with Paul Givan, effective from midnight, says she wants to meet party leaders on Friday to discuss fast-tracking legislation ""to protect the progress that has been made"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has ""poisoned politics"" over the past two years, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons tells BBC Newsline. The DUP MLA says he has a list ""as long as my arm"" of businesses which have expressed concern about issues they face. ""The protocol is not working for everybody right now and it's causing problems for businesses and consumers and that is the boil that needs to be lanced,"" the minister continues. BBC News NI political editor Enda McClafferty interviews Gordon Lyons Mr Lyons says the government needs to deliver ""on what they promised"" in dealings with the EU. ""The Belfast Agreement has been torn up,"" he adds, explaining that many unionists believe their concerns are being ignored. Asked if the DUP wanted an early election, Mr Lyons says that is up to the Northern Ireland secretary, but ""we want to go to the electorate and say enough is enough"". Still hungry for more after a day which saw the resignation of the first minister and the descent of Northern Ireland into another political crisis? If so, you're in luck, The View will be live on BBC One NI from 10:35 GMT with live reaction and analysis.  This video can not be played Donaldson sorry abuse survivors yet to receive apology Speaker Alex Maskey says he will ask for a sitting of the assembly on or before 10 February to provide an opportunity for the first and deputy first minister positions to be filled. In a letter to MLAs, he writes there is ""much commentary"" around legislation which is being considered at Westminster which could allow the assembly to function for longer after the first and deputy first minister resign. At present, Paul Givan's resignation triggers a seven-day process to re-nominate. A failure to do so will leave it up to the Northern Ireland secretary to call an election. Mr Maskey says he has to work with the ""legal position which exists now"" and the vacancies are a ""serious matter for the assembly"". He continues: ""I appreciate that these matters will be a cause for concern and that all members will wish to see these issues resolved as quickly as possible. I will update the assembly as necessary."" The Irish government has taken a ""partisan"" stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has claimed. ""It is for the Irish government to explain to the people of Northern Ireland why they are continuing to ignore the concerns of unionists,"" he tells reporters. ""Why they have abandoned the principle of consensus, why they no longer take the view that significant matters that affect the future of Northern Ireland should have the consent of both unionists and nationalists."" The DUP leader's comments follow Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saying he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments"" at Stormont and his belief the DUP's action was a ""very damaging move"". Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey Donaldon's decision to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister was the ""wrong decision"". ""I don't think it will work in the long term,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""This is 3 February and we've had our first minister resign, on 3 March we will have no first minister and the protocol is likely still to be here, and every month after that."" Doug Beattie has said Sir Jeffrey made the ""wrong decision"". Asked if the resignation might give the UK government leverage reach a fresh agreement with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol, he said: ""An agreement is reached not because a first minister has resigned. ""An agreement reached is going to be because people are working and talking to come up with a solution, and there are solutions there"".

While Robin Swann has attempted to tackle much of what was in his to-do box, due to the pandemic many issues remain unresolved. For instance, hospital waiting lists, which continue to soar. When the NI Executive was resuscitated in January 2020 the lists had increased to over 308,000. Now they are in excess of 350,000 and rising. The system needs to operate within a stable structure - not one thatâs in political limbo. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he is sorry that victims of historical institutional abuse have yet to receive an official apology. The statement was expected to be made by Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers on 11 March. ""We have supported them throughout their case, we supported them in getting a scheme that provided them with support, much needed and overdue support,"" the DUP leader continues. ""I am determined to ensure that apology is forthcoming.""

""Collectively, unionists need to see Northern Irelandâs place in the United Kingdom restored, with unfettered access for all goods moving within the UKâs internal marketâ as well as the removal of the powers of foreign courts and legislatures in the affairs of Northern Ireland.""

NI First Minister Paul Givan 'intends to resign',"This video can not be played Paul Givan says being first minister has been the ""privilege of my life"" Paul Givan has announced his resignation as first minister of Northern Ireland, effective from midnight. The move is part of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protest against theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Mr Givan's resignation automatically means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, also loses her position. Sinn FÃ©in has called for an early assembly election as a result. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. DUP minister Edwin Poots ordered officials on Wednesday to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain, butthose checks were continuing on Thursday. It is understood those checks will continue until at least Monday afternoon, according to a solicitor for the Department of Agriculture addressing High Court proceedings on Thursday. Mr Givan said the power-sharing institutions were being tested once again. ""The delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew's Agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Mr Givan said. Paul Givan says the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland were being tested Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. LIVE: NI first minister's resignation sparks political crisis Paul Givan's political career Stormont in crisis - what happens now? Givan resignation: Reaction in quotes Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. It is understood other ministers will remain in place to run their respective departments. However the move will prevent the Northern Ireland Executive from functioning properly. The executive will not be able to meet as it is chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. Other ministers can remain in post, but they cannot take any new decisions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. ""I will remain in post, but the task of rebuilding our health service has been made all the more difficult,"" he said. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Read more:Analysis: A fresh political crisis In a press conference on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the DUP's actions have consequences and called for an early election. ""We cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a functioning executive and Sinn FÃ©in will not facilitate this,"" Ms McDonald said. ""In the absence of a functioning executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say. This video can not be played 'Stormont 'cannot limp on forever' ""We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre."" Ms O'Neill said the actions of the DUP were an ""act of harm towards wider society here"". ""We had huge opportunity here in prioritising the health budget and the DUP for their own selfish interests have walked away from all of that today and left such collateral damage behind them in terms of the wider community impact,"" she said. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson accused the UK government of not protecting ""Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market"". ""This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early 2020 and have participated in the political institutions since then,"" he said. ""I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's position in it."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the UK government has not honoured its commitments to Northern Ireland Alex Maskey, Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, has addressed a letter to all assembly members (MLAs), in which he explained the offices of the first and deputy first ministers were now ""vacant"". ""Therefore, the offices will have to be filled before 12.01am on Friday 11 February,"" he said. Mr Maskey also said he was aware thatlegislation due to be completed at Westminster next weekmay leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". We knew today was coming, now we must assess what it means. Paul Givan's resignation as first minster sets in train a series of events. Once he goes, it means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill loses her post. They can not continue without each other. That means that the executive can not meet. Other minsters can stay in charge of their departments, but they will be limited in what decisions they can take. Crucially, if the executive can not meet, it won't be able to approve a budget. So where does this place the long term future of power-sharing? An assembly election was due to take place on 5 May, but today's resignation has changed the atmosphere, and the political dynamic at Stormont. The chance of an early election has just increased. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments,"" adding that ""this is a very damaging move"". ""It is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the Executive is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly now as we emerge from the Covid pandemic,"" his spokesperson added. ""The protocol is part of an international treaty agreed and ratified by the UK and EU, to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. ""I would urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the decision by the DUP to withdraw from the executive was ""extremely disappointing"". ""I urge them to reinstate the first minister immediately to ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, seen here earlier this month, met virtually on Thursday Mr Å efÄoviÄ said it was essential that checks on goods entering Northern Ireland continues, and said the directive from Mr Poots to halt checks had been ""very unhelpful"". ""It creates uncertainty and unpredictability for the people and businesses in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""These checks are necessary for Northern Ireland to benefit from access to the EU's Single Market for goods."" Ms Truss said urgent progress was needed and her priority was peace and stability in Northern Ireland. The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdrawn DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks. The DUP is the biggest party in Stormont and so they are entitled to hold the first minister's post. Mr Givan was appointed first minister just over eight months ago in June 2021, during a turbulent period for the DUP, in which the party had three different leaders within a matter of weeks. He was nominated for the top job by his close ally Mr Poots, during the latter's short tenure as DUP leader. Paul Givan previously served as a special adviser to Edwin Poots and became his choice as first minister However, Mr Poots faced an internal revolt within days of taking control of the DUP andhe resigned the party leadership last June, after just 21 days in the job. Mr Poots was replaced as DUP leader by Sir Jeffrey, who allowed Mr Givan to continue as first minister. Nevertheless,since his first week in the job, Mr Givan's position as leader at Stormont has constantly been in doubt. There has been condemnation of the DUP's decision to withdraw from the executive by most of the other main assembly parties. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the people of Northern Ireland would ""suffer"" as a result of the move. ""If there's agreement reached, it's not going be because a first minister's resigned,"" he said. ""Agreement reached is because people are going to be talking and working to come up with solutions."" The move was described as ""obvious"" and ""coming for months"", by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. ""This is a stunt, it's nothing to do with the protocol, it's nothing to do with the concerns of real people out there,"" he said. ""It's an absolute betrayal of ordinary people and it won't work, in my view."" The budget implications were raised by Alliance leader Naomi Long, who said the DUP's decision was ""reprehensible and inexcusable"" and did not take into consideration vital programmes which need funding from a new budget. ""Instead the DUP decide to play a cynical and calculated game of risk with the lives and the livelihoods of the people in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The TUV leader Jim Allister said it was ""about time"" the first minister stood down, in opposition to the protocol. ""We have long said that if the price of Stormont is the implementation of the protocol that it was a price no unionist should pay, or ever should have paid,"" he said.

"Too early to know Rogan row impact, Spotify says","Spotify's boss says it is ""too early to know"" how the controversy over Joe Rogan's podcast, which averages 11m listeners an episode, has hit the firm. Musicians, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, asked for their music to be removed from the platform after criticism that the US broadcaster has helped to spread Covid misinformation. It comes as Spotify projected slower subscriber growth for this quarter. The streaming company's shares fell by more than 10% in after-hours trading. ""Usually when we've had controversies in the past, those are measured in months, not days,"" Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek told investors. ""We don't change our policies based on one creator, nor do we change based on any media cycle or calls from anyone else,"" he added. The company said revenue for the last three months of 2021 rose to 2.69bn euros (Â£2.2bn; $3bn), easily beating market expectations. However, the firm missed analysts' predictions as it forecast that it would have 183m paying subscribers this quarter. Spotify added that the outlook was ""subject to substantial uncertainty"" due to the pandemic. Four claims from Joe Rogan's podcast fact-checked Joe Rogan pledges to try harder after Spotify row This week, Spotify said it was working to add advisory warnings to any podcast discussing Covid-19. The company also made public rules which give it the power to remove or suspend users and podcasts that promote dangerous falsehoods. These are similar to those adopted by social media platforms Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Mr Ek said the advisory will direct listeners to a resource hub with facts, information from experts, and ""links to trusted sources"". ""This new effort to combat misinformation will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days,"" he said. ""To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform."" Mr Rogan also pledged to try harder to offer more balanced views on his podcast. In an almost 10-minute long Instagram video posted on Monday, he said he would ""try harder to get people with differing opinions"" on his show. Allow Twitter content?

New Zealand unveils border reopening plan,"New Zealand has announced a phased reopening of its borders, as the country starts to ease some of the world's toughest Covid restrictions. Vaccinated citizens in Australia can go home from 27 February without needing to undergo state mandatory hotel quarantine. Jabbed citizens elsewhere will be allowed in from 13 March, said PM Jacinda Ardern. People will still have to self-isolate for 10 days but can do so at home. The announcement comes after growing criticism of Wellington's controversial closed-border policy to keep out the coronavirus. New Zealand's borders have been shut for nearly two years due to the pandemic. In that period, the country of five million people has recorded 53 deaths and about 17,000 Covid cases - very low numbers compared to the rest of the world. But while the closed border policy has been popular domestically, New Zealanders overseas said it had made it near impossible to go home. The huge demand for hotel quarantine spots shut many Kiwis out. ""We have missed a lot of big life events such as weddings and funerals but more than anything just miss seeing family and friends,"" said Joe Mulcare, who lives in Singapore. ""I'm really happy that I now have the opportunity to get home but have felt a lot of frustration and confusion over New Zealand's halted approach when the rest of the world is moving on with opening up and co-existing with Covid."" The difficulties faced by stranded New Zealanders was also highlighted this week by the case of a pregnant reporter, who said she had to turn to the Taliban to ask if she could give birth in Afghanistan, after her initial request to return home was rejected. NZ to allow in pregnant reporter helped by Taliban New Zealand PM cancels wedding amid Covid spike Men caught sneaking KFC into lockdown-hit Auckland New Zealand's re-opening will be in five stages. ""Opening back up in this managed way balances inflows of travellers so people can reunite and fill our workforce shortages, while also ensuring our healthcare system can manage an increase in cases,"" Ms Ardern said in a speech in Auckland on Thursday. The prime minister said there was ""life before"" the virus but ""there will be life after Covid too"". ""We are well on our way to reaching that destination. But we are not quite there yet,"" she stressed. The key elements of the plan are as follows: Step 1:Fully vaccinated New Zealanders from Australia can return home from 27 February Step 2:Fully jabbed citizens from all other countries are able to arrive from 13 March. This also applies to a number of critical and skilled foreign workers Step 3:Up to 5,000 international students are allowed into the country from 12 April Step 4:Australians and all other visitors who can normally travel visa-free to NZ are expected to be able to travel to the country no later than July Step 5:Begins in October and includes all other visitors and students who normally require a visa Since the emergence of the Delta variant, Ms Ardern has switched from a Covid elimination strategy to pushing for higher vaccination rates and treating the virus as endemic. It is thought that about 94% of the country's population over the age of 12 is fully vaccinated and 56% of eligible people have had their boosters.

DUP issues fresh warning on Stormont's future,"Sir Jeffrey has previously threatened to withdraw DUP ministers from the executive Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said he cannot guarantee if Paul Givan will still be first minister next week. He was speaking after meeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday. Afterwards, Sir Jeffrey warned that if the government fails to take decisive action over the Northern Ireland Protocol then his party will act. He said the government is working to bring the talks with Brussels to a head by mid-February. The DUP leader did not set a deadline for movement, but explained he needs to hear what the government's plans are before then. The protocol is an element of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union's single market to ensure the free movement of goods across the Irish border. However, unionists have criticised the mechanism for having an impact on trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Sir Jeffrey haspreviously threatened to pull the DUP ministers out of the executive. Asked if First Minister Paul Givan will still be in post by next week, the DUP leader said he cannot give any guarantees until he hears what the government intends to do. ""I can't give that assurance because that depends on what others do,"" he said. Sir Jeffrey said the government must honour its commitments to ""protect Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market"" from theNew Decade, New Approach Agreement,external. ""It hasn't done that, and if it fails to do that then the basis for our participation in the devolved institutions is removed,"" he added. ""I could not have been clearer with the prime minister on where my party stands on this issue. We have been patient, we have given the government more than enough time now."" Speaking to BBC Newsline after the meeting, Mr Donaldson said he had told Mr Johnson that the situation could not go on ""indefinitely"". ""We made clear to the prime minister that it is not a sustainable position for us, as unionists, for the protocol to continue to be implemented in a way that is harming our place within the UK and prevents us operating normally within the UK internal market,"" he said. ""We will follow through on the actions we outlined as far back as September if the prime minister will not act,"" he added. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said Mr Donaldson should not make threats. ""Jeffrey has been threatening this since September and he is fast becoming the boy who cried wolf,"" he told the programme. ""We have access to the European market and the British market under the protocol. ""Are there problems with it? Yes - but they can be resolved so let the negotiators negotiate,"" he said. ""I think it's a bad mistake to threaten the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement - we will end up collapsing the institutions and Boris Johnson running the place,"" Mr Eastwood added. However, Mr Donaldson rejected his comments saying that his party had acted. ""We withdrew our ministers from the north-south ministerial council which brought the EU to the table - whatever progress has been made has been done by the DUP,"" he said. ""Of course I want to see a stable NI but this protocol is costing our businesses Â£1bn a year - we can't ignore that,"" he added. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (centre) was joined by Lord Dodds (left) and Gavin Robinson MP (right) for the Downing Street meeting The meeting with the prime minister lasted about 30 mins and the DUP leader said Mr Johnson had been fully focused on the message he delivered. This week, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Maros Å efÄoviÄsaid he was not setting ""artificial deadlines"" for a breakthrough. Further talks between the EU and the UK are expected next week. Earlier, speaking at prime minister's questions in the Commons, Boris Johnson accused the EU of implementing the Northern Ireland Protocol in an ""insane"" way. He was responding to Sir Jeffrey about efforts to re-negotiate the Irish Sea border arrangements. Mr Johnson continued: ""I never thought when we negotiated that 200 businesses would stop supplying Northern Ireland, foods are being blocked, Christmas cards are being surcharged. ""Frankly the EU is implementing this in an insane and pettifogging way and we need to sort it out."" What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Breaking|Breaking newsInterest rates rise again in bid to cool pricesBank of England increases rates for the second time in three months as the cost of living rises.Business,"Interest rates have risen for the second time in three months as the Bank of England tries to curb a rapid rise in the cost of living. The hike to 0.5% from 0.25% came as the Bank warned that price rises could speed up. Prices are expected to climb faster than pay, putting the biggest squeeze on household finances in decades. It comes as the chancellor unveiled a support package to help households cope with a 54% jump in energy bills. Rising gas and electricity costs are the main factors pushing up prices across the economy. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), is expected to peak at 7.25% in April, and average close to 6% in 2022. This would be the fastest price growth since 1991 and is well above the Bank's 2% target. Despite that, the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has suggested workers need to accept pay restraint, and should not ask for higher wages, in order for inflation to be tamed more quickly. Don't ask for a big pay rise, warns Bank boss How the interest rate rise might affect you What are interest rates and why do they matter? There are also increasing signs of broader price pressures across the economy. Prices of household appliances such as fridges climbed almost 10% over the past year. Goods shortages also meant retailers were offering fewer bargains in the January sales compared with previous years. Food prices and rents were also likely to creep up in the short term, the Bank warned. Pay increases are not expected to keep pace with rising prices. Post-tax incomes are forecast to fall 2% this year, after taking into account the rising cost of living. This represents the biggest fall in take-home pay since records began in 1990. Despite this, the Bank said there had been a ""material pick-up in pay settlements"" this year, with the average worker enjoying a 5% pay rise. ""Acute"" staff shortages in sectors such as hospitality, engineering, construction and IT also meant many employers were offering staff ""ad-hoc"" bonuses to keep them. The pandemic meant other workers had retired early, stayed in education or cut down their hours for a better work life balance. The Bank said this had created other labour shortages that could take ""many years to be resolved"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said the jobs market was ""extraordinarily tight"", adding that when he speaks to businesses up and down the UK, labour shortages are the ""first, second and third thing people want to talk about"". The Bank's decision to raise interest rates will make borrowing more expensive, potentially hitting some households harder. The Bank cannot do much to ease the energy price shock or rapid price rises in some consumer goods, so it is sticking to its job by trying to keep inflation stable, the Bank's deputy governor for monetary policy Ben Broadbent said. The rates rise coupled with soaring prices will make it more difficult for some people to afford mortgage repayments. Naomi Mellor said her and her husband were ""tightening their belts"" due to rising energy costs Naomi Mellor, a vet who lives in Hatfield with her husband, sold their house in April, but their next purchase fell through, so they're renting. She said rising mortgage rates have had a big impact on what they can afford. ""We're looking at a rise in our energy bills, a rise in our fuel bills and a rise in our mortgage repayments, which altogether is going to contribute to probably Â£200 to Â£300 a month more in our monthly bills. ""We're trying to buy a house and the rising mortgage rates have had a big impact on what we can afford and how much we're going to be repaying on a monthly basis,"" she said. The Bank's rates decision will add just over Â£25 to the typical monthly repayment for people on a tracker mortgage. Those who have a standard variable rate mortgage will pay an extra Â£15 per month on average. Nearly two million people in the UK have one of these two types of mortgage. While savers will hope for higher returns, many big banks failed to pass on the full increase in December, when interest rates were increased from a record low of 0.1%. The worst squeeze on the income of households since 1990 is what the Bank predicts. Record energy bill rises from April will take inflation to a peak of 7.25% in April, more than treble the Bank's normal target. Some have called it ""Black Thursday"" for living standards. In raising interest rates again and signalling more rate rises in the coming months, and nearly voting for even more on Thursday, the Bank is putting the nation on the couch in an exercise in mass psychology. Inflation rises can be self-fulfilling. If workers, consumers and businesses expect 7% rises to persist, they will pre-emptively put up prices and ask for wage rises that then bring this about. What the Bank is trying to do is to confine what is happening right now to being a one-off shock. To stop the inflation becoming ""ingrained"" as Bank governor Andrew Bailey put it today. There is a presentational issue here. In ordinary circumstances interest rates are raised to temper booming or bubbly growth - to take the punch bowl away from the party. But there is no punch bowl. There is no party. In fact the Bank lowered its forecasts for growth of the economy to 3.75% from 5%, even though Omicron was not as damaging as feared. The Bank's answer is that this series of rate rises will be enough to stop a spiral of inflation, but will not go so high as to kill off the recovery. It is a delicate balancing act indeed. The recent rapid rise in prices led to some members of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to call for a bigger rate rise. Four of the nine members voted to increase rates to 0.75% to ward off fears that price rises could become more sustained. The MPC voted unanimously to end new purchases as part of its Â£895bn bond buying programme to support the economy. The Bank also forecast that the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid variant will hit growth this year. The economy is forecast to stagnate in the first three months of this year, while the Bank also cut its annual growth forecast for 2022 from 5% to 3.75%. Policymakers expect the economy to grow by around 1.25% in 2023. While consumers are expected to dip into their savings to maintain living standards, this is expected to slow down later this year, weighing on growth.

Facebook sees daily users fall for first time everThe technology giant's owner Meta said platforms like TikTok were hurting its growth.BusinessComments,"Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg Social media giant Facebook has seen its daily active users (DAUs) drop for the first time in its 18-year history. Facebook's owner Meta Platforms says DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter. The firm also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rivals like TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers are also cutting spending. Meta's shares slumped by more than 20% in after-hours trading in New York. The slide in Meta's share price wiped around $200bn (Â£147.5bn) off the company's stock market value. Shares in other social media platforms, including Twitter, Snap and Pinterest, also fell sharply in extended trading. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals. Meta, which owns the world's second biggest digital advertising platform after Google, also said it had been hit by privacy changes on Apple's operating system. The changes have made it harder for brands to target and measure their advertising on Facebook and Instagram and could have an impact ""in the order of $10 billion"" for this year, according to Meta's chief financial officer Dave Wehner. Meta's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from advertising sales, rose to $33.67bn in the period, narrowly beating market predictions. It also forecast revenues of between $27bn to $29bn for the next quarter, which is lower than analysts had expected. While the company has been making its own investments in video to compete with TikTok -owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance - it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds. Facebook changes its name to Meta in major rebrand Meta monopoly case given go-ahead in US Mr Zuckerberg said he was confident the investments in video and virtual reality would pay off, as previous bets on mobile advertising and Instagram stories have. But, he noted, the firm didn't have to contend with a major rival during previous shifts in strategy. ""The teams are executing quite well and the product is growing very quickly,"" he said. ""The thing that is somewhat unique here is that TikTok is so big a competitor already and also continues to grow at quite a fast rate."" Facebook has always been a platform that grows. For every quarter in its existence the global numbers have been in one direction. Yet in the last few years, growth has stalled in Europe and US. That was masked by rises in users from the rest of the world. Facebook just isn't as popular with younger people as it was. By its own admission, TikTok is hurting business. But there are other reasons too that investors are worried about Meta. Meta changed its name because it wanted to focus on the Metaverse. But Meta is nowhere near building a Metaverse yet, it's a pipedream at the moment. Instead it is pumping billions of dollars into trying to create one - all because Mark Zuckerberg thinks there's an appetite for it - a huge risk. Perhaps the answer to Meta's immediate problems would be to buy TikTok? Well US regulators would never allow that due to anti-competition laws. And Facebook is now seen by many in Silicon Valley as a poisonous brand. It's certainly not a cool place to work in the same way it was say ten years ago. That makes attracting talent more difficult. Meta has some serious problems going forward. This milestone could be just the beginning.

Iran accused in anti-Israel fake social media plot,"The ""Aduk"" Facebook group shared a post created by a right-wing Israeli group that declared: ""Israeli democracy is in danger"" A suspected Iranian disinformation unit ran an elaborate network on Facebook targeting nationalist and ultra-religious Jews in Israel in an attempt to stoke division and inflame tensions with Palestinians, according to research shared exclusively with the BBC. The alleged foreign interference campaign ran across multiple social media platforms posing as an ultra-Orthodox Jewish news group supportive of extreme right-wing groups. Its goal was to help fuel ""religious war"" by amplifying ""fear, hatred and chaos"", according to the Israeli disinformation watchdog FakeReporter, which uncovered the group's suspected Iranian origin. It is the latest sign of a growing disinformation battleground on social media and messaging apps in Israel. The network became active after last year's flare-up in sectarian violence in the country. The administrator of ""Aduk"" set up a fake profile with the name ""Ariel Levi"", using a stolen photo of a dead Russian man In one case, the network reposted a video of a confrontation between a far-right MP, who was carrying a gun, and a Palestinian car parking attendant, adding the comment: ""It's a shame he didn't give him one in the head."" Facebook and Twitter deactivated the group's pages and associated profiles after being approached by FakeReporter. The network remains active on the messaging channel Telegram. Facebook says the accounts were part of attempts to reappear after it took down ""a small Iranian influence operation"" last March. The company sees Iran-based groups as persistent and well-resourced in trying to exploit social media platforms. The BBC approached the groups' administrator pages, asking their location and why they used copied content but they did not respond. The Iranian embassy in London did not respond to requests for comment. The ""Aduk"" - or ""strictly religious"" - group was created as a Hebrew acronym of ""Virtual religious union for the religious community"". It recirculated articles and posts supporting far-right politicians, encouraged protests and cultivated anti-government and anti-Arab sentiment. One of its profiles gathered thousands of followers. ""We see this network rise up following the events in May, when Israel was at one of the lowest points in its history in the relations between Jewish and Arab citizens,"" says FakeReporter chief executive Achiya Schatz. An Israeli security source said the online profiles had similar characteristics to Iranian activity that previously took place on the platforms. Another post shared by ""Aduk"" alleged that Naftali Bennett was ""completely controlled"" by his coalition partner, Arab Islamist politician Mansour Abbas The network went to extensive lengths to look genuine, creating a page for a fictitious bakery in an ultra-Orthodox Israeli town, and in another case stealing the online identity of an ultra-religious Jewish man from Russia who died four years ago. On learning of the fake profiles his sister told the BBC that the social media platforms should be shut down (read her story below). ""It's something that we haven't seen before, creating such a backstory,"" says Mr Schatz. ""It's another concern because these networks are becoming more and more developed, to see them connecting with such extremists and violent groups... they're very fluent in Israeli politics,"" he adds. The group repeatedly backed an ultra-nationalist Israeli MP, Itamar Ben Gvir, a follower of an outlawed, racist movement which called for the expulsion of Arabs from Israel. Other posts by the suspected Iran-based network and its administrators included: Repeatedly calling for attendance at anti-government protests in Israel, particularly those organised by the far-right A retweeted call by Mr Ben Gvir for ""targeted killings"" of Arab Israeli ""inciters"" in towns that witnessed a flare-up of sectarian violence last May Reposting pictures falsely suggesting Israel's coalition was controlled by Muslims due to the inclusion of an Islamist party in government Further encouraging anti-police sentiment among Israel's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, many of whom are distrustful of law enforcement and the state Analysts draw comparisons with previous foreign interference campaigns designed to destabilise and amplify divisions in the US and Europe. When Olga Veshueva got a message from her brother Reuven she broke into a broad smile as she clicked open the photo. It was a picture of him wearing the expensive hat he had saved for weeks to buy. He had planned to wear it proudly among friends at the Jewish religious seminary he attended in St Petersburg. But that moment in 2017 is now a tragic memory for Olga. A few days later, Reuven, still in his 20s, died suddenly of heart failure. Olga cherishes the picture - the last one of Reuven ever taken. She could not have predicted the bitter blow that would come four years later. Without the family's knowledge, the picture and others were taken from Reuven's social media profile - copied by disinformation operatives believed to be in Iran to become the online face of a man calling himself ""Ariel Levi"", the administrator of the ""Aduk"" news network. Olga Veshueva with her late brother, Reuven Nesterov Reuven's stolen identity has now appeared to thousands of Israeli social media users in posts on the group supporting extreme right-wing politicians and inflaming tensions between Jews and Arabs. Olga wept when she saw how her brother's photos had been used for the false persona on Facebook for the last eight months. ""He left his mark as a kind, gentle person. He was the greatest brother, a loving person,"" she told the BBC, speaking from her home in Kazakhstan. ""But what can I do? I have no power. All these social networks should be shut down,"" she added. Some young ultra-Orthodox Israelis may be more vulnerable to foreign interference due to low ""digital literacy"", suggests Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler of the Israel Democracy Institute think tank, who says many more are now experiencing the internet for the first time. ""This community is very conservative and doesn't have the experience of 70 years of TV,"" she says. ""Any resentfulness towards Israeli society, or far-right extremism, or anti-Arab, anti-Muslim feeling [can be exploited]. This kind of community is not prepared to cope with fake news or digital manipulation."" The ""Aduk"" network used a scattered approach to try to gain traction. Pages on some platforms were barely active and many posts gained few comments. However, the Facebook page for ""Aduk"" administrator ""Ariel Levi"" had almost 3,000 friends. There was unprecedented violence between Arabs and Jews in mixed Israeli cities and towns in May This foreign interference pattern has been seen in other countries, says Simin Kargar, a non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. She suggests Iran benefits from its opponents observing the disinformation campaigns themselves. ""Since the presidential elections in the US we've seen Iranian tactics getting more diverse, part of a broader and more complicated playbook... They see they're being noticed and feared,"" she says. Erez Kreimer, former head of the cyber division at Israel's Shin Bet domestic security agency, describes the ""Aduk"" network as ""unprofessional but efficient"", adding that Iran sees Israel as ""a prime target in its cyber efforts"". The case is the latest in a broader series of alleged interventions in Israel. Last month, security agencies made several arrests and the government warned about Iranian attempts to lure ordinary Israelis into low-level spying. Since late 2020, at least five cases have come to light of suspected Iranian interference on messaging apps to infiltrate and foster anti-government protests in Israel. Israel says Iran recruited women for spy network Israel ex-top spy reveals operations against Iran Ms Kargar at the Atlantic Council links the attempts to the Middle East's wider shadow war, pointing to the assassination of Iran's chief nuclear scientist and mysterious explosions at its nuclear facilities. Many have attributed them to Israel, but it has never acknowledged any involvement. ""For Iran, a way of getting back at Israel is doing these more subversive campaigns or cyberattacks in order to show they're not staying silent and they're also doing things to mitigate the threat,"" she says. ""But obviously at a lower cost because the bar for entry is much lower in this [cyber] space."" Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler of the Israel Democracy Institute describes this as a cheap form of foreign intervention. ""It costs more to send missiles to Lebanon than digital bytes [to Israel],"" she says. Facebook's parent company, Meta, says it is taking action against alleged Iranian foreign intervention Meanwhile, FakeReporter's researchers are calling for more robust monitoring by social media platforms. Mr Schatz says: ""We need to understand that if countries and the social networks, the big techs, won't step forward and increase security and defend the rights of users online, we are going to see more infiltration of politics and distrust between people."" Facebook's parent company, Meta, says its actions against alleged Iranian foreign intervention have ""slowed this campaign down each time and helped to keep them from rebuilding their audience on our platform"". ""Given the adversarial nature of this space and knowing that these malicious actors will always try to come back, we'll stay vigilant and take action as necessary."" A spokesman for Twitter says: ""The accounts referenced were permanently suspended for violating our platform manipulation and spam policy"". Telegram did not respond to requests for comment.

"New Zealand unveils border reopening planIt first allows fully jabbed New Zealanders in Australia to return, later expanding to other visitors.Asia","New Zealand has announced a phased reopening of its borders, as the country starts to ease some of the world's toughest Covid restrictions. Vaccinated citizens in Australia can go home from 27 February without needing to undergo state mandatory hotel quarantine. Jabbed citizens elsewhere will be allowed in from 13 March, said PM Jacinda Ardern. People will still have to self-isolate for 10 days but can do so at home. The announcement comes after growing criticism of Wellington's controversial closed-border policy to keep out the coronavirus. New Zealand's borders have been shut for nearly two years due to the pandemic. In that period, the country of five million people has recorded 53 deaths and about 17,000 Covid cases - very low numbers compared to the rest of the world. But while the closed border policy has been popular domestically, New Zealanders overseas said it had made it near impossible to go home. The huge demand for hotel quarantine spots shut many Kiwis out. ""We have missed a lot of big life events such as weddings and funerals but more than anything just miss seeing family and friends,"" said Joe Mulcare, who lives in Singapore. ""I'm really happy that I now have the opportunity to get home but have felt a lot of frustration and confusion over New Zealand's halted approach when the rest of the world is moving on with opening up and co-existing with Covid."" The difficulties faced by stranded New Zealanders was also highlighted this week by the case of a pregnant reporter, who said she had to turn to the Taliban to ask if she could give birth in Afghanistan, after her initial request to return home was rejected. NZ to allow in pregnant reporter helped by Taliban New Zealand PM cancels wedding amid Covid spike Men caught sneaking KFC into lockdown-hit Auckland New Zealand's re-opening will be in five stages. ""Opening back up in this managed way balances inflows of travellers so people can reunite and fill our workforce shortages, while also ensuring our healthcare system can manage an increase in cases,"" Ms Ardern said in a speech in Auckland on Thursday. The prime minister said there was ""life before"" the virus but ""there will be life after Covid too"". ""We are well on our way to reaching that destination. But we are not quite there yet,"" she stressed. The key elements of the plan are as follows: Step 1:Fully vaccinated New Zealanders from Australia can return home from 27 February Step 2:Fully jabbed citizens from all other countries are able to arrive from 13 March. This also applies to a number of critical and skilled foreign workers Step 3:Up to 5,000 international students are allowed into the country from 12 April Step 4:Australians and all other visitors who can normally travel visa-free to NZ are expected to be able to travel to the country no later than July Step 5:Begins in October and includes all other visitors and students who normally require a visa Since the emergence of the Delta variant, Ms Ardern has switched from a Covid elimination strategy to pushing for higher vaccination rates and treating the virus as endemic. It is thought that about 94% of the country's population over the age of 12 is fully vaccinated and 56% of eligible people have had their boosters.

The Welsh government said it will consider what to do with the cash, amid calls for the Toriesfor the rebate to be matched. Cardiff ministers announced earlier this week they would double a fuel help scheme for people on working age benefits,from Â£100 to Â£200. Shop owner Lauren Morse said rising living costs were a ""hot topic"" Ms Morse, who runs a zero-waste store, selling foods and cleaning products, said: ""No matter how much money they earn, everybody is feeling the pinch."" The harsh reality is that when the price of energy rises, that pushes up the cost of manufacturing and distribution - making products such as food more expensive. That adds to the increase in the cost of living and squeezes the money in people's pockets. The poorest households pay a larger proportion of their money on fuel and essentials, but there are arange of schemes,externalthat help people who rely on benefits, as well as help for the elderly. Pete Harrison, 64, from Prestatyn, in Denbighshire, had to stop work about seven years ago due toCOPD,external. He gets about Â£114 per week in income support and his wife earns minimum wage at a children's nursery. Rising rent and fuel and food prices have already squeezed their budget ahead of the predicted increase in fuel bills. Pete Harrison said he has already cut back his energy usage ""to the bone"" Mr Harrison said: ""It's quite frightening now with the fuel bills. ""We're at rock bottom now, there's nothing else we can do to save power anymore. We're in a bit of a quandary really."" Mr Harrison said he only turns the heating on for two hours a day, but often wears three or four layers around the house and is in bed by about 21:00 in order to stay warm. Tracey Morgan, of Splice, a charity based in Bridgend, said the situation was ""frightening"" for families she works with. ""I think people are really worried at the moment,"" she said. ""The previous increase just before Christmas affected families massively. We saw a big increase with families needing to access our baby bank, needing extra food parcels, we were issuing e-vouchers for the food bank for them. ""It's an extremely worrying time for them at the moment."" Karen Dorling is trying to grow more of her own fruit and vegetables to cut her household bills Meanwhile, one customer at Ms Morse's store, Karen Dorling, 55, from Pontypool, said she was making cut backs. ""I've got an allotment so I'm trying to reduce what I spend on fruit and veg."" Ms Dorling has a 17-year-old son in college ""so you've got the food prices, buses, he wants to go out with his friends - everything has gone up,"" she said. She goes to a craft club which costs Â£3 a week and is a church volunteer ""so I do get out a lot without having to spend any money,"" she added. Ms Morse has also had to try and absorb increasing costs at her store, Zero Waste Torfaen. She said wholesale prices for rice had increased 50% since September, shampoo is up by 25%, 11% for toilet rolls and 10% for white vinegar used for cleaning. What's the energy price cap? Why are prices rising so quickly? At home, her household utility bills leapt when her provider went bust due to increasing wholesale prices. Her husband Daniel, 35, now uses a motorbike to keep transport costs down on his commute to Bristol where he works as scientist. It is the rise in utility bills that the couple are dreading the most. Ms Morse said the couple were ""potentially looking at about Â£2,500 a year when eight months ago we were paying Â£900"". It all means a hoped-for caravan holiday with sons Ruben, nine and Oliver, six, ""won't happen this year"". ""It's going to mean less spending on non-essentials,"" said Ms Morse. This video can not be played ""People are having to make their choices as to whether they heat or eat"" Not only will rising prices affect domestic bills directly, but higher costs for businesses and inflation could see prices rise elsewhere. Tom Denman, the chief financial officer for the Principality building society, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Obviously [energy costs are] hitting households directly, but then you've got that background of hitting businesses and that is being passed on to consumers. ""There's lots of competing, unprecedented challenges that the authorities and us are trying to deal with, but ultimately it is going to be a squeeze for households."" Mr Denman said increasing interest rates to combat inflation was a ""well-trodden"" path, but for those not on fixed-rate mortgages, monthly repayments would go up alongside rising bills. Meanwhile, Dave Jones, who runs a renewable energy company in St Asaph, Denbighshire, said higher electricity costs would deter people from making more environmentally-friendly choices, such as electric cars and heat pumps in homes. He said his firm, Hafod Renewable Energy, bought three electric vans 18 months ago, but they would be more expensive to run than their diesel counterparts after the new cap is introduced. He added heat pumps could become ""unsustainable"" to run. ""We're pretty worried really, especially on the heat pump side,"" he said. ""I don't know what the price of gas and electricity is going to be in a year, so it's difficult to say what the best option is at the moment.""

"Too early to know Rogan row impact, Spotify saysShares in the streaming platform fell by more than 10% in after-hours trading.Business","Spotify's boss says it is ""too early to know"" how the controversy over Joe Rogan's podcast, which averages 11m listeners an episode, has hit the firm. Musicians, including Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, asked for their music to be removed from the platform after criticism that the US broadcaster has helped to spread Covid misinformation. It comes as Spotify projected slower subscriber growth for this quarter. The streaming company's shares fell by more than 10% in after-hours trading. ""Usually when we've had controversies in the past, those are measured in months, not days,"" Spotify's chief executive Daniel Ek told investors. ""We don't change our policies based on one creator, nor do we change based on any media cycle or calls from anyone else,"" he added. The company said revenue for the last three months of 2021 rose to 2.69bn euros (Â£2.2bn; $3bn), easily beating market expectations. However, the firm missed analysts' predictions as it forecast that it would have 183m paying subscribers this quarter. Spotify added that the outlook was ""subject to substantial uncertainty"" due to the pandemic. Four claims from Joe Rogan's podcast fact-checked Joe Rogan pledges to try harder after Spotify row This week, Spotify said it was working to add advisory warnings to any podcast discussing Covid-19. The company also made public rules which give it the power to remove or suspend users and podcasts that promote dangerous falsehoods. These are similar to those adopted by social media platforms Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Mr Ek said the advisory will direct listeners to a resource hub with facts, information from experts, and ""links to trusted sources"". ""This new effort to combat misinformation will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days,"" he said. ""To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform."" Mr Rogan also pledged to try harder to offer more balanced views on his podcast. In an almost 10-minute long Instagram video posted on Monday, he said he would ""try harder to get people with differing opinions"" on his show. Allow Twitter content?

NI First Minister Paul Givan 'intends to resign'The move is part of the Democratic Unionist Party's protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Paul Givan says being first minister has been the ""privilege of my life"" Paul Givan has announced his resignation as first minister of Northern Ireland, effective from midnight. The move is part of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protest against theNorthern Ireland Protocol. Mr Givan's resignation automatically means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, also loses her position. Sinn FÃ©in has called for an early assembly election as a result. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. DUP minister Edwin Poots ordered officials on Wednesday to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain, butthose checks were continuing on Thursday. It is understood those checks will continue until at least Monday afternoon, according to a solicitor for the Department of Agriculture addressing High Court proceedings on Thursday. Mr Givan said the power-sharing institutions were being tested once again. ""The delicate balance created by the Belfast and St Andrew's Agreements has been impacted by the agreement made by the United Kingdom and the European Union which created the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" Mr Givan said. Paul Givan says the power-sharing institutions in Northern Ireland were being tested Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. LIVE: NI first minister's resignation sparks political crisis Paul Givan's political career Stormont in crisis - what happens now? Givan resignation: Reaction in quotes Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. It is understood other ministers will remain in place to run their respective departments. However the move will prevent the Northern Ireland Executive from functioning properly. The executive will not be able to meet as it is chaired by the first and deputy first ministers. Other ministers can remain in post, but they cannot take any new decisions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. ""I will remain in post, but the task of rebuilding our health service has been made all the more difficult,"" he said. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Read more:Analysis: A fresh political crisis In a press conference on Thursday, Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the DUP's actions have consequences and called for an early election. ""We cannot stagger on in the months ahead without a functioning executive and Sinn FÃ©in will not facilitate this,"" Ms McDonald said. ""In the absence of a functioning executive, an early election must be called and the people must have their say. This video can not be played 'Stormont 'cannot limp on forever' ""We can do so much better than this chaotic theatre."" Ms O'Neill said the actions of the DUP were an ""act of harm towards wider society here"". ""We had huge opportunity here in prioritising the health budget and the DUP for their own selfish interests have walked away from all of that today and left such collateral damage behind them in terms of the wider community impact,"" she said. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson accused the UK government of not protecting ""Northern Ireland's place within the UK internal market"". ""This commitment was the basis upon which we re-entered the executive in early 2020 and have participated in the political institutions since then,"" he said. ""I warned that as leader of the DUP, I was not prepared to lend my hand to a protocol which so fundamentally undermines the union and the economic integrity of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland's position in it."" Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says the UK government has not honoured its commitments to Northern Ireland Alex Maskey, Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, has addressed a letter to all assembly members (MLAs), in which he explained the offices of the first and deputy first ministers were now ""vacant"". ""Therefore, the offices will have to be filled before 12.01am on Friday 11 February,"" he said. Mr Maskey also said he was aware thatlegislation due to be completed at Westminster next weekmay leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". We knew today was coming, now we must assess what it means. Paul Givan's resignation as first minster sets in train a series of events. Once he goes, it means Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill loses her post. They can not continue without each other. That means that the executive can not meet. Other minsters can stay in charge of their departments, but they will be limited in what decisions they can take. Crucially, if the executive can not meet, it won't be able to approve a budget. So where does this place the long term future of power-sharing? An assembly election was due to take place on 5 May, but today's resignation has changed the atmosphere, and the political dynamic at Stormont. The chance of an early election has just increased. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said that he was ""deeply concerned about the latest developments,"" adding that ""this is a very damaging move"". ""It is absolutely vital for peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland that the Executive is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland, particularly now as we emerge from the Covid pandemic,"" his spokesperson added. ""The protocol is part of an international treaty agreed and ratified by the UK and EU, to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. ""I would urge the DUP to return to full engagement with all the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement and avoid any action that could damage peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the decision by the DUP to withdraw from the executive was ""extremely disappointing"". ""I urge them to reinstate the first minister immediately to ensure the necessary delivery of public services for the citizens of Northern Ireland,"" he said. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss met the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Thursday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and the EU's chief Brexit negotiator MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, seen here earlier this month, met virtually on Thursday Mr Å efÄoviÄ said it was essential that checks on goods entering Northern Ireland continues, and said the directive from Mr Poots to halt checks had been ""very unhelpful"". ""It creates uncertainty and unpredictability for the people and businesses in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""These checks are necessary for Northern Ireland to benefit from access to the EU's Single Market for goods."" Ms Truss said urgent progress was needed and her priority was peace and stability in Northern Ireland. The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdrawn DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks. The DUP is the biggest party in Stormont and so they are entitled to hold the first minister's post. Mr Givan was appointed first minister just over eight months ago in June 2021, during a turbulent period for the DUP, in which the party had three different leaders within a matter of weeks. He was nominated for the top job by his close ally Mr Poots, during the latter's short tenure as DUP leader. Paul Givan previously served as a special adviser to Edwin Poots and became his choice as first minister However, Mr Poots faced an internal revolt within days of taking control of the DUP andhe resigned the party leadership last June, after just 21 days in the job. Mr Poots was replaced as DUP leader by Sir Jeffrey, who allowed Mr Givan to continue as first minister. Nevertheless,since his first week in the job, Mr Givan's position as leader at Stormont has constantly been in doubt. There has been condemnation of the DUP's decision to withdraw from the executive by most of the other main assembly parties. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the people of Northern Ireland would ""suffer"" as a result of the move. ""If there's agreement reached, it's not going be because a first minister's resigned,"" he said. ""Agreement reached is because people are going to be talking and working to come up with solutions."" The move was described as ""obvious"" and ""coming for months"", by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. ""This is a stunt, it's nothing to do with the protocol, it's nothing to do with the concerns of real people out there,"" he said. ""It's an absolute betrayal of ordinary people and it won't work, in my view."" The budget implications were raised by Alliance leader Naomi Long, who said the DUP's decision was ""reprehensible and inexcusable"" and did not take into consideration vital programmes which need funding from a new budget. ""Instead the DUP decide to play a cynical and calculated game of risk with the lives and the livelihoods of the people in Northern Ireland,"" she said. The TUV leader Jim Allister said it was ""about time"" the first minister stood down, in opposition to the protocol. ""We have long said that if the price of Stormont is the implementation of the protocol that it was a price no unionist should pay, or ever should have paid,"" he said.

Children in care 'seen as criminals not victims',"Children in care are treated as ""criminals rather victims"" (Picture posed by a model) Children in care are too often treated in society as criminals rather than victims, an independent body has said. Applications to build new care homes are regularly met with hostility by nearby residents, said the Independent Children's Home Association (ICHA). Chief executive Peter Sandiford urged communities to view the wellbeing of children above fears over house prices. Since 2017 the number of children's homes in England has risen by at least a quarter, to more than 2,700. Mr Sandiford said: ""I think local communities and people often think about themselves rather than valuing children's wellbeing. ""An example would be how local communities think their house prices will go down if they have a children's home in that area."" Independent Children's Home Association boss Peter Sandiford says neighbours are often 'hostile' to new homes being built Mr Sandiford said residents were often ""at the very least reluctant, if not actually hostile"" when plans for children's homes are revealed. ""For some reason they seem to believe that children who require care away from their families are criminals rather than victims, with objections to planning consents having included terms such as 'murderer' and 'rapist',"" he added. ""Children in public care have almost inevitably experienced early life trauma and, for many, ongoing trauma. ""The task of children's homes is to address the consequences of such experiences and help children achieve their true potential."" Social services initially seek to place children with foster families, but this is not always possible. The number of foster carers is not keeping up with demand. Residential homes are therefore an important part of children's social care, providing support for those who cannot live with their families. However, communities are often divided when planning applications for children's homes are submitted to their local council. This video can not be played Author and poet Lemn Sissay spoke to the BBC about his concerns about the care system. Author and poet Lemn Sissay, who grew up in the care system, spoke to the BBC about Mr Sandiford's concerns. He said: ""This is about inherent prejudice against children in care. ""Having a children's home in your area should be something people want - a sign of caring for the most vulnerable in society, a sign of kindness. ""Instead we have people falling back on unchallenged prejudice."" Lee - not his real name - is 17. He recently left residential care in the North West of England. He said: ""I think children's homes have a really bad reputation. ""There needs to be more education around what children's homes are actually like. ""There's crime and anti-social behaviour, no matter where you go. ""It doesn't make a difference whether you're in a children's home or not - it's a massive stereotype if anything."" Despite the growing demand for children's care homes, provision is not equally spread across England. More than a quarter are found in the North West, with Lancashire home to the highest number. At the other end of the scale, several London boroughs, including Lambeth and Hackney, are among nine local authorities with only one registered children's home. Per capita, Shropshire has the highest number of children's homes with roughly one for every 5,000 people. Richard Witt is one of the owners of Hopscotch Care, a company which owns seven care homes across the North West. He said his company recently had problems gaining permission to convert a residential property into a home for just two children, with objections relating to parking and anti-social behaviour. Mr Witt said: ""We've got young people who are vulnerable, who have come from some very complex backgrounds, but they're just young children. ""Children's homes don't have to be a problem."" Objections to applications for children's homes include fears regarding anti-social behaviour, reduced house prices, and that residents may be sex offenders or targeted for crime. According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service: One objector to a care home inLeicester,externalsaid the children's ""challenging behaviour probably will disrupt the current residential nature of [the road] and could pose significant risks to neighbours"". Objections to a children's home inNewcastle-upon-Tyne,externalincluded claims that the plans would harm ""residents' peace, tranquillity and health"". Plans for a children's home inSheffield,externalwere approved despite fears those living in the property would ""become entrapped by criminals, groomed and exploited"". An application for a children'shome in Derby,externalwas withdrawn after almost 100 objections were lodged Objectors toa home in Stoke,externalsaid the area was ""not a place suitable for unsupervised troubled teenagers"". Adele Warren, a Conservative councillor on Bolton Council, recently backed a campaign opposing a new children's home in the area. She said: ""At the time we already had 30 children's homes in the borough, with an additional eight to 12 that were also planned. ""When the first one came along, I actually defended that home to local residents. ""Then when there was the second and then the third; obviously that became quite concerning for local residents."" Ms Warren said that although there are ""some very good private children's homes"", there are others that are ""capitalising on shipping children that are very vulnerable across the country for placements"". Other objections to children's homes relate to the companies that own them, including large private equity groups considered to be making large profits, or those previously judged unfavourably by Ofsted. However, figures from Ofsted show that four out of five homes in 2021 and 2020 were judged as ""outstanding"" or ""good"". Mr Sandiford said: ""Children living in children's homes are the responsibility of society. ""Local politicians and national politicians have joined with local residents to fight the opening of children's homes. My belief is those leaders in society should be challenging those myths - that nimby-ism - rather than joining in."" A government spokesperson said: ""Children's homes provide places for young people who require dedicated support and care, who may be particularly vulnerable to exploitation or harm. ""Councils are responsible for ensuring sufficient places to meet those needs and we are making up to Â£19.5m of capital funding available in 2021-23 for councils to develop new homes for vulnerable young people. ""As with any planning application, where there is a change of use of a building to convert to a children's home, the community will be given an opportunity to comment.""

Four things going up in price,"Lamb lovers will have seen prices rise Everyone is braced for financial pain as the cost of living rises this year, particularly with energy bills likely to soar from April. But it is not just gas that is pushing up prices at theirfastest rate for nearly 30 years. Here are some of the less obvious items which have recorded rapid price rises, and some of the reasons behind the increases. Those families who still sit down to eat a traditional roast dinner together are having to be a little more imaginative if they are trying to keep the costs down. Prices of fresh beef rose by 8.6% from a year earlier, information from data firm Kantar shows. Fresh lamb prices were up even more steeply, rising by 10% to around Â£11 per kilogramme. Potatoes - another Sunday lunch staple - were also highlighted as a factor in pushing up December'sofficial inflation rate,external(which measures the rising cost of living), by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). In fact, food prices in general were key to the rate rising to a level not seen for three decades. Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, says that a lid had been kept on grocery prices for some time, especially at Christmas, but it is ""inevitable"" that increases are to come. Supermarkets are facing cost pressures of their own from logistics, manufacturing, farming and distribution. Problems such as driver shortages and rising energy prices will add to those pressures. ""Retailers will be having robust discussions with suppliers, but delayed costs have to flow through and be reflected in what consumers pay,"" he says. He points out that when shoppers are faced with grocery price rises of more than 3% or 4% a year, they tend to make bigger decisions, such as cutting back, seeking out promotions, or buying cheaper own-label products. The trouble is, he says, there are price rises ""in nearly every category across the supermarket shelves"" and the price gap between discount brands and others is narrower than was once the case. Richard Walker, boss of supermarket chain Iceland, says he has been seeing an ""alarming"" rise in the use of food banks. Open the bathroom cabinet and the moisturisers and cleansers you see inside may well have got more expensive recently. Prices of skincare products typically rose by 9.6% in the 12 weeks to Boxing Day compared with the same period a year earlier, data from the same Kantar survey shows. Prestige brands, in particular, went up in price even though demand fell, according to analysts. Perhaps people were a little less hung up on their Zoom face. Skincare tells a story typical of the general cost of living squeeze at the moment, in that no one single factor is causing prices to rise. Emma Fishwick says consumers are choosing cheaper brands ""The cost of shipping, packaging and raw materials are on the rise and thereby brands have little choice but to increase the price of their products to ensure that their business is sustainable,"" says Emma Fishwick, from analysts NPD. She said masks, body creams and eye treatments had recorded some of the biggest price rises towards the end of the year. Customer behaviour has been changing as a result, she says. Shoppers are increasingly choosing mid-range brands, which can be 60% cheaper than the upmarket options. ""Whilst consumers feel the squeeze, as the cost of living increases, consumers are increasingly turning to these brands as a cheaper alternative,"" she says. INFLATION:Why prices are rising so quickly PETROL:Are we paying too much at the pump? GAS PRICES:How can I protect myself from rising prices? IMPACT:'I'm so cold it feels like I'm sleeping outside' In the official figures, sofas and the like come under quite a broad category of ""furniture and household goods"". The ONS points out prices in the sector have been rising steadily since the start of 2021. That includes furniture, household appliances - including the cost of fitting them, and even garden equipment. Prices of furniture have been highlighted in official statistics The 7.4% inflation rate of this category in December was the highest since comparable data began in 1989, according to ONS calculations. Furniture prices are rising for many of the same reasons as skincare products and food. The cost of raw materials - such as wood in this case - as well as transporting them has gone up. A settee may be considered a luxury item, and one only bought new after saving up the money. A fridge, on the other hand, is a necessity for every family. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. If the price of a bottle of milk is Â£1 and it rises by 5p, then milk inflation is 5%. You may not notice price rises from month to month. But right now, prices are rising so quickly that the money people earn does not go as far. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world Statisticians at the ONS featured the effect of second-hand car prices on the inflation rate as a whole, and not for the first time. They say used-car prices grew by 28% during 2021, compared with a 7.3% increase the previous year. Issues in the new and used car market are pushing up prices The cost of manufacturing new cars has risen and has been made difficult by a global shortage of computer chips, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt. As a result fewer new vehicles have been rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market, which has pushed up prices. Added to that, the ONS says there are concerns in the trade about fewer second-hand cars being made available owing to a dearth of one-year-old cars to sell on. Delays in new car supplies have meant extensions of lease contracts and fewer part exchanges, again affecting used car availability.

"Row erupts over location of Cook's HMS EndeavourAustralian experts say a wreck off the US coast is the famous ship, a claim dismissed as ""premature"".","The Endeavour had sailed for several years around the South Pacific before famously landing in eastern Australia in 1770 The final resting place of Captain James Cook's HMB Endeavour has been found, Australian experts say - a claim their US colleagues say is ""premature"". On Thursday, the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) said a wreck in Newport Harbour, off Rhode Island in the US, had been confirmed as the ship. But the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) immediately said ""many unanswered questions"" remained. The British-built coal ship famously landed in eastern Australia in 1770. Before that, HM Bark Endeavour had sailed for several years around the South Pacific, after setting out from Plymouth in England. The vessel, then known as Lord Sandwich II, was sunk with 12 other ships off Rhode Island in August 1778 - but no-one was sure where. Captain Cook's Endeavour replica comes 'home' to Whitby Could hunt for Cook's Endeavour be over? The ANMM made its announcement in Sydney on Thursday morning. ""I am satisfied that this is the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australia's maritime history,""ANMM Director and CEO Kevin Sumption said in a statement.,external ""The last pieces of the puzzle had to be confirmed before I felt able to make this call. ""Based on archival and archaeological evidence, I'm convinced it's the Endeavour,"" Mr Sumption added. But shortly afterwards,the RIMAP, the lead team involved in the years-long research, posted a statement saying the ANMM report ""that the Endeavour has been identified is premature"".,external The RIMAP accused the ANMM of a breach of the contract between the two organisations ""for the conduct of this research and how its results are to be shared with the public"". ""What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification,"" said the statement by RIMAP's Executive Director Kathy Abbass. It added that ""when the study is done, RIMAP will post the legitimate report on its website"" and that its ""conclusions will be driven by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics"". The Endeavour was the ship in which Captain Cook charted New Zealand and Australia between 1769 and 1771. The British explorer, who sailed under the command as lieutenant, arrived off the south-east coast of what is now Australia in 1770, eventually making landfall at Botany Bay. He later claimed the region for the British crown, despite the presence of large Indigenous communities. After sailing back to Britain, the Endeavour was renamed Lord Sandwich II and became a troop carrier. During the American War of Independence it was scuttled by the British Navy to form a blockade of the Narragansett Bay. Could hunt for Cook's Endeavour be over?

There's undoubtedly a lot to get your head around - but we're here to help. Find out why the cost of living is soaringhere, how interest rates might affect youhere, and what help you can gethere. Today's live page was written by Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan, Chris Giles, Jo Couzens, Joseph Lee, Alex Kleiderman, James Harness, Malu Cursino and Dulcie Lee and was edited by Rob Corp. It's been a huge day for households worried about rising bills. Here's a reminder of the main developments. A little earlier we heard from Chancellor Rishi Sunak defending his plans to support households in England amid rising costs for energy bills. The Resolution Foundation - a think tank which looks at living standards for low and middle income earners - says Sunak has an ""ambitious"" plan. Butit tweeted,externalthat by opting for support for nearly everyone - instead of a targeted plan for low-income households - the number of families in fuel stress is set to double. Sunak has said because the price rises were ""so significant"" he wanted to make sure the support he provided went to all families, not just those on lower incomes. As he raised interest rates in a bid to curb inflation, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey issueda plea to workers not to ask for big pay risesto help them with increases in the cost of living. He told the BBC that it would be ""painful"" for workers to accept that prices would rise faster than their wages, but said some ""moderation of wage rises"" was needed to prevent inflation becoming entrenched. ""I don't want to in any sense sugar that, it is painful. But we need to see that in order to get through this problem more quickly,"" he said. Inflation, which measures how fast the cost of living is rising, is expected to reach an average of about 6% in 2022. We're all worried about rising bills and the growing cost of living - now research by the Liberal Democrats has revealed the areas in England that could be hit hardest by today's 54% rise in energy prices. They say the worst hit local authority areas include:  Meanwhile families living in Chancellor Rishi Sunakâs area of Richmondshire face an average energy price hike of Â£836 - the sixth highest in England. In the South East, the worst hit areas are Mole Valley (Â£767), Sevenoaks (Â£757) and Rother (Â£741). Nick JohnsonBBC News Let's get more reaction to today's warning of rising energy bills: Louise from Leicester has been telling us how she is already working out how she will use her heating during the day. Louise is part of a large family in a house with five
children. She says the rise in energy prices is going to make an already precarious situation even worse. âWeâre thinking of turning the heating on for a couple of hours in the morning and a couple of hours in the evening. So long as my grandson goes to bed warm, thatâs the most important thing.â She adds, ""weâre going to have cut back even further on foodâ and thinks âbulk cooking is going to have become something we rely upon
even moreâ. It's not just energy prices - people are being hit by rising costs in many other areas. Inflation is at its highest level for 30 years,having risen to 5.4% in the 12 months to December. Over the last year, we've seen vehicle prices go up by more than 13%, while public transport users were hit with a near 6% rise in fares. Food and clothing costs have also risen by some 4.5% over the last year. Want to escape it all with a holiday? Package deals have gone up 2.6% over the last 12 months. BBC Radio 5 Live We've been speaking to lots of people today, to find out how the energy bill price cap rise will affect them. Sue lives near Newtown in Powys and has health issues which prevent her from working. She tellsRadio 5 Livea charity has been helping feed her 10-year-old dog Dylan. ""He's a big dog with a big food bill and big vet's bill,"" she says. ""His total food bill is just shy of Â£60 a month."" ""He's my best friend and I'd be lost without him. If it was a choice between going hungry myself or not feeding Dylan, I'd feed him."" Money worries have affected Sue, with her regularly skipping two or three meals a week and avoiding turning on lights and heating in her house. ""I worry about it,"" she says. ""It's the knock on effect with my own personal mental health, worrying about the way the economic climate is going."" If you missed the chancellor's press conference on the big increases in energy bills, these were the key bits: A bit more from Labour's Nick Thomas Symonds, who says the government should have offered something more ""ambitious"" at a time when companies like Shell announced a ""momentous year"" after making $20bn in profits. He says there should be a windfall tax on profits from North Sea oil and gas to fund greater support, with Â£600 off energy bills for households that need it. Instead the government is offering a ""buy now, pay later"" scheme and giving with one hand then taking back with the other, he says. He adds that Labour would offer a long-term plan of investment in the energy sector, with Â£28bn each year for things such as insulation and renewable energy. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak on Munira Mirza resignation over PM's Savile comments During the press conference, which was intended to focus on the cost of living, the chancellor was asked several times aboutthe prime minister's debunked claimthat Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute serial sex offender Jimmy Savile when he was director of public prosecutions. One of Boris Johnson's closest aides, Munira Mirza, has resigned saying the PM should have apologised for the misleading remarks. The prime minister has since clarified the comments he made in the Commons earlier this week. He said today he had not been talking about Sir Keir's ""personal record"" when he was Director of Public Prosecutions, adding: ""I totally understand that he had nothing to do personally with those decisions. ""I was making a point about his responsibility for the organisation as a whole."" So we've heard from the chancellor. Here's a take from Martin Lewis, the money saving expert who millions trust for financial advice. He warns the Â£200 rebate on energy bills in October could leave consumers worse off. ""The issue is that it is a loan and it needs repaying at Â£40 a year,"" he says. ""In effect the Chancellor has created the equivalent of a giant UK-wide energy direct debit, trying to spread the hit of a high-cost period and repay once things return to normal."" But the problem is thereâs no guarantee things will return to normal, Lewis says. ""This âwinterâ could last for years, and if that happens, an extra Â£40 on future bills will be a very high price to pay."" Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds is giving his reaction, calling the package of measures from the chancellor ""underwhelming"". He says: ""We have a chancellor who just doesnât grasp the scale of the
cost of living crisis due to his decisions."" Thomas-Symonds points to cuts to Universal Credit, rising inflation and the rise in National Insurance which is coming. He acknowledges that energy costs are going up due to global pressures, as Sunak said several times, but argues the government's energy policy has made things worse. The chancellor was also asked whether loans to energy companies to offer people a rebate on their bills that will be paid back down the line was a bail-out? ""In no way shape or form is this a bailout of energy companies,"" he responded. ""This is help to families."" He added: ""When youâre faced with a shock of this magnitude the
sensible thing for governments to do is not to pretend it doesnât exist but to
help ease the burden of it by spreading it over some years."" In that news conference, Rishi Sunak was asked if there was a point when he would step in - as a Conservative chancellor - and say people are paying too much tax. He said his mission over the remainder of this Parliament was still to cut people's taxes - and that he felt confident he could still do it. But - defending what he was doing at the moment, with a rise in National Insurance looming - he said we'd been through a once-in-a-300-year economic shock, with borrowing at the highest level since the Second World War. The press conference is now over - but we'll bring you a few more interesting things he said, as well as some reaction. The chancellor is asked about issues with people on low incomes who happen to live in properties valued 30 years ago in a higher tax band. Does he accept that it's poorly targeted as a way to support people? Sunak says he accepts that no system could be ""perfectly targeted"", but he says there is a discretionary fund of Â£150m for councils to support people in this situation. He says there are about 300,000 people living on benefits who live in houses that are rated about council tax band D, so wouldn't automatically get the Â£150 discount. But he defends using the council tax system, saying it has the advantage of working on a household basis, as energy bills do, and being quick. ""People will feel that Â£150 in April and thatâs really good,"" he says. Sunak says he still thinks it's the right thing to do. He says the country is faced with a situation where NHS backlogs are growing to unacceptable levels as a result of Covid. Everyone wants to see action on that, he says. It will get to a point where almost every family will have a someone on a waiting list and ""that's something we didn't want to see happen"". At the same time the government wanted to ""grapple"" with the challenges of fixing social care. Both are big challenges and require serious amounts of funding, he says. Rishi Sunak keeps getting asked about this, but he doesn't want to say any more. He does say though that Munira Mirza, a close adviser to the PM who has just resigned over it, was a ""valued colleague and brought a lot to the job and I'll miss working with her"". Sunak says everyone is feeling the pinch and the government wants to make sure the support provided goes to all families. The Â£150 council tax discount for households in bands A to D will benefit families in the middle too, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Unclear whether Irish Sea border checks halted,"Checks are continuing on goods along the Irish Sea border despite an order by a Democratic Unionist Party minister for them to stop, Downing Street has said. Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots had ordered checks to stop from 00:01 GMT. But the prime minister's spokesman said checks were continuing, and that ""we are reviewing the legal position"". Mr Poots has said he made the move after receiving legal advice. Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's power-sharing partners, criticised the move to halt port checks as a ""stunt"". The order is part of the DUP's ongoingopposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. First Minister Paul Givan announced his resignation lateras part of that protest. Inspections of products from Great Britain into Northern Ireland are part of the post-Brexit protocol agreement. Q&A: Irish Sea border checks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Issues 'clear when Brexit deal was done' It was agreed by the UK and EU toensure free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. Under the deal, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Ireland's ports to ensure they comply with EU laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that a ""sensible solution"" was needed to the protocol, which ""recognises that it's crazy to have checks on goods that are basically circulating within the single market of the UK"". Earlier, Mr Johnson's spokesman said checks were ""a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"", adding ""we would like to see this situation resolved"". Asked whether the prime minister viewed the checks as the UK's obligation under the protocol, he said ""we are reviewing the legal position"" and said the government wanted to find ""solutions"" through ongoing negotiations with the EU. The environment secretary George Eustice is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons later, after speaking with Mr Poots. The spokesman said the prime minister wanted checks to continue and had not been informed of the decision to suspend them until the announcement was made, adding: ""We certainly weren't aware this was an approach the DUP would take."" Asked about reports that Mr Givan will resign as Northern Ireland's first minister and the possible return of powers to Westminster if Stormont collapsed, he said the government wanted to see a ""resilient"" and ""stable power-sharing executive"". Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements, saying they damage Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Simon Coveney, the Irish Republic's foreign minister, has warned that an end to those checks would breach international law. However, the UK government said it would not interfere and that the issue was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"". The dispute over the protocol checks centres on whether Mr Poots needs the wider authority of Stormont to act. Mr Poots, who is the Stormont Executive's agriculture minister, said legal advice supported his view that he was entitled to order officials to stop. On Thursday he confirmed that the legal advice came from former Northern Ireland attorney general John Larkin, but also said he had also been receiving advice from the current attorney general Brenda King. Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland's agricultural minister, believes the Irish Sea checks are unlawful Under power-sharing arrangements,if a matter was put to the executive, it would need an agreed approach from both the first and deputy first minister for changes to be made. DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the move was a ""test"" to see if border checks were necessary, and a ""kick to get reality into talks"" over the protocol. But Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd said Mr Poots announcement was a ""stunt"". Mr O'Dowd said Sinn FÃ©in would ""use whatever powers we have at our disposal to ensure that the protocol remains in place"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie, whose party opposes the protocol, said the Irish Sea border loomed as large as it did before Mr Poots stopped some checks. ""HMRC are still doing their checks, border force are still there. The checks are not stopped."" He told BBC NI's The Nolan Show: ""What we're trying to do is trying to get rid of the Irish Sea Border, and you'll get rid of the Irish Sea Border through negotiation."" For now, some checks appear to be continuing. However, even in the light of Edwin Poots' order, pre-Brexit checks on livestock are expected to continue as normal. Belfast City Council, which employs staff at the port's border control post, said it will ""engage with representatives and statutory partners"" on Thursday and ""assess the situation at that point"". As the sun rises at Duncrue Street in Belfast, there's no further light shed on what's happening behind the checkpoint fence. Staff in hi-vis jackets are on the ground. I watched one lorry stop, its back doors open, and a member of staff appeared to be looking at what was inside. It then left the facility, seemingly following an official-looking 4x4. Another lorry has just pulled up inside the checkpoint. Several members of staff are around it. Again it looks like something is being checked but at this point it's just not clear what. The next ferry is due to arrive in Belfast just before 10am. Seamus Leheny from Logistics UK said the directive had left hauliers in a legal limbo, but that most businesses would carry on as they had before. Mr Poots' announcement applies only to animal, food and plant products - Mr Leheny said the vast minority, only about 3%, of lorries which arrive at Belfast Port will have to open their doors for their goods to be checked. About 12% just need their documents checked, and the rest need no checks at all. He said things were ""up in the air"". ""The legal text hasn't changed - this is the situation businesses find themselves in, is that the legality side of things says one thing, the practical assessment of those checks has been instructed in another way."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium, said he did not have ""clarity"" on whether the checks on goods had stopped. ""For retailers and for any business, it's not what we can get away with, but what's the safest course of action to minimise the chance that our products will get caught up in some regulatory or legal problem."" He added: ""What business has always needed is stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability, now short-term solutions of removing checks don't get us to that long-term solution which removes that friction from Great Britain to Northern Ireland."" There is now a tense wait to see what happens next. First, will checks actually be stopped? Both Downing Street and the European Commission say that checks are still going on. A second question is, if those checks did stop - what would be the consequences? The UK is suggesting that this is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. That won't wash with the EU who point out that the protocol is an agreement between Brussels and the UK government. If the European Commission believes the agreement is being breached, it's conceivable it could take legal action. But we're not there yet and, as things stand, the Commission says it won't ""speculate"". Everyone is aware that this is a difficult and delicate situation. Suddenly an already scheduled call between the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has gained a whole new significance. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said the move was an attempt by the DUP to ""unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law"". Her party maintains that Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform those controls. But Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and cannot continue without approval from the Stormont Executive. Last week, his attempt to force an executive rethink on the issue was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. Unionists have been critical of the Protocol, saying its damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK Mr Poots had sought executive support for the checks continuing, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. The DUP minister argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. The BBC has contacted the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs for a response. The Manufacturing NI trade body said it was advising members to continue to enact the measures.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to speak to EU Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ when they meet on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said there was no orchestration between the government and the DUP over Mr Poots' decision. Speaking to ITV's Robert Peston, he said he first found out about the move when Mr Poots announced it, adding that the decision was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"" and ""within their legal remit"". Brandon Lewis said he had no prior warning of Mr Poots' announcement Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described moves to ""deliberately frustrate obligations"" under the post-Brexit agreement as a ""very serious matter "". An EU diplomat told BBC News the move ""won't do the UK's reputation any good"" and questioned the decision's legality. The Alliance Party's John Blair said it was ""not a time for causing further disruption"", adding that his party would consider ""very carefully"" before deciding on any legal challenge. Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesperson, said the order was ""outrageous"" and that the public was more concerned with other matters, adding it would ""not command the support of the assembly or the executive"" and would be challenged. However, the move was welcomed by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who said the protocol's implementation was ""never compatible"" with Northern Ireland's position within the UK.

Millions braced for huge rise in energy prices,"Millions of people facing a spike in energy costs will find out shortly how much more they will have to pay. The energy regulator's new price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers for each unit of energy - is likely to add hundreds of pounds onto the annual bill for 22 million homes. Ofgem's new cap for England, Wales and Scotland will take effect in April. Ministers are reported to have plans to provide loans for energy firms to help them cut money from customers' bills. Details of the new cap are due to be announced at 11:00 GMT. A typical household will face an annual increase of more than Â£600 on their energy bill, with a further increase of as much as Â£400 to come in the winter after the next cap is set in six months' time, analysts at Cornwall Insight have said. The cost of living in general is forecast to rise further this year, and the Bank of England will also announce on Thursday whether it will increase interest rates to combat rising prices. There are also planned tax rises in April, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson under intense pressure to scrap an increase in National Insurance. But he, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said at the weekend the tax rise would go ahead. Michael Ball says he is anxious about the price rise Among those braced for the squeeze on their finances is 24-year-old Michael Ball, from Kirkcaldy. His biggest worry is that a significant rise in energy prices could mean he would no longer be able to afford the rent on his one-bedroom flat, and would have to move back in with his parents. ""Anything over a 30% rise in April would make me leave this flat. I'm already spending more than my rent on energy,"" he said. He said he was ""very anxious"" about the rise, and expected it to be a ""big challenge"". The cap, which is announced every six months, sets the prices that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy as well as the standing charge. This is then translated into the expected annual bill for a household that uses the typical amount of gas and electricity. At present, that is Â£1,277, but analysts are predicting a 50% rise from April. That does not mean there is a limit to how much people can pay. The more gas and electricity that is used, the higher the bill. What's the energy price cap and why is it going up? Anyone who is on a standard variable tariff, whose fixed deal has come to an end (or is about to), and those moved because their old supplier went bust will be affected by the new higher cap. There is a separate cap for 4.5 million people on prepayment meters. It means a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity pays Â£1,309 a year. Energy firms are struggling under the weight of surging wholesale gas prices. The new cap will allow them to pass some of that cost onto customers. This video can not be played Why are UK energy prices so high? Joe Malinowski, founder of energy price comparison website The Energy Shop, said: ""The energy price cap has already bankrupted over half of all energy suppliers in the market. Now it is set to bankrupt the consumer. ""Come 1 April, energy households up and down the country are set to get battered by colossal increases in energy bills. For many, if not most, it will be simply unaffordable."" However, ministers are expected to announce a package of measures to reduce the immediate impact on households. The plans are expected to include the Treasury's ""rebate and clawback"" scheme, which would involve providing around Â£5-6bn in loans to energy firms to enable them to lower bills from April - possibly by about Â£200. But it has raised concerns among providers because the money would still have to be paid back eventually by billpayers. As oil giant Shell announced a huge increase in profits, Labour has called for a windfall tax to pay to keep consumer bills down. Shell's earnings reached $19.2bn (Â£14.2bn) in 2021, about four times the level recorded a year earlier. ""With oil and gas profits booming in recent months because of the spike in energy prices, it is clearer than ever that the North Sea oil and gas producers who have made a fortune recently should be asked to contribute,"" said Labour's shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband. ""Our plan, part paid for with a one-off windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas profits, would save most households Â£200 off their bills, with targeted support of up to Â£400 on top of that to the squeezed middle, pensioners and the lowest earners. Nigel Pocklington, chief executive of renewable energy supplier Good Energy, said there was ""a lot unexplained"" about the government's proposal, but added a Â£200 rebate would ""help"" households. He told the BBC's Today programme: ""It looks to be quite a complex and perhaps a slightly rushed proposal in that there's all sorts of open questions around what happens if a customer leaves you and you have borrowed money to smooth their bill? ""What happens if a customer is already on a low tariff? Do we cut that even lower?"" Meanwhile, the managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, Richard Walker, said he was concerned that ""bricks and mortar"" retailers and businesses were ""going to bear the brunt"" of rising energy prices. ""I think it's safe to say 2022 is probably set to be the hardest year ever for many UK families,"" he added. ""We are talking about energy prices and costs directly affecting consumers but that is also going to have a huge knock on effect for businesses too. In terms of grocery retail, every supermarket will be raising its prices."" INFLATION:Why prices are rising so quickly PETROL:Are we paying too much at the pump?

Call for clear date on phasing out new gas boilers,"Many people in Britain remain unprepared for the revolution in home heating that the country faces in the next ten to 15 years, a report from MPs has said. MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee said the government's approach to decarbonising home heating lacked clear direction. Current policies are also not on the scale required, they said. However, the report rejected hydrogen as a solution for greener home heating. The committee's chairman, Darren Jones, said replacing gas boilers, the major source of pollution from homes, was ""a huge task and we are not making near enough progress"". The report urges the government to do more to explain to the public the changes they will be facing, including the potential costs and benefits. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said it would provide a detailed response to the committee's report in due course but said its Heat and Buildings Strategy, published last year, already provided ""a clear and comprehensive plan for cutting emissions"". ""In total, we're investing Â£6.6bn this parliament to decarbonise our buildings, saving people money on their bills and slashing pollution in the process,"" a BEIS spokesperson said. Government says its climate change curbs inadequate How to save energy at home and help the planet Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilers How much do heat pumps cost and how do they work? Meeting climate targets would require a ban on the installation and use of any new gas boilers by the mid-2030s at the latest, the report said. The government should set a clear date in law, regulating the phase out of gas boilers it said. Current ""signalling"" from the government failed to give industry and consumers a clear date to work towards, it said. No new gas boilers should be installed after 2035 as part of government strategy Mr Jones said the government should also replace the failed Green Homes Grant â the scheme providing financial support for people to insulate their homes. âMinisters canât simply leave this to the market â the government should tackle the cost of heating our homes in the round and bring forward joined-up policies that address these issues together,â he said. The committee also urged ministers to support the training of engineers to install low carbon heating systems in every community. BEIS said the government's existing plans would incentivise people to install low-carbon heating systems ""in a simple, fair and cheap way"" and included Â£5,000 grants for heat pumps. ""With industry we are aiming for big cost reductions of between a quarter and a half by 2025 as the heat pump market expands and technology develops,"" a BEIS spokesperson said. The Heat and Buildings Strategy set out measures to support customers switching away from gas, with additional support for those on low incomes. From 2035 all new heating systems must be heat pumps, hydrogen-ready boilers or similarly low-carbon systems. However, the cross-party committee poured cold water on suggestions that hydrogen could play a major role in home heating. Mr Jones told BBC News: âWe were not convinced that hydrogen was proven to be a front-running, viable technology. ""I understand why trades unions are enthusiastic about hydrogen because it preserves jobs â but many workers will need to transition to heat pumps. Concerns around hydrogen included âsupply, distribution, changes to the network, changes in the home with safety work around pipes and valves - so many reasons weâre not convinced,â he said. Mr Jonesâ comments were attacked by Mike Foster from the trade body Energy and Utilities Alliance. ""Comments in the report [about hydrogen] are factually untrue and others deliberately misinterpret government plans,â Mr Foster said. Separately, the think tank Nesta said home heating accounted for 38% of all UK gas use. Nesta said the greenhouse gases emitted from the average UK gas boiler were equivalent to approximately 2.2 tonnes of CO2 per year, which it said was roughly the same as taking seven flights between London and New York or eating 1,263 quarter-pounders made with British beef. It also published polling suggesting that most people significantly underestimate boiler emissions. A poll of 2,000 UK adults, conducted by the market research firm Opinium for Nesta, found only 12% saw heating their home with a gas boiler as a high source of emissions. âFor most people, your boiler is probably the most environmentally damaging thing that you own,â said Nesta's Andrew Sissons. He said there were steps people could take to reduce both the emissions from their boilers and cut their gas bills, such as improving home insulation andreducing the flow temperature,externalof their boiler. Nesta said it had developeda carbon calculator,externalwhere people could quantify the environmental impact of their own boiler.

Minister orders halt to Irish Sea border checks,"Checks are continuing on goods along the Irish Sea border despite an order by a Democratic Unionist Party minister for them to stop, Downing Street has said. Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots had ordered checks to stop from 00:01 GMT. But the prime minister's spokesman said checks were continuing, and that ""we are reviewing the legal position"". Mr Poots has said he made the move after receiving legal advice. Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's power-sharing partners, criticised the move to halt port checks as a ""stunt"". The order is part of the DUP's ongoingopposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. First Minister Paul Givan announced his resignation lateras part of that protest. Inspections of products from Great Britain into Northern Ireland are part of the post-Brexit protocol agreement. Q&A: Irish Sea border checks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Issues 'clear when Brexit deal was done' It was agreed by the UK and EU toensure free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. Under the deal, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Ireland's ports to ensure they comply with EU laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that a ""sensible solution"" was needed to the protocol, which ""recognises that it's crazy to have checks on goods that are basically circulating within the single market of the UK"". Earlier, Mr Johnson's spokesman said checks were ""a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"", adding ""we would like to see this situation resolved"". Asked whether the prime minister viewed the checks as the UK's obligation under the protocol, he said ""we are reviewing the legal position"" and said the government wanted to find ""solutions"" through ongoing negotiations with the EU. The environment secretary George Eustice is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons later, after speaking with Mr Poots. The spokesman said the prime minister wanted checks to continue and had not been informed of the decision to suspend them until the announcement was made, adding: ""We certainly weren't aware this was an approach the DUP would take."" Asked about reports that Mr Givan will resign as Northern Ireland's first minister and the possible return of powers to Westminster if Stormont collapsed, he said the government wanted to see a ""resilient"" and ""stable power-sharing executive"". Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements, saying they damage Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Simon Coveney, the Irish Republic's foreign minister, has warned that an end to those checks would breach international law. However, the UK government said it would not interfere and that the issue was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"". The dispute over the protocol checks centres on whether Mr Poots needs the wider authority of Stormont to act. Mr Poots, who is the Stormont Executive's agriculture minister, said legal advice supported his view that he was entitled to order officials to stop. On Thursday he confirmed that the legal advice came from former Northern Ireland attorney general John Larkin, but also said he had also been receiving advice from the current attorney general Brenda King. Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland's agricultural minister, believes the Irish Sea checks are unlawful Under power-sharing arrangements,if a matter was put to the executive, it would need an agreed approach from both the first and deputy first minister for changes to be made. DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the move was a ""test"" to see if border checks were necessary, and a ""kick to get reality into talks"" over the protocol. But Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd said Mr Poots announcement was a ""stunt"". Mr O'Dowd said Sinn FÃ©in would ""use whatever powers we have at our disposal to ensure that the protocol remains in place"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie, whose party opposes the protocol, said the Irish Sea border loomed as large as it did before Mr Poots stopped some checks. ""HMRC are still doing their checks, border force are still there. The checks are not stopped."" He told BBC NI's The Nolan Show: ""What we're trying to do is trying to get rid of the Irish Sea Border, and you'll get rid of the Irish Sea Border through negotiation."" For now, some checks appear to be continuing. However, even in the light of Edwin Poots' order, pre-Brexit checks on livestock are expected to continue as normal. Belfast City Council, which employs staff at the port's border control post, said it will ""engage with representatives and statutory partners"" on Thursday and ""assess the situation at that point"". As the sun rises at Duncrue Street in Belfast, there's no further light shed on what's happening behind the checkpoint fence. Staff in hi-vis jackets are on the ground. I watched one lorry stop, its back doors open, and a member of staff appeared to be looking at what was inside. It then left the facility, seemingly following an official-looking 4x4. Another lorry has just pulled up inside the checkpoint. Several members of staff are around it. Again it looks like something is being checked but at this point it's just not clear what. The next ferry is due to arrive in Belfast just before 10am. Seamus Leheny from Logistics UK said the directive had left hauliers in a legal limbo, but that most businesses would carry on as they had before. Mr Poots' announcement applies only to animal, food and plant products - Mr Leheny said the vast minority, only about 3%, of lorries which arrive at Belfast Port will have to open their doors for their goods to be checked. About 12% just need their documents checked, and the rest need no checks at all. He said things were ""up in the air"". ""The legal text hasn't changed - this is the situation businesses find themselves in, is that the legality side of things says one thing, the practical assessment of those checks has been instructed in another way."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium, said he did not have ""clarity"" on whether the checks on goods had stopped. ""For retailers and for any business, it's not what we can get away with, but what's the safest course of action to minimise the chance that our products will get caught up in some regulatory or legal problem."" He added: ""What business has always needed is stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability, now short-term solutions of removing checks don't get us to that long-term solution which removes that friction from Great Britain to Northern Ireland."" There is now a tense wait to see what happens next. First, will checks actually be stopped? Both Downing Street and the European Commission say that checks are still going on. A second question is, if those checks did stop - what would be the consequences? The UK is suggesting that this is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. That won't wash with the EU who point out that the protocol is an agreement between Brussels and the UK government. If the European Commission believes the agreement is being breached, it's conceivable it could take legal action. But we're not there yet and, as things stand, the Commission says it won't ""speculate"". Everyone is aware that this is a difficult and delicate situation. Suddenly an already scheduled call between the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has gained a whole new significance. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said the move was an attempt by the DUP to ""unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law"". Her party maintains that Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform those controls. But Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and cannot continue without approval from the Stormont Executive. Last week, his attempt to force an executive rethink on the issue was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. Unionists have been critical of the Protocol, saying its damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK Mr Poots had sought executive support for the checks continuing, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. The DUP minister argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. The BBC has contacted the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs for a response. The Manufacturing NI trade body said it was advising members to continue to enact the measures.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to speak to EU Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ when they meet on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said there was no orchestration between the government and the DUP over Mr Poots' decision. Speaking to ITV's Robert Peston, he said he first found out about the move when Mr Poots announced it, adding that the decision was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"" and ""within their legal remit"". Brandon Lewis said he had no prior warning of Mr Poots' announcement Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described moves to ""deliberately frustrate obligations"" under the post-Brexit agreement as a ""very serious matter "". An EU diplomat told BBC News the move ""won't do the UK's reputation any good"" and questioned the decision's legality. The Alliance Party's John Blair said it was ""not a time for causing further disruption"", adding that his party would consider ""very carefully"" before deciding on any legal challenge. Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesperson, said the order was ""outrageous"" and that the public was more concerned with other matters, adding it would ""not command the support of the assembly or the executive"" and would be challenged. However, the move was welcomed by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who said the protocol's implementation was ""never compatible"" with Northern Ireland's position within the UK.

Row erupts over location of Cook's HMS Endeavour,"The Endeavour had sailed for several years around the South Pacific before famously landing in eastern Australia in 1770 The final resting place of Captain James Cook's HMB Endeavour has been found, Australian experts say - a claim their US colleagues say is ""premature"". On Thursday, the Australian National Maritime Museum (ANMM) said a wreck in Newport Harbour, off Rhode Island in the US, had been confirmed as the ship. But the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) immediately said ""many unanswered questions"" remained. The British-built coal ship famously landed in eastern Australia in 1770. Before that, HM Bark Endeavour had sailed for several years around the South Pacific, after setting out from Plymouth in England. The vessel, then known as Lord Sandwich II, was sunk with 12 other ships off Rhode Island in August 1778 - but no-one was sure where. Captain Cook's Endeavour replica comes 'home' to Whitby Could hunt for Cook's Endeavour be over? The ANMM made its announcement in Sydney on Thursday morning. ""I am satisfied that this is the final resting place of one of the most important and contentious vessels in Australia's maritime history,""ANMM Director and CEO Kevin Sumption said in a statement.,external ""The last pieces of the puzzle had to be confirmed before I felt able to make this call. ""Based on archival and archaeological evidence, I'm convinced it's the Endeavour,"" Mr Sumption added. But shortly afterwards,the RIMAP, the lead team involved in the years-long research, posted a statement saying the ANMM report ""that the Endeavour has been identified is premature"".,external The RIMAP accused the ANMM of a breach of the contract between the two organisations ""for the conduct of this research and how its results are to be shared with the public"". ""What we see on the shipwreck site under study is consistent with what might be expected of the Endeavour, but there has been no indisputable data found to prove the site is that iconic vessel, and there are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identification,"" said the statement by RIMAP's Executive Director Kathy Abbass. It added that ""when the study is done, RIMAP will post the legitimate report on its website"" and that its ""conclusions will be driven by proper scientific process and not Australian emotions or politics"". The Endeavour was the ship in which Captain Cook charted New Zealand and Australia between 1769 and 1771. The British explorer, who sailed under the command as lieutenant, arrived off the south-east coast of what is now Australia in 1770, eventually making landfall at Botany Bay. He later claimed the region for the British crown, despite the presence of large Indigenous communities. After sailing back to Britain, the Endeavour was renamed Lord Sandwich II and became a troop carrier. During the American War of Independence it was scuttled by the British Navy to form a blockade of the Narragansett Bay. Could hunt for Cook's Endeavour be over?

New 'Disappeared' case opens on Troubles-era murder,"Seamus Maguire's case is the commission's first case in more than 10 years The commission established to find the remains of murder victims buried in secret graves during the Troubles is taking on a new case for the first time in more than 10 years. Seamus Maguire disappeared after leaving his home at Aghagallon, near Lurgan, about 50 years ago. The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) said it was not clear ""which wing of the IRA was involved"". He is the commission's 17th case. The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during Northern Ireland's Troubles. Mr Maguire vanished in or around 1973-74, according to a statement from the commission, when he was about 26. It is believed republican paramilitaries were behind his murder - both the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA were active at the time. The ICLVR said it was taking on the case ""on the basis of information received from the PSNI"". A spokesperson for the Maguire family said: ""Seamus was a much loved eldest son.  His mother looked for him for many years. Geoff Knupfer, who is leading the commission's investigation, appealed for more information ""The family's wish is that he is brought home and given a Christian burial."" The ICLVR's lead investigator, Geoff Knupfer, said: ""As with all our cases, our sole aim is to locate and recover the remains to return them to Seamus' family. ""It is a purely humanitarian cause. ""I would appeal to anyone who knows anything about the disappearance of Seamus to come forward to the commission, safe in the knowledge that any information will be treated in the strictest confidence. ""With the right information we will find Seamus and return his remains to his family"". Who were the Disappeared? Timeline: The Disappeared Information given to the ICLVR is not passed to other agencies or used in prosecutions. It is understood the PSNI and the commission have had ongoing discussions about the case for several years. ""This case currently sits within the workload of Legacy Investigation Branch for formal review in due course,"" a PSNI statement read. ""The commission believe the case meets their criteria and the police will share all relevant information to assist their investigation."" The ICLVR has located the remains of 13 peoplesince it was established by the British and Irish governments in 1999. The majority of the murders took place in the 1970s, with victims abducted in Northern Ireland and mostly killed and buried at locations in the Republic of Ireland. The Provisional IRA has admitted responsibility for 13 of the murders and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) one. No attribution has been given to the others. Seamus Maguire now joins Joe Lynskey,Columba McVeigh and Army officer Robert Nairac as the 'Disappeared' whose remains have yet to be found. A reward of more than Â£44,000 is being offered for new information that results in finding any or all of their remains by the independent UK charity Crimestoppers.

"People still in dark over gas boilers, say MPsGovernment needs to clearly spell out the major changes required in the years ahead, a committee says.Business","Many people in Britain remain unprepared for the revolution in home heating that the country faces in the next ten to 15 years, a report from MPs has said. MPs on the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee said the government's approach to decarbonising home heating lacked clear direction. Current policies are also not on the scale required, they said. However, the report rejected hydrogen as a solution for greener home heating. The committee's chairman, Darren Jones, said replacing gas boilers, the major source of pollution from homes, was ""a huge task and we are not making near enough progress"". The report urges the government to do more to explain to the public the changes they will be facing, including the potential costs and benefits. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said it would provide a detailed response to the committee's report in due course but said its Heat and Buildings Strategy, published last year, already provided ""a clear and comprehensive plan for cutting emissions"". ""In total, we're investing Â£6.6bn this parliament to decarbonise our buildings, saving people money on their bills and slashing pollution in the process,"" a BEIS spokesperson said. Government says its climate change curbs inadequate How to save energy at home and help the planet Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilers How much do heat pumps cost and how do they work? Meeting climate targets would require a ban on the installation and use of any new gas boilers by the mid-2030s at the latest, the report said. The government should set a clear date in law, regulating the phase out of gas boilers it said. Current ""signalling"" from the government failed to give industry and consumers a clear date to work towards, it said. No new gas boilers should be installed after 2035 as part of government strategy Mr Jones said the government should also replace the failed Green Homes Grant â the scheme providing financial support for people to insulate their homes. âMinisters canât simply leave this to the market â the government should tackle the cost of heating our homes in the round and bring forward joined-up policies that address these issues together,â he said. The committee also urged ministers to support the training of engineers to install low carbon heating systems in every community. BEIS said the government's existing plans would incentivise people to install low-carbon heating systems ""in a simple, fair and cheap way"" and included Â£5,000 grants for heat pumps. ""With industry we are aiming for big cost reductions of between a quarter and a half by 2025 as the heat pump market expands and technology develops,"" a BEIS spokesperson said. The Heat and Buildings Strategy set out measures to support customers switching away from gas, with additional support for those on low incomes. From 2035 all new heating systems must be heat pumps, hydrogen-ready boilers or similarly low-carbon systems. However, the cross-party committee poured cold water on suggestions that hydrogen could play a major role in home heating. Mr Jones told BBC News: âWe were not convinced that hydrogen was proven to be a front-running, viable technology. ""I understand why trades unions are enthusiastic about hydrogen because it preserves jobs â but many workers will need to transition to heat pumps. Concerns around hydrogen included âsupply, distribution, changes to the network, changes in the home with safety work around pipes and valves - so many reasons weâre not convinced,â he said. Mr Jonesâ comments were attacked by Mike Foster from the trade body Energy and Utilities Alliance. ""Comments in the report [about hydrogen] are factually untrue and others deliberately misinterpret government plans,â Mr Foster said. Separately, the think tank Nesta said home heating accounted for 38% of all UK gas use. Nesta said the greenhouse gases emitted from the average UK gas boiler were equivalent to approximately 2.2 tonnes of CO2 per year, which it said was roughly the same as taking seven flights between London and New York or eating 1,263 quarter-pounders made with British beef. It also published polling suggesting that most people significantly underestimate boiler emissions. A poll of 2,000 UK adults, conducted by the market research firm Opinium for Nesta, found only 12% saw heating their home with a gas boiler as a high source of emissions. âFor most people, your boiler is probably the most environmentally damaging thing that you own,â said Nesta's Andrew Sissons. He said there were steps people could take to reduce both the emissions from their boilers and cut their gas bills, such as improving home insulation andreducing the flow temperature,externalof their boiler. Nesta said it had developeda carbon calculator,externalwhere people could quantify the environmental impact of their own boiler.

Post-Brexit Irish Sea checks expected to stop,"Checks are continuing on goods along the Irish Sea border despite an order by a Democratic Unionist Party minister for them to stop, Downing Street has said. Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots had ordered checks to stop from 00:01 GMT. But the prime minister's spokesman said checks were continuing, and that ""we are reviewing the legal position"". Mr Poots has said he made the move after receiving legal advice. Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's power-sharing partners, criticised the move to halt port checks as a ""stunt"". The order is part of the DUP's ongoingopposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. First Minister Paul Givan announced his resignation lateras part of that protest. Inspections of products from Great Britain into Northern Ireland are part of the post-Brexit protocol agreement. Q&A: Irish Sea border checks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Issues 'clear when Brexit deal was done' It was agreed by the UK and EU toensure free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. Under the deal, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Ireland's ports to ensure they comply with EU laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that a ""sensible solution"" was needed to the protocol, which ""recognises that it's crazy to have checks on goods that are basically circulating within the single market of the UK"". Earlier, Mr Johnson's spokesman said checks were ""a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"", adding ""we would like to see this situation resolved"". Asked whether the prime minister viewed the checks as the UK's obligation under the protocol, he said ""we are reviewing the legal position"" and said the government wanted to find ""solutions"" through ongoing negotiations with the EU. The environment secretary George Eustice is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons later, after speaking with Mr Poots. The spokesman said the prime minister wanted checks to continue and had not been informed of the decision to suspend them until the announcement was made, adding: ""We certainly weren't aware this was an approach the DUP would take."" Asked about reports that Mr Givan will resign as Northern Ireland's first minister and the possible return of powers to Westminster if Stormont collapsed, he said the government wanted to see a ""resilient"" and ""stable power-sharing executive"". Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements, saying they damage Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Simon Coveney, the Irish Republic's foreign minister, has warned that an end to those checks would breach international law. However, the UK government said it would not interfere and that the issue was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"". The dispute over the protocol checks centres on whether Mr Poots needs the wider authority of Stormont to act. Mr Poots, who is the Stormont Executive's agriculture minister, said legal advice supported his view that he was entitled to order officials to stop. On Thursday he confirmed that the legal advice came from former Northern Ireland attorney general John Larkin, but also said he had also been receiving advice from the current attorney general Brenda King. Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland's agricultural minister, believes the Irish Sea checks are unlawful Under power-sharing arrangements,if a matter was put to the executive, it would need an agreed approach from both the first and deputy first minister for changes to be made. DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the move was a ""test"" to see if border checks were necessary, and a ""kick to get reality into talks"" over the protocol. But Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd said Mr Poots announcement was a ""stunt"". Mr O'Dowd said Sinn FÃ©in would ""use whatever powers we have at our disposal to ensure that the protocol remains in place"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie, whose party opposes the protocol, said the Irish Sea border loomed as large as it did before Mr Poots stopped some checks. ""HMRC are still doing their checks, border force are still there. The checks are not stopped."" He told BBC NI's The Nolan Show: ""What we're trying to do is trying to get rid of the Irish Sea Border, and you'll get rid of the Irish Sea Border through negotiation."" For now, some checks appear to be continuing. However, even in the light of Edwin Poots' order, pre-Brexit checks on livestock are expected to continue as normal. Belfast City Council, which employs staff at the port's border control post, said it will ""engage with representatives and statutory partners"" on Thursday and ""assess the situation at that point"". As the sun rises at Duncrue Street in Belfast, there's no further light shed on what's happening behind the checkpoint fence. Staff in hi-vis jackets are on the ground. I watched one lorry stop, its back doors open, and a member of staff appeared to be looking at what was inside. It then left the facility, seemingly following an official-looking 4x4. Another lorry has just pulled up inside the checkpoint. Several members of staff are around it. Again it looks like something is being checked but at this point it's just not clear what. The next ferry is due to arrive in Belfast just before 10am. Seamus Leheny from Logistics UK said the directive had left hauliers in a legal limbo, but that most businesses would carry on as they had before. Mr Poots' announcement applies only to animal, food and plant products - Mr Leheny said the vast minority, only about 3%, of lorries which arrive at Belfast Port will have to open their doors for their goods to be checked. About 12% just need their documents checked, and the rest need no checks at all. He said things were ""up in the air"". ""The legal text hasn't changed - this is the situation businesses find themselves in, is that the legality side of things says one thing, the practical assessment of those checks has been instructed in another way."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium, said he did not have ""clarity"" on whether the checks on goods had stopped. ""For retailers and for any business, it's not what we can get away with, but what's the safest course of action to minimise the chance that our products will get caught up in some regulatory or legal problem."" He added: ""What business has always needed is stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability, now short-term solutions of removing checks don't get us to that long-term solution which removes that friction from Great Britain to Northern Ireland."" There is now a tense wait to see what happens next. First, will checks actually be stopped? Both Downing Street and the European Commission say that checks are still going on. A second question is, if those checks did stop - what would be the consequences? The UK is suggesting that this is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. That won't wash with the EU who point out that the protocol is an agreement between Brussels and the UK government. If the European Commission believes the agreement is being breached, it's conceivable it could take legal action. But we're not there yet and, as things stand, the Commission says it won't ""speculate"". Everyone is aware that this is a difficult and delicate situation. Suddenly an already scheduled call between the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has gained a whole new significance. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said the move was an attempt by the DUP to ""unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law"". Her party maintains that Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform those controls. But Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and cannot continue without approval from the Stormont Executive. Last week, his attempt to force an executive rethink on the issue was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. Unionists have been critical of the Protocol, saying its damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK Mr Poots had sought executive support for the checks continuing, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. The DUP minister argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. The BBC has contacted the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs for a response. The Manufacturing NI trade body said it was advising members to continue to enact the measures.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to speak to EU Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ when they meet on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said there was no orchestration between the government and the DUP over Mr Poots' decision. Speaking to ITV's Robert Peston, he said he first found out about the move when Mr Poots announced it, adding that the decision was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"" and ""within their legal remit"". Brandon Lewis said he had no prior warning of Mr Poots' announcement Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described moves to ""deliberately frustrate obligations"" under the post-Brexit agreement as a ""very serious matter "". An EU diplomat told BBC News the move ""won't do the UK's reputation any good"" and questioned the decision's legality. The Alliance Party's John Blair said it was ""not a time for causing further disruption"", adding that his party would consider ""very carefully"" before deciding on any legal challenge. Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesperson, said the order was ""outrageous"" and that the public was more concerned with other matters, adding it would ""not command the support of the assembly or the executive"" and would be challenged. However, the move was welcomed by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who said the protocol's implementation was ""never compatible"" with Northern Ireland's position within the UK.
