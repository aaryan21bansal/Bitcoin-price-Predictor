We need all-female emergency cabinet - Lucas,"This video can not be played Why Caroline Lucas wants an all-female ""emergency cabinet"" Caroline Lucas has asked 10 female politicians from all parties to join her in forming an ""emergency cabinet"" in a bid to stop a no-deal Brexit. Writing in the Guardian,,externalthe Green Party MP said the all-women cabinet could ""bring a different perspective"". Ms Lucas, whose party wants another Brexit referendum, said the aim would be to force a no-confidence vote in Prime Minister Boris Johnson. She would then hope to form a ""national unity government"". This arrangement - when a group of MPs of multiple parties choose to work together and form a government - has not been seen since the Second World War. In her Guardian article, Ms Lucas - a former Green Party leader - said the national unity government would ""press the pause button"" and organise another referendum offering a choice between staying in the EU or the government's Brexit plan, whether that is an agreed deal or no deal. ""In my experience, women tend to be less tribal, they tend to find it easier to establish trust more quickly,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She also added that her proposed unity government would have to be led by a female Labour MP, as they would be representing the largest opposition party. But her idea was criticised by International Trade Secretary Liz Truss, who tweeted: ""Is there anything more sexist than claiming your gender determines your worldview/behaviour/attitude?"" MP cautious on all-female unity cabinet bid Greens call for new Brexit referendum No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Liz Truss criticised the proposals as sexist Among the women Ms Lucas has invited to join her are Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, Conservative MP Justine Greening, and Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts. The others are: Heidi Allen, Kirsty Blackman, Yvette Cooper, Sylvia Hermon, and Anna Soubry. She has asked to meet the 10 women in the coming days. On Monday, Ms Lucas told the BBC she had received responses from five of the women she has written to, expressing differing levels of interest. She added she wasn't completely against involving men - for instance accepting that a key anti-Brexit campaigner like Dominic Grieve could be given a cabinet seat. Ms Thornberrytweeted a reply,externalto say she would not be able to take part in the planned talks because she is currently on holiday. She added that returning the issue of Brexit ""to the people"" was the ""best route to go down at this point"". ""My fear with the other suggested route - imposing some alternative coalition government without any reference to the public - would risk worsening the feelings of anger and resentment towards 'Westminster' that have led us into this Brexit mess,"" she added. Ms Saville Roberts welcomed Ms Lucas's bid to break the deadlock over Brexit, but said she was ""not entirely comfortable"" that only women would be involved. Ms Lucas's suggestion has also attracted widespread discussion on social media, with many people expressing criticism. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott tweeted it ""won't work... whatever the gender of the participants"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MP Clive Lewis called it a ""very interesting proposal"", but asked: ""Where are the BAME women politicians?""

HK clashes as tear gas fired into rail station,"This video can not be played Violence erupts in HK train stations Police officers in Hong Kong stormed enclosed railway stations on Sunday, firing tear gas in an effort to force out protesters. One video inside Tai Koo station showed officers firing what appeared to be non-lethal ammunition at close range. It also showed several police beating people with batons on an escalator. In the bustling central Wan Chai district, petrol bombs and bricks were thrown at police, who responded by charging at protesters. A number of people, including a police officer, were injured in the clashes. The protesters have started to adopt new tactics, striking in several areas in smaller groups before running when the police arrive, says the BBC's Stephen McDonell who is in the city.

PM plans prison places and extends stop-and-search,"This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Stop-and-search works."" An extra 10,000 new prison places will be created and stop-and-search powers expanded, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised. The first new prison in the Â£2.5bn programme will be at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, whereexpansion plans have previously been announced. The government said the plans showed it was ""serious about fighting crime"". But Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said ""random"" stop-and-search was a ""recipe for unrest"". The government's focus on law and order will add to speculation that No 10 is preparing for an autumn general election, said BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. But Mr Johnson has previouslyruled out an election before October 31. Reality Check: Have police numbers dropped? Does stop and search reduce crime? The prison and policing plans for England and Wales follow other recent initiatives from Downing Street about the NHS and immigration. Last month, the government alsopledged to recruit20,000 extra police officers, nearly replacing the number of officers lost since the Conservatives returned to power. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We know the greatest deterrent to crime is the perception of the likelihood of getting caught. Prevention is really what we're after."" But on the same programme, Lord Heseltine accused the government of ""economic irresponsibility"", saying it was ""trashing money around the place like there is no tomorrow, aimed very specifically at very clear electoral targets"". The 10,000 new prison places are expected to be created by building new jails and expanding existing ones, at a cost of up to Â£2.5bn. The first new prison will be built alongside the maximum security jail at HMP Full Sutton, the Ministry of Justice said. But plans already announced there have drawn objections from police, who said it would increase violent crime in the jail. Previously decommissioned prison venues will also be refurbished and brought back into use, the government said. Mr Johnson wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat the investment was ""long overdue"". He also argued that too many serious violent or sexual offenders are coming out of prison long before they should, and tougher sentences were needed. ""We need to come down hard on crime,"" he wrote. ""That means coming down hard on criminals. We need to reverse the balance of fear. ""I want the criminals to be afraid - not the public."" In 2016, former justice secretary Liz Truss unveiled a white paper promising a Â£1.3bn investment in prisons, addingan extra 10,000 places by 2020- later pushed back to 2022. The Ministry of Justice said it was on course to create 3,360 places at two new prisons by 2023. Government sources said the Â£2.5bn funding would allow it to deliver 10,000 places on top of that, including projects already at a planning stage such as HMP Full Sutton. But a spokesman for the Prison Reform Trust said the suggestion that all 10,000 places were new was ""misleading"" given earlier announcements. The trust said prisons needed 12,000 more places just to eliminate overcrowding and accommodate new prisoners who have already been sentenced. ""We know the aggressive rhetoric of 'prison works' invariably drives up the use of imprisonment long before the capacity to deal with that has been created,"" said Peter Dawson, the trust's director. ""Tough rhetoric is no substitute for understanding the evidence."" A pilot scheme making it easier for police to search people without reasonable suspicion, in places where serious violence may occur, is being extended to all 43 forces across England and Wales. In March, when he was home secretary, Sajid Javidfirst introduced the scheme in seven police force areas: London, the West Midlands, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Greater Manchester. The latest move will see restrictions over using section 60 stop-and-search lifted more widely, giving officers across England and Wales a limited time period to search anyone in a designated area in order to prevent violent crime. Inspectors will now be able to use section 60 without seeking the authorisation of a senior officer and there will be a lower threshold for its use, with police only needing to reasonably believe that violence ""may"" occur, not that it will. Police given more stop and search powers The key facts about rising knife crime The Home Office and Number 10 said their decision to extend stop-and-search was based on ""initial feedback"" from the three-month trial in seven areas. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Stop-and-search works. We hear again and again from police that [they] need to be empowered."" She said powers needed to be used in the ""right, legal and professional way"" but their use was supported by families of victims of knife crime, from ""communities that have suffered so much trauma and pain"". The announcement comes days aftera police officer was stabbed in the headwith a machete in east London. Stop-and-search powers have been controversial for many years, with evidence that they are sometimes misused and that they disproportionately target black people. In 2017-18, black people were9.5 times more likely to be searched,externalthan white people, a gap which has grown in recent years. Jonathan Hinds, who campaigns against its misuse, told BBC Radio 5 Live he had been stopped three times within a mile by three different police officers. He warned black people faced being ""targeted by these draconian powers"". London was one of seven areas where the stop-and-search pilot scheme was initially trialled Elena Noel, co-chair of Southwark's anti-knife crime forum, said action was needed to halt the ""crisis"" but ""independent data does not show that stop-and-search stops knife crime and violence"". Astudy of stop-and-search over a decade in London,externalby the College of Policing found it to be ""inconsistent"" and ""weak"" as a deterrent. Labour accused the Conservatives of trying to ""appear tough"" instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. Ms Abbott said evidence-based stop-and-search was an important tool, but ""random stops have only poisoned police community relations"" and were a ""tried and tested recipe for unrest"". The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of repeating the ""failed policies of the past"" and said extending stop-and-search disproportionately affected black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Talking tough on crime will always grab headlines for governments and that's exactly what Boris Johnson's done. These announcements may address public concern about violent crime and follow the priorities Mr Johnson set for his government on day one. But they are also the type of promises the prime minister would like to point to during an election campaign. And the announcements, coming in such quick succession from the government, add to the sense that it is preparing to go to the polls. Whether the prime minister is forced into it through a vote of no confidence, or chooses to call for one himself, there is an increasing sense that an election isn't far away - either before or after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. Promising to do something is one thing, but paying for it and delivering it is another - and with these policy announcements comes an increasing bill for the Treasury to foot. Tax rises or extra borrowing are a much harder sell for MPs campaigning on the doorstep, so we might have to wait some time to find out exactly where the money's coming from. The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers, said it welcomed forces across the country being given the same tools to tackle knife crime. John Apter, the federation's national chairman, said: ""We can't have a postcode lottery on keeping the public safe."" ""We are in the grip of a wave of violent crime on a scale we've not seen before, with young people being killed or stabbed on our streets, and we have to do something about it,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. This video can not be played Youth mentor Dijon Joseph and Ch Supt Simon Messinger discuss stop and search He acknowledged concerns about stop-and-search and said police officers would be as professional as possible, with many wearing body cameras. But he said they also had to respond to people who could be ""incredibly hostile, aggressive and violent"". Have police numbers dropped?

How the protests have hit tourism,"Hong Kong is one of the world's most visited cities Protesters in Hong Kong are continuingprotests at the city's international airport. The demonstrations come as the US warned its citizens to ""exercise increased caution"" when travelling there. Several other nations - including Australia, the UK, Ireland, Singapore and Japan - have also issued heightened travel advisories over what the US called ""confrontational"" protests in the Chinese territory. This isn't the first time the airport has become a protest site: On 26 July, thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators and airline staff held a sit-in there with the aim of reaching tourists and raising awareness of the protests' goals. Then on 5 August,more than 200 flights were cancelled amid a city-wide strike. Hong Kong is one of the world's most visited cities, but experts say the disruption is hurting its hospitality sector. So how much have the protests affected tourism? The background you need on the protests A brief history of Hong Kong Young, radical and ready for tear gas For nine weeks now, anti-government rallies have frequently ended in violent clashes with police - and some would-be visitors are concerned the city may be more dangerous than before. Google Trends data shows a marked increase for the search term ""Hong Kong safe"" since the end of July, with the majority of searches coming from Europe and other parts of Asia. China warns HK protesters not to 'play with fire' Were triads involved in Hong Kong violence? According to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, preliminary figures have shown a ""double-digit decline"" in the number of visitor arrivals in the second half of July. ""The travel trade has reported that the number of forward bookings in August and September has [also] dropped significantly,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. Flight bookings, too, have taken a hit. Hong Kong flagship carrier Cathay Pacific declined to give any figures, but said that it was ""seeing the impact of local political unrest"". Hong Kong's flagship carrier Cathay Pacific says business has been hit by the protests ""This has led to a significant fall-off in future bookings over the next few months, particularly for inbound travel,"" John Slosar, Cathay Pacific Group Chairman, said in a statement. International hotel chain the Langham Hospitality Group said ""certain segments"" at its Hong Kong hotels had seen a ""slowdown"". However, a spokesperson added that the protests would ""affect sentiment and retail businesses, but in the longer term will not pose a threat to Hong Kong's economy and global standing as one of the top travel destinations of the world"". Tourists from the Chinese mainland visit Hong Kong in their millions Even Disneyland Hong Kong is seeing a drop in numbers. CEO Bob Iger said: ""We have seen an impact from the protests. There's definitely been disruption. That has impacted our visitation there."" The tourism industry is one of the major pillars of Hong Kong's economy, contributing around 5% of the city's GDP. A large majority of Hong Kong's visitors come from mainland China. In January to June 2019 alone, mainlanders made 27 million visits to the territory. Protesters in Hong Kong are well aware of this. Earlier in July, they attempted to spread their pro-democracy message to mainland tourists, handing out leaflets in the busy shopping district of Tsim Sha Tsui. Information is strictly censored in China, and many state-media outlets have painted a picture of protesters ""destroying"" the city - a tactic aimed at fanning public anger against the demonstrators - as in this tweet from the (famously nationalistic and outspoken) Global Times.

According to news outlet Radio Free Asia (RFA), a travel agency in Shenzhen said many people in China had recently cancelled their trips to Hong Kong. ""One of my guests said he was afraid that it would be unsafe,"" the unnamed agency told RFA. And others agreed. ""How are there still people willing to travel to Hong Kong?"" asked one commenter on the Chinese micro-blogging site Weibo. ""Do they not read the news? Their personal safety will be at risk."" ""I used to travel to Hong Kong for shopping, I'd rather go to Japan or Korea now,"" another added. Jason Wong, chairman of the Travel Industry of Hong Kong, told AFP: ""I think the situation is getting more and more serious."" He added that travel agents are considering putting staff on unpaid leave. According to the South China Morning Post, which is based in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association (HKRMA) said most of its 8,000 member shops had recorded a drop in revenue. The HKRMA said it would revise its sales forecast to a ""double digit decline"" if protests continued. It had earlier forecasted a year of single-digit growth. Swiss watchmaker Swatch told Reuters news agency that political turbulence had contributed to a ""double-digit decline in sales in Hong Kong"", one of its most important global markets. And Angela Cheng, an economist at CMB International Capital Corporation Limited, said retail sales in 2019 were forecast to drop by as much as 10%. ""Hong Kong's retail industry will be affected both internally and externally,"" she told Reuters.

Marina Wheeler urges women to take smear tests,"Marina Wheeler says she is 'cancer-free' after undergoing two operations The estranged wife of Boris Johnson has urged women ""to make time"" for smear tests after having surgery, following her cervical cancer diagnosis in May. Marina Wheeler QC had two operations after a routine screening revealed she had developed the disease, she toldthe Sunday Times,external. The 54-year-old now considers herself ""cancer-free"", she added. She said: ""I know the take-up of smear tests is way down. I know they can save your life.

Boris Johnson and Marina Wheeler to divorce ""If people are willing to listen - as they seem to be - why not say so? Why be afraid? ""I would urge other women to make the time and do the tests."" Describing her own reaction in May, after a doctor told her of her cancer diagnosis, she said she thought: ""That's absurd. I have no time for this. ""Quite apart from everything else, I have a book to write."" She said her experience made her appreciate ""the incalculable value of holding close those who you love and trust"".

Rashford double as Man Utd open with win over ChelseaMarcus Rashford scores twice as Manchester United begin their Premier League campaign with an emphatic win over Chelsea at Old Trafford.,"Marcus Rashford has scored all four of the penalties he has taken in competitive senior matches for club and country, including shootouts Manchester United recorded their biggest Old Trafford win over Chelsea since 1965 to condemn Frank Lampard to a miserable start as a Premier League manager. Marcus Rashford scored twice, either side of a close-range effort from Anthony Martial, who had been given the number nine shirt back following the sale of Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan. Substitute Daniel James completed the scoring with a goal on his debut nine minutes from time. The final scoreline was harsh on the visitors, who were the better side before the break and hit the frame of the goal through Tammy Abraham and Emerson, but still suffered their worst ever opening-day defeat in 104 league seasons. The ecstatic home supporters did not care about that though, as the negativity of a difficult summer was swept away by their best result against Chelsea since they beat them by the same score in the 1994 FA Cup final. Man Utd remain 'a work in progress' - Solskjaer We have to learn harsh lessons quickly - Lampard VAR's Premier League debut - did it work? Wan-Bissaka your player of the match This video can not be played Winning is a good habit - Solskjaer United had to pay Leicester Â£80m - and make Harry Maguire the most expensive defender ever - to land manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's number one summer transfer target. Maguire's England team-mate Rashford may grab the plaudits with his brace but the Yorkshireman's authoritative performance underlined why his new boss wanted him above getting the big name midfield or striking reinforcements so many United fans have demanded on social media. His calmness under pressure helped ensure that when the home side looked shaky in the first half they did not add to their concerns with self-inflicted mistakes. Maguire was happy to keep it simple in possession and push the ball on to Paul Pogba when he could, and had the awareness to spot team-mates in trouble, something former United boss Jose Mourinho rather churlishly said on TV might be frequently needed in the case of Luke Shaw. The game was still in the balance when Maguire stepped up to challenge Abraham on the edge of the United box. Maguire calmly took possession, leaving Abraham on the floor in the process, and strode away, setting in motion the attack that ended with Martial bundling home. Lampard went for an early morning run around Old Trafford to prepare for his Premier League debut as Chelsea manager. The Blues' record goal-scorer has made some bold decisions already, despite being barely a month into his new job. He has picked seven home-grown players in his senior squad: the four in action against United - Abraham, Mason Mount, Andreas Christensen and Fikayo Tomori - the currently injured duo of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi, and promising defender Reece James. This was Chelsea's heaviest ever opening-day league defeat in what is their 104th league season It is an unprecedented number for the Roman Abramovich era. But, while it is the philosophy of promoting youth from within that Chelsea's fans have wanted, it comes with risk. For every powerful fourth-minute shot from Abraham that thunders off the inside of a post, there is the moment Mount had when, presented with a shooting opportunity from an angle on the right of the United box, the 20-year-old elected for a cut-back, which ran disappointingly through for new United defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka. This video can not be played Chelsea made too many mistakes - Lampard Given that investment in youth, this summer's transfer ban and the departure of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid, Lampard took a brave decision to sell David Luiz to Arsenal on deadline day. The Brazilian may not be the most reliable defender but his experience is valuable and Luiz's replacement on Sunday, Kurt Zouma, struggled badly. He not only conceded the penalty but was also caught out of position and gave away possession, both expensive mistakes in an era when top teams routinely build from the back. Chelsea's inability to stem the flow of goals in the second half will be a major concern for Lampard, whose name was still being sung heartily by the visiting fans at the end. United's opening goal came from the penalty spot. Referee Anthony Taylor played an excellent advantage after Andreas Pereira had been fouled, allowing play to continue as Zouma brought Rashford down. Never a regular penalty taker for club or country, two of the three penalties Rashford has scored were in the World Cup last-16 shoot-out with Colombia last year and in the fourth-minute of injury-time to give United their memorable Champions League victory against Paris St-Germain in March. Rashford held his nerve to fire United ahead from the penalty spot before showing great composure to make it 3-0 after a sublime pass by Paul Pogba Frank Lampard suffered the heaviest defeat by a Chelsea manager in his first match in charge since Danny Blanchflower lost 7-2 to Middlesbrough in December 1978. For a second consecutive season, Manchester United's first goal of their Premier League campaign has been a penalty (also Paul Pogba v Leicester City in 2018-19). Chelsea will end the day in the Premier League relegation-zone for the first time since 30 September 2000. Since his debut in September 2015, Anthony Martial has scored 49 goals in all competitions for Manchester United - more than any other player. The last manager before Frank Lampard to lose by four or more goals in his first Premier League match in charge was Gustavo Poyet in October 2013 (Swansea City 4-0 Sunderland). Chelsea's starting XI average age was 25 years and 199 days - compared to Manchester United's average age of 24 years and 227 days. United have a full week to prepare for the game at Wolves on 19 August (20:00 BST). Before then, Chelsea play two games - the Uefa Super Cup against Liverpool in Instanbul on Wednesday (20:00) and a home league game with Leicester next Sunday (16:30).

Death toll rises as typhoon moves up China coastTwenty-eight are killed and more than five million affected as Typhoon Lekima hits China.China,"This video can not be played Dramatic rescues after typhoon Lekima causes floods in China The death toll from Typhoon Lekima in China has risen to 32 with another 16 people missing, local authorities say. Officials say about five million people in Zhejiang province have been affected, with over one million evacuated to safe spaces. Lekima made landfall in the early hours of Saturday in Wenling, between Taiwan and China's financial capital Shanghai, packing strong winds and heavy rain. It was moving further north up the east coast on Sunday. Most of the deaths were in the city of Wenzhou where torrential downpours caused a landslide, state media said. The landslide occurred after a barrier lake - or natural dam - formed, pooling water from the heavy rains before collapsing. Emergency crews battled to save stranded motorists from floods and searched for survivors in the rubble of damaged buildings. Rescuers search for survivors following a landslide in Wenzhou In Zhejiang province, Lekima damaged crops and 34,000 houses. The direct economic loss amounts to 14.57 billion yuan (Â£1.7 billion), state media said. How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Footage on Sunday from state broadcaster CCTV showed rescue workers on boats in Linhai city where streets were completely submerged in water. Lekima has now passed over Shanghai and is expected to hit Shandong province later on Sunday. Cars were left partially submerged in water in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province Shanghai evacuated some 250,000 residents. More than 3,200 flights have been cancelled due to the typhoon with Shanghai, Beijing and other cities grounding planes. Lekima is the ninth typhoon to hit China so far this year. Weather experts quoted by Xinhua news agency said it was among the top three strongest typhoons to have ever hit Zhejiang. It was initially given China's highest level of weather warning but was later downgraded to an ""orange"" level. Chinese weather forecasters said the storm, which had winds of 187km/h (116mph) when it made landfall, was moving north at 15km/h. It earlier passed Taiwan, skirting its northern tip and causing a handful of injuries and some property damage. Lekima is one of two typhoons in the western Pacific at the moment. Further east, Typhoon Krosa is spreading heavy rain across the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. It is moving north-west and could strike Japan some time next week, forecasters said.

Government launches investigation into power cut,"Clapham Junction station in south London was one of the areas where lights went out The government has launched an investigation into Friday's huge power cut which affected nearly one million people across England and Wales. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said a committee will look at what happened. Train passengers were stranded, traffic lights failed to work and thousands of homes were plunged into darknessduring the blackout. The investigation will consider whether the procedures followed by National Grid are fit for purpose. Mrs Leadsom said the power outages ""caused enormous disruption"", adding: ""National Grid must urgently review and report to Ofgem."" The Energy Emergencies Executive Committee, carrying out the inquiry, will also explore whether there were any technical problems, plus how well National Grid communicated about the incident and resolved the problem. The outage caused ""enormous disruption"", said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom Energy regulator Ofgem has already demanded an ""urgent detailed report"" into what went wrong and could take enforcement action, including a fine. And the National Grid has promised it will ""learn the lessons"" - but added its systems were not to blame. 'We were stuck on a train with no food or toilets' Why the power cut caused so much disruption Major power failure affects homes and transport The outage happened after problems at two power stations - the gas-fired station at Little Barford in Bedfordshire at 16:58 BST and then at Hornsea offshore wind farm two minutes later. Blackouts were reported across the Midlands, the south east, south west, north west and north east of England, and Wales. National Grid power was restored by 17:40 BST on Friday but there was a knock-on effect for some train services, which continued to be disrupted into Saturday. National Grid's director of operations Duncan Burt said he did not believe that a cyber-attack or unpredictable wind power generation was to blame. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, Mr Burt acknowledged the ""immense disruption"" the blackout had caused. He said the near-simultaneous loss of two generators was more than the grid was routinely prepared for, prompting automatic safety systems to shut off power to some places. ""We think that worked well; we think the safety protection systems across the industry, on generators and on the network, worked well to secure and keep the grid safe, to make sure that we preserved power to the vast proportion of the country,"" he said. This video can not be played The National Grid's operations director explains why nearly one million people lost power on Friday But he said the industry needed to examine whether these safety systems were set up correctly to have ""minimal impact"" on people's daily lives. Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the impact of the power cut was ""unacceptable"" at a time when National Grid reported Â£1.8bn in profits and increased dividends to shareholders. All services in and out of King's Cross station were suspended during Friday's rush hour Police were called to help travellers during the huge disruption on the railways on Friday, with delayed passengers stranded for hours. Disruption continued into Saturday for some routes, with services to and from King's Cross station in London particularly badly hit. Passenger Dayna McAlpine told BBC Radio 5 Live her train took nearly 13 hours to reach London King's Cross from Edinburgh - a journey which would normally take less than five hours. ""By hour seven things were starting to get pretty tense,"" she said. ""People were threatening to self-evacuate off the train... Food ran out about five hours ago."" Passengers on a train near Kentish Town station got off and began walking along the tracks At the worst point of the power cut, about 500,000 people were affected in Western Power Distribution's area - including 44,500 customers in Wales - while 110,000 Northern Powergrid customers also lost power. In London and south-east England, 300,000 people were affected, UK Power Networks said, and another 26,000 customers were without power in north-west England. Northern Powergrid said the problems had affected Newcastle Airport and the metro system in the city. At Ipswich Hospital,a back-up generator which was supposed to supply power to outpatient areas did not work after the power cut, causing problems for 15 minutes before power was restored.

'Lessons to learn' from blackout - National Grid,"This video can not be played The National Grid's operations director explains why nearly one million people lost power on Friday National Grid has said it will ""learn the lessons"" after nearly one million people across England and Wales lost power on Friday. But director of operations Duncan Burt told the BBC that its systems ""worked well"" after the ""incredibly rare event"" of two power stations disconnecting. He said he did not believe that a cyber-attack or unpredictable wind power generation was to blame. The government has announced an investigation into what happened. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she is asking the Energy and Emergencies Executive Committee to carry out the investigation, which will look at whether National Grid's procedures are ""fit for purpose"". Regulator Ofgem has demanded an ""urgent detailed report"" into what went wrong. It said it could take enforcement action, including a fine, after train passengers were stranded, traffic lights failed to work and thousands of homes lost power during the blackout. National Grid power was restored by 17:40 BST on Friday but some train services continued to be disrupted on Saturday. 'We were stuck on a train with no food or toilets' Why the power cut caused so much disruption Major power failure affects homes and transport The power cut happened at about 17:00 BST on Friday, National Grid said, with blackouts across the midlands, the south east, south west, north west and north east of England, and Wales. National Grid said its systems were not to blame. Industry experts said a gas-fired power station at Little Barford, Bedfordshire, failed at 16:58 followed, two minutes later, by the Hornsea offshore wind farm disconnecting from the grid. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Burt acknowledged the ""immense disruption"" the blackout had caused. He said the near-simultaneous loss of two generators was more than the grid was routinely prepared for, prompting automatic safety systems to shut off power to some places. ""We think that worked well; we think the safety protection systems across the industry, on generators and on the network, worked well to secure and keep the grid safe, to make sure that we preserved power to the vast proportion of the country,"" he said. But he said the industry needed to examine whether these safety systems were set up correctly to have ""minimal impact"" on people's daily lives. RWE, owner of the Little Barford power station, said it shut down temporarily on Friday as a routine response to a technical issue, and called for National Grid and Ofgem to investigate the ""wider system issues"". And Orsted, the owner of the Hornsea offshore wind farm, said automatic systems on Hornsea One ""significantly reduced"" power around the same time others failed. A spokesperson added: ""We are investigating the cause, working closely with National Grid System Operator, which balances the UK's electricity system."" Police were called to help travellers during the huge disruption on the railways on Friday, with delayed passengers stranded for hours. Disruption continued into Saturday for some routes. London North Eastern Railway, which runs between King's Cross and the north of England and Scotland, said services were returning to normal, but a small number of trains were cancelled Great Northern services are still facing disruption and passengers are being advised to check their train's status before travelling Thameslink services have returned to normal. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which operates Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern and Gatwick Express, says it is investigating why the power cut had such a severe effect on its trains. Thameslink trains were particularly badly impacted as GTR had to deploy technicians to manually restart trains north of London. All services in and out of King's Cross station were suspended during Friday's rush hour Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the impact of the power cut was ""unacceptable"" at a time when National Grid reported Â£1.8bn in profits and increased dividends to shareholders. By Ben Ando, BBC News correspondent Yesterday's power outage caused chaos for thousands of rail passengers left stranded as the electric trains they were on ground to a halt when the power supply went dead. But although the National Grid restored power inside a couple of hours, many passengers remained stuck on hot, stuffy trains because the drivers couldn't get them started again and had to wait for technicians to come out. The trains worst affected are the relatively new Class 700 and Class 717 commuter trains built in Germany by Siemens to specifications laid down by the Department for Transport. They were introduced onto the British network for Thameslink and Great Northern services from 2014. When the power died, the trains would have switched to back up batteries to keep essential systems going. Passengers on a train near Kentish Town station got off and began walking along the tracks But getting the trains restarted once the power came back was not straightforward. Drivers found that in some cases the on-board computers had shut systems down more fully, so a technician was needed. The Class 700 fleet is normally fast and efficient, but GTR has already launched an investigation with Network Rail and Siemens to examine what went wrong this time. And it's likely that the manufacturers will be asked to examine how they respond to serious power failures in future. Battery performance is also likely to come under scrutiny - a back-up diesel generator cannot be fitted to these trains because they spend much of their lives in long tunnels. King's Cross was one of the worst-hit stations, with all trains suspended for several hours. Passenger Dayna McAlpine told BBC Radio 5 Live her train took nearly 13 hours to reach London King's Cross from Edinburgh - a journey which would normally take less than five hours. ""By hour seven things were starting to get pretty tense,"" she said. ""People were threatening to self-evacuate off the train... Food ran out about five hours ago."" Others on social media reported having travelled for 12 hours, while some rail passengers were stuck on trains until the early hours of the morning. Allow Twitter content?

"The mystery of the screaming schoolgirlsWhen panic gripped a school one day, the girls affected did not know they were in the ""mass hysteria capital of the world'.","It was a quiet Friday morning last July when pandemonium broke out at a school in north-east Malaysia. Siti Nurannisaa, a 17-year-old student, was at the centre of the chaos. This is her account of what happened. The assembly bells rang. I was at my desk feeling sleepy when I felt a hard, sharp tap on my shoulder. I turned round to see who it was and the room went dark. Fear overtook me. I felt a sharp, splitting pain in my back and my head started spinning. I fell to the floor. Before I knew it, I was looking into the 'otherworld'. Scenes of blood, gore and violence. The scariest thing I saw was a face of pure evil. It was haunting me, I couldn't escape. I opened my mouth and tried to scream but no sound came out. I passed out. Siti's outburst triggered a powerful chain reaction that ripped through the school. Within minutes students in other classrooms started screaming, their frantic cries ricocheting through the halls. One girl fainted after claiming to have seen the same ""dark figure"". Classroom doors slammed shut at the Ketereh national secondary school (SMK Ketereh) in Kelantan as panicked teachers and students barricaded themselves in. Islamic spiritual healers were called to perform mass prayer sessions. By the end of the day, 39 people were deemed to have been affected by an outbreak of ""mass hysteria"". Mass hysteria, or mass psychogenic illness, as it's also known, is the rapid spread of physical symptoms such as hyperventilation and twitching among a substantial group of people - with no plausible organic cause. ""It is a collective stress response prompting an overstimulation of the nervous system,"" says American medical sociologist and author Robert Bartholomew. ""Think of it as a software problem."" The mechanisms behind mass hysteria are often poorly understood and it is not listed in the DSM - the manual of mental disorders. But psychiatrists like Dr Simon Wessely from King's College Hospital in London view it as a ""collective behaviour"". ""The symptoms experienced are real - fainting, palpitations, headaches, nausea, shaking and even fits,"" he says. ""It is often attributed to a medical condition but for which no conventional biomedical explanation can be found."" Transmission, he adds, ""is largely due to psychological and social factors"". Outbreaks have been recorded around the world, with cases dating back as early as the Middle Ages. Incidents in Malaysia were particularly prevalent among factory workers during the 1960s. Today it largely affects children in schools and dormitories. One of many mosques in the town of Ketereh Robert Bartholomew spent decades researching the phenomenon in Malaysia. He calls the South East Asian country ""the mass hysteria capital of the world"". ""It is a deeply religious and spiritual country where many people, especially those from rural and conservative states, believe in the powers of traditional folklore and the supernatural."" But the issue of hysteria remains a sensitive one. In Malaysia, cases have involved adolescent girls from the Malay Muslim ethnic majority more than any other group. ""There's no denying that mass hysteria is an overwhelmingly female phenomenon,"" says Mr Bartholomew. ""It's the one constant in the [academic] literature."" Surrounded by lush green rice fields, the sleepy Malay village of Padang Lembek sits on the outskirts of Kelantan's capital Kota Bharu. It's a small, tight-knit community where everyone knows each other, the sort of place that would make many Malaysians reminisce about how their country used to be. There are family-run restaurants, beauty salons, a mosque and good neighbourhood schools. Siti's family at their home in Padang Lembek Siti and her family live in a modest, single-storey terrace house, easily distinguishable by its weathered red roof and green exterior. An old, sturdy motorbike she shares with her best friend Rusydiah Roslan, who lives nearby, is parked outside. ""We rode it to school on the morning I was possessed by 'spirits',"" Siti says. Like any other teenager, stress affects Siti. She says she felt it most during her final school year in 2018, when all-important examinations loomed. ""I was preparing for weeks, trying to memorise my notes but something was wrong,"" she says. ""It felt like nothing was going into my head."" The incident at school during the July study period left Siti unable to sleep or eat properly. It took her a month of rest before she returned to her - almost-regular - self. An outbreak of mass hysteria usually begins with what experts call an ""index case"", the first person to become affected. In this story, that is Siti. ""It doesn't happen overnight,"" says Robert Bartholomew. ""It starts with one child and then quickly spreads to others because of an exposure to a pressure-cooker environment of stress."" And all it takes is a major spike in anxiety in a group situation, like seeing a fellow classmate faint or have a fit - to trigger a reaction in another person. Siti compares her experiences with spirits as having her ""eyes covered"" Rusydiah Roslan will never forget seeing her best friend in that state. ""Siti was screaming uncontrollably,"" she says. ""No one knew what to do. We were afraid to even touch her."" The girls have always been close but the events of the past year have strengthened their bond. ""It helps us to talk about what happened,"" Rusydiah says. ""It helps us to move on."" From the outside, SMK Ketereh looks like any other Malaysian high school. Giant trees shade its premises and its walls have fresh coats of grey and bright yellow paint. Makcik(aunty) Zan runs a popular stall across the street selling local rice dishes. She was preparing food a year ago, on that humid July morning, when she heard screams. ""The cries were deafening,"" the elderly vendor says as she serves up dishes of grilled mackerel, yellow curry and steaming glutinous rice. The SMK Ketereh, Siti Nurannisaa's school, sits along a busy road in the Kelantan countryside She saw at least nine girls being carried out of their classrooms, kicking and screaming. She recognised some of them as regulars at her stall. ""It was a heartbreaking sight,"" she says. She later saw a witch doctor enter a small prayer room with his assistants. ""They were in there for hours,"" she recalls. ""I pity the children for what they must have seen that day."" Security at SMK Ketereh has been heightened since the July 2018 incident. ""In order to prevent outbreaks from spiralling again, we restructured our safety programme and had a change in staff,"" a senior staff member told the BBC on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media. Daily prayer and psychology sessions have also been introduced, he said. ""Safety comes first but we also know the importance of aftercare for our students."" It is unclear what such sessions involve or if they have been designed by mental health professionals. He would not provide further details. Experts like Robert Bartholomew strongly advocate that Malaysian students be educated about the phenomenon, given its prevalence in the country. ""They should be taught why mass hysteria happens and how it spreads,"" he says. ""It's also important they learn how to cope with stress and anxiety."" Malaysian education ministry officials have not responded to a request for comment. SMK Ketereh is one of 68 secondary schools in Kelantan. But it is far from the only one to have witnessed an outbreak. In early 2016, mass hysteria took hold across many schools in the state. ""Officials could not handle the multiple outbreaks and shut all the schools,"" said Firdaus Hassan, a local reporter. He and TV cameraman Chia Chee Lin remember a febrile atmosphere that April. ""It was mass hysteria season and cases were happening non-stop, spreading from one school to another,"" says Chia. One case in the nearby town of Pengkalan Chepaattracted significant media attention. Students and teachers were described in reports as becoming ""possessed"" after seeing a ""dark, shadowy figure"" lurking around the compound. About 100 people were affected. Graduate Siti Ain (pictured right) with her mother, who sells drinks and snacks outside the school Siti Ain, who studied at SMK Pengkalan Chepa 2, says she will remember it as being ""the most haunted school in all of Malaysia"". ""The scare lasted hours but it took months for life to return to normal,"" the now 18-year-old says. She shows us a secluded spot next to a basketball court. ""This is where it first started,"" she says, pointing to a row of tree stumps. ""My schoolmates said they saw an elderly woman standing amongst the trees. ""I couldn't see what they saw but their reactions were real."" A row of stumps, where large Angsana trees used to stand Malaysia's fascination with ghosts dates back centuries and is deep-rooted in shamanic tradition and South East Asian folk mythology. Children grow up hearing stories about dead infants calledtoyol- invoked by shamans using black magic - and other terrifying vampiric ghosts like thepontianakandpenanggalan, vengeful powerful female spirits that feed on the living. Trees and burial sites are common settings for these eerie tales. These locations stoke fears that feed into superstitious beliefs. It's hard to determine what really happened that day at Pengkalan Chapa 2 but officials wasted no time in tackling what they believed to be the source of the problem. ""We watched from our classrooms as workers came with electric saws to cut down the trees,"" Siti Ain says. ""The old trees were beautiful and it was sad to see them go but I understood why."" Like many students here, she sees what happened that day not as an outbreak of mass hysteria but as a supernatural event. In 2016 a ""mass hysteria outbreak"" was reported at this sprawling multi-storey school But this isn't a phenomenon confined to Islamic schools in deeply religious areas. Dr Azly Rahman, a US-based, Malaysian anthropologist described an episode of mass hysteria in 1976 at an elite boarding school he attended in neighbouring Kuantan city. ""All hell broke loose"" during a campus singing competition when a female student claimed to have spotted ""a smiling Buddhist monk"" on top of a nearby dormitory. ""She let out a bloodcurdling scream,"" he recalls. As more of Malaysia's forests are lost in the name of development, some believe that spirits have lost their final resting places Witch doctors were brought in to perform exorcisms on 30 affected girls. ""Their role was to mediate between the living and the dead. But it's important for society today to look to logical explanations behind such outbreaks,"" Dr Rahman says. Siti Nurannisaa and her family were given the scientific and medical language of mass hysteria to understand the events of a year ago. ""It would hurt any parent to see their child suffer like ours has,"" says doting father and former military man Azam Yaacob. He insists that ""nothing was wrong"" with Siti psychologically. In the wake of the incident they turned to Zaki Ya, a spiritual healer with 20 years of experience. ""Science can't fully explain the supernatural,"" says Zaki Ya At his centre in Ketereh, he greets us with a warm smile. ""Apa khabar, how are you?"" He abides by the teachings of the Koran, Islam's holy book, and also believes in the power of Jinn - spirits in Middle Eastern and Islamic cosmology that""appear in a variety of shapes and forms"",external. ""We share our world with these unseen beings,"" Zaki Ya says. ""They are good or bad and can be defeated by faith."" ""Cursed"" items rest on a table at Zaki Ya's spiritual centre Islamic scriptures adorn the centre's bright green walls. Bottles of holy water are stacked up high near its entrance. In a corner by a window, a collection of mysterious objects are gathered on a table - rusty knives, combs, orbs and even a dried seahorse. ""These are cursed items,"" Zaki Ya warns. ""Please do not touch anything."" Zaki Ya met Siti Nurannisaa and her family after the 2018 outbreak at SMK Ketereh. ""I've been guiding Siti and she has been getting better with my help,"" he says proudly. He shows me a video of another girl he ""treated"". She is seen thrashing about wildly on the floor and screaming before being restrained by two men. Possession, Jinn and Britain's backstreet exorcists Minutes later, Zaki Ya enters the room and approaches the visibly distressed girl. He holds her head and chants Islamic verses, and she appears to calm down. ""Women are softer and physically weaker,"" he tells us. ""That makes them more susceptible to spiritual possession."" He professes to understand that mental health plays a role in many of the cases he sees, but is emphatic about the power of Jinn. ""Science is important but it can't fully explain the supernatural,"" he says. ""Non-believers won't understand these attacks unless it happens to them."" An ""anti-hysteria kit"" costs more than $2000 A more controversial approach comes from a team of Islamic academics in Pahang, the largest state in peninsular Malaysia. Priced at a hefty 8,750 Malaysian ringgit (Â£1,700; $2,100), the ""anti-hysteria kit"" they offer consists of items including formic acid, ammonia inhalants, pepper spray and bamboo ""pincers"". Wooden pincers are meant to induce pain in a possessed person and drive out demons and spirits ""According to the Koran, evil spirits are unable to tolerate such items,"" says Dr Mahyuddin Ismail, who developed the kit with the aim of ""combining science and the supernatural"". ""Our kits have been used by two schools and solved more than 100 cases,"" he says. There's no scientific evidence to back up these claims. Dr Mahyuddin Ismail poses with his ""anti-hysteria kit"" outside his office at the Universiti Malaysia Pahang The kit drew widespread criticism upon its release in 2016. Former minister Khairy Jamaluddin called it ""the mark of a backward society"". ""It's nonsensical, absurd superstition. We want Malaysians to be scientific and innovative, not remain entrenched in supernatural beliefs."" But clinical psychologists, like Irma Ismail from Universiti Putra Malaysia, do not discount such beliefs when it comes to mass hysteria cases. ""Malaysian culture has its own take on the phenomenon,"" she says. ""A more realistic approach is integrating spiritual beliefs with adequate mental health treatment."" A bird's eye view of Kelantan's capital city Kota Bharu If Malaysia is the ""mass hysteria capital of the world"", Kelantan on the north-east coast is ground zero. ""It is no coincidence that Kelantan, the most religiously conservative of all Malaysian states, is also the one most prone to outbreaks,"" Robert Bartholomew says. Known as the Muslim-majority nation's Islamic heartland, Kelantan is one of two states ruled by the conservative opposition Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Unlike the rest of the country, Kelantan's week follows the Islamic calendar - with the working week beginning on Sundays and ending on Thursdays to free up Fridays for prayers. ""This is a different side of Malaysia,"" says Ruhaidah Ramli, a sprightly 82-year-old vendor at a local market. ""Life here is simple. It isn't busy or stressful like it is in [the capital] Kuala Lumpur."" A woman walks past a mural at the central Siti Khadijah market in Kota Bharu Are religion and supernatural beliefs related? Academic Afiq Noor argues that the stricter implementation of Islamic law in school in states such as Kelantan is linked to the surge in outbreaks. ""Malay Muslim girls attend school under rigid religious discipline,"" he says. ""They observe stricter dress codes and can't listen to music which isn't Islamic."" The theory is that such a constricted environment could be creating more anxiety. Similar outbreaks have also been reported in Catholic convents and monasteries across Mexico, Italy and France, in schools in Kosovo and even among cheerleaders in a rural North Carolina town. Mexico, where exorcisms are on the rise The town that nearly danced itself to death Each case is unique - the cultural context is different and hence the form varies. But it ultimately remains the same phenomenon and researchers argue that the impact of strict, conservative cultures on those affected by mass hysteria is clear. To clinical psychologists like Steven Diamond, the ""painful, frightening and embarrassing symptoms"" often associated with mass hysteria could be ""indicative of a frustrated need for attention"". ""Might their remarkable symptoms be saying something about how they are really feeling inside but are unable or unwilling to allow themselves to consciously acknowledge, feel or verbalise?""he wrote in a 2002 article for Psychology Today.,external 2019 has been a quiet year for Siti Nurannisaa. ""I have been doing okay. It's been calm for me,"" she says. ""I haven't seen bad things for months now."" She's lost touch with much of her cohort after graduating from SMK Ketereh already but this doesn't bother her - she tells me she's always kept a small circle of friends. She is now taking a break from study before going on to university. Siti and her ginger cat Chomel On the day we meet, she shows me a shiny black microphone. ""Karaoke has always been a favourite pastime of mine,"" she says. Pop songs by Katy Perry and homegrown Malaysian diva Siti Nurhaliza are her favourites. Singing proved to be a great stress-reliever for the young girl during her ordeal. It helped her gain some confidence back after the very traumatic incident. ""Stress makes my body weak but I have been learning how to manage it,"" she says. ""My goal is to be normal and happy."" Siti and her father Azam Yacob, at their home On that note, I ask her what she wants to be in future. ""A policewoman,"" she says. ""They are brave and aren't afraid of anything.""

"PM to create jail space for 10,000 new prisoners","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""Stop-and-search works."" An extra 10,000 new prison places will be created and stop-and-search powers expanded, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has promised. The first new prison in the Â£2.5bn programme will be at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire, whereexpansion plans have previously been announced. The government said the plans showed it was ""serious about fighting crime"". But Labour's shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, said ""random"" stop-and-search was a ""recipe for unrest"". The government's focus on law and order will add to speculation that No 10 is preparing for an autumn general election, said BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. But Mr Johnson has previouslyruled out an election before October 31. Reality Check: Have police numbers dropped? Does stop and search reduce crime? The prison and policing plans for England and Wales follow other recent initiatives from Downing Street about the NHS and immigration. Last month, the government alsopledged to recruit20,000 extra police officers, nearly replacing the number of officers lost since the Conservatives returned to power. Policing Minister Kit Malthouse told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We know the greatest deterrent to crime is the perception of the likelihood of getting caught. Prevention is really what we're after."" But on the same programme, Lord Heseltine accused the government of ""economic irresponsibility"", saying it was ""trashing money around the place like there is no tomorrow, aimed very specifically at very clear electoral targets"". The 10,000 new prison places are expected to be created by building new jails and expanding existing ones, at a cost of up to Â£2.5bn. The first new prison will be built alongside the maximum security jail at HMP Full Sutton, the Ministry of Justice said. But plans already announced there have drawn objections from police, who said it would increase violent crime in the jail. Previously decommissioned prison venues will also be refurbished and brought back into use, the government said. Mr Johnson wrotein the Mail on Sunday,externalthat the investment was ""long overdue"". He also argued that too many serious violent or sexual offenders are coming out of prison long before they should, and tougher sentences were needed. ""We need to come down hard on crime,"" he wrote. ""That means coming down hard on criminals. We need to reverse the balance of fear. ""I want the criminals to be afraid - not the public."" In 2016, former justice secretary Liz Truss unveiled a white paper promising a Â£1.3bn investment in prisons, addingan extra 10,000 places by 2020- later pushed back to 2022. The Ministry of Justice said it was on course to create 3,360 places at two new prisons by 2023. Government sources said the Â£2.5bn funding would allow it to deliver 10,000 places on top of that, including projects already at a planning stage such as HMP Full Sutton. But a spokesman for the Prison Reform Trust said the suggestion that all 10,000 places were new was ""misleading"" given earlier announcements. The trust said prisons needed 12,000 more places just to eliminate overcrowding and accommodate new prisoners who have already been sentenced. ""We know the aggressive rhetoric of 'prison works' invariably drives up the use of imprisonment long before the capacity to deal with that has been created,"" said Peter Dawson, the trust's director. ""Tough rhetoric is no substitute for understanding the evidence."" A pilot scheme making it easier for police to search people without reasonable suspicion, in places where serious violence may occur, is being extended to all 43 forces across England and Wales. In March, when he was home secretary, Sajid Javidfirst introduced the scheme in seven police force areas: London, the West Midlands, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, South Wales and Greater Manchester. The latest move will see restrictions over using section 60 stop-and-search lifted more widely, giving officers across England and Wales a limited time period to search anyone in a designated area in order to prevent violent crime. Inspectors will now be able to use section 60 without seeking the authorisation of a senior officer and there will be a lower threshold for its use, with police only needing to reasonably believe that violence ""may"" occur, not that it will. Police given more stop and search powers The key facts about rising knife crime The Home Office and Number 10 said their decision to extend stop-and-search was based on ""initial feedback"" from the three-month trial in seven areas. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Stop-and-search works. We hear again and again from police that [they] need to be empowered."" She said powers needed to be used in the ""right, legal and professional way"" but their use was supported by families of victims of knife crime, from ""communities that have suffered so much trauma and pain"". The announcement comes days aftera police officer was stabbed in the headwith a machete in east London. Stop-and-search powers have been controversial for many years, with evidence that they are sometimes misused and that they disproportionately target black people. In 2017-18, black people were9.5 times more likely to be searched,externalthan white people, a gap which has grown in recent years. Jonathan Hinds, who campaigns against its misuse, told BBC Radio 5 Live he had been stopped three times within a mile by three different police officers. He warned black people faced being ""targeted by these draconian powers"". London was one of seven areas where the stop-and-search pilot scheme was initially trialled Elena Noel, co-chair of Southwark's anti-knife crime forum, said action was needed to halt the ""crisis"" but ""independent data does not show that stop-and-search stops knife crime and violence"". Astudy of stop-and-search over a decade in London,externalby the College of Policing found it to be ""inconsistent"" and ""weak"" as a deterrent. Labour accused the Conservatives of trying to ""appear tough"" instead of dealing with the root causes of crime. Ms Abbott said evidence-based stop-and-search was an important tool, but ""random stops have only poisoned police community relations"" and were a ""tried and tested recipe for unrest"". The Liberal Democrats' home affairs spokesman Ed Davey accused Mr Johnson of repeating the ""failed policies of the past"" and said extending stop-and-search disproportionately affected black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Talking tough on crime will always grab headlines for governments and that's exactly what Boris Johnson's done. These announcements may address public concern about violent crime and follow the priorities Mr Johnson set for his government on day one. But they are also the type of promises the prime minister would like to point to during an election campaign. And the announcements, coming in such quick succession from the government, add to the sense that it is preparing to go to the polls. Whether the prime minister is forced into it through a vote of no confidence, or chooses to call for one himself, there is an increasing sense that an election isn't far away - either before or after the Brexit deadline of 31 October. Promising to do something is one thing, but paying for it and delivering it is another - and with these policy announcements comes an increasing bill for the Treasury to foot. Tax rises or extra borrowing are a much harder sell for MPs campaigning on the doorstep, so we might have to wait some time to find out exactly where the money's coming from. The Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents police officers, said it welcomed forces across the country being given the same tools to tackle knife crime. John Apter, the federation's national chairman, said: ""We can't have a postcode lottery on keeping the public safe."" ""We are in the grip of a wave of violent crime on a scale we've not seen before, with young people being killed or stabbed on our streets, and we have to do something about it,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. This video can not be played Youth mentor Dijon Joseph and Ch Supt Simon Messinger discuss stop and search He acknowledged concerns about stop-and-search and said police officers would be as professional as possible, with many wearing body cameras.
