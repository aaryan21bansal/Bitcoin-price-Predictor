Ban on petrol and diesel car sales brought forward,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough: ""Now is the moment"" A ban on selling new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars in the UK will be brought forward from 2040 to 2035 at the latest, under government plans. The change comes after experts said 2040 would be too late if the UK wants to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. Boris Johnson unveiled the policy as part of a launch event fora United Nations climate summit in November. He said 2020 would be a ""defining year of climate action"" for the planet. The summit, known as COP26, is being hosted in Glasgow. It is an annual UN-led gathering set up to assess progress on tackling climate change. Sir David Attenborough said at the launch event at London's Science Museum that he was looking forward to COP26 and found it ""encouraging"" that the UK government was launching a ""year of climate action"". ""The longer we leave it... the worse it is going to get,"" he said. ""So now is the moment. It is up to us to organise the nations of the world to do something about it."" How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? Campaign group Extinction Rebellion held a protest outside London's Science Museum to coincide with the event In a statement made ahead of the launch, Mr Johnson said the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars would come even earlier than 2035, if possible. Hybrid vehicles are also now being included in the proposals, which were originally announced in July 2017. People will only be able to buy electric or hydrogen cars and vans, once the ban comes into effect. The change in plans, which will be subject to a consultation, comes after experts warnedthe previous target date of 2040would still leave old conventional cars on the roads following the clean-up date of 2050. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""This phenomenon of global warming is taking its toll"" The Scottish government does not have the power to ban new petrol and diesel cars but has alreadypledged to ""phase out the need""for them by 2032 with measures such as an expansion of the charging network for electric cars. Mr Johnson said the 2050 pledge was necessary because the UK's ""historic emissions"" meant ""we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way"". The announcement comes as COP26's former president Claire OâNeill, who was sacked on Friday, wrote a bitter letteraccusing Mr Johnson of failing to support her work. The prime minister's official spokesperson said Downing Street had ""no comment"" to make on the letter, but thanked Mrs O'Neill for her work towards the conference. He said her replacement would be a ""ministerial post"" with details set out ""in due course."" Mr Johnson did not answer the BBC's David Shukman's questions about the row. Allow Twitter content?

Arena attack brother 'equally guilty of murders',"The Old Bailey heard the case concerns Hashem Abedi's ""role in perpetrating"" the attack The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber was ""just as guilty"" of the murder of the 22 people who died in the attack, his trial has heard. Salman Abedi detonated a ""large home-made improvised explosive device"" outside an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. His brother Hashem Abedi is standing trial at the Old Bailey over his ""role in perpetrating these terrible events"". He denies the murder of 22 people and the attempted murder of others. He also denies conspiring with his brother to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said the siblings spent ""months"" planning the attack, which had been ""both sudden and lethal"" and had had ""nearly 1,000 victims"". He said in addition to the 22 people - men, women, teenagers and a child - who died, a total of 264 ""were physically injured"" while 670 more had since ""reported psychological trauma as a result of these events"".

He said they had also obtained an address in Blackley, north Manchester where they could work on the device and bought a Nissan Micra car to use as a ""de-facto storage facility"". The court heard the flat was ""not an area the two were used to frequenting"" and had been used as a ""safe address from which to operate without unwanted or uninvited interruption"". The resulting bomb was ""detonated in the middle of a crowd in a very public areaâ¦ to kill and to inflict maximum damage"", Mr Penny said. The court heard the Manchester-born brothers had lived alone in the family home in Fallowfield, about four miles south of the city centre, since 2016 when their parents returned to Libya. Mr Penny said they had shown ""some signs of radicalisation"" in the years before the bombing - ""Salman more so than Hashem"". Jurors were told Hashem had worked in a takeaway at the time and had asked if he could take home used vegetable oil cans to sell for scrap, which Mr Penny described as a ""cover story"". A part of one of the cans was found at the scene of the attack. Mr Penny said it was not suggested the brothers had a specific target and the final destination may have been chosen by Salman Abedi alone, but they had a ""shared goal [to] kill, maim and injure as many people as possible"". ""The law is that Hashem Abedi is just as responsible for this atrocityâ¦ as surely as if he had selected the target and detonated the bomb himself,"" he added. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Jurors were shown a map of the city with locations such as Manchester Arena, the Arndale Centre and Victoria Station identified. Mr Penny said the arena was ""one of the busiest and one of the largest"" in Europe and had been filled with the American singer's ""large and diverse fan base"" on the night of the attack. He said the foyer outside it was ""busy and heavily congested with people"" as the crowd left the venue at about 22:30 BST, and in their ""midstâ¦ carrying a heavy rucksack that contained a homemade bombâ¦ was Salman Abedi"". He added that such was the ""ferocity of the explosion"" that it ""dismembered"" the bomber and left a scene ""of destruction and chaos"". Mr Penny said ""significant exhibits from two separate locations"" linked Hashem to the attack. He said his hand and finger marks were found on parts which had been cut from the vegetable oil cans at the brothers' Fallowfield home. Six thumbprints were also discovered on a piece of metal that had been discarded in a bag of rubbish behind a flat in Manchester city centre where Salman Abedi had ""ultimately assembled"" the bomb, he added. The court heard the pieces found at the flat and the home came from the same oil can as the one found in the arena foyer and ""played a pivotal role in the development of this story"". Hashem Abedi denies the murder of 22 people and the attempted murder of others Mr Penny said the bomb was made from three chemicals, two of which the defendant had made various attempts to buy using false online accounts or via other people, some of whom had been ""sufficiently gullible to avail him of their internet accounts"". He said Hashem Abedi had asked a relative if he could use an Amazon account to buy one chemical, but said the third chemical was easily purchased in chemists and police had not traced any acquisition of it by either brother. Jurors heard the brothers had a ""high turnover"" of telephone numbers, some of which were only used for a few days ""to avoid detection"". Records showed Hashem had five mobile numbers between June 2016 and May 2017, Salman had four, and they had shared a further two. The trial continues.

Buttigieg takes early lead in Iowa caucuses chaos,"This video can not be played Buttigieg chokes up as he takes early lead in Iowa result Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are leading in the first vote to choose the Democratic candidate to run against President Donald Trump in November's election. The vote in Iowa has been chaotic, beset by technical problems and delays in reporting results. Iowa's Democratic Party said data from 71% of precincts showed Mr Buttigieg on 26.8%, with Mr Sanders on 25.2%. Elizabeth Warren was third on 18.4% and Joe Biden fourth on 15.4%. Amy Klobuchar was on 12.6%, and Andrew Yang on 1%, according to the other preliminary results released on Tuesday evening from all of Iowa's 99 counties. Tom Steyer and Tulsi Gabbard were on less than 1%. But the state party has still not declared a winner from Monday's vote. Democrats have blamed the delay on a coding error with an app being used for the first time to report the votes. Iowa was the first contest in a string of nationwide state-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, that will culminate in the crowning of a Democratic nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July. Eleven candidates remain in a Democratic field that has already been whittled down from more than two dozen. The results represent the share of delegates needed to clinch the party nomination under America's quirky political system. Iowa awards only 41 of the 1,991 delegates required to become the Democratic White House nominee. In the popular vote count, partial results showed Mr Sanders leading with 32,673 ballots, while Mr Buttigieg was second at 31,353. However, Mr Buttigieg came top in certain rural areas with smaller populations, and so far has more delegates. Ms Warren was third with 25,692, followed by Mr Biden at 16,447 and Ms Klobuchar at 15,470. A simple guide to US primaries and caucuses Listen to Americast, our new US politics podcast Meet the Democrats vying to take on Trump Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price told a news conference on Tuesday evening the fiasco had been ""simply unacceptable"". ""I apologise deeply for this,"" he added of the turmoil, which has provoked calls for Iowa to lose its coveted spot atop the presidential voting calendar. ""This was a coding error,"" he said, while insisting the data was secure and promising a thorough review. This video can not be played 'The story of the night is... this system sucks' State party officials earlier said the problem was not the result of ""a hack or an intrusion"". Officials were being dispatched across the Hawkeye state to retrieve hard-copy results. They were matching those numbers against results reported via a mobile app that many precinct captains said had crashed. The app was developed by tech firm Shadow Inc., run by veterans of Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 presidential campaign. It was put together in just two months and had not been independently tested,external, the New York Times reported, quoting people briefed on the matter by the Iowa Democratic Party. The party in Nevada, where caucuses will be held on 22 February, has reversed a decision to use the company's software. Trump declares 'win' amid Democratic caucus chaos Voters flocked on Monday to more than 1,600 caucus sites, including libraries, high schools and community centres. President Trump said earlier that the Iowa Democratic caucuses had been an ""unmitigated disaster"". If elected, 38-year-old Mr Buttigieg would be the first openly gay US president. He is the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, a city of just over 100,000 people. He is a former Harvard and Oxford University Rhodes scholar, who served as a military intelligence officer in Afghanistan and used to work for global management consultancy McKinsey. Rivals say Mr Buttigieg, who is younger than Macaulay Culkin and Britney Spears, is too inexperienced to be US president. But he says he is transformative outsider who can break the gridlock in Washington and defeat President Trump. Campaigning in Laconia, New Hampshire, on Tuesday evening, Mr Buttigieg welcomed the preliminary results. ""A campaign that started a year ago with four staff members, no name recognition, no money, just a big idea, a campaign that some said should have no business even making this attempt, has taken its place at the front of this race to replace the current president with a better vision for the future,"" he said. We finally have some 2020 Iowa caucuses results to talk about. And they're going to generate a lot of talk - and hand-wringing. There are clear winners, as Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg can both claim some kind of victory, depending on how the final tabulations come in. There's also a clear loser - Joe Biden. He entered Monday leading in some polls and hoping for a strong showing that would put to bed concerns that he is a flawed front-runner. Instead those concerns are wide awake and pacing the room. Unlike candidates like Mr Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Mr Buttigieg, the Biden campaign coffers are thin - and this Iowa performance isn't opening any cash spigots. It could have been worse for the former vice-president - he could have had to give a fourth-place concession speech on Monday night - but the end result is the same. He was unable to land a knock-out blow on fellow moderate Amy Klobuchar, while Mr Buttigieg and Mr Sanders both exit Iowa strengthened, suggesting Mr Biden could be staring at a third-place finish - or worse - in New Hampshire. Until proven otherwise, Biden still has his southern-state firewall, based on support from elderly and black voters. But the flames are licking at his heels. After pumping nearly $800m (Â£610m) into campaigning in Iowa, the rival campaigns expressed dismay at the debacle. Mr Sanders, a Vermont senator, told reporters he was ""obviously disappointed"" at the hold-up, which he said was ""not a good night for democracy"". He said there was no reason to cast ""aspersions"" on the results, but criticised Mr Buttigieg's decision to declare victory on Monday night, despite the lack of any official results. ""I don't know how anybody declares victory before you have an official statement from the election results, we're not even declaring victory,"" Mr Sanders said. Ms Warren, a Massachusetts senator, and former US Vice-President Biden earlier on Tuesday questioned the state party's decision to release partial results. Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders told reporters: ""What we're saying is there are some inconsistencies, that the process, the integrity, is at stake."" What are primaries and caucuses?

"Breaking|Breaking newsButtigieg in early lead in chaotic Iowa caucusesBernie Sanders is narrowly behind in second place, with Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden third and fourth.US & Canada","This video can not be played Buttigieg chokes up as he takes early lead in Iowa result Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders are leading in the first vote to choose the Democratic candidate to run against President Donald Trump in November's election. The vote in Iowa has been chaotic, beset by technical problems and delays in reporting results. Iowa's Democratic Party said data from 71% of precincts showed Mr Buttigieg on 26.8%, with Mr Sanders on 25.2%. Elizabeth Warren was third on 18.4% and Joe Biden fourth on 15.4%. Amy Klobuchar was on 12.6%, and Andrew Yang on 1%, according to the other preliminary results released on Tuesday evening from all of Iowa's 99 counties. Tom Steyer and Tulsi Gabbard were on less than 1%. But the state party has still not declared a winner from Monday's vote. Democrats have blamed the delay on a coding error with an app being used for the first time to report the votes. Iowa was the first contest in a string of nationwide state-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, that will culminate in the crowning of a Democratic nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July. Eleven candidates remain in a Democratic field that has already been whittled down from more than two dozen. The results represent the share of delegates needed to clinch the party nomination under America's quirky political system. Iowa awards only 41 of the 1,991 delegates required to become the Democratic White House nominee. In the popular vote count, partial results showed Mr Sanders leading with 32,673 ballots, while Mr Buttigieg was second at 31,353. However, Mr Buttigieg came top in certain rural areas with smaller populations, and so far has more delegates.

nearing 23:30 here in Washington, so we are going to wind down our live
coverage of another busy day in US politics. We started out explaining what was happening with the
Democratic race for president in Iowa, and we ended it with President Trump's
third State of the Union address. Here's the latest from Iowa, where
Monday's caucuses aimed to decide who Iowans wanted to run against Mr Trump:  Meanwhile, in Washington:  We'll be back tomorrow for live coverage of the ongoing
impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

Paterson 'played God' with women,"Ian Paterson was described as ""charming"" by his patients Thousands of patients were introduced to breast surgeon Ian Paterson. The 59-year-old, who has been found guilty of wounding with intent, appeared trusting, kind and with their best interests at heart. But he left them disfigured and suffering years of mental and physical torment. Here, some of them share their stories. Frances Perks lost her mother and sister to breast cancer, so when a lump showed up on a mammogram when she was 35, she was referred to Paterson. During one consultation, he urged her to have a double mastectomy or risk ""full-blown cancer"". She had her left breast removed and underwent eight other operations at the private Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull, West Midlands. However, she later learned that none had been necessary. The effect on her life has been devastating. ""I was very worried. Because not only mum, but my older sister had died of breast cancer and she was only 40,"" said Mrs Perks, of Burntwood, Staffordshire. Paterson told her she was ""high risk"" because of her family history. ""I had a mammogram once a year, and then an ultrasound every six months. When things did start to crop up, he'd say 'there's something sinister there, I don't like the look of it and because of your family history we need to careful. I think it should come out.' Mrs Perks underwent nine operations at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull By 2008, she had undergone nine operations - the final being a left mastectomy. Paterson had told her, if it were him, he would have both breasts removed, but her insurers would not cover a preventative treatment. ""I had a fear that I could end up with breast cancer, which scared the living daylights out of me,"" she said. ""But when I was told I didn't need any of it, I was so shocked."" Mrs Perks' tissue was studied as part of a review of Paterson's work in 2012. The results showed the lumps had all been benign and the removal of her breast should never have happened. A genetic specialist later reassured her she had only ever been at moderate risk of developing cancer. Paterson's actions did not only affect Mrs Perks physically. The stress of learning her operations were unnecessary caused her to leave her job at a firm of solicitors, and her financial hardship left her with no option but to sell her house. ""I feel hatred - pure hatred,"" she said. ""I did not think I could hate someone as much as I hate him. ""I want to see him suffer because, OK, he might think he's suffered over the last few years but that's not good enough for me. Not for what he's put me through, what I've lost, and how it's affected me mentally and physically."" Breast surgeon needlessly harmed patients Arrogant bully who 'mutilated' patients What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Jade Edgington was just 16 and studying for her A-levels when she found a lump in her breast while in the shower. She was introduced to Paterson at the Spire Hospital and, by the time she was 19, had undergone four invasive operations. She later learned three procedures were unnecessary as the lumps were not even at risk of becoming cancerous. ""He told me we needed to get it out,"" she said. ""He said it wasn't anything scary, but that it was big enough to get it out."" She went on to find three more lumps, and again Paterson said they should be removed. She and her family trusted his opinion. ""[We thought] he's the expert, he knows what he's doing. We went ahead with his advice."" Jade's operations, which happened while she was studying for her A-levels, have left her scarred for life Two years after her last operation she was recalled to be seen by another doctor who was reassessing Paterson's work. ""He came back and said they would have monitored the first lump for 12 months, and may not have taken it out, and the other three operations did not need to happen because I was so young. ""I was 16, I was growing and changing and they would have suggested I didn't have those operations,"" added Ms Edgington, who is now 28 and a bank worker. ""Why put us all through that? You feel almost violated - essentially, someone has stuck a knife in me unnecessarily. ""You can't believe a man of his calibre has put somebody through something like that unnecessarily."" Marie Pinfield (left) and her sister Shirley Moroney were the best of friends Police officer Marie Pinfield was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in August 2006 and asked Paterson for a double mastectomy. However, instead of waking up with the flat chest she expected, the surgeon - who pioneered the controversial ""cleavage-sparing"" surgical technique - had left so much tissue behind she had to wear a bra. She asked for a second operation to correct the work. However, the subsequent delay to chemotherapy and radiotherapy meant she developed secondary cancer in her lung and died in October 2008. Heart of England NHS Trust admitted the second operation would not have been necessary if the double mastectomy had been carried out properly. An independent report found Ms Pinfield could have lived for 10 more years had she received the right initial treatment. Her sister, Shirley Moroney, remembers the first time they met Paterson. ""He was absolutely charming,"" she said. ""He came across as a bit arrogant, but that almost gave you confidence that he would do a good job. ""At the point we had to make a complaint, that arrogance and charm was a difficult combination to work with. ""His attitude was 'how dare you question what I've done for you?'"" Ms Pinfield, a child protection officer with West Midlands Police, had made it clear to Paterson she wanted a double mastectomy. ""He was reluctant to agree to that,"" recalled her sister. ""He said 'lots of people say that - they're in shock - and later on they look at their body shape and they wish they'd made another decision'."" Marie and her niece Ciara ""I was shocked at how much material she still had on her body,"" said Mrs Moroney. ""I waited around to see him. I needed to ask him why she had so much left on her body. And his reaction to me was 'I knew you'd be trouble'. ""He said - I've taken all the mammary glands out. There's no breast tissue left. All that is left is fatty tissue."" Paterson finally agreed to a second procedure. ""On reflection, he should have said: 'Marie, let's do the chemotherapy, let's do the radiotherapy, and we'll sort your body issues out afterwards,"" said Mrs Moroney. ""But he didn't. ""You need a month's recovery after the operation before you can start your chemotherapy and radiotherapy. That delay in her getting treatment is probably the reason the secondary cancer came back so quickly. ""The guy had a God complex. He felt that women could only be in this world if they'd got a breast body shape. ""Marie believed in justice, and right and wrong, doing the job she did. I know she will be looking down on me, willing me to go on."" Cheryl Iommi first met Paterson in 2003 when she was having lumps removed from her right breast at Solihull Hospital. He operated on her twice and told her she appeared to be developing cancer. She later learned the lumps he claimed were a cancer risk were simply scar tissue left behind from his botched procedures. ""When I first met him at Solihull Hospital, he came across as quite aggressive. He wasn't a very nice man on the National Health,"" she said. He put her to sleep, and when she woke up, she discovered he had operated on both sides of her body without her consent. ""He said I'd had a lump in my left side as well,"" recalled Ms Iommi. ""Initially, I felt grateful that he'd got another lump out. But when I saw what he'd done, I thought: 'Oh my word'."" She had been left with a large ""dent"" in her side. To try and correct the damage, she went on to have reconstructive surgery but was never happy with the results. The surgery later ruptured. Over the years, the mother of two continued to find lumps in her breast. In 2010, she decided to go to a private clinic and when she booked an appointment at Spire hospital in Solihull, met Paterson again. ""He was a completely different person this time. As nice as pie. Ian Paterson was charming and confident - but he betrayed his patients' trust ""He said he could take the lumps out in a week, so he did. When I had my check-up he told me 'we're so lucky we caught it when we did'."" Shortly after, Ms Iommi, from Birmingham, was told her surgery needed to be reviewed. She has since seen many medical professionals who have told her the lumps in her breasts are simply scar tissue. Her experience has left her traumatised. ""He's an educated man,"" she said. ""I believed him. I'm still scared now. ""I'm forever at the doctors. I have a lump in my throat due to anxiety. I feel like I've been duped - seriously misled. ""I think he did it for power - and a lack of respect for women. Why mutilate women so they no longer want their partners to look at them?"" Debbie Douglas says she copes with the trauma of having unnecessary surgery by always being 'on the go' In the space of three years, mother-of-three Debbie Douglas lost both her parents to cancer and was diagnosed with breast cancer herself. Paterson performed a cleavage-sparing mastectomy which left her in ""horrendous"" pain. She later learned her cancer was not serious enough to warrant a mastectomy or the exhausting, seven-month course of chemotherapy she endured. ""He never bothered telling me any of that - he just took my breast off,"" said Mrs Douglas, 58, of Birmingham. Paterson recommended immediate reconstructive surgery, which involved taking part of the stomach muscle and using it to shape the new breast. ""I was cut from hip to hip and had all my lymph nodes removed. Afterwards I had no core strength - even now, I struggle to lift my granddaughter. I also got a hernia, which is a common side effect. ""I was grieving for my parents, and I was in horrendous pain for a long time."" Paterson never told her he was giving her one of his signature cleavage-sparing ops. It was only when she was recalled and reviewed, she learnt he had not taken away all the breast tissue. ""I always knew my scar looked different to what it should have done. I don't know why he gave it to me - he didn't explain anything to me about it at all."" She estimates the cost of all her surgery exceeded Â£100,000. ""He was the best surgeon - the top notch consultant. If he'd have told me to stand on one leg to get rid of my cancer, I'd have done it. ""He used to say: 'You can be cured.' He used to say that a lot. ""He's left me with a real fear my cancer will return. I am still paying to get checked out, because I don't want to get cancer."" Patricia Welch was one of 10 patients who gave evidence in Paterson's trial at Nottingham Crown Court Paterson had told Patricia Welch he had found a ""ticking bomb"" of cancerous cells in her breast - she was so scared of the consequences she opted for a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. But when her case was reviewed as Paterson's work was called into question, an expert found her symptoms had been grossly exaggerated. His trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard Paterson embellished the cancer risk to both Mrs Welch and her doctor, and her mastectomy was unnecessary. ""I don't know whether he liked to play God or whether he liked to see the women he saw be grateful for what he'd done and whether he got a kick out of it,"" she said. ""He was just sitting there in open court on a laptop as if he hadn't got a care in the world. ""Hate is a strong word. I've never hated anyone in my life before, but it's pretty close. ""He won't suffer as all of us have been made to suffer all these years. ""I don't think you can ever get over it, because you've got it looking back at you in the mirror every morning. ""What he did. It will never go away. When you go private, you think you've got the best.""

"Ban on petrol and diesel car sales brought forwardBoris Johnson unveils the plan as he launches a ""year of climate action"" alongside Sir David Attenborough.Science & Environment","This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough: ""Now is the moment"" A ban on selling new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars in the UK will be brought forward from 2040 to 2035 at the latest, under government plans. The change comes after experts said 2040 would be too late if the UK wants to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. Boris Johnson unveiled the policy as part of a launch event fora United Nations climate summit in November. He said 2020 would be a ""defining year of climate action"" for the planet. The summit, known as COP26, is being hosted in Glasgow. It is an annual UN-led gathering set up to assess progress on tackling climate change. Sir David Attenborough said at the launch event at London's Science Museum that he was looking forward to COP26 and found it ""encouraging"" that the UK government was launching a ""year of climate action"". ""The longer we leave it... the worse it is going to get,"" he said. ""So now is the moment. It is up to us to organise the nations of the world to do something about it."" How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? Campaign group Extinction Rebellion held a protest outside London's Science Museum to coincide with the event In a statement made ahead of the launch, Mr Johnson said the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars would come even earlier than 2035, if possible. Hybrid vehicles are also now being included in the proposals, which were originally announced in July 2017. People will only be able to buy electric or hydrogen cars and vans, once the ban comes into effect. The change in plans, which will be subject to a consultation, comes after experts warnedthe previous target date of 2040would still leave old conventional cars on the roads following the clean-up date of 2050. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""This phenomenon of global warming is taking its toll"" The Scottish government does not have the power to ban new petrol and diesel cars but has alreadypledged to ""phase out the need""for them by 2032 with measures such as an expansion of the charging network for electric cars. Mr Johnson said the 2050 pledge was necessary because the UK's ""historic emissions"" meant ""we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way"". The announcement comes as COP26's former president Claire OâNeill, who was sacked on Friday, wrote a bitter letteraccusing Mr Johnson of failing to support her work. The prime minister's official spokesperson said Downing Street had ""no comment"" to make on the letter, but thanked Mrs O'Neill for her work towards the conference. He said her replacement would be a ""ministerial post"" with details set out ""in due course."" Mr Johnson did not answer the BBC's David Shukman's questions about the row. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson said: âHosting COP26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change. âAs we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions. âThere can be no greater responsibility than protecting our planet, and no mission that a global Britain is prouder to serve."" At the Science Museum the prime minister added that a ""catastrophic period of global addiction"" to hydrocarbons had led to the planet being ""swaddled in a tea cosy"" of carbon dioxide. But Green Party MPCaroline Lucas said on Twitter,external: ""Carbon emissions are not 'swaddling the planet like a tea cosy'. They are behind wildfires in Australia, soaring temperature records and the broken lives of those least responsible. The PM needs to understand that - and act."" Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push Sacked climate chief 'may sue government' Clean car target 'needs to be sooner' Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said the government was ""right"" to bring forward the ban, but that 2030 would be better than 2035. âA new 2035 target will still leave the UK in the slow-lane of the electric car revolution and meantime allow more greenhouse gases to spew into the atmosphere,"" he said. He said the government could show ""real leadership"" ahead of COP26 by reversing plans to develop ""climate-wrecking roads and runways"". This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? AA president Edmund King said: ""Drivers support measures to clean up air quality and reduce CO2 emissions but these stretched targets are incredibly challenging."" The chief executive of the society of motor manufacturers and traders (SMMT) accused the government of ""moving the goalposts"". ""With current demand for this still expensive technology still just a fraction of sales, it's clear that accelerating an already very challenging ambition will take more than industry investment,"" Mike Hawes said. He said the government's plans must safeguard industry and jobs, as well as ensuring current sales of low emission vehicles were not undermined. Meanwhile Mrs OâNeill accused Mr Johnson of promising money and people to support her work, but failing to deliver either. She also said he admitted to her thathe ""doesn't really get"" climate changeand claimed hehad refused to give Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an official role at COP26. This video can not be played Claire O'Neill: PM 'doesn't really get' climate change Cabinet minister Michael Gove said Mrs O'Neill was a ""close friend"" but that he disagreed with her comments. He toldBBC Radio 5 LiveMr Johnson described his own political outlook as ""that of a green Tory"". Mrs O'Neill said her ""absolute desire for action has not been comfortable for some"", adding that this was ""not about me"" or Mr Johnson - but about working towards ""rapid decarbonisation"". She said at COP26 the UK must ""absolutely double down on taking our great leadership and ambitions in this space, and really energising the world as to why this is a huge opportunity"".

LiveLiveIowa releases partial vote results after glitchesLess than a minute agoNow Preliminary results breakdownPreliminary results breakdown7 minutes ago Buttigieg takes early leadButtigieg takes early lead15 minutes ago Democratic Party to report 62% of resultsDemocratic Party to report 62% of resultsLive Iowa releases partial vote results after glitches  Less than a minute ago,"Donald Trump's third state of the union address has taken place Trump appeared to snub handshake from House speaker Nancy Pelosi; she tore up his speech later His speech focused on what he called the ""great American comeback"" In optimistic speech, he said ""the years of economic decay are over"" Results from Monday's Iowa caucuses trickle in after technical glitches Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, takes narrow lead in early results Roland Hughes, Max Matza, Holly Honderich and Shrai Popat It's
nearing 23:30 here in Washington, so we are going to wind down our live
coverage of another busy day in US politics. We started out explaining what was happening with the
Democratic race for president in Iowa, and we ended it with President Trump's
third State of the Union address. Here's the latest from Iowa, where
Monday's caucuses aimed to decide who Iowans wanted to run against Mr Trump:  Meanwhile, in Washington:  We'll be back tomorrow for live coverage of the ongoing
impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

"Arena attack brother 'equally guilty of murders'Hashem Abedi denies 22 counts of murder over the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, a court is told.","The Old Bailey heard the case concerns Hashem Abedi's ""role in perpetrating"" the attack The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber was ""just as guilty"" of the murder of the 22 people who died in the attack, his trial has heard. Salman Abedi detonated a ""large home-made improvised explosive device"" outside an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. His brother Hashem Abedi is standing trial at the Old Bailey over his ""role in perpetrating these terrible events"". He denies the murder of 22 people and the attempted murder of others. He also denies conspiring with his brother to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said the siblings spent ""months"" planning the attack, which had been ""both sudden and lethal"" and had had ""nearly 1,000 victims"". He said in addition to the 22 people - men, women, teenagers and a child - who died, a total of 264 ""were physically injured"" while 670 more had since ""reported psychological trauma as a result of these events"". Top (left to right): Lisa Lees, Alison Howe, Georgina Callender, Kelly Brewster, John Atkinson, Jane Tweddle, Marcin Klis, Eilidh MacLeod - Middle (left to right): Angelika Klis, Courtney Boyle, Saffie Roussos, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Martyn Hett, Michelle Kiss, Philip Tron, Elaine McIver - Bottom (left to right): Wendy Fawell, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Allen-Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Megan Hurley, Nell Jones Mr Penny said the explosion was the ""culmination of months of planning and preparation"" by the brothers, who had worked together to source chemicals and buy screws and nails to use as ""anti-personnel shrapnel"" in experimental improvised bombs. He said they had also obtained an address in Blackley, north Manchester where they could work on the device and bought a Nissan Micra car to use as a ""de-facto storage facility"". The court heard the flat was ""not an area the two were used to frequenting"" and had been used as a ""safe address from which to operate without unwanted or uninvited interruption"". The resulting bomb was ""detonated in the middle of a crowd in a very public areaâ¦ to kill and to inflict maximum damage"", Mr Penny said. The court heard the Manchester-born brothers had lived alone in the family home in Fallowfield, about four miles south of the city centre, since 2016 when their parents returned to Libya. Mr Penny said they had shown ""some signs of radicalisation"" in the years before the bombing - ""Salman more so than Hashem"". Jurors were told Hashem had worked in a takeaway at the time and had asked if he could take home used vegetable oil cans to sell for scrap, which Mr Penny described as a ""cover story"". A part of one of the cans was found at the scene of the attack. Mr Penny said it was not suggested the brothers had a specific target and the final destination may have been chosen by Salman Abedi alone, but they had a ""shared goal [to] kill, maim and injure as many people as possible"". ""The law is that Hashem Abedi is just as responsible for this atrocityâ¦ as surely as if he had selected the target and detonated the bomb himself,"" he added. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Jurors were shown a map of the city with locations such as Manchester Arena, the Arndale Centre and Victoria Station identified. Mr Penny said the arena was ""one of the busiest and one of the largest"" in Europe and had been filled with the American singer's ""large and diverse fan base"" on the night of the attack. He said the foyer outside it was ""busy and heavily congested with people"" as the crowd left the venue at about 22:30 BST, and in their ""midstâ¦ carrying a heavy rucksack that contained a homemade bombâ¦ was Salman Abedi"". He added that such was the ""ferocity of the explosion"" that it ""dismembered"" the bomber and left a scene ""of destruction and chaos"". Mr Penny said ""significant exhibits from two separate locations"" linked Hashem to the attack. He said his hand and finger marks were found on parts which had been cut from the vegetable oil cans at the brothers' Fallowfield home. Six thumbprints were also discovered on a piece of metal that had been discarded in a bag of rubbish behind a flat in Manchester city centre where Salman Abedi had ""ultimately assembled"" the bomb, he added. The court heard the pieces found at the flat and the home came from the same oil can as the one found in the arena foyer and ""played a pivotal role in the development of this story"". Hashem Abedi denies the murder of 22 people and the attempted murder of others Mr Penny said the bomb was made from three chemicals, two of which the defendant had made various attempts to buy using false online accounts or via other people, some of whom had been ""sufficiently gullible to avail him of their internet accounts"". He said Hashem Abedi had asked a relative if he could use an Amazon account to buy one chemical, but said the third chemical was easily purchased in chemists and police had not traced any acquisition of it by either brother. Jurors heard the brothers had a ""high turnover"" of telephone numbers, some of which were only used for a few days ""to avoid detection"". Records showed Hashem had five mobile numbers between June 2016 and May 2017, Salman had four, and they had shared a further two. The trial continues.

Stillborn babies lost decades ago 'must be traced',"This video can not be played 'Thank you for finding my baby' Families that lost babies more than 40 years ago should be told where their remains are, a cross-party group of MPs has said ahead of a Commons debate. Before the 1980s, when a woman had a miscarriage or gave birth to a stillborn child, medical staff took the baby away quickly. They were rarely given time to grieve or hold their child, which was buried or cremated in an undisclosed place. ""We owe these mums an apology,"" Labour MP Carolyn Harris said. ""The place to start is with the government - the system was wrong and we now have an opportunity to make sure that we make amends for the damage we caused."" The MP for Swansea East's mother gave birth to a stillborn girl in 1958. And her baby was taken away before she could say goodbye. Carolyn Harris's mother gave birth to a stillborn girl in 1958 Her family believes the baby was buried with someone else but they were never told where. After tracing a baby for a friend, Paula Jackson set up a website offering to help other families.

Erivo 'bittersweet' as lone black actor nominee,"This video can not be played Cynthia Erivo: ""I want to make sure it doesn't look like this every single time"" Harriet star Cynthia Erivo says it feels ""bittersweet"" to be the only person of colour to be nominated for an Oscar in this year's acting categories. Erivo is up for a best actress Academy Award for her portrayal of slave-turned-abolitionist Harriet Tubman. But overall,the lack of diversity in this year's Oscar nominationshas sparked widespread criticism. Erivo told BBC Breakfast she wanted it to ""serve as an example of how we need to judge these films"". ""I want to make sure it doesn't look like this every single time,"" she added. Erivo's category rivals include Little Women's Saoirse Ronan, Bombshell star Charlize Theron and Renee Zellweger for Judy. The British actress said it was time for the film industry to take stock and ""figure out how this happens"". ""There are people who also deserve to be a part of this,"" she said. ""Hopefully this year will be a turning point for everyone because we're talking about it out loud and now it can start to make some changes. ""We can't keep doing this and doing nothing about it so maybe now we start doing something."" Cynthia Erivo as Harriet Tubman Erivo is also nominated for best original song, for Harriet's Stand-Up. She said she was drawn to Harriet by her ""humanity and the love that she had"". ""I wanted her legacy to continue,"" she added. There's also been criticism of the lack of female representation in many of the Oscar nominee categories this year. There were no female best director nominees, with Little Women's Greta Gerwig missing out, meaning her nomination for Lady Bird in 2018 was the only one for a female director in the last 10 years. Oscars 2020: How diverse are the nominations? Oscars 2020: Joker leads pack with 11 nominations Oscars 2020: Nominations in full Oscars 2020: 9 snubs, surprises and snippets It was back in 2015 and 2016 that the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag began, when there were no nominees of colour in the acting categories for two years in a row. The Academy said then it had taken steps to have a more diverse membershipbut many users have been tweeting the hashtag again following the announcement of the 2020 nominees. However, it's not isolated to the Academy Awards as both the Golden Globes and the Baftas have alsobeen publically criticised, mostly recently by Joaquin Phoenix. At this year's Baftas, there was no ethnic minority representation in any of the acting categories, with no room even for homegrown talent Erivo. She went on to turn down an invitation to perform at the ceremony,saying she felt it didn't ""represent people of colour in the right light"",external. ""It felt like it was calling on me as an entertainer as opposed to a person who was a part of the world of film,"" she told US website Extra. However, Erivo will be one of the performers during the Oscars ceremony on Sunday, where she is due to sing Stand Up. She said it felt ""crazy"" to find herself in such a position.

Stillborn babies lost decades ago 'must be traced'A group of MPs wants families that lost babies more than 40 years ago to be told where their remains are.Family & Education,"This video can not be played 'Thank you for finding my baby' Families that lost babies more than 40 years ago should be told where their remains are, a cross-party group of MPs has said ahead of a Commons debate. Before the 1980s, when a woman had a miscarriage or gave birth to a stillborn child, medical staff took the baby away quickly. They were rarely given time to grieve or hold their child, which was buried or cremated in an undisclosed place. ""We owe these mums an apology,"" Labour MP Carolyn Harris said. ""The place to start is with the government - the system was wrong and we now have an opportunity to make sure that we make amends for the damage we caused."" The MP for Swansea East's mother gave birth to a stillborn girl in 1958. And her baby was taken away before she could say goodbye. Carolyn Harris's mother gave birth to a stillborn girl in 1958 Her family believes the baby was buried with someone else but they were never told where. After tracing a baby for a friend, Paula Jackson set up a website offering to help other families.

Actor Jim Carrey, who left in 2018, also sold his Facebook stock, citing the fact that the firm had profited from Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Facebook's decision not to change the way it fact-checked political adverts has proved controversial with many. It has argued that it is not right for private companies to censor politicians and called for government regulation to deal with the issue. By contrast,Twitter announced in October that it would ban all political advertising, with founder Jack Dorsey saying that it was not possible to be working to stop the spread of information while at the same time allowing someone who had paid the platform to ""say whatever they want"". It is estimated that US political parties will spend about $6bn (Â£4.6bn) on advertising in the run-up to the 2020 elections. According to research firm Kantar about 20% of this will be digital. Facebook has said that political adverts are not a major revenue stream for it - less than 0.5% according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. However, the firm has faced pressure to change its mind -Hillary Clinton was among politicians to praise Twitter's decision,externaland ask Facebook why it was not doing the same. After the UK's recent general election, the Coalition for Reform in Political Advertising said that there had been a flood of fake news and disinformation. This included: a Conservative Party tweet that featured a video of Labour's Keir Starmer, in which his replies to questions about Brexit had been edited out. The Coalition said this was ""misleading"" a Liberal Democrat post featuring a bar chart placing the Lib Dems in second place to the Conservatives, but with no information as to whether the underlying data came from polls or earlier election results. Without this the results were not ""meaningful"" said the Coalition a Brexit Party ad that claimed five million Labour voters had voted to leave the EU. The Coalition noted that ""precise figures do not exist"", adding that most estimates put the number at between three and four million a Labour Party post that said a sell-out deal with Donald Trump could mean giving Â£500m a week to big drugs companies.

Coronavirus outbreak not yet pandemic - WHO,"This video can not be played The first coronavirus-infected patients arrive at the newly built hospital in Wuhan The World Health Organization (WHO) says there is a ""window of opportunity"" to stop the deadly new coronavirus becoming a broader global crisis. Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the steps China took to fight the virus at its epicentre were a good way of stopping its spread. The praise comes as Chinese officials have been widely criticised for their initial handling of the outbreak. On Tuesday alone, nearly 4,000 new cases were confirmed in the country. The death toll has now risen to 490, an increase of 65 deaths in mainland China in one day, the latest figures from the country's National Health Commission (NHC) said. All the new fatalities were in Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak. In China alone, there are now more than 24,300 cases, with a much smaller number of cases in other countries around the globe. Two people have died of the disease outside of mainland China - one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines. The WHO has declared a global health emergency over the outbreak but said it did not yet constitute a ""pandemic"", orthe worldwide spread of a new disease,external. Could it become pandemic? The Chinese doctor who tried to warn others A visual guide to the outbreak About 80% of those who died were over the age of 60, and 75% of them had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, according to the NHC. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a flu. Speaking at a technical briefing in Geneva, Dr Tedros praised the Chinese authorities for their response at the epicentre of the outbreak, where millions of people are on lockdown and severe transport restrictions have been imposed. ""There is a window of opportunity because of the high measures, the strong measures China is taking at the epicentre, at the source. So let's use this opportunity to prevent further spread and control it,"" he said, stressing that developed countries were failing to share data. The comments come a day after China's top leadership admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in the country's response. The government has also been accused of downplaying the severity of the virus at the start of the outbreak and in some cases, attempting to keep news of it secret. One doctor in Wuhan who tried to warn his fellow colleagueslate last year was accused of ""making false comments"" and told by police to stop the ""illegal activity"". This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus Dr Tedros also reiterated his call for countries not to impose travel and trade restrictions, saying 22 nations had officially reported such measures. He urged them to be ""short in duration, proportionate"" and reviewed regularly. But Chen Xu, China's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said some restrictions went against the WHO's advice and told countries not to over-react. Earlier, Sylvie Briand, head of WHO's Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, said the outbreak ""currently"" was not a pandemic. While more than two dozen nations have reported cases there have been no confirmations across Africa or Latin America. Dr Briand also stressed the importance of tackling unfounded rumours, saying they could be an ""obstacle for good response and hamper effective implementation of counter-measures"". Meanwhile, 27 cases of human-to-human infections have occurred in nine countries outside China, according to the WHO. Among other developments: In Japan, health officials screened about 3,700 people on board a cruise ship after a passenger tested positive for the virus, discovering a further 10 new cases in the process The UK and French governments told their citizens in China to leave the countryif they could, with the British Foreign Office saying it will charter another special flight on Sunday Taiwan said that from Friday it would deny entry to all foreign nationals who had been to mainland China in the past 14 days Macau - a special administrative region of China and one of Asia's biggest gambling hubs - announced that it would temporarily close down all its casinos Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the total number of cases could be far higher than official figures. Dr David Heymann, who led the WHO's response to the outbreak of Sars, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, in 2002-03, told the Associated Press news agency thatthe new coronavirus appeared to still be on the increase,external, and that it was too early to estimate when it would peak.

RHI report release date publishedThe report into the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme will be published on Friday 13 March.Northern Ireland,"The RHI scheme brought Stormont's institutions to collapse in January 2017 The report into the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme (RHI), which led to the collapse of devolution in 2017, will be published on Friday 13 March. The inquiry chairman, Sir Patrick Coghlin, will make a statement in the Long Gallery, Parliament Buildings in Belfast. The scheme was set up to encourage the use of renewable energy sources, but it closed in 2016 after concerns were raised about cost controls. The inquiry was established in 2017. Major flaws in the set-up and implementation of the scheme meant it effectively encouraged individuals and businesses to burn more fuel to earn more money. It became known as the ""cash-for-ash"" scandal and the scheme risked going vastly over budget, with fears the overspend could reach as much as Â£700m over 20 years. The inquiry panel is made of up of Sir Patrick Coghlin (centre), Dame Una O'Brien and Dr Keith MacLean The scheme was shut in 2016 and deep cuts in subsidies introduced in 2017 and 2019 brought it within budget. A top civil servant has since told MPs that the overspend figure had actually been just over Â£33m before the measures to curb spending were introduced. Since the scheme was closed to new entrants, available cash has been handed back to the treasury. The sum was Â£25m this year and if no replacement scheme is established, almost Â£400m would be returned over the remaining lifetime of the scheme. Three years after it was established the Renewable Heat Inquiry will issue its report next month. The Chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin, has chosen Stormont, where the political institutions collapsed in the wake of the scandal. It will address several important questions: was there a DUP conspiracy to delay lucrative cost controls in the runaway scheme? did former Economy Minister Arlene Foster pay enough attention as her officials designed and implemented it? what lessons must the civil service learn to ensure it never happens again? The contents will be eagerly anticipated and pored over to see whether three years on, they have any political ramifications. The scheme ultimately led to the collapse of power sharing at Stormont in January 2017 when Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy first minister in protest at the DUP's handling of the scandal. The scheme was run by Stormont's Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Deti), which later became the Department for the Economy (DfE). The ministers in office during the creation and implementation of the scheme were the DUP's Arlene Foster and Jonathan Bell.

Academics set sights on hard-to-treat cancersAcademics at Queen's University Belfast are studying pancreatic and oesophageal cancers.Northern Ireland,"Two cancers which are among the hardest to treat and have very low survival rates are to be the focus of pioneering research at Queen's University Belfast. The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer in Northern Ireland is 4.9% and for oesophageal cancer is 18.6%. In England, the statistics are 6.9% and approximately 15%. Cancer survivor Paul Fox said only research will help us beat cancer, or at least learn to live with it. This video can not be played Cancer survivor Paul Fox says he is ""living beyond cancer"" The 47-year-old, from County Down, was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in July 2018. It was detected early and having received treatment, three cycles of chemotherapy, he told BBC News NI that he is well on the road to recovery. ""I am very much living beyond cancer. I urge people particularly men to respond to symptoms, to seek help. It is actually being man enough,"" he said. On this World Cancer Day, Cancer Focus Northern Ireland announced a Â£300,000 investment in pioneering research at Queen's University Belfast. The new project will study pancreatic and oesophageal cancers. Roisin Foster, chief executive of Cancer Focus NI, said: ""We know that as people live longer, the incidence of cancer is rising and one in two of us can expect to get a diagnosis in our lifetime."" Stomach and back ache; Unexplained weight loss; Indigestion; Changes to bowel habits, including floating faeces ; Jaundice (yellow skin or eyes or itchy skin); Feeling and being sick; You may also develop symptoms of diabetes. Difficulty swallowing; Persistent indigestion or heartburn; Bringing up food soon after eating; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Pain or discomfort in upper tummy. Dr Richard Turkington, oncologist and cancer researcher at Queen's, who is leading the research, said the ""pioneering"" new project aims to determine how immunotherapy can successfully treat pancreatic and oesophageal cancers. ""[These] are two cancers which at present are hard to treat and have very low survival rates,"" he said. Immunotherapy works by overcoming cancer cells' ability to hide from the body's immune system. It allows a patient's immune defences to identify and destroy cancer cells, but does not always work for everyone. The UK and Ireland have the highest rates of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus in the world; The number of UK cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in men has risen by 50% in the past 25 years; The rates of pancreatic cancer in UK are also increasing, with it expected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030, overtaking breast and colon cancer; Pancreatic cancer is one of the least survivable cancers in NI. Dr Turkington explained: ""The outlook for these patients has remained unchanged for decades partly due to lack of research and investment. ""Our researchers will work to understand why most pancreatic and oesophageal types of cancers are resistant to immunotherapy and identify which drugs can be used to help overcome this resistance so patients will respond positively to the treatment. Hollywood actor Patrick Swayze died from advanced pancreatic cancer aged 57 ""Immunotherapy has transformed the outlook for specific cancers, such as lung cancer and malignant melanoma, previously thought to be relatively untreatable. ""We believe the same revolution can occur for oesophageal and pancreatic cancers. ""This new work will enable us to drive forward a new era of treatment. If successful it has the potential to save lives both here and across the world.""

Jehovah's Witnesses sued over 'child sex abuse',"At least 20 former Jehovah's Witnesses are suing the group over historical sexual abuse they say they suffered. The group has a policy of not punishing alleged child sex abuse unless a second person, alongside the accuser, has witnessed it - or an abuser confesses. It says its elders ""comply with child-abuse reporting laws even if there is only one witness"", though, and always tell police if a child is in danger. But one former elder said it had been failing to involve the authorities. John Viney said his abuser had gone on to abuse other children John Viney, who says he was abused between the ages of nine and 13, by ""a distant family member who was an active Jehovah's Witness"", added children were still being abused and the religious organisation was  ""inadvertently"" protecting their abusers. ""The way that Jehovah's Witnesses handle matters within the congregation, it's a closed shop,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I know for a fact now that there are parents that haven't done anything about the abuse of their children by others because they don't want to bring reproach on Jehovah's name."" Mr Viney's own daughter, Karen, was abused as a child - and has since spoken out about it publicly. But when she left the organisation, Mr Viney disowned her - something he has regretted ever since. ""When I was an elder and a dad, I put being an elder absolutely first,"" he said. ""And that was a mistake."" Mr Viney said he had eventually reported his own abuser to the police, in 2019, after years of being too ""ashamed"", only to be told the man had gone on to abuse other children and died in prison. ""What would have happened if I had had the courage and common sense to come forward [at the time]?"" he said. Thomas Beale, a solicitor representing some of the former members, said they had decided to seek compensation after asking the group for an apology only to find it ""denying what has happened or refusing to engage"". Those taking the legal action say the organisation is ""vicariously liable"" for the abuse they say they suffered. Some claim it was negligent. If you have had a similar experience, and would like to share your story, contact the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme by emailing victoria@bbc.co.uk. Information and support for those affected by sexual abuse can be found on theBBC's Action Line page. One woman, Emma - not her real name - said after she had been abused she had been visited by elders who had repeated scripture ""about why we should keep it in-house, not follow the laws of the land"". And she had been asked to recount explicit details, with the elders ""glaring at me"". Several former members have also told BBC News they were made to discuss their allegations with elders at a ""judicial committee"", while their alleged abuser sat next to them. Emma's abuser was jailed for two years. But, she said, following his release, he had been welcomed back into the organisation. Labour MP Sarah Champion said elders in the Jehovah's Witnesses felt child abuse should be dealt with ""internally"" within the group Labour's Sarah Champion, the chair of a cross-party group of MPs looking at adults who experienced child sexual abuse, said she had ""very serious concerns"" about a convicted child abuser being allowed ""back into a community where they have access to vulnerable people"". She said she had met elders who ""believe that there is more than enough safeguarding in place... [but] couldn't think of an example when they would go to the police about their concerns"". And the group saw child abuse as ""a sin that they need to deal with internally"". ""That's really concerning to me,"" she added. The Charity Commission has been investigating the Jehovah's Witnesses organisation since 2013. A spokeswoman said the inquiry remained ongoing, but would not comment further. A Jehovah's Witnesses spokesman said: ""The only way that a child abuser can gain access to children in a religious organisation like ours, which does not have any programmes that separate children from their parents, is through parents themselves."" He said that for ""decades"", the organisation had educated parents ""about the dangers of child abuse and how they can protect their children"" and parents and victims were informed they had the right to report the matter to the authorities. ""If a congregant has been guilty of child sexual abuse, our elders inform parents with minors so that they can take measures to protect their children,"" he added.

Fraudster jailed for Â£6m money launder conspiracy,"Michael Kinane has been jailed for seven years and eight months A man has been jailed after he admitted conspiring to money launder nearly Â£6m. Michael Kinane, 41, of Porthmadog, Gwynedd, was caught following a joint FBI and British police inquiry, Operation Blue Coastal. The email systems of London-based pharmaceutical investment company Avillion were infiltrated, with requests for payments to be made. At Caernarfon Crown Court, Kinane was sentenced to seven years and eight months in prison. He had previously pleaded guilty toconspiracy to money launderand three counts of fraud. The targeted company was working with a US investor when fake emails were sent to staff, requesting money for legitimate work, to be paid into new accounts - one of which was Kinane's. On 2 November 2018, the company deposited $7.8 million into his NatWest account. Kinane, a British citizen born in Sri Lanka, had set up two foreign currency accounts. Between 2 November and 5 November 2018, funds arriving in Kinane's accounts were separated between his associates to accounts in Poland, Germany, Hong Kong, China and Malaysia. Judge Nicola Jones said she accepted he had not orchestrated the scheme, but was motivated by ""greed"". ""You played a key role in laundering this money, took great care to ensure the optimum amount could be moved between bank accounts. ""This was motivated by greed and I'm not sure you showed genuine remorse."" Kinane pictured after his arrest at London Gatwick airport in August 2019 Kinane also organised fraudulent purchases of high-value cars. Funds were also transferred to separate accounts belonging to Kinane which were linked to a business he was the sole director of. Identified as Magic Lily Ltd, it was alleged to have operated from his home address in Porthmadog. The email trickery costing businesses billions Courier fraud victim 'cried for days' Arrests in 10 countries over money-transfer scams Police inquiries identified that the company existed, but did not have any stock, did not trade and did not file accounts or pay corporation tax. Kinane was arrested on 8 August 2019 as he got off a plane from Turkey at London Gatwick Airport. At the time of his arrest, police said he was wearing a Tag Heuer watch valued at Â£4,550. He was also in possession of documents identifying he had recently invested the equivalent of Â£30,000 into a Dubai-based company. North Wales Police have obtained banking documents for 32 accounts attributable to Kinane so far. The 13-month investigation has resulted in the recovery and return of Â£1.2m ($1.6m) to the victim. Avillion said it was ""pleased justice has been done"" and was in the process of recovering the money, adding it had consulted with experts to improve its cyber security. Det Ch Insp Brian Kearney said: ""This case has been solved because of the support we have received from the companies concerned, the work of the FBI in their parallel investigation and the excellent support we have received from the specialist fraud division of the Crown Prosecution Service in Merseyside.""

Killer who blamed mystery man guilty of murderBrendan Rowan-Davies cut Kelly-Anne Case's throat before setting her house on fire in Gosport.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Kelly-Anne Case was found dead at her home by firefighters on 30 July A killer who tried to blame the death of a mother-of-three on a mystery man has been found guilty of her murder. Brendan Rowan-Davies tortured Kelly-Anne Case before cutting her throat and setting her house on fire on 30 July. He attempted to film the 27-year-old victim having sex with his friend the night before her body was found bound with cable ties at her home in Gosport. The 29-year-old was also convicted of arson. He was jailed for life with a minimum term of 30 years. Rowan-Davies, who has learning difficulties and was assisted by an intermediary throughout the trial at Winchester Crown Court, had claimed he interrupted the ""real killer"". The judge, Mr Justice Garnham, described Rowan-Davies' attack on Ms Case as ""sadistic"" and ""a truly dreadful crime"". Brendan Rowan-Davies shook his head as the verdicts were read out The court heard the defendant had known Ms Case for some time and told her he ""fancied"" her while they were drinking vodka and taking cocaine on the night before her death. She laughed off his advances and had sex with his friend that same evening, with Rowan-Davies telling jurors he used his phone to try and film the pair through a gap in the bedroom door. He told the court he left the house but later returned to retrieve some tobacco the following morning and was confronted by a knifeman who had already killed Ms Case. Rowan-Davies was filmed heading towards the victim's house on a bus before the murder Rowan-Davies, of Haslar Road, Gosport, said he managed to escape the man and run downstairs, before collecting his tobacco and leaving the house. However, prosecutors said evidence from CCTV and witnesses suggested he must have been in the house at the time of the killing and no-one else was seen or heard leaving the property. Ms Case's naked body was found by firefighters on a bed, with her wrists bound with cable ties bearing the defendant's DNA. Prosecutor William Mousley QC said the attack was sexually motivated and at least eight shallow neck wounds were inflicted before the murder in order to ""control, coerce or terrify Kelly-Anne"". The court heard Ms Case was ""alone and vulnerable"" after her three daughters were placed in the care of others with the assistance of social services. Ms Case's body was found in an upstairs bedroom at the house in Grange Crescent, Gosport Ms Case's mother, Caroline Tebb, said her daughter had been ""brutally, savagely and sadistically"" taken from her by a ""sick, vile excuse for a human being"". The judge said the defendant had not immediately killed Ms Case, but instead used the knife to inflict ""extremely painful"" injuries before cutting her throat. He told Rowan-Davies: ""You found Ms Case asleep. She was vulnerable and defenceless. ""You attacked her, tying her arms together with cable ties. She was at your mercy and you showed her none.""

Author Stephen King quits Facebook,"The horror writer is a big user of social media Novelist Stephen King has quit Facebook, saying he was uncomfortable with the ""flood of false information allowed in its political advertising"". He also said he was not confident the social network was protecting ""users' privacy"". He made the announcement on Twitter,external, where he has 5.6 million followers. Other high-profile users to quit includeStar Wars actor Mark Hamill, comedian Will Ferrell, musician Cher and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak Mr King's tweet, which had been liked more than 250,000 times at the time of writing, added that users could continue to follow him and his dog Molly on Twitter.

Actor Jim Carrey, who left in 2018, also sold his Facebook stock, citing the fact that the firm had profited from Russian interference in the 2016 US election. Facebook's decision not to change the way it fact-checked political adverts has proved controversial with many. It has argued that it is not right for private companies to censor politicians and called for government regulation to deal with the issue. By contrast,Twitter announced in October that it would ban all political advertising, with founder Jack Dorsey saying that it was not possible to be working to stop the spread of information while at the same time allowing someone who had paid the platform to ""say whatever they want"". It is estimated that US political parties will spend about $6bn (Â£4.6bn) on advertising in the run-up to the 2020 elections. According to research firm Kantar about 20% of this will be digital. Facebook has said that political adverts are not a major revenue stream for it - less than 0.5% according to founder Mark Zuckerberg. However, the firm has faced pressure to change its mind -Hillary Clinton was among politicians to praise Twitter's decision,externaland ask Facebook why it was not doing the same. After the UK's recent general election, the Coalition for Reform in Political Advertising said that there had been a flood of fake news and disinformation. This included: a Conservative Party tweet that featured a video of Labour's Keir Starmer, in which his replies to questions about Brexit had been edited out. The Coalition said this was ""misleading"" a Liberal Democrat post featuring a bar chart placing the Lib Dems in second place to the Conservatives, but with no information as to whether the underlying data came from polls or earlier election results. Without this the results were not ""meaningful"" said the Coalition a Brexit Party ad that claimed five million Labour voters had voted to leave the EU. The Coalition noted that ""precise figures do not exist"", adding that most estimates put the number at between three and four million a Labour Party post that said a sell-out deal with Donald Trump could mean giving Â£500m a week to big drugs companies.

"'Long way to go' for diversity in gaming industryWomen are significantly under-represented in gaming, leaving some people with ""no-one to look up to"".Newsbeat","Diversity is a ""necessity"" if the gaming industry is to continue to grow, says the body that represents people who make games. Around one in 10 people working in the UK industry are from ethnically diverse backgrounds - slightly higher than the national working average. But women make up less than 30%, the research by Ukie and the University of Sheffield suggests. It means some women have ""no-one to look up to"", says Kat Welsford. She works in marketing at independent games developer Bossa Studios - and says when it comes to women in games, it's a mixed picture. ""At my studio I'm really lucky that we have great gender diversity. ""But there are other places I've been to where it's disappointing when you see how few women there are, especially in leadership roles,"" Kat tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Kat says she's lucky to work somewhere with women in senior roles ""We have women in the senior leadership team at Bossa. That's useful to see because it shows I can make progress where I am. I can have a career here. ""Lots of other women I know in the industry who are 29 or 30 are saying to me they've got no-one to look up to."" Diversity in the creative industries is a hot topic at the moment, afterJoaquin Phoenix and Prince William spoke outat the recent Bafta film awards. It's something that's been on the mind of games companies in the UK for some time too, and Ukie started looking into the state of the industry last year. Ukie's boss Dr Jo Twist says diversity is a ""necessity"" for the industry to grow. More than 3,000 people who work in games in the UK took part in the survey - that's around 20% of the total number of people employed by gaming companies. ""I do know quite a few Chinese and Indian programmers who work in the industry,"" says Moo Yu, a Chinese-American gameplay programmer who works in London. But he says when it comes to some of the more creative roles, ""there's more white people and established people"". The survey suggests that 10% of UK games company staff are from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds - which is higher than the national working population and above that in the creative industries overall. But representation is notably less in senior roles. ""In the modern day, if you want to tell your own stories, you have to set up your own games studio,"" says Moo. ""It's something I'm noticing a lot more people of colour doing."" Moo Yu says he knows people setting up their own studios to tell their ""own"" stories He adds that for the bigger studios, the ""key is to make people feel like their voices are being heard"". ""I still think there's a long way to go."" The research also suggests that nearly a quarter of the UK games industry are LGBT and that two-thirds are under 35. Men make up 70% and women 28% - with 2% identifying as non-binary. Most come from middle-class backgrounds, according to the research, with 62% of those who took part coming from a household where the main earner worked in a managerial or professional role. In response to the research Ukie says it will sign up 200 UK games companies, which covers 50% of the workforce, to their #raisethegame pledge by 2021. It aims to increase diversity ""at every level"" of the gaming industry by recruiting ""as fairly and as widely as possible"" - and make workplaces more ""inclusive"" by ""educating and inspiring people to take more personal responsibility"" for promoting diversity. Companies like EA, Facebook, Jagex, King and Xbox have signed up already. ""Diversity isn't a nicety - it's a necessity if the industry is going to grow, thrive and truly reflect the tens of millions of people that play games every day in this country,"" Dr Jo Twist says.

UK tells all Britons to leave China 'if they can'The Foreign Office is issuing the advice to minimise the risk of exposure to the new coronavirus.UK,"All Britons in China should leave the country if they can to minimise the risk of exposure to the coronavirus,the Foreign Office has said,external. The UK says it will charter another flight on Sunday to evacuate British nationals and their families from Wuhan, where the virus originated. Commercial flights are available from other parts of China. Meanwhile, a Belgian woman, who was on a flight bringing UK citizens back on Sunday, tested positive for the virus. Eleven UK citizens and family members were on the woman's flight, which carried passengers from 30 other countries to France, before the Britons flew on to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Of these, 10 continued to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral for a 14-day period of isolation, while Anthony May-Smith was taken to hospital in Oxford to be tested for potential coronavirus. At least427 people have died after contracting the virus and there have been more than 20,000 confirmed cases, most of them in China. There are an estimated 30,000 UK nationals in China, ministers have said. The Foreign Office earlier said it continued to work to evacuate Britons from Hubei province where the outbreak began. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""We now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. ""Where there are still British nationals in Hubei province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this."" Coronavirus outbreak not yet pandemic - WHO How worried should we be? A visual guide to the outbreak Coronavirus: Could it become pandemic? The latest Foreign Office advice added that the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk. The virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, including two cases in the UK. However,the World Health Organization (WHO) said it does not yet qualify as a ""pandemic"". This is declared only when there are sustained outbreaks within communities in multiple parts of the world, according to the WHO. Previously the Foreign Office had advised against all but essential travel to China, while warning against any travel to Hubei province, including the city of Wuhan. BBC China correspondent Robin Brant said the new advice was ""not because we've seen a sudden increase in the severity of the outbreak of the virus"". Instead, he said it appeared to be prompted by the Foreign Office organising what it was calling ""the last flight"" to evacuate Wuhan. The UK was also moving non-essential staff out from its embassy and consulates in China, so ""there are fewer people who can help any Britons in distress"", he said. Dozens of Britons were flown home from the centre of the outbreak and taken into quarantine One British man in China who fears he contracted the new coronavirus in November saidhe had been given no indication of when he will be able to leave Wuhan. Jamie Morris, 23, from Tredegar in South Wales, said he had not been able to return on recent flights because he had given his passport to Chinese authorities to extend his residency permit. ""I am currently on my own in my apartment, isolated from the outside world,"" he said. Sam and Rebekah Mulliner say they do not want to leave China Some Britons in China told the BBC that they intend to stay despite the Foreign Office advice - while others questioned whether it was possible to leave. Music teacher Sam Mulliner and his wife, Rebekah, work at an international school in Shanghai and say it is not easy to ""just get up and leave"". ""I feel like I want to stay here and support my Chinese colleagues,"" he said, adding that there may be more risk of infection on a plane. John Hall said he wants to return to the UK with his Chinese wife and his three-month-old daughter from his home in Zhanjiang. But he said he cannot travel the six hours to the nearest embassy to get the paperwork and feared his daughter is ""much too young"" to fight the virus if she should contract it. ""We don't want to be split up,"" he said. ""I would be devastated."" On Friday, 83 UK citizens were repatriated on a flight out of Wuhan arranged by the UK government. Another 11 Britons joined them on Sunday on a French flight. They are now in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for 14 days - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure that they are not infected. A further eight UK nationals and six of their family members left China on a flight to New Zealand on Tuesday, the Foreign Office has said. But shadow foreign minister Afzal Khan said the evacuation of Wuhan had been a ""shambles"", citing delays, lack of information and ""the terrible cases of family separation that have occurred"". The only two UK airlines serving China - British Airways and Virgin Atlantic - have suspended their flights between the UK and China due to fears about the spread of the virus. All flights with Chinese Airline Hainan between Manchester and Beijing will also be suspended from Thursday to 28 March, Manchester Airport said. UK passengers have been advised to contact the airline on 0161 236 6184. Two people, a student at the University of York and one of their relatives, are being treated for coronavirus at the specialist infectious diseases unit at Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. They are the UK's only two confirmed cases, with 414 people having tested negative for the virus, according to the Department of Health. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday thatthere is a ""window of opportunity"" to stop the deadly new coronavirus becoming a broader global crisis. It said that the steps China took to fight the virus at its epicentre were a good way of stopping its spread. Are you a British citizen in China? Will you leave the country?

"Arena attack brother 'equally guilty of murders'Hashem Abedi denies 22 counts of murder over the Manchester Arena bombing in 2017, a court is told.Manchester","The Old Bailey heard the case concerns Hashem Abedi's ""role in perpetrating"" the attack The brother of the Manchester Arena bomber was ""just as guilty"" of the murder of the 22 people who died in the attack, his trial has heard. Salman Abedi detonated a ""large home-made improvised explosive device"" outside an Ariana Grande concert on 22 May 2017. His brother Hashem Abedi is standing trial at the Old Bailey over his ""role in perpetrating these terrible events"". He denies the murder of 22 people and the attempted murder of others. He also denies conspiring with his brother to cause an explosion. Prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said the siblings spent ""months"" planning the attack, which had been ""both sudden and lethal"" and had had ""nearly 1,000 victims"". He said in addition to the 22 people - men, women, teenagers and a child - who died, a total of 264 ""were physically injured"" while 670 more had since ""reported psychological trauma as a result of these events"". Top (left to right): Lisa Lees, Alison Howe, Georgina Callender, Kelly Brewster, John Atkinson, Jane Tweddle, Marcin Klis, Eilidh MacLeod - Middle (left to right): Angelika Klis, Courtney Boyle, Saffie Roussos, Olivia Campbell-Hardy, Martyn Hett, Michelle Kiss, Philip Tron, Elaine McIver - Bottom (left to right): Wendy Fawell, Chloe Rutherford, Liam Allen-Curry, Sorrell Leczkowski, Megan Hurley, Nell Jones Mr Penny said the explosion was the ""culmination of months of planning and preparation"" by the brothers, who had worked together to source chemicals and buy screws and nails to use as ""anti-personnel shrapnel"" in experimental improvised bombs. He said they had also obtained an address in Blackley, north Manchester where they could work on the device and bought a Nissan Micra car to use as a ""de-facto storage facility"". The court heard the flat was ""not an area the two were used to frequenting"" and had been used as a ""safe address from which to operate without unwanted or uninvited interruption"". The resulting bomb was ""detonated in the middle of a crowd in a very public areaâ¦ to kill and to inflict maximum damage"", Mr Penny said. The court heard the Manchester-born brothers had lived alone in the family home in Fallowfield, about four miles south of the city centre, since 2016 when their parents returned to Libya. Mr Penny said they had shown ""some signs of radicalisation"" in the years before the bombing - ""Salman more so than Hashem"". Jurors were told Hashem had worked in a takeaway at the time and had asked if he could take home used vegetable oil cans to sell for scrap, which Mr Penny described as a ""cover story"". A part of one of the cans was found at the scene of the attack. Mr Penny said it was not suggested the brothers had a specific target and the final destination may have been chosen by Salman Abedi alone, but they had a ""shared goal [to] kill, maim and injure as many people as possible"". ""The law is that Hashem Abedi is just as responsible for this atrocityâ¦ as surely as if he had selected the target and detonated the bomb himself,"" he added. Salman Abedi and his brother lived in Fallowfield, four miles south of Manchester city centre Jurors were shown a map of the city with locations such as Manchester Arena, the Arndale Centre and Victoria Station identified. Mr Penny said the arena was ""one of the busiest and one of the largest"" in Europe and had been filled with the American singer's ""large and diverse fan base"" on the night of the attack. He said the foyer outside it was ""busy and heavily congested with people"" as the crowd left the venue at about 22:30 BST, and in their ""midstâ¦ carrying a heavy rucksack that contained a homemade bombâ¦ was Salman Abedi"". He added that such was the ""ferocity of the explosion"" that it ""dismembered"" the bomber and left a scene ""of destruction and chaos"". Mr Penny said ""significant exhibits from two separate locations"" linked Hashem to the attack. He said his hand and finger marks were found on parts which had been cut from the vegetable oil cans at the brothers' Fallowfield home. Six thumbprints were also discovered on a piece of metal that had been discarded in a bag of rubbish behind a flat in Manchester city centre where Salman Abedi had ""ultimately assembled"" the bomb, he added. The court heard the pieces found at the flat and the home came from the same oil can as the one found in the arena foyer and ""played a pivotal role in the development of this story"". Hashem Abedi denies the murder of 22 people and the attempted murder of others Mr Penny said the bomb was made from three chemicals, two of which the defendant had made various attempts to buy using false online accounts or via other people, some of whom had been ""sufficiently gullible to avail him of their internet accounts"". He said Hashem Abedi had asked a relative if he could use an Amazon account to buy one chemical, but said the third chemical was easily purchased in chemists and police had not traced any acquisition of it by either brother. Jurors heard the brothers had a ""high turnover"" of telephone numbers, some of which were only used for a few days ""to avoid detection"". Records showed Hashem had five mobile numbers between June 2016 and May 2017, Salman had four, and they had shared a further two. The trial continues.

Academics set sights on hard-to-treat cancers,"Two cancers which are among the hardest to treat and have very low survival rates are to be the focus of pioneering research at Queen's University Belfast. The five-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer in Northern Ireland is 4.9% and for oesophageal cancer is 18.6%. In England, the statistics are 6.9% and approximately 15%. Cancer survivor Paul Fox said only research will help us beat cancer, or at least learn to live with it. This video can not be played Cancer survivor Paul Fox says he is ""living beyond cancer"" The 47-year-old, from County Down, was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in July 2018. It was detected early and having received treatment, three cycles of chemotherapy, he told BBC News NI that he is well on the road to recovery. ""I am very much living beyond cancer. I urge people particularly men to respond to symptoms, to seek help. It is actually being man enough,"" he said. On this World Cancer Day, Cancer Focus Northern Ireland announced a Â£300,000 investment in pioneering research at Queen's University Belfast. The new project will study pancreatic and oesophageal cancers. Roisin Foster, chief executive of Cancer Focus NI, said: ""We know that as people live longer, the incidence of cancer is rising and one in two of us can expect to get a diagnosis in our lifetime."" Stomach and back ache; Unexplained weight loss; Indigestion; Changes to bowel habits, including floating faeces ; Jaundice (yellow skin or eyes or itchy skin); Feeling and being sick; You may also develop symptoms of diabetes. Difficulty swallowing; Persistent indigestion or heartburn; Bringing up food soon after eating; Loss of appetite and weight loss; Pain or discomfort in upper tummy. Dr Richard Turkington, oncologist and cancer researcher at Queen's, who is leading the research, said the ""pioneering"" new project aims to determine how immunotherapy can successfully treat pancreatic and oesophageal cancers. ""[These] are two cancers which at present are hard to treat and have very low survival rates,"" he said. Immunotherapy works by overcoming cancer cells' ability to hide from the body's immune system. It allows a patient's immune defences to identify and destroy cancer cells, but does not always work for everyone. The UK and Ireland have the highest rates of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus in the world; The number of UK cases of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in men has risen by 50% in the past 25 years; The rates of pancreatic cancer in UK are also increasing, with it expected to become the second-leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030, overtaking breast and colon cancer; Pancreatic cancer is one of the least survivable cancers in NI. Dr Turkington explained: ""The outlook for these patients has remained unchanged for decades partly due to lack of research and investment. ""Our researchers will work to understand why most pancreatic and oesophageal types of cancers are resistant to immunotherapy and identify which drugs can be used to help overcome this resistance so patients will respond positively to the treatment. Hollywood actor Patrick Swayze died from advanced pancreatic cancer aged 57 ""Immunotherapy has transformed the outlook for specific cancers, such as lung cancer and malignant melanoma, previously thought to be relatively untreatable. ""We believe the same revolution can occur for oesophageal and pancreatic cancers. ""This new work will enable us to drive forward a new era of treatment. If successful it has the potential to save lives both here and across the world.""

Half of UK 10-year-olds own a smartphone,"Fifty per cent of the UK's 10-year-olds owned a smartphone in 2019, according to a report by media regulator Ofcom. The amount of young phone owners doubled between the ages of nine and 10, which Ofcom dubbed ""the age of digital independence"". In addition, 24% of 3 and 4-year-olds had their own tablet, and 15% of them were allowed to take it to bed. Ofcom's annual report looks at the media habits of children, and the types of devices they are using. The 2019 study was based on more than 3,200 interviews with children and parents around the UK. ""The mobile phone is the device of choice for children,"" said Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom. ""I'm conscious that for these children who have never known a world without the internet, in many respects their online and offline worlds are indistinguishable."" The report also found that more older children were using social media to express their support for social causes and organisations, with 18% having shared or commented on a post, and one in ten having signed an online petition. Ofcom dubbed this ""the Greta effect"" after the 17-year-old environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. The ""Greta effect"" has led to more older children supporting causes online. Other key findings for 2019 included: 48% of girls aged 5-15 played online games, compared with 71% of boys. Boys spent twice as long playing, clocking up 14.5 hours per week, compared with 7.5 for girls Snapchat and Facebook remained the most popular social media platforms of older children, but 62% were also using WhatsApp (up from 43% in 2018) 99% of children aged 5-15 used a TV set, 27% used a smart speaker and 22% used a radio 80% of the children in the report watched video-on-demand, and 25% watched no live broadcast TV at all. One nine-year-old girl told researchers: ""I don't really like the TV because you can't pick what channels are on it"". This video can not be played Students in Milton Keynes on their favourite smartphone apps Ofcom also interviewed parents about their concerns. It found that 45% of parents thought the benefits of children using the internet outweighed the risks, but there was an overall increase in parental concern about young people seeing content that might lead them to self-harm. Just under half (47%) of the parents spoken to were worried about pressure to spend money within games, especially on loot boxes, where the reward is not clear before purchase. 'Hateful content' more likely to be seen by Northern Ireland children 'The kids emptied our bank account playing Fifa' BBC launches 'digital wellbeing' app for children Of those parents with children aged between 5 and 15, 87% had sought advice about how to keep them safe online. ""We are seeing around half of 12-15 year olds saying they have seen hateful content online, and an increase in parents who are concerned about it,"" said Yih-Choung Teh. ""The good news is, more conversations about staying safe online are also happening across the country."" Following the report, children's charity the NSPCC called for independent regulators to force social media platforms to protect their users from viewing harmful material. ""While it's encouraging that parents are talking to their children about their media use, we must look to tech giants to protect their users and ensure they are a force for good not bad,"" said Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy.

China admits 'shortcomings' in virus response,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor on what we know about the virus China's top leadership has admitted ""shortcomings and deficiencies"" in the country's response to the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The rare admission came from the Politburo Standing Committee, which called for an improvement in China's emergency management system. It also ordered a ""severe"" crackdown on illegal wildlife markets - where the virus is thought to have emerged. The death toll has risen to 425, with more than 20,000 confirmed cases. ""In response to the shortcomings and deficiencies... we must improve our national emergency management system and improve our abilities in handling urgent and dangerous tasks,"" the report said. ""It is necessary to strengthen market supervision, resolutely ban and severely crack down on illegal wildlife markets and trade."" 'Make coronavirus wildlife trade ban permanent' Why are we catching more diseases from animals? How worried should we be? Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak The government's initial handling of the outbreak has been widely criticised. Officials have been accused of downplaying the severity of the virus at the start of the outbreak and in some cases, attempting to keep news of it secret. One doctor in Wuhan who tried to warn his fellow colleaguesabout the outbreak late last year was accused of ""making false comments"" and told by police to stop the ""illegal activity"". It was only later in January that the government ordered the virtual lockdown of Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated. This video can not be played The first coronavirus-infected patients arrive at the newly built hospital in Wuhan Other regions close to the mainland are also feeling the effects of the virus first-hand. On Tuesday, Hong Kong confirmed its first death from the coronavirus. Broadcaster RTHK said the 39-year-old man, who suffered from an underlying illness, had visited Wuhan on 21 January. Hong Kong, which has 15 confirmed cases, has suspended 10 out of 13 border crossings with mainland China. Taiwan announced that starting Friday, it would deny entry to all foreign nationals who have been to mainland China in the past 14 days. Macau - one of Asia's biggest gambling hubs - also announced that it would temporarily close down all the casinos in the region. The closure is set to last two weeks but could be extended. The new coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. The number of deaths in China, excluding Hong Kong, now exceeds the 349 killed on the mainland in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-03. But the mortality rate of the new virus is about 2.1% - much lower than that of Sars at around 9.6% - suggesting it is not as deadly. There are more than 150 cases in other countries, with one death in the Philippines. On Tuesday, South Korea announced that one of its citizens had tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said the 42-year-old woman flew back to Korea on 19 January after visiting Thailand. She showed symptoms on 25 January and her conditions did not improve. The Thai Department of Disease Control said it was ""possible"" that she contracted the virus in Thailand, which has one of the highest number of virus cases outside of China. It is not clear if she had visited China at all. Many nations have evacuated their citizens from affected areas of China, often placing them in quarantine on arrival home. The US ordered the departure of all US personnel family members under the age of 21, and any US citizen who has been in Hubei province will be subject to 14 days' quarantine. US bars foreigners who recently visited China Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the US measures were ""excessive"" and contrary to WHO recommendations, accusing the US of ""spreading fear"". The WHO has warned that closing borders could even accelerate the spread of the virus, if travellers enter countries unofficially. More than 20 countries have recorded confirmed cases. The latest on travel restrictions: Denying entry to all foreign visitors who have recently been to China:US, Australia, Singapore Denying entry to foreigners travelling from mainland China:New Zealand, Israel. (Russiawill also apply these restrictions, though not through Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport) Denying entry to foreigners who have visited Hubei province:Japan, South Korea Temporarily suspending all flights to mainland China:Egypt, Finland, Indonesia, Italy Closing the border with China:Mongolia, Russia (partially) The body that represents some of the world's largest cruise ship operators, the Cruise Lines International Association, announced on Monday that passengers and crew members who had recently travelled to China would not be allowed to board vessels This video can not be played Indonesians evacuated from Wuhan are sprayed with disinfectant More than 75,000 people may have been infected in Wuhan, experts say. But estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the total number of cases could be far higher than official figures. Diary of a life in locked-down Wuhan Coronavirus: What it does to the body Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began Around 80% of those who have died from the virus are over the age of 60, said a report by state media quoting the National Health Commission. The national health body added that 75% of them had suffered from underlying conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Most people infected are likely to fully recover - just as they would from a normal flu. An expert at China's National Health Commission (NHC) said that one week was sufficient for a recovery from mild coronavirus symptoms. How has the coronavirus outbreak affected you?

Surgeon 'played God' with women,"Ian Paterson was described as ""charming"" by his patients Thousands of patients were introduced to breast surgeon Ian Paterson. The 59-year-old, who has been found guilty of wounding with intent, appeared trusting, kind and with their best interests at heart. But he left them disfigured and suffering years of mental and physical torment. Here, some of them share their stories. Frances Perks lost her mother and sister to breast cancer, so when a lump showed up on a mammogram when she was 35, she was referred to Paterson. During one consultation, he urged her to have a double mastectomy or risk ""full-blown cancer"". She had her left breast removed and underwent eight other operations at the private Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull, West Midlands. However, she later learned that none had been necessary. The effect on her life has been devastating. ""I was very worried. Because not only mum, but my older sister had died of breast cancer and she was only 40,"" said Mrs Perks, of Burntwood, Staffordshire. Paterson told her she was ""high risk"" because of her family history. ""I had a mammogram once a year, and then an ultrasound every six months. When things did start to crop up, he'd say 'there's something sinister there, I don't like the look of it and because of your family history we need to careful. I think it should come out.' Mrs Perks underwent nine operations at Spire Parkway Hospital in Solihull By 2008, she had undergone nine operations - the final being a left mastectomy. Paterson had told her, if it were him, he would have both breasts removed, but her insurers would not cover a preventative treatment. ""I had a fear that I could end up with breast cancer, which scared the living daylights out of me,"" she said. ""But when I was told I didn't need any of it, I was so shocked."" Mrs Perks' tissue was studied as part of a review of Paterson's work in 2012. The results showed the lumps had all been benign and the removal of her breast should never have happened. A genetic specialist later reassured her she had only ever been at moderate risk of developing cancer. Paterson's actions did not only affect Mrs Perks physically. The stress of learning her operations were unnecessary caused her to leave her job at a firm of solicitors, and her financial hardship left her with no option but to sell her house. ""I feel hatred - pure hatred,"" she said. ""I did not think I could hate someone as much as I hate him. ""I want to see him suffer because, OK, he might think he's suffered over the last few years but that's not good enough for me. Not for what he's put me through, what I've lost, and how it's affected me mentally and physically."" Breast surgeon needlessly harmed patients Arrogant bully who 'mutilated' patients What is cleavage-sparing surgery? Jade Edgington was just 16 and studying for her A-levels when she found a lump in her breast while in the shower. She was introduced to Paterson at the Spire Hospital and, by the time she was 19, had undergone four invasive operations. She later learned three procedures were unnecessary as the lumps were not even at risk of becoming cancerous. ""He told me we needed to get it out,"" she said. ""He said it wasn't anything scary, but that it was big enough to get it out."" She went on to find three more lumps, and again Paterson said they should be removed. She and her family trusted his opinion. ""[We thought] he's the expert, he knows what he's doing. We went ahead with his advice."" Jade's operations, which happened while she was studying for her A-levels, have left her scarred for life Two years after her last operation she was recalled to be seen by another doctor who was reassessing Paterson's work. ""He came back and said they would have monitored the first lump for 12 months, and may not have taken it out, and the other three operations did not need to happen because I was so young. ""I was 16, I was growing and changing and they would have suggested I didn't have those operations,"" added Ms Edgington, who is now 28 and a bank worker. ""Why put us all through that? You feel almost violated - essentially, someone has stuck a knife in me unnecessarily. ""You can't believe a man of his calibre has put somebody through something like that unnecessarily."" Marie Pinfield (left) and her sister Shirley Moroney were the best of friends Police officer Marie Pinfield was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer in August 2006 and asked Paterson for a double mastectomy. However, instead of waking up with the flat chest she expected, the surgeon - who pioneered the controversial ""cleavage-sparing"" surgical technique - had left so much tissue behind she had to wear a bra. She asked for a second operation to correct the work. However, the subsequent delay to chemotherapy and radiotherapy meant she developed secondary cancer in her lung and died in October 2008. Heart of England NHS Trust admitted the second operation would not have been necessary if the double mastectomy had been carried out properly. An independent report found Ms Pinfield could have lived for 10 more years had she received the right initial treatment. Her sister, Shirley Moroney, remembers the first time they met Paterson. ""He was absolutely charming,"" she said. ""He came across as a bit arrogant, but that almost gave you confidence that he would do a good job. ""At the point we had to make a complaint, that arrogance and charm was a difficult combination to work with. ""His attitude was 'how dare you question what I've done for you?'"" Ms Pinfield, a child protection officer with West Midlands Police, had made it clear to Paterson she wanted a double mastectomy. ""He was reluctant to agree to that,"" recalled her sister. ""He said 'lots of people say that - they're in shock - and later on they look at their body shape and they wish they'd made another decision'."" Marie and her niece Ciara ""I was shocked at how much material she still had on her body,"" said Mrs Moroney. ""I waited around to see him. I needed to ask him why she had so much left on her body. And his reaction to me was 'I knew you'd be trouble'. ""He said - I've taken all the mammary glands out. There's no breast tissue left. All that is left is fatty tissue."" Paterson finally agreed to a second procedure. ""On reflection, he should have said: 'Marie, let's do the chemotherapy, let's do the radiotherapy, and we'll sort your body issues out afterwards,"" said Mrs Moroney. ""But he didn't. ""You need a month's recovery after the operation before you can start your chemotherapy and radiotherapy. That delay in her getting treatment is probably the reason the secondary cancer came back so quickly. ""The guy had a God complex. He felt that women could only be in this world if they'd got a breast body shape. ""Marie believed in justice, and right and wrong, doing the job she did. I know she will be looking down on me, willing me to go on."" Cheryl Iommi first met Paterson in 2003 when she was having lumps removed from her right breast at Solihull Hospital. He operated on her twice and told her she appeared to be developing cancer. She later learned the lumps he claimed were a cancer risk were simply scar tissue left behind from his botched procedures. ""When I first met him at Solihull Hospital, he came across as quite aggressive. He wasn't a very nice man on the National Health,"" she said. He put her to sleep, and when she woke up, she discovered he had operated on both sides of her body without her consent. ""He said I'd had a lump in my left side as well,"" recalled Ms Iommi. ""Initially, I felt grateful that he'd got another lump out. But when I saw what he'd done, I thought: 'Oh my word'."" She had been left with a large ""dent"" in her side. To try and correct the damage, she went on to have reconstructive surgery but was never happy with the results. The surgery later ruptured. Over the years, the mother of two continued to find lumps in her breast. In 2010, she decided to go to a private clinic and when she booked an appointment at Spire hospital in Solihull, met Paterson again. ""He was a completely different person this time. As nice as pie. Ian Paterson was charming and confident - but he betrayed his patients' trust ""He said he could take the lumps out in a week, so he did. When I had my check-up he told me 'we're so lucky we caught it when we did'."" Shortly after, Ms Iommi, from Birmingham, was told her surgery needed to be reviewed. She has since seen many medical professionals who have told her the lumps in her breasts are simply scar tissue. Her experience has left her traumatised. ""He's an educated man,"" she said. ""I believed him. I'm still scared now. ""I'm forever at the doctors. I have a lump in my throat due to anxiety. I feel like I've been duped - seriously misled. ""I think he did it for power - and a lack of respect for women. Why mutilate women so they no longer want their partners to look at them?"" Debbie Douglas says she copes with the trauma of having unnecessary surgery by always being 'on the go' In the space of three years, mother-of-three Debbie Douglas lost both her parents to cancer and was diagnosed with breast cancer herself. Paterson performed a cleavage-sparing mastectomy which left her in ""horrendous"" pain. She later learned her cancer was not serious enough to warrant a mastectomy or the exhausting, seven-month course of chemotherapy she endured. ""He never bothered telling me any of that - he just took my breast off,"" said Mrs Douglas, 58, of Birmingham. Paterson recommended immediate reconstructive surgery, which involved taking part of the stomach muscle and using it to shape the new breast. ""I was cut from hip to hip and had all my lymph nodes removed. Afterwards I had no core strength - even now, I struggle to lift my granddaughter. I also got a hernia, which is a common side effect. ""I was grieving for my parents, and I was in horrendous pain for a long time."" Paterson never told her he was giving her one of his signature cleavage-sparing ops. It was only when she was recalled and reviewed, she learnt he had not taken away all the breast tissue. ""I always knew my scar looked different to what it should have done. I don't know why he gave it to me - he didn't explain anything to me about it at all."" She estimates the cost of all her surgery exceeded Â£100,000. ""He was the best surgeon - the top notch consultant. If he'd have told me to stand on one leg to get rid of my cancer, I'd have done it. ""He used to say: 'You can be cured.' He used to say that a lot. ""He's left me with a real fear my cancer will return. I am still paying to get checked out, because I don't want to get cancer."" Patricia Welch was one of 10 patients who gave evidence in Paterson's trial at Nottingham Crown Court Paterson had told Patricia Welch he had found a ""ticking bomb"" of cancerous cells in her breast - she was so scared of the consequences she opted for a mastectomy and immediate reconstruction. But when her case was reviewed as Paterson's work was called into question, an expert found her symptoms had been grossly exaggerated. His trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard Paterson embellished the cancer risk to both Mrs Welch and her doctor, and her mastectomy was unnecessary. ""I don't know whether he liked to play God or whether he liked to see the women he saw be grateful for what he'd done and whether he got a kick out of it,"" she said. ""He was just sitting there in open court on a laptop as if he hadn't got a care in the world. ""Hate is a strong word. I've never hated anyone in my life before, but it's pretty close. ""He won't suffer as all of us have been made to suffer all these years. ""I don't think you can ever get over it, because you've got it looking back at you in the mirror every morning. ""What he did. It will never go away. When you go private, you think you've got the best.""

Aviation 'not the enemy',"Flying is not ""the enemy"" in the fight against climate change, the chief executive of Heathrow Airport has said. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme: ""The answer is not to stop people flying. It has to be about decarbonising aviation."" The UK's aviation industry is promising to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Cleaner engines, new fuels and planting trees will all help, according to the industry group Sustainable Aviation. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The enemy is carbon, not aviation. We need to protect the ability to fly in a world without carbon. ""When the government blocked Heathrow expansion 10 years ago, people started flying through Amsterdam and Paris instead, taking two flights instead of one and not a single tonne of carbon was saved."" He said synthetic fuels were the way forward. ""It has been around for about 100 years and is becoming more affordable. It needs a real push on investment."" Sustainable Aviation says the industry's plan will mean airlines can cut pollution even as passenger numbers grow by an expected 70%. But campaigners say the only way to cut airline pollution is by reducing air travel and cancelling new airports and runways. ""We need to restrict flying,"" said Muna Suleiman, from Friends of the Earth. ""We can't have airport expansion at the same time."" Rail travel and buses are greener alternatives and taxes should be applied to frequent fliers, she said. Biofuels, which Sustainable Aviation say will be part of the industry's plan, still pollute, Ms Suleiman added. ""The crisis is here and now."" The aviation sector is under increasing pressure to come up with a plan to cut emissions, especially as it has no commercial comparator yet to the electric car, which is seen as the auto industry's hope for cutting emissions. While other forms of transport produce more carbon, individual journeys on planes produce large amounts of CO2. Sustainable Aviation says the UK industry can reduce its emissions of CO2 from 30 million tonnes a year to zero, without restricting growth. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger, according to the calculator from the UN's civil aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization. That is equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK or about the same as all of those caused by someone living in Ghana for more than a year. US firm Wright Electric said last week it had started electric engine development for a 186-seater plane, and hoped to begin test flights in 2023. British Airways is investing in a project to make fuel from rubbish. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly ""We are going to have to do this through many projects,"" Alex Cruz, chief executive of British Airways, told the BBC. ""Biofuels will give us a greener alternative and we are attracted by that,"" he said, while conceding that they will still produce carbon dioxide and that they are expensive at the moment. ""We do believe we will reach a point where the price will be compatible with the rest of fuel prices."" BA will also retire old planes, with the double-decker Boeing 747 being phased out in 2024. Other plans include planting trees - so-called carbon offsetting - and investing in renewable power sources, said Matt Gorman, a council member of Sustainable Aviation. ""Aviation is one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonise but we are absolutely confident it can be done,"" said Mr Gorman. ""We have to do it"" Sustainable Aviation's members include Heathrow Airport, British Airways, EasyJet, Rolls Royce, Airbus and air traffic controller Nats. The aviation sector has a problem. On one level, it is extremely successful. Passenger numbers in the UK are higher than they've ever been, and massive growth is expected worldwide over the next couple of decades. More passengers means more planes, and all else being equal that means an awful lot more emissions. The sector only accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 output at the moment, but the obvious risk is that share could rise significantly. You don't have to be Greta Thunberg to realise where that could lead. There's a risk that faced with growing public pressure to act on climate change, regulators could start to clamp down on the sector in a meaningful way - and that could hit growth. So here in the UK, businesses are taking pre-emptive action. Action they claim will reduce emissions to zero without curbing growth. So how effective will the plans be? Boeing and Airbus are already selling a new generation of aircraft that are much more efficient than their predecessors, and it's fair to say that there are plenty of benefits to be gained from investing in new technology. But the value of ""market-based measures"" such as carbon offsets is harder to calculate and hotly debated. People within the industry claim the projects they support are carefully chosen and reap real benefits. Climate campaigners say that's greenwash - and they'd rather we simply decided to fly a lot less. Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train?

"Children abused in the home 'unseen and unheard'Disbelief and denial about family sex abuse help perpetrators evade justice, a report says.Family & Education","Children abused in the home are often ""unseen and unheard"", despite making up two-thirds of sex abuse cases,a report from four official watchdogs,externalsays. ""There remains a disbelief and denial about familial sexual abuses,"" the inspectorates for police, health, probation and children's services say. It means abusers ""too often evade justice"", their joint report says. The government says it is taking urgent action that will see serious sexual offenders spending longer behind bars. The inspectors examined how child abuse within families was handled in six areas of England between September 2018 and May 2019 - and found local agencies ""woefully ill equipped"" to deal with it. One in five adults experienced abuse as children Most child sex abuse is carried out by family and friends Despite some pockets of good practice, they found local and national strategies to tackle the problem virtually non-existent. In the worst cases, criminal investigations would ignore the needs of the child, with children left without medical treatment or mental-health support. And sometimes, delays to police investigations left children ""in limbo or even unsafe"", with weak bail conditions leaving abusers free to contact or even live with children they may be abusing. The inspections, in Bracknell Forest, Berkshire, Cornwall, Derby, Islington, north London, Shropshire and York, found, overall, professionals lacked training, focus and knowledge about child sex abuse by family members or friends so were unable to identify abusers and how to stop them. There needs to be a greater emphasis on prevention work, which is currently either ""absent or focused on known offenders"", the report says. Samantha, seven, lived with her mother, whose new partner, a registered sex offender with convictions for child abuse, had just been released from prison. He was released without a risk assessment or sexual offending assessment and an assessment by the probation service was late and did not take full account of his risk to children or refer the family to children's social services. ""No referral for assessment was made and Samantha was left at risk of significant harm,"" the report finds. Hannah told her teacher she had been sexually abused by her adult brother. The school immediately informed social workers and Hannah was visited at school by a police officer and social worker the same day, who spoke to her with support from her teacher. The alleged abuser was immediately removed from the home. Hannah received very good emotional support from her teachers, school nurse and social worker and an intermediary helped her provide evidence for ensuing court proceedings. Too often professionals rely on children to verbally disclose abuse - but children are unlikely to tell someone they are being sexually abused, particularly when the abuser is close to them, the authors say. ""Everyone in society needs to know how to recognise the signs of abuse of a child and how best to respond,"" the report says. It says important lessons from child sexual exploitation are not being applied to abuse in families, which should be just as much of a priority. ""We can no longer stay silent on this issue - we have to talk about it and act,"" the report says. In a statement, the government said it would ""soon be publishing a first-of-its-kind national strategy to tackle child sexual abuse, better support victims and improve collaboration between the government, agencies and law enforcement"". ""Alongside work to better safeguard children, new sentencing laws will see serious sexual offenders spending longer behind bars and we are recruiting 20,000 extra police officers to bring more abusers to justice."" Ursula Gallagher, deputy chief inspector of general practice and children's health at the Care Quality Commission, said the report highlighted ""too many missed opportunities"" to protect children from harm. ""It is vital that people in healthcare and across other agencies work together, think about the wider social situation a child might be living in, share information to protect children from abuse and create support around those who are at risk."" Amanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspector, said:  ""If we are to deal with incest or other abuse involving families or family friends, we must talk openly and honestly about the signs and symptoms - to protect children and to stop abusers in their tracks.""

In addition, 24% of 3 and 4-year-olds had their own tablet, and 15% of them were allowed to take it to bed. Ofcom's annual report looks at the media habits of children, and the types of devices they are using. The 2019 study was based on more than 3,200 interviews with children and parents around the UK. ""The mobile phone is the device of choice for children,"" said Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom. ""I'm conscious that for these children who have never known a world without the internet, in many respects their online and offline worlds are indistinguishable."" The report also found that more older children were using social media to express their support for social causes and organisations, with 18% having shared or commented on a post, and one in ten having signed an online petition. Ofcom dubbed this ""the Greta effect"" after the 17-year-old environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg. The ""Greta effect"" has led to more older children supporting causes online. Other key findings for 2019 included: 48% of girls aged 5-15 played online games, compared with 71% of boys. Boys spent twice as long playing, clocking up 14.5 hours per week, compared with 7.5 for girls Snapchat and Facebook remained the most popular social media platforms of older children, but 62% were also using WhatsApp (up from 43% in 2018) 99% of children aged 5-15 used a TV set, 27% used a smart speaker and 22% used a radio 80% of the children in the report watched video-on-demand, and 25% watched no live broadcast TV at all. One nine-year-old girl told researchers: ""I don't really like the TV because you can't pick what channels are on it"". This video can not be played Students in Milton Keynes on their favourite smartphone apps Ofcom also interviewed parents about their concerns. It found that 45% of parents thought the benefits of children using the internet outweighed the risks, but there was an overall increase in parental concern about young people seeing content that might lead them to self-harm. Just under half (47%) of the parents spoken to were worried about pressure to spend money within games, especially on loot boxes, where the reward is not clear before purchase. 'Hateful content' more likely to be seen by Northern Ireland children 'The kids emptied our bank account playing Fifa' BBC launches 'digital wellbeing' app for children Of those parents with children aged between 5 and 15, 87% had sought advice about how to keep them safe online. ""We are seeing around half of 12-15 year olds saying they have seen hateful content online, and an increase in parents who are concerned about it,"" said Yih-Choung Teh. ""The good news is, more conversations about staying safe online are also happening across the country."" Following the report, children's charity the NSPCC called for independent regulators to force social media platforms to protect their users from viewing harmful material. ""While it's encouraging that parents are talking to their children about their media use, we must look to tech giants to protect their users and ensure they are a force for good not bad,"" said Andy Burrows, head of child safety online policy.

'Long way to go' for diversity in gaming industry,"Diversity is a ""necessity"" if the gaming industry is to continue to grow, says the body that represents people who make games. Around one in 10 people working in the UK industry are from ethnically diverse backgrounds - slightly higher than the national working average. But women make up less than 30%, the research by Ukie and the University of Sheffield suggests. It means some women have ""no-one to look up to"", says Kat Welsford. She works in marketing at independent games developer Bossa Studios - and says when it comes to women in games, it's a mixed picture. ""At my studio I'm really lucky that we have great gender diversity. ""But there are other places I've been to where it's disappointing when you see how few women there are, especially in leadership roles,"" Kat tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Kat says she's lucky to work somewhere with women in senior roles ""We have women in the senior leadership team at Bossa. That's useful to see because it shows I can make progress where I am. I can have a career here. ""Lots of other women I know in the industry who are 29 or 30 are saying to me they've got no-one to look up to."" Diversity in the creative industries is a hot topic at the moment, afterJoaquin Phoenix and Prince William spoke outat the recent Bafta film awards. It's something that's been on the mind of games companies in the UK for some time too, and Ukie started looking into the state of the industry last year. Ukie's boss Dr Jo Twist says diversity is a ""necessity"" for the industry to grow. More than 3,000 people who work in games in the UK took part in the survey - that's around 20% of the total number of people employed by gaming companies. ""I do know quite a few Chinese and Indian programmers who work in the industry,"" says Moo Yu, a Chinese-American gameplay programmer who works in London. But he says when it comes to some of the more creative roles, ""there's more white people and established people"". The survey suggests that 10% of UK games company staff are from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds - which is higher than the national working population and above that in the creative industries overall. But representation is notably less in senior roles. ""In the modern day, if you want to tell your own stories, you have to set up your own games studio,"" says Moo. ""It's something I'm noticing a lot more people of colour doing."" Moo Yu says he knows people setting up their own studios to tell their ""own"" stories He adds that for the bigger studios, the ""key is to make people feel like their voices are being heard"". ""I still think there's a long way to go."" The research also suggests that nearly a quarter of the UK games industry are LGBT and that two-thirds are under 35. Men make up 70% and women 28% - with 2% identifying as non-binary. Most come from middle-class backgrounds, according to the research, with 62% of those who took part coming from a household where the main earner worked in a managerial or professional role. In response to the research Ukie says it will sign up 200 UK games companies, which covers 50% of the workforce, to their #raisethegame pledge by 2021. It aims to increase diversity ""at every level"" of the gaming industry by recruiting ""as fairly and as widely as possible"" - and make workplaces more ""inclusive"" by ""educating and inspiring people to take more personal responsibility"" for promoting diversity. Companies like EA, Facebook, Jagex, King and Xbox have signed up already. ""Diversity isn't a nicety - it's a necessity if the industry is going to grow, thrive and truly reflect the tens of millions of people that play games every day in this country,"" Dr Jo Twist says. ""A diverse industry that draws on myriad cultures, lifestyles and experiences will lead to more creative and inclusive games that capture the imagination of players and drive our sector forward.""

Children abused in the home 'unseen and unheard',"Children abused in the home are often ""unseen and unheard"", despite making up two-thirds of sex abuse cases,a report from four official watchdogs,externalsays. ""There remains a disbelief and denial about familial sexual abuses,"" the inspectorates for police, health, probation and children's services say. It means abusers ""too often evade justice"", their joint report says. The government says it is taking urgent action that will see serious sexual offenders spending longer behind bars. The inspectors examined how child abuse within families was handled in six areas of England between September 2018 and May 2019 - and found local agencies ""woefully ill equipped"" to deal with it. One in five adults experienced abuse as children Most child sex abuse is carried out by family and friends Despite some pockets of good practice, they found local and national strategies to tackle the problem virtually non-existent. In the worst cases, criminal investigations would ignore the needs of the child, with children left without medical treatment or mental-health support. And sometimes, delays to police investigations left children ""in limbo or even unsafe"", with weak bail conditions leaving abusers free to contact or even live with children they may be abusing. The inspections, in Bracknell Forest, Berkshire, Cornwall, Derby, Islington, north London, Shropshire and York, found, overall, professionals lacked training, focus and knowledge about child sex abuse by family members or friends so were unable to identify abusers and how to stop them. There needs to be a greater emphasis on prevention work, which is currently either ""absent or focused on known offenders"", the report says. Samantha, seven, lived with her mother, whose new partner, a registered sex offender with convictions for child abuse, had just been released from prison. He was released without a risk assessment or sexual offending assessment and an assessment by the probation service was late and did not take full account of his risk to children or refer the family to children's social services. ""No referral for assessment was made and Samantha was left at risk of significant harm,"" the report finds. Hannah told her teacher she had been sexually abused by her adult brother. The school immediately informed social workers and Hannah was visited at school by a police officer and social worker the same day, who spoke to her with support from her teacher. The alleged abuser was immediately removed from the home. Hannah received very good emotional support from her teachers, school nurse and social worker and an intermediary helped her provide evidence for ensuing court proceedings. Too often professionals rely on children to verbally disclose abuse - but children are unlikely to tell someone they are being sexually abused, particularly when the abuser is close to them, the authors say. ""Everyone in society needs to know how to recognise the signs of abuse of a child and how best to respond,"" the report says. It says important lessons from child sexual exploitation are not being applied to abuse in families, which should be just as much of a priority. ""We can no longer stay silent on this issue - we have to talk about it and act,"" the report says. In a statement, the government said it would ""soon be publishing a first-of-its-kind national strategy to tackle child sexual abuse, better support victims and improve collaboration between the government, agencies and law enforcement"". ""Alongside work to better safeguard children, new sentencing laws will see serious sexual offenders spending longer behind bars and we are recruiting 20,000 extra police officers to bring more abusers to justice."" Ursula Gallagher, deputy chief inspector of general practice and children's health at the Care Quality Commission, said the report highlighted ""too many missed opportunities"" to protect children from harm. ""It is vital that people in healthcare and across other agencies work together, think about the wider social situation a child might be living in, share information to protect children from abuse and create support around those who are at risk."" Amanda Spielman, Ofsted's chief inspector, said:  ""If we are to deal with incest or other abuse involving families or family friends, we must talk openly and honestly about the signs and symptoms - to protect children and to stop abusers in their tracks.""

First of new UK submarine hunters due in Scotland,"This video can not be played Watch as the first P-8A Poseidon touches down at Kinloss Barracks The first of nine new maritime patrol aircraft for the RAF has arrived at a military base in Scotland after being flown from the United States. The Â£3bn fleet of P-8A Poseidons are to be stationed at RAF Lossiemouth on the Moray coast. The first of the completed planes will operate from nearby Kinloss Barracks, a former RAF station, while new facilities are built at Lossiemouth. It is almost 10 years since the RAF's last patrol aircraft were scrapped. The last of those jet aircraft, called Nimrods, flew out of RAF Kinloss in 2010. New Nimrods were dismantled for scrap as part of defence cuts, but not replaced by another type of plane. The plane was escorted by RAF Typhoons A review in 2015 led to the Ministry of Defence ordering the P-8A Poseidons from US aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The first of these aircraft landed at Kinloss at about 13:30. The RAF crews will operate alongside the Royal Navy in a submarine hunter role, and in work identifying and tracking surface vessels. About 470 jobs, a mix of military and civilian posts, will be created at RAF Lossiemouth to fly and service the fleet. RAF crews have been training on the new aircraft in the US A new facility is being built at RAF Lossiemouth for the Poseidons The first of the completed Poseidons has been named the Pride of Moray. It is expected to move from Kinloss to Lossiemouth by the end of this year. Sqn Ldr Dave Higgins was among the crew board Tuesday's flight to Kinloss following training in the US. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is a huge honour to be on that historic flight. ""For some of us there is much excitement because myself and my colleagues know how capable this aircraft is going to be. ""They are multi-mission aircraft with a variety of sensors that can fuse together so the crew can see lots of different types of information."" Equipped with ""state-of-the-art sensors"" enabling it to detect, identify and track vessels both above and below water Carries sonobuoys, devices which are dropped from the aircraft into the sea to search for submarines Armed with Harpoon anti-surface ship missiles and Mk 54 torpedoes capable of attacking both surface and sub-surface targets Will be flown from RAF Lossiemouth by two squadrons: CXX Sqn and the still to be fully operational 201 Sqn Crews have been training on the aircraft at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in the US Â£132m of improvements being made at Lossiemouth to accommodate the fleet and its crews, including a new ""strategic facility"" to house and maintain the aircraft and personnel. The investment includes Â£75m in resurfacing runways Joe Kennedy, who flew on Nimrods for more than 30 years, said the decision to scrap the planes and not immediately replace them with new maritime patrol aircraft still felt shocking almost 10 years later. He said: ""We all felt incredibly sad this fantastic aeroplane was coming to an end of its life. ""In my personal opinion I think it was a great loss and I think a lot of us thought it inconceivable that we lose the maritime patrol capability with nothing to replace it."" Joe Kennedy said it seemed 'inconceivable' not to have replaced Nimrods after scrapping the aircraft Mr Kennedy, who co-authored a book about Nimrods, said he was ""delighted"" the RAF would soon have a fleet of Poseidons. Moray councillor James Allan said the arrival of the new personnel would bring benefits to the local community. He said: ""It's great for Lossiemouth, which is a small place. ""We have a new school being built just now and a new community centre and swimming pool. It will also be great for our economy."" Defence Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said RAF Lossiemouth's strategic northerly location made it ""one of the most important air stations in the UK"". Richard Lochhead SNP MSP for Moray said the fleet would bring new employment opportunities to the local area. He said: ""The arrival of the very first P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is a big day for RAF Lossiemouth and Moray and also plugs a gap in the UK's defence capability by restoring marine surveillance."" Douglas Ross, Conservative MP for Moray and UK government minister for Scotland, said the Poseidon's new facilities formed part of Â£470m of investment in RAF Lossiemouth.

YouTube shines but Google ads continue to slow,"Google's parent company has published details of its YouTube and cloud business for the first time, as the firm's advertising business continues to slow. YouTube's ad sales in the last three months of 2019 rose 31% year-on-year to $4.7bn (Â£3.62bn), Alphabet said. Overall Alphabet revenue increased by 17% year-on-year to $46bn - the slowest rate in more than two years. While YouTube is rapidly growing, Alphabet's cloud business lags rivals. For years the business did not publish revenue figures for its various divisions, to the concern of investors and regulators. When Sundar Pichai took over as Alphabet chief executive last year the policy changed, although it is still not releasing profit figures for individual units. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? Alphabet said it earned $2.6bn in cloud revenue for the most recent quarter - compared to almost $10bn at Amazon. However it is fast-growing, rising more than 50% year-on-year. Alphabet and others make money in cloud computing by charging companies to host their data remotely, rather than firms maintaining their own servers. Alphabet shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trade. Although growth missed analyst forecasts, Alphabet's business remains strong, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown. ""It's always important to put these sorts of misses into perspective,"" he said. ""The core businesses, like Search and YouTube, continue to generate prodigious quantities of cash."" Google's advertising revenue increased 17% to almost $27.2bn. Alphabet reported quarterly profits of almost $10.7bn, up 19% year-on-year, while costs rose 18% to $36.8bn, as the firm invested in data centres and hired new staff. YouTube now counts about two million paid subscribers, Mr Pichai said. At more than $15bn for 2019, YouTube's ad business accounted for almost 10% of Alphabet's overall revenues last year - but the firm also said it shares a large portion of YouTube ad revenue with people posting videos. Mr Pichai said the firm sees opportunity to make even more money off its YouTube adverts, including by targeting them more precisely. ""We see that as a big opportunity and are investing for it,"" he said. Who is Sundar Pichai and what does Alphabet do? What can you use instead of Google and Facebook?

The shelter giving wine to alcoholics,"This video can not be played ""I started drinking alcohol when I was eight"" A Canadian scheme that tries to stabilise alcoholics by giving them measured amounts of wine is to be tested in Scotland. Every hour residents of the Managed Alcohol Project in downtown Ottawa line up for what is called ""the pour"". They take their mugs, emblazoned with the names of ice hockey teams and local cafes, to get a glass of white wine. The wine is made in plastic barrels by residents up the road at the Oaks project where longer-term clients live. Before the pour - which takes place between 07:30 and 21:30 - there is a quick assessment by the nurse on duty. If they are intoxicated, they do not get their measure. Based on the Canadian experience, a pilot project is being set up in Glasgow. Brian says he now wants to give up drinking In Ottawa, a group of people live in shared rooms where they are learning to stabilise their lifelong addictions to alcohol. The setting is semi-clinical, but one notable difference is that the hand sanitiser on the wall has been replaced with sunscreen because the residents were drinking it for its alcohol content. Brian McMahon is cooking spaghetti at the project for people he has only just met recently, but considers to be his friends. He used to run a bakery and took pride in the popularity of his homemade apple pies. But while he worked, he drank heavily. The 46-year-old comes from a family of alcoholics and has been drinking since he was eight. His drinking got so bad that his body would go into seizures without alcohol. He lost his job and ended up homeless. ""I started passing out in the snow and on the streets,"" he toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. ""I started getting put in ambulances and hospitalised."" Brian says that after one alcoholic seizure he ran out of the hospital as the doors opened at 7am, desperately searching for a drink. While hunting for alcohol he found another homeless man buried under the snow of a freezing Canadian winter. ""Just his boots were showing,"" he says. Brian dragged him across the snow to the hospital he had just run away from. He does not know if the man survived but for Brian it was a wake-up call. After 14 months on the managed alcohol programme, Brian is talking about his hopes of getting back to work and coming off alcohol altogether. Abstinence is a potential effect of the project, but not necessarily its overall aim. The shelter gives alcoholics a measured amount of wine every hour The aim is to stabilise people's addiction, stop them from drinking paint thinner and hand sanitiser, stop them passing out on the streets, and give them some dignity, says Dr Jeff Turnbull. He and nurse Wendy Muckle set up the Managed Alcohol Project (MAP) after four people died on the streets of Ottawa in a short space of time and a well-known homeless ""character"" called Eugene had all of his toes amputated after passing out drunk in a doorway. Eugene released himself from hospital and ran out in the snow in his bandaged stubs to get his next drink. Ms Muckle explains that Dr Turnbull chased Eugene down the street with a vial of antibiotics in a desperate bid to keep him alive. That, they say, was when they realised they needed to do something different. The idea was to stop alcoholics thinking about where they could get their next drink by providing it for them. To begin with the project had little budget and resources but 19 years later they have local and central government funding and two residential centres in Ottawa for chronically alcoholic homeless people. There are now 14 MAPs across Canada and plans to build more. Dr Jeff Turnbull started the scheme 19 years ago It is a harm reduction model which, when some people first heard about it, led to death threats for Dr Turnbull. Interestingly, he says, some of their biggest critics have become their strongest advocates. The local police chief officially opened the Oaks project after seeing the benefits for his own officers who no longer have to spend hours and hours taking drunk people to hospital or police cells. Instead they take them directly to the specialist team at MAP. In response to accusations that people are just being parked on alcohol, she responds by asking if diabetics are being parked on insulin. Her point is that alcoholism is a disease, which for some cannot be cured. She says it is about providing people with some quality of life and a community. Karyn McCluskey says no-one has come up with a better alternative Karyn McCluskey is well known for her leadership of Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, which cracked down on Glasgow's knife crime rates, and now runs Community Justice Scotland. She also volunteers with homeless charity the Simon Community and has seen first hand people dying on the streets of Glasgow because of alcohol. Ms McCluskey visited the project in Canada to see how it could work in Scotland and was impressed. When she returned, she looked at seven men who would fit the profile in Glasgow - homeless, addicted to alcohol and who had had multiple failed treatment attempts. She found that in the previous three years those seven men had been recorded for 1,630 crimes. One had been taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary 427 times. They were costing services hundreds of thousands of pounds. Ms McCluskey admits the pilot scheme will have its critics but says no-one has come up with an alternative other than letting people drain public resources and then die on the streets. ""The evidence is that they will drink less and that their health is better and they use much less public resources,"" she said. For the Glasgow pilot project there is already a building and a steering group in place, made up of health and justice experts including Ms McCluskey. But there are going to be critics. Prof Jonathan Chick is medical director at Castle Craig Hospital in the Scottish Borders, which treats people suffering from alcohol and drug addictions. He says Canada has specific problems with people drinking non-beverage alcohol - which Scotland does not. Prof Chick said he would not support the introduction of a MAP in Scotland, and would prefer to see greater investment in traditional abstinence programmes.

Aviation 'not the enemy' in climate battle,"Flying is not ""the enemy"" in the fight against climate change, the chief executive of Heathrow Airport has said. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme: ""The answer is not to stop people flying. It has to be about decarbonising aviation."" The UK's aviation industry is promising to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Cleaner engines, new fuels and planting trees will all help, according to the industry group Sustainable Aviation. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The enemy is carbon, not aviation.

Sustainable Aviation says the industry's plan will mean airlines can cut pollution even as passenger numbers grow by an expected 70%.

Biofuels, which Sustainable Aviation say will be part of the industry's plan, still pollute, Ms Suleiman added. ""The crisis is here and now."" The aviation sector is under increasing pressure to come up with a plan to cut emissions, especially as it has no commercial comparator yet to the electric car, which is seen as the auto industry's hope for cutting emissions. While other forms of transport produce more carbon, individual journeys on planes produce large amounts of CO2. Sustainable Aviation says the UK industry can reduce its emissions of CO2 from 30 million tonnes a year to zero, without restricting growth. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger, according to the calculator from the UN's civil aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization. That is equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK or about the same as all of those caused by someone living in Ghana for more than a year.

""We do believe we will reach a point where the price will be compatible with the rest of fuel prices."" BA will also retire old planes, with the double-decker Boeing 747 being phased out in 2024. Other plans include planting trees - so-called carbon offsetting - and investing in renewable power sources, said Matt Gorman, a council member of Sustainable Aviation. ""Aviation is one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonise but we are absolutely confident it can be done,"" said Mr Gorman. ""We have to do it"" Sustainable Aviation's members include Heathrow Airport, British Airways, EasyJet, Rolls Royce, Airbus and air traffic controller Nats. The aviation sector has a problem. On one level, it is extremely successful. Passenger numbers in the UK are higher than they've ever been, and massive growth is expected worldwide over the next couple of decades. More passengers means more planes, and all else being equal that means an awful lot more emissions. The sector only accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 output at the moment, but the obvious risk is that share could rise significantly. You don't have to be Greta Thunberg to realise where that could lead. There's a risk that faced with growing public pressure to act on climate change, regulators could start to clamp down on the sector in a meaningful way - and that could hit growth. So here in the UK, businesses are taking pre-emptive action. Action they claim will reduce emissions to zero without curbing growth. So how effective will the plans be? Boeing and Airbus are already selling a new generation of aircraft that are much more efficient than their predecessors, and it's fair to say that there are plenty of benefits to be gained from investing in new technology.

Aviation 'not the enemy' on climate,"Flying is not ""the enemy"" in the fight against climate change, the chief executive of Heathrow Airport has said. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme: ""The answer is not to stop people flying. It has to be about decarbonising aviation."" The UK's aviation industry is promising to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Cleaner engines, new fuels and planting trees will all help, according to the industry group Sustainable Aviation. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The enemy is carbon, not aviation.

Blanket given to stem bleeding,"Dave Chawner speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Eyewitnesses have described scenes of distress and panic when a man was shot dead by police after stabbing people in Streatham, London. They told the BBC how they fled at the sound of gunshots on Streatham High Road just after 14:00 GMT on Sunday. Three people were injured in the attack - carried out by Sudesh Amman, 20 - but none is in a critical condition. One man said he gave people looking after one of the victims a blanket to ""help stem the bleeding"". Dave Chawner, who had been on the way to the cinema, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I heard what I thought at that time was a car backfiring. Police search homes in Streatham attack probe Streatham attacker named as Sudesh Amman Who was Sudesh Amman? ""I turned back and turned round and saw a small group of people around a man who was on the floor who was incredibly distressed, he was holding his lower right quadrant and there was blood everywhere. ""I happened to have a blanket in my bag and I gave it to them to help stem the bleeding and I ran to the nearest crossroads to wave down the ambulance."" Mr Chawner said the ambulance ""took well over half an hour to arrive"", which was ""incredibly frustrating and distressing"". London Ambulance Servicesaid its medics were at the scene in four minutes,external, but were sent to a rendezvous point until police told them it was safe to treat patients. People gathered near the scene in Streatham Adam Blake, who was walking along Streatham Common, described how he saw two or three cars crash into each other, including an unmarked police car, as the incident unfolded. ""Another police car carried on towards the hill pursuing someone,"" he told the BBC. A police officer was seen pointing a gun at a man, who was seen on the floor outside Boots Gjon Kathegjolli said he was in a barber shop when he heard a woman, who was with a baby in a push chair and two young boys, scream and saw her being stabbed. A man then walked past carrying a knife the size of his forearm, he said. Daniel Gough said he was out for a run when he heard shots and everyone ran. ""There was panic, people were yelling,"" he said. ""A young girl running alongside me kept asking 'Is this what I'm meant to do?' - she was very distressed. ""I saw a policeman and he yelled, telling everyone to get back. His gun was pointing in the direction of a man on the floor.""

Ban on petrol and diesel vehicles brought forward,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough: ""Now is the moment"" A ban on selling new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars in the UK will be brought forward from 2040 to 2035 at the latest, under government plans. The change comes after experts said 2040 would be too late if the UK wants to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. Boris Johnson unveiled the policy as part of a launch event fora United Nations climate summit in November. He said 2020 would be a ""defining year of climate action"" for the planet. The summit, known as COP26, is being hosted in Glasgow. It is an annual UN-led gathering set up to assess progress on tackling climate change. Sir David Attenborough said at the launch event at London's Science Museum that he was looking forward to COP26 and found it ""encouraging"" that the UK government was launching a ""year of climate action"". ""The longer we leave it... the worse it is going to get,"" he said. ""So now is the moment. It is up to us to organise the nations of the world to do something about it."" How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? Campaign group Extinction Rebellion held a protest outside London's Science Museum to coincide with the event In a statement made ahead of the launch, Mr Johnson said the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars would come even earlier than 2035, if possible. Hybrid vehicles are also now being included in the proposals, which were originally announced in July 2017. People will only be able to buy electric or hydrogen cars and vans, once the ban comes into effect. The change in plans, which will be subject to a consultation, comes after experts warnedthe previous target date of 2040would still leave old conventional cars on the roads following the clean-up date of 2050. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""This phenomenon of global warming is taking its toll"" The Scottish government does not have the power to ban new petrol and diesel cars but has alreadypledged to ""phase out the need""for them by 2032 with measures such as an expansion of the charging network for electric cars. Mr Johnson said the 2050 pledge was necessary because the UK's ""historic emissions"" meant ""we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way"". The announcement comes as COP26's former president Claire OâNeill, who was sacked on Friday, wrote a bitter letteraccusing Mr Johnson of failing to support her work. The prime minister's official spokesperson said Downing Street had ""no comment"" to make on the letter, but thanked Mrs O'Neill for her work towards the conference. He said her replacement would be a ""ministerial post"" with details set out ""in due course."" Mr Johnson did not answer the BBC's David Shukman's questions about the row. Allow Twitter content?

At the Science Museum the prime minister added that a ""catastrophic period of global addiction"" to hydrocarbons had led to the planet being ""swaddled in a tea cosy"" of carbon dioxide. But Green Party MPCaroline Lucas said on Twitter,external: ""Carbon emissions are not 'swaddling the planet like a tea cosy'.

""With current demand for this still expensive technology still just a fraction of sales, it's clear that accelerating an already very challenging ambition will take more than industry investment,"" Mike Hawes said. He said the government's plans must safeguard industry and jobs, as well as ensuring current sales of low emission vehicles were not undermined. Meanwhile Mrs OâNeill accused Mr Johnson of promising money and people to support her work, but failing to deliver either.

The shelter giving wine to alcoholicsA Canadian scheme tries to stabilise alcoholics by giving them measured amounts of booze each day.Scotland,"This video can not be played ""I started drinking alcohol when I was eight"" A Canadian scheme that tries to stabilise alcoholics by giving them measured amounts of wine is to be tested in Scotland. Every hour residents of the Managed Alcohol Project in downtown Ottawa line up for what is called ""the pour"". They take their mugs, emblazoned with the names of ice hockey teams and local cafes, to get a glass of white wine. The wine is made in plastic barrels by residents up the road at the Oaks project where longer-term clients live. Before the pour - which takes place between 07:30 and 21:30 - there is a quick assessment by the nurse on duty. If they are intoxicated, they do not get their measure. Based on the Canadian experience, a pilot project is being set up in Glasgow. Brian says he now wants to give up drinking In Ottawa, a group of people live in shared rooms where they are learning to stabilise their lifelong addictions to alcohol. The setting is semi-clinical, but one notable difference is that the hand sanitiser on the wall has been replaced with sunscreen because the residents were drinking it for its alcohol content. Brian McMahon is cooking spaghetti at the project for people he has only just met recently, but considers to be his friends. He used to run a bakery and took pride in the popularity of his homemade apple pies. But while he worked, he drank heavily. The 46-year-old comes from a family of alcoholics and has been drinking since he was eight. His drinking got so bad that his body would go into seizures without alcohol. He lost his job and ended up homeless. ""I started passing out in the snow and on the streets,"" he toldBBC Scotland's The Nine. ""I started getting put in ambulances and hospitalised."" Brian says that after one alcoholic seizure he ran out of the hospital as the doors opened at 7am, desperately searching for a drink. While hunting for alcohol he found another homeless man buried under the snow of a freezing Canadian winter. ""Just his boots were showing,"" he says. Brian dragged him across the snow to the hospital he had just run away from. He does not know if the man survived but for Brian it was a wake-up call. After 14 months on the managed alcohol programme, Brian is talking about his hopes of getting back to work and coming off alcohol altogether. Abstinence is a potential effect of the project, but not necessarily its overall aim. The shelter gives alcoholics a measured amount of wine every hour The aim is to stabilise people's addiction, stop them from drinking paint thinner and hand sanitiser, stop them passing out on the streets, and give them some dignity, says Dr Jeff Turnbull. He and nurse Wendy Muckle set up the Managed Alcohol Project (MAP) after four people died on the streets of Ottawa in a short space of time and a well-known homeless ""character"" called Eugene had all of his toes amputated after passing out drunk in a doorway. Eugene released himself from hospital and ran out in the snow in his bandaged stubs to get his next drink. Ms Muckle explains that Dr Turnbull chased Eugene down the street with a vial of antibiotics in a desperate bid to keep him alive. That, they say, was when they realised they needed to do something different. The idea was to stop alcoholics thinking about where they could get their next drink by providing it for them. To begin with the project had little budget and resources but 19 years later they have local and central government funding and two residential centres in Ottawa for chronically alcoholic homeless people. There are now 14 MAPs across Canada and plans to build more. Dr Jeff Turnbull started the scheme 19 years ago It is a harm reduction model which, when some people first heard about it, led to death threats for Dr Turnbull. Interestingly, he says, some of their biggest critics have become their strongest advocates. The local police chief officially opened the Oaks project after seeing the benefits for his own officers who no longer have to spend hours and hours taking drunk people to hospital or police cells. Instead they take them directly to the specialist team at MAP. In response to accusations that people are just being parked on alcohol, she responds by asking if diabetics are being parked on insulin. Her point is that alcoholism is a disease, which for some cannot be cured. She says it is about providing people with some quality of life and a community. Karyn McCluskey says no-one has come up with a better alternative Karyn McCluskey is well known for her leadership of Scotland's Violence Reduction Unit, which cracked down on Glasgow's knife crime rates, and now runs Community Justice Scotland. She also volunteers with homeless charity the Simon Community and has seen first hand people dying on the streets of Glasgow because of alcohol. Ms McCluskey visited the project in Canada to see how it could work in Scotland and was impressed. When she returned, she looked at seven men who would fit the profile in Glasgow - homeless, addicted to alcohol and who had had multiple failed treatment attempts. She found that in the previous three years those seven men had been recorded for 1,630 crimes. One had been taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary 427 times. They were costing services hundreds of thousands of pounds. Ms McCluskey admits the pilot scheme will have its critics but says no-one has come up with an alternative other than letting people drain public resources and then die on the streets. ""The evidence is that they will drink less and that their health is better and they use much less public resources,"" she said. For the Glasgow pilot project there is already a building and a steering group in place, made up of health and justice experts including Ms McCluskey. But there are going to be critics. Prof Jonathan Chick is medical director at Castle Craig Hospital in the Scottish Borders, which treats people suffering from alcohol and drug addictions. He says Canada has specific problems with people drinking non-beverage alcohol - which Scotland does not. Prof Chick said he would not support the introduction of a MAP in Scotland, and would prefer to see greater investment in traditional abstinence programmes.

"Universal credit rollout delayed to 2024People are ""scared"" to transfer onto the new benefit which has been beset by problems.UK","Stories like Paula's, whose first universal credit payment wasn't enough to live on, are thought to have ""scared people"" Full rollout of universal credit, the government's flagship welfare reform, is being delayed again, adding Â£500m to its overall cost, the BBC has learned. Officials say not enough people are moving to the benefit as they are ""scared"" to move to universal credit. The system was meant to be fully live by April 2017, but the new delay will push it back to September 2024. The welfare delivery minister, Will Quince, said claimants would not lose money as a result of the change. Full rollout had already been put back to 2023 What is universal credit - and what's the problem? The backroom discussions leading to the latest delay were recorded by a BBC team whose series,Universal Credit: Inside the Welfare State, starts on Tuesday. The new benefit, which replaces six existing payments, has been beset by problems, with claimants having to wait at least five weeks for the payments to start and many reports of people falling into debt, and having to resort to food banks as a consequence. People transferring to universal credit have to wait five weeks for the first payment On top of that, advance payments of the benefit, introduced to help people through the five weeks with no money coming in, have been blamed for putting claimants into debt. That's because once the benefit finally comes through, payments are reduced to pay off the advance. Claimants are meant to transfer onto universal credit when they have a change of circumstances, such as moving in with a new partner. The film-makers were allowed access to meetings inside the Department for Work and Pensions, and officials are seen pondering what to do when they realise fewer people are reporting changes of circumstances and therefore being transferred to the new benefit, than expected. One programme shows Bolton mum Paula struggling to feed her family when her first universal credit payment comes in at just over Â£500 for a month, because of deductions to pay off the advance she took during the five-week wait. She ends up resorting to a food bank. ""I have just got myself into one big mess and I have lost control over everything,"" Paula tells a debt counsellor. ""I am in debt up to my eyeballs and it's not going to go away."" Paula was referred to a food bank The counsellor tells her: ""Any customer on universal credit, we already know that you're standing on the back foot. ""If you don't have money saved up already or you don't have backup of family who can support you, you will fall into taking an advance payment."" She added that benefit deductions to pay off the advance, leave people ""constantly trying to catch up"". Neil Couling, the senior civil servant in charge of the rollout for the past five years, is filmed telling a Whitehall meeting: ""We've got a lot of anecdotal evidence of people being scared to come to universal credit. ""It's a potentially serious issue for us, in terms of completing the project by December 2023, but I'm urging people not to panic."" ""I'll take the beating"": senior civil servant Neil Couling decides to delay full rollout by another nine months But a few weeks later, in September 2019, he decides to delay full rollout to September 2024, putting Â£500m on the bill. ""Three, six or nine months, it doesn't matter - the headline will be: 'Delay, disaster',"" he says ""I would say, 'Go safe, put the claimants first, and I'll take the beating.'"" Despite the problems, Mr Couling says he believes that once universal credit is fully implemented, it will be successful and regarded as ""the right thing to do"". ""This is the system that will form the bedrock of social security for the next 30 years."" He expects universal credit to continue to grow, with 2.6 million people already on it by September last year: ""Right now there's no way I can put the brakes on and stop. ""I have to keep going to the destination or you have to set me a different destination, because there's 2.6 million people, and if we get something wrong we could disrupt their lives and they've got no alternative. There's no alternative bank they can go to get help. We are the payer of last resort."" Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, called the news ""hugely embarrassing"" for the government and called for universal credit to be scrapped. ""Universal credit was supposed to be its flagship social security programme. ""Instead we now find that it is being forced to delay the full rollout because the public have so very little faith in it and many are actually afraid of it,"" said Ms Greenwood. The government says universal credit was always intended to be introduced slowly. It is ""the biggest change to the welfare system in a generation, bringing together six overlapping benefits into one monthly payment and offering support to some of the most vulnerable people in society"", said Mr Quince. ""It is right that we revisit our forecasts and plan, and re-plan accordingly, ensuring that the process is working well for people on benefits.""

UK aviation industry vows net zero carbon by 2050,"Flying is not ""the enemy"" in the fight against climate change, the chief executive of Heathrow Airport has said. John Holland-Kaye told the BBC's Today programme: ""The answer is not to stop people flying. It has to be about decarbonising aviation."" The UK's aviation industry is promising to reduce its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. Cleaner engines, new fuels and planting trees will all help, according to the industry group Sustainable Aviation. Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""The enemy is carbon, not aviation. We need to protect the ability to fly in a world without carbon. ""When the government blocked Heathrow expansion 10 years ago, people started flying through Amsterdam and Paris instead, taking two flights instead of one and not a single tonne of carbon was saved."" He said synthetic fuels were the way forward. ""It has been around for about 100 years and is becoming more affordable. It needs a real push on investment."" Sustainable Aviation says the industry's plan will mean airlines can cut pollution even as passenger numbers grow by an expected 70%. But campaigners say the only way to cut airline pollution is by reducing air travel and cancelling new airports and runways. ""We need to restrict flying,"" said Muna Suleiman, from Friends of the Earth. ""We can't have airport expansion at the same time."" Rail travel and buses are greener alternatives and taxes should be applied to frequent fliers, she said. Biofuels, which Sustainable Aviation say will be part of the industry's plan, still pollute, Ms Suleiman added. ""The crisis is here and now."" The aviation sector is under increasing pressure to come up with a plan to cut emissions, especially as it has no commercial comparator yet to the electric car, which is seen as the auto industry's hope for cutting emissions. While other forms of transport produce more carbon, individual journeys on planes produce large amounts of CO2. Sustainable Aviation says the UK industry can reduce its emissions of CO2 from 30 million tonnes a year to zero, without restricting growth. An economy-class return flight from London to New York emits an estimated 0.67 tonnes of CO2 per passenger, according to the calculator from the UN's civil aviation body, the International Civil Aviation Organization. That is equivalent to 11% of the average annual emissions for someone in the UK or about the same as all of those caused by someone living in Ghana for more than a year. US firm Wright Electric said last week it had started electric engine development for a 186-seater plane, and hoped to begin test flights in 2023. British Airways is investing in a project to make fuel from rubbish. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly ""We are going to have to do this through many projects,"" Alex Cruz, chief executive of British Airways, told the BBC. ""Biofuels will give us a greener alternative and we are attracted by that,"" he said, while conceding that they will still produce carbon dioxide and that they are expensive at the moment. ""We do believe we will reach a point where the price will be compatible with the rest of fuel prices."" BA will also retire old planes, with the double-decker Boeing 747 being phased out in 2024. Other plans include planting trees - so-called carbon offsetting - and investing in renewable power sources, said Matt Gorman, a council member of Sustainable Aviation. ""Aviation is one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonise but we are absolutely confident it can be done,"" said Mr Gorman. ""We have to do it"" Sustainable Aviation's members include Heathrow Airport, British Airways, EasyJet, Rolls Royce, Airbus and air traffic controller Nats. The aviation sector has a problem. On one level, it is extremely successful. Passenger numbers in the UK are higher than they've ever been, and massive growth is expected worldwide over the next couple of decades. More passengers means more planes, and all else being equal that means an awful lot more emissions. The sector only accounts for about 2.5% of global CO2 output at the moment, but the obvious risk is that share could rise significantly. You don't have to be Greta Thunberg to realise where that could lead. There's a risk that faced with growing public pressure to act on climate change, regulators could start to clamp down on the sector in a meaningful way - and that could hit growth. So here in the UK, businesses are taking pre-emptive action. Action they claim will reduce emissions to zero without curbing growth. So how effective will the plans be? Boeing and Airbus are already selling a new generation of aircraft that are much more efficient than their predecessors, and it's fair to say that there are plenty of benefits to be gained from investing in new technology. But the value of ""market-based measures"" such as carbon offsets is harder to calculate and hotly debated. People within the industry claim the projects they support are carefully chosen and reap real benefits. Climate campaigners say that's greenwash - and they'd rather we simply decided to fly a lot less. Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train?

Minister unveils Â£23m welfare scheme extensionPayments to lessen the impact of the so-called bedroom tax in Northern Ireland were due to run out on 31 March.Northern IrelandComments,"Michelle O'Neill and Deirdre Hargey announced the proposals at Stormont on Monday Plans for an extension of welfare mitigations to the so-called bedroom tax have been announced by the minister for communities. The scheme currently provides financial support to people who would otherwise have faced welfare cuts. But it was due to run out on 31 March. About 38,000 households in Northern Ireland are in receipt of supplementary payments, which protect them from the tax, the Department for Communities said. The minister Deirdre Hargey said the proposal would cost Â£23m per annum. ""We have a responsibility to protect the poorest and most vulnerable in society,"" said Ms Hargey. She said the executive agreed her recommendation on Monday. It was first outlined inNew Decade, New Approach,external- the deal that restored devolution after three years of political deadlock in Northern Ireland. ""A society is judged on how we protect the most disadvantaged,"" she added. ""I am a minister who will fight to protect those families living in poverty; low-income families, single-parent families, those with disabilities and children and young people.  I am working hard to target resources towards those most in need."" She said there were other mitigations ""which need to be looked at"" and she will be working with stakeholders ""in moving forward with that important piece of work"".

"Universal credit rollout delayed to 2024People are ""scared"" to transfer onto the new benefit which has been beset by problems.","Stories like Paula's, whose first universal credit payment wasn't enough to live on, are thought to have ""scared people"" Full rollout of universal credit, the government's flagship welfare reform, is being delayed again, adding Â£500m to its overall cost, the BBC has learned. Officials say not enough people are moving to the benefit as they are ""scared"" to move to universal credit. The system was meant to be fully live by April 2017, but the new delay will push it back to September 2024. The welfare delivery minister, Will Quince, said claimants would not lose money as a result of the change. Full rollout had already been put back to 2023 What is universal credit - and what's the problem? The backroom discussions leading to the latest delay were recorded by a BBC team whose series,Universal Credit: Inside the Welfare State, starts on Tuesday.

nearing 23:30 here in Washington, so we are going to wind down our live
coverage of another busy day in US politics. We started out explaining what was happening with the
Democratic race for president in Iowa, and we ended it with President Trump's
third State of the Union address. Here's the latest from Iowa, where
Monday's caucuses aimed to decide who Iowans wanted to run against Mr Trump:  Meanwhile, in Washington:  We'll be back tomorrow for live coverage of the ongoing
impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

impeachment trial into Mr Trump. See you then. It's been a busy few days in US politics - the Iowa caucuses on Monday and the State of the Union address today. It doesn't look like slowing down on Wednesday either. After the chaotic results process, we should (or maybe could) find out who actually won in Iowa and is on the early front foot to be the Democratic nominee. Right now, Pete Buttigieg is in the lead. Oh, and there's also the small matter of the vote on whether to convict President Trump in his impeachment trial. That should happen at about 21:00 east coast time on Wednesday. On BBC World News, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher spoke of the divided body language that coloured Trump's remarks, noting both Trump's snub of top Democrat Nancy Pelosi's attempted handshake and later, Pelosi's shredding of the president speech. But partisan tension aside, ""the point of Trump's speech"", like for any incumbent president before an election ""is to lay out the framework of that re-election campaign,"" Zurcher says. And this year, America's ""booming economy"" was Trump's central pitch, drawing a counterpoint to the Democrats, who he says would endanger a long-term economic growth period. And Trump got most aggressive in two main areas Zurcher says: healthcare and immigration. Zurcher also noted the medal of freedom awarded to Rush Limbaugh, a figure who is is ""notorious among Democrats for what they view as racist and sexist statements"", and known among Republicans as a ""grandfather of conservative politics"". Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has commented on her headline-grabbing move following Trump's address: ripping up pages of the president's remarks. Asked why she did it, the Speaker of the House told reporters: ""It was the courteous thing to do."" ""It was such a dirty speech,"" she said. âNadie estÃ¡ por encima de la ley.â So says Veronica Escobar, the congresswoman from El Paso, Texas, who is delivering the Spanish-language Democratic rebuttal. The sentence translates to: âNo one is above the law.â âThis is a tragic moment, and Congress must defend our republic,"" she continues in a speech delivered from  a medical clinic in El Paso's Segundo Barrio neighbourhood. She also criticises a statement Trump previously made, calling El Paso a dangerous area. In fact, it is one of the safest communities in America. She calls Trump's words ""a misinformation campaign"". Governor Gretchen Whitmer has wrapped up the Democratic rebuttal. Now a second rebuttal, this time in Spanish, is being delivered by Texas Congresswoman Veronica Escobar. Take a look at how different lawmakers had very different responses to Trump's remarks this evening. Vice-President Mike Pence and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi Democratic members of Congress sit stony-faced Rush Limbaugh, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom Trump gets a thumbs-up from his fellow Republicans ""American workers are hurting,"" says Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer in her rebuttal to Mr Trump's speech. ""Wages have stagnated while CEO pay has sky-rocketed,"" she continues, adding that corporations are ""reaping rewards from tax cuts they don't need."" Democrats have made corporate accountability a major issue in the 2020 Democratic election. She is continuing to highlight specific efforts made by state-level Democratic politicians. ""That's strength. That's action,"" she says. Something we meant to mention earlier: a man whose daughter was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting in Florida was removed from the House after heckling the president during his remarks. Fred Guttenberg reportedly stood up and shouted something after Trump promised to protect the second amendment - which enshrines the rights of Americans right to keep and bear arms. Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi was seen scolding someone in the upper chamber - believed to be Guttenberg - during Trump's remarks on gun rights. Gretchen Whitmer Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, is now delivering the Democrat's rebuttal. ""I'm doing to need a lot more than ten minutes,"" to rebut what Trump said tonight, she says. ""Instead of talking about what he is saying, I'm going to highlight what the Democrats are doing,"" says Whitmer. She is now going from state to state, talking about efforts made by local Democrats to improve life in their districts. ""Everyone in this country benefits when we invest infrastructure,"" she says. We're now waiting for the Democratic rebuttals to Mr Trump's speech, but these are some of the lines he ended with: ""Our brightest discoveries are
not yet known."" ""Our most thrilling stories are not yet told."" ""Our
grandest journeys are not yet made."" ""The American Age, the American Epic,
the American Adventure, has only just begun.""  One hour and 18 minutes. As Trump leaves the chamber, Republicans are overheard telling him ""awesome speech"". Democrats clearly hated it, with several walking out as it was ongoing. Throughout Trump's speech, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, was sitting behind him. When he finished, she was seen tearing a copy of his speech she had on her desk. This all came about 70 minutes after he appeared to snub a handshake from Pelosi, the woman who launched his impeachment proceedings. In an emotional orchestrated moment, the soldier husband of a White House State of the Union guest has just surprised his wife. Sergeant First Class Townsend
Williams was in Afghanistan on his fourth combat deployment, or so we thought... He just walked into the chamber to the shock of his wife and small children. Members of Congress promptly broke out in chants of ""USA"". Reality Check President Trump said that, for the first time in 51 years, ""the cost of prescription drugs actually went down"". In the year to May 2019, the average monthly cost of prescription drugs fell by 0.2% according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics' Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the increase in the cost of household items in the US . This is the first price decrease over a 12-month period since 1973, some 47 years ago. But this may not be the most reliable way to measure drug prices according to Inma Hernandez, a pharmacy lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh. ""The CPI is based on a basket of drugs which is representative of popular drugs. So it tends to include widely-used drugs, which are usually cheaper,"" she says. ""However, it is less likely to include newer or less-prescribed drugs, which are more expensive and have higher price increases."" The lack of transparency around drug pricing makes it very difficult to know exactly what's happening to the cost of prescription medication.  ""Three years ago, the
barbarians of ISIS held over 20,000 square miles of territory in Iraq and
Syria,"" Trump says, referring to the Islamic State terror group. ""Today, the ISIS territorial caliphate has been 100 percent
destroyed, and the founder and leader of ISIS -- the bloodthirsty killer alâBaghdadi - is dead."" The parents of slain humanitarian aid worker Kayla Mueller - who was killed while in IS captivity - are in the audience tonight. The operation that killed Baghdadi was named after Kayla's birthday, Trump says. He then goes on to tout the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, who was assassinated in a US airstrike at the Baghdad airport in January. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter At the top of his speech Donald Trump said that he was
building âthe world's most prosperous and inclusive societyâ. The use of the word âinclusiveâ wasnât by chance. Throughout
his speech, the president made repeated overtures to minority groups in America
â groups that, according to polls, view the president with considerably
scepticism. Trump spoke of how he signed criminal justice reform and
funded historically black colleges and universities. He specifically noted the low levels of unemployment for
âAfrican-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americansâ. Among his guests at the speech were the last surviving
member of the Tuskegee Airmen, the all-black World War II fighter wing group,
and his great-grandson. He announced that he was awarding an âopportunity scholarshipâ
to a young black girl to attend a private school in Philadelphia. When talk turned to immigration, the president called out
Raul Ortiz, who he recently appointed to deputy chief of Border Patrol. If the president successfully improves his standing among
minority voters â and convinces independent voters of all stripes that
Democratic accusations of racism and xenophobia are scurrilous attacks â his
path to re-election becomes considerably easier. His State of the Union address
suggests that he knows this very well. ""We have confirmed a record
number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our Constitution as written,"" says Trump. He referred to his two recently approved Supreme Court Judges, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett
Kavanaugh. But in an ad-libbed line that's not in his speech transcript, he adds: ""And we have many in the pipeline."" New Supreme Court judges can only be added when one dies. Could he be saying that he hopes some Supreme Court justices are not around much longer? ""And as the wall goes up, drug
seizures rise, and border crossings go down, and they're going down rapidly,"" says Trump. His promised wall is not going up ""rapidly"", despite his claim, but is slowly making progress. Just last week, part of the wall on the US-Mexico borderactually collapsed due to high winds. Trump is praising ""heroic"" Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who are tasked with enforcing immigration policy within America's borders. ""Tragically, there are many
cities in America where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary
for these criminal illegal aliens. ""In sanctuary cities, local officials
order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public,
instead of handing them over to ICE to be safely removed."" Cameras pan over California lawmakers as Trump speaks, since that state recently declared the entire state to be a ""sanctuary"" zone. More than 400 jurisdictions across the country, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston and Seattle - major cities in left-leaning states that did not vote for Mr Trump - have enacted policies protecting undocumented immigrants within their boundaries, creating these so-called ""sanctuary cities"".

First of new UK submarine hunters due in ScotlandThe aircraft is the first of nine Poseidons that will be operated from RAF Lossiemouth.,"This video can not be played Watch as the first P-8A Poseidon touches down at Kinloss Barracks The first of nine new maritime patrol aircraft for the RAF has arrived at a military base in Scotland after being flown from the United States. The Â£3bn fleet of P-8A Poseidons are to be stationed at RAF Lossiemouth on the Moray coast. The first of the completed planes will operate from nearby Kinloss Barracks, a former RAF station, while new facilities are built at Lossiemouth. It is almost 10 years since the RAF's last patrol aircraft were scrapped. The last of those jet aircraft, called Nimrods, flew out of RAF Kinloss in 2010. New Nimrods were dismantled for scrap as part of defence cuts, but not replaced by another type of plane. The plane was escorted by RAF Typhoons A review in 2015 led to the Ministry of Defence ordering the P-8A Poseidons from US aircraft manufacturer Boeing. The first of these aircraft landed at Kinloss at about 13:30. The RAF crews will operate alongside the Royal Navy in a submarine hunter role, and in work identifying and tracking surface vessels. About 470 jobs, a mix of military and civilian posts, will be created at RAF Lossiemouth to fly and service the fleet. RAF crews have been training on the new aircraft in the US A new facility is being built at RAF Lossiemouth for the Poseidons The first of the completed Poseidons has been named the Pride of Moray. It is expected to move from Kinloss to Lossiemouth by the end of this year. Sqn Ldr Dave Higgins was among the crew board Tuesday's flight to Kinloss following training in the US. He told BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is a huge honour to be on that historic flight. ""For some of us there is much excitement because myself and my colleagues know how capable this aircraft is going to be. ""They are multi-mission aircraft with a variety of sensors that can fuse together so the crew can see lots of different types of information."" Equipped with ""state-of-the-art sensors"" enabling it to detect, identify and track vessels both above and below water Carries sonobuoys, devices which are dropped from the aircraft into the sea to search for submarines Armed with Harpoon anti-surface ship missiles and Mk 54 torpedoes capable of attacking both surface and sub-surface targets Will be flown from RAF Lossiemouth by two squadrons: CXX Sqn and the still to be fully operational 201 Sqn Crews have been training on the aircraft at Naval Air Station Jacksonville in the US Â£132m of improvements being made at Lossiemouth to accommodate the fleet and its crews, including a new ""strategic facility"" to house and maintain the aircraft and personnel. The investment includes Â£75m in resurfacing runways Joe Kennedy, who flew on Nimrods for more than 30 years, said the decision to scrap the planes and not immediately replace them with new maritime patrol aircraft still felt shocking almost 10 years later. He said: ""We all felt incredibly sad this fantastic aeroplane was coming to an end of its life. ""In my personal opinion I think it was a great loss and I think a lot of us thought it inconceivable that we lose the maritime patrol capability with nothing to replace it."" Joe Kennedy said it seemed 'inconceivable' not to have replaced Nimrods after scrapping the aircraft Mr Kennedy, who co-authored a book about Nimrods, said he was ""delighted"" the RAF would soon have a fleet of Poseidons. Moray councillor James Allan said the arrival of the new personnel would bring benefits to the local community. He said: ""It's great for Lossiemouth, which is a small place. ""We have a new school being built just now and a new community centre and swimming pool. It will also be great for our economy."" Defence Minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said RAF Lossiemouth's strategic northerly location made it ""one of the most important air stations in the UK"". Richard Lochhead SNP MSP for Moray said the fleet would bring new employment opportunities to the local area. He said: ""The arrival of the very first P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft is a big day for RAF Lossiemouth and Moray and also plugs a gap in the UK's defence capability by restoring marine surveillance."" Douglas Ross, Conservative MP for Moray and UK government minister for Scotland, said the Poseidon's new facilities formed part of Â£470m of investment in RAF Lossiemouth.

New petrol and diesel vehicle sales ban from 2035,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough: ""Now is the moment"" A ban on selling new petrol, diesel or hybrid cars in the UK will be brought forward from 2040 to 2035 at the latest, under government plans. The change comes after experts said 2040 would be too late if the UK wants to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. Boris Johnson unveiled the policy as part of a launch event fora United Nations climate summit in November. He said 2020 would be a ""defining year of climate action"" for the planet. The summit, known as COP26, is being hosted in Glasgow. It is an annual UN-led gathering set up to assess progress on tackling climate change. Sir David Attenborough said at the launch event at London's Science Museum that he was looking forward to COP26 and found it ""encouraging"" that the UK government was launching a ""year of climate action"". ""The longer we leave it... the worse it is going to get,"" he said. ""So now is the moment. It is up to us to organise the nations of the world to do something about it."" How will the petrol and diesel car ban work? Campaign group Extinction Rebellion held a protest outside London's Science Museum to coincide with the event In a statement made ahead of the launch, Mr Johnson said the ban on selling new petrol and diesel cars would come even earlier than 2035, if possible. Hybrid vehicles are also now being included in the proposals, which were originally announced in July 2017. People will only be able to buy electric or hydrogen cars and vans, once the ban comes into effect. The change in plans, which will be subject to a consultation, comes after experts warnedthe previous target date of 2040would still leave old conventional cars on the roads following the clean-up date of 2050. This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson: ""This phenomenon of global warming is taking its toll"" The Scottish government does not have the power to ban new petrol and diesel cars but has alreadypledged to ""phase out the need""for them by 2032 with measures such as an expansion of the charging network for electric cars. Mr Johnson said the 2050 pledge was necessary because the UK's ""historic emissions"" meant ""we have a responsibility to our planet to lead in this way"". The announcement comes as COP26's former president Claire OâNeill, who was sacked on Friday, wrote a bitter letteraccusing Mr Johnson of failing to support her work. The prime minister's official spokesperson said Downing Street had ""no comment"" to make on the letter, but thanked Mrs O'Neill for her work towards the conference. He said her replacement would be a ""ministerial post"" with details set out ""in due course."" Mr Johnson did not answer the BBC's David Shukman's questions about the row. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson said: âHosting COP26 is an important opportunity for the UK and nations across the globe to step up in the fight against climate change. âAs we set out our plans to hit our ambitious 2050 net zero target across this year, so we shall urge others to join us in pledging net zero emissions. âThere can be no greater responsibility than protecting our planet, and no mission that a global Britain is prouder to serve."" At the Science Museum the prime minister added that a ""catastrophic period of global addiction"" to hydrocarbons had led to the planet being ""swaddled in a tea cosy"" of carbon dioxide. But Green Party MPCaroline Lucas said on Twitter,external: ""Carbon emissions are not 'swaddling the planet like a tea cosy'. They are behind wildfires in Australia, soaring temperature records and the broken lives of those least responsible. The PM needs to understand that - and act."" Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push Sacked climate chief 'may sue government' Clean car target 'needs to be sooner' Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said the government was ""right"" to bring forward the ban, but that 2030 would be better than 2035. âA new 2035 target will still leave the UK in the slow-lane of the electric car revolution and meantime allow more greenhouse gases to spew into the atmosphere,"" he said. He said the government could show ""real leadership"" ahead of COP26 by reversing plans to develop ""climate-wrecking roads and runways"". This video can not be played Should I buy an electric car? AA president Edmund King said: ""Drivers support measures to clean up air quality and reduce CO2 emissions but these stretched targets are incredibly challenging."" The chief executive of the society of motor manufacturers and traders (SMMT) accused the government of ""moving the goalposts"". ""With current demand for this still expensive technology still just a fraction of sales, it's clear that accelerating an already very challenging ambition will take more than industry investment,"" Mike Hawes said. He said the government's plans must safeguard industry and jobs, as well as ensuring current sales of low emission vehicles were not undermined. Meanwhile Mrs OâNeill accused Mr Johnson of promising money and people to support her work, but failing to deliver either. She also said he admitted to her thathe ""doesn't really get"" climate changeand claimed hehad refused to give Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon an official role at COP26. This video can not be played Claire O'Neill: PM 'doesn't really get' climate change Cabinet minister Michael Gove said Mrs O'Neill was a ""close friend"" but that he disagreed with her comments. He toldBBC Radio 5 LiveMr Johnson described his own political outlook as ""that of a green Tory"". Mrs O'Neill said her ""absolute desire for action has not been comfortable for some"", adding that this was ""not about me"" or Mr Johnson - but about working towards ""rapid decarbonisation"". She said at COP26 the UK must ""absolutely double down on taking our great leadership and ambitions in this space, and really energising the world as to why this is a huge opportunity"".
