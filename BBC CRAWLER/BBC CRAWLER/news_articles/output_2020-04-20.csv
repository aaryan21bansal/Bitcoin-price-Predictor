"Dentists facing 'critical shortage of kit'Patients with urgent problems are having to ""take matters into their own hands"", a dental body says.Health","Dentists in England are facing ""critical shortages"" in personal protective equipment (PPE), forcing patients with urgent problems to ""take matters into their own hands"", says an organisation representing UK dentists. Over half (54%) of dentists in England say that PPE shortages are hampering efforts to treat patients at urgent dental care (UDC) hubs, according to a survey carried out by the British Dental Association (BDA). The BDA, which surveyed one thousand dentists, says a lack of PPE has meant some UDC hubs can't currently treat patients. It says a third of the sites in England remain inactive, compared with just 2% across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In response, the chief dental officer for England, Sara Hurley, says there are now 219 open hubs ""to provide care for those who need it"" and that ""every hub has the relevant PPE and work is ongoing to ensure that supply is maintained."" UDC hubs are designed to provide emergency dental treatment for patients with urgent needs, such as cracked teeth, gum infections and facial swelling. Patients requiring emergency treatment are meant to be referred to a UDC hub after a telephone consultation with their local dentist. Local practices were told to suspend routine face-to-face services on 25 March,externalin order to slow the spread of coronavirus and to set up local UDC hubs to treat patients with urgent needs. However, BDA Chair Mick Armstrong says progress has been too slow. ""Many dentists have been redeployed, only to find their hands tied by a critical shortage of kit, and delays in training and fit-testing. The depth of these problems will fatally undermine any progress on getting this network up and running,"" he says. One dentist, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC they had been redeployed to a UDC hub in the Midlands. However, they said their hub is currently unable to treat patients until a testing kit to be used on masks arrives. ""It's frustrating and disappointing when we know there is a significant need for urgent care because of a lack of training and PPE"", they said. ""The testing kits are shared across the region and they're being been taken up and down the motorway, and we're still waiting for it to arrive."" ""But as soon as we get the PPE, the hub will be up and running"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Another dentist, based in the south, said that while their hub was treating patients, they only had about 20 days' worth of FFP3 masks remaining. The FFP3 mask offers one of the highest grades of protection. The dentist said they would have to stop treating patients if they ran out of masks and replacement ones could not be sourced. Has the NHS got enough protective gear? Should we all be wearing masks now? The BDA's survey found that two thirds of dentists at sites in England are reporting shortages of FFP3 masks and gowns and that 58% of dentists say they do not feel fully protected at their sites. Dentists say PPE is necessary because they can be as close as 20cm from patients' mouths and are therefore at a high risk of contracting and spreading Covid-19. Dr Michael Ehrlich is a dentist based at a practice in Brighouse, West Yorkshire. He says he's been giving advice to patients over for the phone for the past three weeks. ""A broken tooth, a sharp bit of tooth, a lost crown, they are not urgent but they still cause discomfort. And then there are certain things that really need seeing and sorting out, but at the moment we have nowhere to send people"", he says. Billy Taylor pulled out his own tooth at home with the help of his 11-year-old son Aircraft fitter Billy Taylor, 33, from Axminster, Devon, told the BBC that he decided to pull out his own tooth after experiencing ""pretty bad"" pain over the Easter bank holiday weekend. ""I phoned my dentist. They said they're closed and will put me on an emergency waiting list, but they're not sure how long it would take to see me"", Mr Taylor said. ""The pain was absolutely excruciating so I thought I'd take it into my own hands"" Mr Taylor said the DIY extraction took an hour and a half. ""I didn't release how hard it would be to take out a molar tooth"". Dentists strongly advise against any patient doing their own dentistry. It is potentially dangerous for an untrained person with no anaesthetic or proper tools and risks significant damage to their mouth, broken teeth and serious infection. Kathryn Hey, 47, a teacher from Biddulph in Staffordshire woke up with a sudden sharp pain on 2 April. She says she has not been seen by a dentist, despite making two phone calls and is managing with painkillers ""My tooth ache is more manageable now so I'm waiting for the lockdown to end before contacting my dentist again"", she says. ""However, I still can't eat or drink on the side my tooth is, so it affects me every day."" In the first instance, patients are advised to call their local practice. If symptoms are serious, local dentists can prescribe medication over the phone (such as painkillers and antibiotics). In such cases, dentists can contact local pharmacies, which can then prepare medication for patients to pick up. If a patient has an urgent dental problem, then they should be referred to a UDC hub. Other emergency treatment may also be available. For example, some hospitals may offer emergency dental walk-ins. However, if a patient cannot reach their local dentist - or is not registered with one - then the advice is to usethe 111 online service.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' wants to plead guilty.

We're pausing our coverage now until tomorrow - but before we go, here's a recap of some of the day's top stories. Today's coverage was brought to you by our reporters in Singapore, the UK, and Washington DC: Saira Asher, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Tessa Wong, Paulin Kola, Joel Gunter, Thom Poole, Rebecca Seales, Josh Cheetham, Georgina Rannard, Josh Nevett, Ashitha Nagesh, Steve Sutcliffe, Jonathan Jurejko, Ben
Collins, Martha Buckley, Matt Cannon, Lucy Webster, Max Matza, Helier Cheung, Ritu Prasad and Jude Sheerin. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington As with the furore over ventilators, so with the furore over testing. That was President Trumpâs theme today, first on his Twitter account and then at the White House briefing.""It used to be ventilators, ventilators, ventilators,"" he said. ""Now itâs testing, testing, testing.""Trump has accused the ""Do Nothing Democrats"" of playing a ""dangerous political game"" by insisting there is a shortage of tests for coronavirus.But governors from both parties have insistently called for more federal help in order to do the testing necessary before they can ease up on stay-at-home orders.Trump told us their demands for tests was overblown, just as it had been in the case of ventilators.""Nobody that needed a ventilator didnât get one,"" he said, declaring that the governors already had tremendous testing capacity in their states about which they didnât know: ""hundreds and hundreds of laboratories"" and thousands of pieces of equipment available at federal locations. The president brought up experts and officials to fill in the details for us and lay out the maps of where these supplies are located.But for him the bottom line was political. He claimed that ""they"" â presumably the Do Nothing Democrats â didnât ""catch him"" on ventilators and so thought theyâd ""get him"" on testing. Quoting an apocryphal story about US Founding Father George Washington confessing to chopping down a cherry tree as a boy, Trump tells the White House briefing room: ""I cannot tell a lie."" He made the comment as he called on a journalist whom he had earlier promised could ask a question. Moments later, Trump said: ""I haven't left the White House in months.â A PBS reporter said: âYou held a rally in March.â Trump shrugs: âDid I hold a rally? Iâm sorry, I held a rally!â Marianna BradyBBC News On 26 March, Chicago stopped for a moment of gratitude: People took to their balconies, porches and rooftops, cheering and ringing bells in the dark winter night. The applause was for the healthcare workers, first responders and service-industry employees on the frontlines of the pandemic who were risking their lives every day to save people from the virus wreaking havoc around the world. But for hospital cleaner Candice Martinez, the recognition of nurses and doctors has left her feeling empty. ""It's disappointing to me that us 'lower level employees' aren't getting any kind of recognition for what we are doing."" As an Environmental Services Worker at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Ms Martinez is responsible for cleaning the rooms while patients are in hospital or after they are discharged or moved. She is one of the thousands of essential employees in the city who still have to go to work despite the crisis. And one of the 12,571 cases of Covid-19 identified in Chicago. Read the full story here. Trump is asked why the governor of Maryland bought 500,000 testing kits from South Korea when the White House says the states have the ability to do all of the testing that they need. ""The governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence. He could have saved a lot of money but that's OK,"" says Trump, pointing to a map of testing facilities in Maryland. ""I don't think he needed to go to South Korea. He needed to get a little knowledge,"" he adds. The White House has claimed that states have local laboratories that are capable of doing all the testing that they need. But states say that they are lacking the test kits themselves, rather than the labs in which to check them. Trump pledges to personally look into the case of a business owner who was denied a loan through coronavirus relief funds because of a criminal past. Fox News correspondent John Roberts tells the president he received an email from a man in the north-west who owns a supply business. He says he was refused a loan from the Small Business Administration because he has a non-violent felony from the past five years. As a result he has had to let go 50 employees, many of whom are former criminals trying to get back into society. Roberts queries why the businessman was denied a loan. Trump says: ""If you give me the name of the company and his name Iâll have that checked out, Iâll do that."" The president adds of small business funding, referring to his own company: ""I know I didn't get any."" Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Oil prices turned negative on Monday as economies on coronavirus lockdowns around the world cause a historic drop in energy demand. The cost of the US oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, for a barrel to be delivered in May plunged to a price of roughly negative $37, as sellers took a loss rather than pay for storage costs. The price of oil for June was also down, though trading higher, at above $20 per barrel, while Brent crude â the other major benchmark - fell more than 7% to about $26 per barrel. The falls come as analysts expect oil demand to contract to levels last seen in 1995, as businesses around the world remain shut and many people remain at home. The International Monetary Fund has predicted the global economy could contract by 3% this year, as coronavirus restrictions bring activity to a halt. Last month, as the rules took hold in Europe and the US, business surveys showed record-setting declines in orders and output in many countries. For its part, the World Trade Organization has warned that global trade could fall by up to a third this year - more than double the 12.5% drop in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Even a recent deal among major oil producers to cut supply by record levels has failed to ease the glut. Since the start of the year, energy prices have fallen by more than 60%. Asked about the sub-zero oil prices, Trump says that short-sellers are to blame. ""Much of it has to do with short sellers. A lot of people got caught,"" says Trump. ""And there are a lot of people not too happy because they got caught.â He calls the record-low prices ""more of a financial thing than an oil situation"". It's ""largely a financial squeeze"", he adds. The current cost oil is negative $37 per barrel, Trump says, noting that he expects the price to jump back up soon. As well as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina (which we told you about earlier), here's how some other states are planning to relax lockdown rules: Facebook has said it will remove pages and events involved in the organisation of protests that violate state laws on social distancing in the US during the pandemic. The company said it has already removed the promotion of anti-lockdown events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska after consultation with state governments. Protests against coronavirus lockdowns were held in states across the US on Sunday. Hundreds of protesters flouted social-distancing guidelines in defiance of restrictions intended to stem the spread of coronavirus and save lives. Similar events that âdefy governmentâs guidance on social distancing arenât allowed on Facebookâ, a spokesman said on Monday. Appearing on ABCâs Good Morning America on Monday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was asked whether the organisation of anti-lockdown protests on the platform amounted to âharmful misinformationâ. âWe do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,"" Zuckerberg said, adding that debates about policy would not be stifled. The removal of events has provoked a backlash from conservatives, among them Donald Trump Jr, who accused Facebook of quashing free speech. The US president has expressed support for the protests, suggesting âsome governors have gone too farâ in placing restrictions on life. Washingon state, once the US epicentre, saw one of the biggest protests this weekend Across the country, some groups of Americans are taking to the streets in protest of lockdown orders aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19. The demonstrations come amid 782,159 confirmed Covid-19 cases nationwide and 41,816 deaths. Numbers are still rising, though infection rates appear to be slowing in some regions. But protesters in more than a dozen states say the stay-at-home measures imposed by state governments to control the spread of coronavirus are an overreaction. As one militia leader in Illinois put it to the BBC: ""Re-open my state or we will re-open it ourselves."" Protests have varied in size across the country - from a few dozen protesters in Virginia and Oregon to rallies of thousands in Michigan and Washington state. Read the full story here. Trump asks Army Corp of Engineer General Todd Semonite to provide an update on the southern US border wall. Semonite had been speaking about the military's effort to build field hospitals at population centres around the US when Trump asked ""how about the wall?"" He then asked the general to speak on ""the quality of that wall in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn't be coming into our country"". Trump has claimed the wall will help prevent infections from entering the US - however, health experts have pointed out that there are already outbreaks occurring in every state. Many of the initial coronavirus cases in the US were linked to people travelling from China or Europe. Construction of the wall has continued during the pandemic - but local residents in border towns in Arizona have said they fear the influx of construction workers could spread the virus. In response to Trump, Semonite said ""construction is going very, very smooth"", adding that 164 miles have been built as of today. As he leaves the briefing, he adds: ""I have a lot of building to do."" Trump says New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is going to visit him in the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon, and that he'll be joined by ""some of his people"". ""We look forward to that,"" the president adds. Cuomo and Trump have previously gone back and forth over each other's responses to the outbreak. During Cuomo's briefing a few days ago, Trump tweeted: ""Stop talking!"" President Trump now turns to the price of oil, which turned negative for the first time in history on Monday - meaning that oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands, over fears that storage capacity could run out. The price of oil, Trump says, is âat a level thatâs very interesting to a lot of peopleâ. Trump says that, with the price plummeting, the US would seek to fill up its petroleum reserves. âWeâre filling up our national petroleum reserves, the strategic reserves. Weâre looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves. That would top it out,â he says. He expressed confidence that his administration can ""get it for the right price"". Demand for oil has dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Trump says governors ""just don't understand"" how to carry out testing. It comes as governors complain that the federal government has not helped states get testing supplies from overseas. Trump says the Republican governor of Maryland Mike Hogan, and the Democratic governor of Illinois JB Pritzker, ""didnât understand too much what was going on"" with testing. He says Vice-President Mike Pence spoke on the phone with governors today to tell him about their ""tremendous capacity"" to do tests at local labs. Both governors have been critical of the federal response, and earlier today, Hogan attacked Trump for claiming that states had the testing capacity they needed in order to reopen. ""To try to push this off and say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing - that somehow we arenât doing our job, is just absolutely false,"" Hogan told MSNBC. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the governmentâs top infectious disease expert, told AP news that the US did not yet have an adequate testing and tracing procedure in place to reopen the economy. President Donald Trump's daily briefing is starting now. He is joined by members of the coronavirus task force including senior co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx, and Vice-President Mike Pence.  Georgia's governor has announced that restaurants, hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and some movie theaters will be allowed to reopen on Friday. It comes as the governor of Tennessee says that by 1 May the ""vast majority of businesses"" will be allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, the South Carolina governor has allowed residents to return to previously closed beaches starting on Tuesday. Non-essential retail businesses will also be allowed to reopen, as long as they can adhere to social distancing guidelines. The White House coronavirus task force briefing is due to begin imminently. It comes as anti-lockdown protests spread in the US, and Facebook bans anti-quarantine demonstrators from using the website to organise in-person gatherings. President Donald Trump also continues to be criticised by state governors for not doing enough to help provide testing equipment. On Monday, a governor from Trump's own Republican party said his Korean-speaking wife had arranged a sale of 500,000 test kits from a company in South Korea. The 2020 event would have marked the 50th anniversary of the NYC Pride March No events will be granted a permit in New York City in the month of June, meaning the 50th anniversary Pride parade is cancelled, as is the Puerto Rican Day Parade, celebrating its 63rd anniversary. The announcement was made by Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference earlier on Monday. De Blasio has heavily criticised the federal governmentâs handling of the outbreak in New York - the epicentre within the US. ""The absence of testing from day one never allowed us to fight this war the right way,"" he told MSNBC. ""If we had had testing in the beginning, we could have done a very intensive containment strategy."" We reported earlier that US oil prices have dropped into negative values for the first time in history. In this graph, you can see just how dramatic the price crash was. In practice, the negative dip means producers have resorted to paying buyers to take oil off their hands, as rapidly decreasing demand has led many producers to fear they'll run out of storage space by May. You can read more about how it happened, and what it means, in our reporthere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"RAF plane en route to Turkey amid NHS kit rowThe government says it is working ""around the clock"" to end the shortage of protective gear.UKComments","An RAF aircraft has departed the UK for Turkey to pick up a delayed delivery of protective kit amid a row over a shortage in the NHS. The plane left at around 17:00 BST on Monday to collect 400,000 gowns. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the daily No 10 briefing the government was working ""around the clock"" to address the lack of protective gear. It comes as another 449 coronavirus deaths were recorded in UK hospitals, taking the total number to 16,509. But the number of new confirmed infections was ""flattening out"", the UK's deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Dame Angela Maclean, told the briefing. Meanwhile,more than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage billthrough the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday morning. What protective gear do NHS staff need? 'Enormous strain' on protective kit for NHS Minute's silence for NHS virus death staff The row over a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the NHS has intensified over the last few days. This video can not be played ""Are you ashamed?"" â BBC News health editor Hugh Pym challenges Chancellor Rishi Sunak over PPE Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers complain that a lack of adequate kit such as gowns, masks and gloves puts them at increased risk of catching coronavirus and of spreading it to their patients. The children of Josiane Ekoli, a nurse from Leeds who died after contracting the disease, said on Monday that her death could have been prevented ""if they gave my mum the proper equipmentin the first place"". Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said the shortage of PPE was ""uppermost"" in people's minds and the government would ""pursue every possible option"" to secure more PPE. He said ministers were trying to resolve problems around the consignment, which had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but was hit by ""unexpected"" delays. However, he said there were regular shipments expected from other sources, and cited a delivery of 140,000 gowns from Myanmar. Mr Sunak said: ""We're improving our sourcing internationally and domestically to make sure we can get the PPE we need in what is a very challenging international context. ""But people on the front line can rest assured that we're doing absolutely everything we can, and straining everything we can, to get the equipment they need."" The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the first of three expected RAF transport aircraft departed from Brize Norton for Turkey on Monday. This video can not be played Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital show how health care workers put on PPE Earlier, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said there was ""no doubt"" some hospital trusts were already experiencing shortages of the gowns. He said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day. Mr Hopson also said too much focus should not be placed on individual consignments. He gave the example of an expected consignment of 200,000 gowns from China, which turned out to be 20,000 gowns when it arrived last week. Downing Street said the government had now delivered one billion pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline staff. Speaking at the government briefing, Public Health England's medical director Prof Yvonne Doyle said a lack of PPE was ""a concern"". However, she denied that PPE guidance had been downgraded based on availability of equipment rather than safety standards, Public Health England changed its advice on Fridayto allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". Prof Doyle said: ""The guidance remains exactly the same. And that is a very precautionary set of advice - it's quite the opposite to putting people at risk because there aren't enough supplies. ""It's trying to ensure that people are well secured and safe when there may not be enough supplies, and it also stresses how important it is not to take risks."" Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland currently had ""adequate stocks"" of all the main items of PPE but gowns were one of the items ""under most pressure"". The owner of a healthcare service in Hampshire providing care to people in their own home said PPE was the ""biggest challenge"" her organisation faced. Alice Ushumba said she was struggling to get hold of enough masks, and that some staff had resigned because they didn't feel safe with the protective equipment available. ""We're going into people's houses who might have Covid but we don't have anything to protect ourselves except perhaps a little plastic apron and gloves,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The latest UK death total of 449 was the lowest daily figure announced since 6 April. The new figures also showed that the number of new infections - 4,676 - was the lowest for four days. Prof Maclean told the daily briefing that infections in the UK were ""flattening out"", and that the number of patients in hospitals in London had fallen for seven consecutive days. She added she hoped the fall would be ""replicated"" across the UK. The number of new deaths announced - 449 - is the lowest for two weeks. Last week the figures were hovering between 700 and 900, before dropping below 600 on Sunday. That is, of course, good news. Although the figures for the past two days should be treated with caution. They cover the weekend and we know reporting and recording delays can mean figures drop before rising again. But the falls are big enough to suggest we may soon start seeing the number of new deaths coming down. The numbers in hospital with coronavirus have already started dropping gradually so the signs are there that we are beginning to turn the corner. Mr Sunak said there were ""encouraging signs we are making progress"" in tackling the virus but added that the lockdown restrictions needed to remain in place. He reiterated the government's message that the UK needed to meet five tests set down last week before exiting the lockdown - which include increasing testing in the community, and being certain there was no risk of a second peak. ""We are not there yet and it is very clear that, for now, what we should focus on is following the guidance, staying home to protect the NHS,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told colleagues his concerns that relaxing lockdown measures too sooncould lead to a second outbreak of coronavirus. He is understood to have had a video call with his deputy, Dominic Raab, on Friday to discuss the crisis.

"More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill help","More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"". ""It is not my current company's fault - they want to help us as much as they can - it's the government that is ignoring us."" On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that the wage subsidy schemewould be extended by a further month, until the end of June. The move came afterthe government confirmed that lockdown restrictions in the UK would continuefor ""at least"" another three weeks. Mr Harra declined to predict how much the scheme would cost. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated a price tag of Â£42bn, but that was before the government extended the scheme by a month. He said he was confident that HMRC could cope with the demand for the scheme.

Branson offers Caribbean island to secure bailout,"Sir Richard moved to Necker Island 14 years ago Sir Richard Branson has pledged his luxury island resort as collateral to help get a UK government bailout of his stricken airline Virgin Atlantic. The billionaire Virgin Group boss saidin an open letter to staff,externalhe was not asking for a handout, but a commercial loan, believed to be Â£500m. The airline's survival was in doubt, and his Necker Island home in the Caribbean could be mortgaged, he said. It comes as Virgin Group's airline in Australia enters administration. Virgin Australia collapses into administration Both airlines have been hit hard by the global coronavirus lockdown, and Sir Richard has appealed to governments in both countries for help. However, he has been criticised for appealing for taxpayer aid rather than drawing on his huge wealth. Sir Richard's fortune is thought to be well over Â£4bn. The large US airline Delta owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic. Sir Richard said in his letter to staff: ""Many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it."" The crisis facing airlines, and the staff they employ, was ""unprecedented,"" he said. Despite his wealth, this did not mean he had ""cash in a bank account ready to withdraw"". And he hit back at criticism that he was a tax exile who did not deserve help, saying he and his wife ""did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island"". He said Necker would be offered as security for any loans. ""As with other Virgin assets, our team will raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group,"" Sir Richard said. Allow Twitter content?

In his letter to staff, Sir Richard said: ""We will do everything we can to keep the airline [Virgin Atlantic] going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. ""This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back (as EasyJet will do for the Â£600m loan the government recently gave them)."" He pointed out that Virgin Atlantic started with one plane 36 years ago, before adding: ""Over those years it has created real competition for British Airways, which must remain fierce for the benefit of our wonderful customers and the public at large."" Sir Richard offered to inject Â£250m into the Virgin Group last month, with most of that going to the airline. Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group sent letters to the government highlighting the importance of Virgin Atlantic to the UK's manufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia - in which Sir Richard holds a stake of around 10% - is going into administration. The carrier has been forced to cancel nearly all of its flights during the coronavirus crisis and been unable to restructure its debts. The Australian government offered some support, but refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn (Â£720m) loan. The airline is part-owned by Sir Richard along with Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. ""The brilliant Virgin Australia team is fighting to survive and need support to get through this catastrophic global crisis,"" Sir Richard said. ""We are hopeful that Virgin Australia can emerge stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline."" He warned: ""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies. We all know what that would lead to."" Sir Richard also addressed the fierce criticism he has faced in recent weeks over his tax situation. Critics have pointed out he has paid no UK income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago. Sir Richard is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. ""I've seen lots of comments about my net worth - but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,"" he said. ""Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities."" Turning to the question of living abroad he said: ""Joan and I did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands (BVI) and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI. ""Over time, we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business, which employs 175 people."" Coronavirus: Who is still flying?

Ofcom rules on Holmes and Icke coronavirus remarks,"Icke used to be a sports presenter, while Holmes is a host on ITV's This Morning Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has ""issued guidance"" to ITV following Eamonn Holmes' comments about 5G technology and coronavirus on This Morning. The regulator said Holmes' remarks had been ""ambiguous"" and ""ill-judged"". Ofcom said they ""risked undermining viewers' trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence"". The regulator also found local TV channel London Live in breach of standards for an interview it aired with David Icke about coronavirus. Conspiracy theorist Icke, it said, had ""expressed views which had the potential to cause significant harm to viewers in London during the pandemic"". Watchdog assesses Eamonn Holmes 5G comments Eamonn Holmes under fire over 5G comments On 13 April, in a segment with This Morning's consumer editor Alice Beer, Holmes cast doubt on media outlets that had debunked the myth that 5G causes coronavirus. Beer, formerly a presenter on the BBC's Watchdog programme, said the theory, which has led to phone masts being set alight or vandalised, was ""not true and incredibly stupid"". ""I totally agree with everything you are saying,"" said Holmes. ""But what I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true. ""No-one should attack or damage or do anything like that, but it's very easy to say it is not true because it suits the state narrative,"" he continued. Holmes was widely criticised for his comments, which he said had been ""misinterpreted"" on the following day's programme. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, I want to make it completely clear there's no scientific evidence to substantiate any of those 5G theories,"" he continued. Ofcom said it had taken this on-air statement into account, along with the ""context"" Beer had provided, before deciding to issue guidance to ITV ""and its presenters"". ""In our view, Eamonn Holmes' ambiguous comments were ill-judged and risked undermining viewers' trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence,"" it said. ""His statements were also highly sensitive in view of the recent attacks on mobile phone masts in the UK, caused by conspiracy theories linking 5G technology and the virus. ""Broadcasters have editorial freedom to discuss and challenge the approach taken by public authorities to a serious public health crisis such as the coronavirus,"" it continued. ""However, discussions about unproven claims and theories which could undermine viewers' trust in official public health information must be put fully into context to ensure viewers are protected."" Ofcom 'urgently' probes Icke TV interview on virus YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interview In a separate ruling,external, Ofcom said ESTV, owner of London-based TV channel London Live, had broken broadcasting rules by airing an interview with former footballer and TV presenter Icke. It said the interview, recorded on 18 March and broadcast on London Live on 8 April, ""included potentially harmful content about the coronavirus pandemic"". While not mentioning 5G by name, Icke referred to an ""electro-magnetic, technologically generated soup of radiation toxicity"" that he claimed had damaged old people's immune systems. He also claimed that official health advice aimed at reducing the spread of the virus were being implemented to further the ambitions of a clandestine ""cult"", rather than to protect public health. Ofcom said it was ""particularly concerned"" by Icke ""casting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus"". ""These claims went largely unchallenged during the 80-minute interview and were made without the support of any scientific or other evidence."" The London Live programme was produced by a London-based independent company. London Live is owned by the Russian businessman Evgeny Lebedev, who also owns the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers. The channel will be required to broadcast a summary of Ofcom's findings and may face additional sanctions from the media regulator. Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. There have dozens of reported attacks on telecoms equipment over the past weeks One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protectioncompleted a major study of related research into the topic. While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacterium. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

"More than 140,000 firms claim wage bill helpChancellor Rishi Sunak says the furlough money will help pay the wages of more than a million people.Business","More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"". ""It is not my current company's fault - they want to help us as much as they can - it's the government that is ignoring us."" On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that the wage subsidy schemewould be extended by a further month, until the end of June. The move came afterthe government confirmed that lockdown restrictions in the UK would continuefor ""at least"" another three weeks. Mr Harra declined to predict how much the scheme would cost. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated a price tag of Â£42bn, but that was before the government extended the scheme by a month. He said he was confident that HMRC could cope with the demand for the scheme. ""We have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims that we could receive - there are well over two million Pay-As-You-Earn schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those."" It's a massive feat of engineering, an unprecedented reverse plumbing of the tax system.

Holmes was widely criticised for his comments, which he said had been ""misinterpreted"" on the following day's programme. ""For the avoidance of any doubt, I want to make it completely clear there's no scientific evidence to substantiate any of those 5G theories,"" he continued. Ofcom said it had taken this on-air statement into account, along with the ""context"" Beer had provided, before deciding to issue guidance to ITV ""and its presenters"". ""In our view, Eamonn Holmes' ambiguous comments were ill-judged and risked undermining viewers' trust in advice from public authorities and scientific evidence,"" it said. ""His statements were also highly sensitive in view of the recent attacks on mobile phone masts in the UK, caused by conspiracy theories linking 5G technology and the virus. ""Broadcasters have editorial freedom to discuss and challenge the approach taken by public authorities to a serious public health crisis such as the coronavirus,"" it continued. ""However, discussions about unproven claims and theories which could undermine viewers' trust in official public health information must be put fully into context to ensure viewers are protected."" Ofcom 'urgently' probes Icke TV interview on virus YouTube tightens Covid-19 rules after Icke interview In a separate ruling,external, Ofcom said ESTV, owner of London-based TV channel London Live, had broken broadcasting rules by airing an interview with former footballer and TV presenter Icke. It said the interview, recorded on 18 March and broadcast on London Live on 8 April, ""included potentially harmful content about the coronavirus pandemic"". While not mentioning 5G by name, Icke referred to an ""electro-magnetic, technologically generated soup of radiation toxicity"" that he claimed had damaged old people's immune systems. He also claimed that official health advice aimed at reducing the spread of the virus were being implemented to further the ambitions of a clandestine ""cult"", rather than to protect public health. Ofcom said it was ""particularly concerned"" by Icke ""casting doubt on the motives behind official health advice to protect the public from the virus"". ""These claims went largely unchallenged during the 80-minute interview and were made without the support of any scientific or other evidence."" The London Live programme was produced by a London-based independent company. London Live is owned by the Russian businessman Evgeny Lebedev, who also owns the Evening Standard and Independent newspapers. The channel will be required to broadcast a summary of Ofcom's findings and may face additional sanctions from the media regulator. Conspiracy theories linking 5G signals to the coronavirus pandemic continue to spread despite there being no evidence the mobile phone signals pose a health risk. Fact-checking charity Full Facthas linked the claims to two flawed theories,external. There have dozens of reported attacks on telecoms equipment over the past weeks One falsely suggests 5G suppresses the immune system, the other falsely claims the virus is somehow using the network's radio waves to communicate and pick victims, accelerating its spread. While 5G uses different radio frequencies to its predecessors, it's important to recognise that the waveband involved is still ""non-ionising"", meaning it lacks enough energy tobreak apart chemical bonds in the DNA in our cells to cause damage. Earlier this year, scientists at the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protectioncompleted a major study of related research into the topic. While it recommended slightly tighter limits on the transmitting capabilities of handsets themselves to minimise any chance of damage caused by human tissue being heated, its key finding was that there was no evidence that either 5G networks or earlier systems could cause cancer or other kinds of illness. The second theory appears to be based on the work of a Nobel Prize-winning biologist who suggested bacteria could generate radio waves. But this remains a controversial idea andwell outside mainstream scientific thought,external. In any case, Covid-19 is a virus rather than a bacterium. There's another major flaw with both these theories. Coronavirus is spreading in UK cities where 5G has yet to be deployed, and in countries like Japan and Iran that have yet to adopt the technology.

US oil prices turn negative as demand dries upCoronavirus downturn has put major pressure on oil prices with demand slumping and storage running out.,"The price of US oil has turned negative for the first time in history. That means oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands over fears that storage capacity could run out in May. Demand for oil has all but dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. As a result, oil firms have resorted to renting tankers to store the surplus supply and that has forced the price of US oil into negative territory. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Record deal to cut oil output ends price war Coronavirus: Who is still flying? Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping ""This is off-the-charts wacky,"" said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The demand shock was so massive that it's overwhelmed anything that people could have expected."" The severe drop on Monday was driven in part by a technicality of the global oil market. Oil is traded on its future price and May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday. Traders were keen to offload those holdings to avoid having to take delivery of the oil and incur storage costs. June prices for WTI were also down, but trading at above $20 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude - the benchmark used by Europe and the rest of the world, which is already trading based on June contracts - was also weaker, down 8.9% at less than $26 a barrel. Mr Glickman said the historic reversal in pricing was a reminder of the strains facing the oil market and warned that June prices could also fall, if lockdowns remain in place. ""I'm really not optimistic about the prospects for oil companies or oil prices,"" he said. OGUK, the business lobby for the UK's offshore oil and gas sector, said the negative price of US oil would affect firms operating in the North Sea. ""The dynamics of this US market are different from those directly driving UK produced Brent but we will not escape the impact,"" said OGUK boss Deirdre Michie. ""Ours is not just a trading market; every penny lost spells more uncertainty over jobs,"" she said. The oil industry has been struggling with both tumbling demand and in-fighting among producers about reducing output. Earlier this month, Opec members and its allies finally agreed a record deal to slash global output by about 10%. The deal was the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. But many analysts say the cuts were not big enough to make a difference. ""It hasn't taken long for the market to recognise that the Opec+ deal will not, in its present form, be enough to balance oil markets,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axicorp. The leading exporters - Opec and allies such as Russia - have already agreed to cut production by a record amount. In the United States and elsewhere, oil-producing businesses have made commercial decisions to cut output. But still the world has more crude oil than it can use. And it's not just about whether we can use it. It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products. Capacity is filling fast on land and at sea. As that process continues it's likely to bear down further on prices. It will take a recovery in demand to really turn the market round and that will depend on how the health crisis unfolds. There will be further supply cuts as private sector producers respond to the low prices, but it's hard to see that being on a sufficient scale to have a fundamental impact on the market. For US drivers, the decline in oil prices - which have fallen by about two-thirds since the start of the year - has had an impact at the pumps, albeit not as dramatic as Monday's decline might suggest. ""The silver lining is, if you for various reason actually need to be on the roads, you're filling up for far less than you would have been even four months ago,"" Mr Glickman said. ""The problem for most of us is even if you could fill up, where are you going to go?"" US President Donald Trump has said the government will buy oil for the country's national reserve. But concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity, with stockpiles at Cushing, the main delivery point in the US for oil, rising almost 50% since the start of March, according to ANZ Bank. Mr Innes said: ""It's a dump at all cost as no one, and I mean no one, wants delivery of oil with Cushing storage facilities filling by the minute.""

Germany relaxes coronavirus shop closures,"Customers entering an opticians' in Leipzig Germany has reopened small shops, car dealerships and bicycle stores, in a tentative easing of the coronavirus lockdown imposed nearly a month ago. The country has flattened the curve of new infections and last week said it had got the spread under control. But social distancing remains in force. In Saxony it is mandatory for people to wear face masks in public - and that is strongly recommended elsewhere. The only students back in school are those sitting leaving exams. Germany's mortality rate from Covid-19 is significantly lower than for many of its European neighbours. Efficient, large-scale testing by diagnostic labs, and tracing of carriers, is seen as a major factor in that. The country on Monday recorded 1,775 new cases for the past day, while the number of deaths linked to Covid-19 rose by 110 to 4,404, according to official figures. Customers use hand sanitiser in a fabrics store in Ludwigsburg Spain registered 399 more Covid-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, pushing its total to 20,852. That is the second-highest in Europe after Italy. In both countries the daily death toll is declining. More than 200,000 are infected with the virus in Spain, but 80,587 have recovered, according to the latest official figures. There are significant regional differences in how Germany's 16 states are implementing the partial relaxation of the lockdown. For instance, the densely populated state of North Rhine-Westphalia has reopened large shops as well as small. Elsewhere only those with an area of less than 800sq m (8,611sq ft) are allowed to start operating again. The government imposed the lockdown on 22 March, shutting schools and banning gatherings of more than two people outdoors. Germany's hotels, restaurants and cafes are to remain shut, as are sports and leisure facilities. Berlin pupils facing school leaving exams returned to class For most German businesses, the lockdown will remain in place until at least 3 May, the government says. Other school pupils will also begin to return to classes after that. Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged her Christian Democrat (CDU) colleagues to refrain from discussing further relaxation of the lockdown, German media report. She warned that such talk could undermine social distancing and fuel a new surge of coronavirus cases, harming Germany's so far successful efforts to fight the virus. The lifting of Europe's lockdown measures is not at all co-ordinated. EU member states have 27 different healthcare systems, 27 different infection rates and 27 different priorities as regards kickstarting their coronavirus-battered economies. Measures even differ within countries. The north Italian region of Lombardy resisted reopening small, non-essential shops last week, while neighbouring Veneto welcomed the opportunity. There are noticeable differences of opinion within governments too. Governments face a challenging balancing act - juggling economic, social and health risks - until a coronavirus vaccine can be found. Denmark has reopened primary schools. Spanish children haven't been allowed outside for over five weeks now. Who's right and who's wrong? No-one can be sure until more is known about Covid-19. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a reference point for many in Europe: calm, authoritative and very careful about over-promising. Her chosen way forward is to test widely, then trace and quarantine those who've been in contact with newly infected individuals. The European Commission and Council presidents agree, but they've played a pretty backstage role so far. EU government leaders jealously guard the right to decide their own national health and border controls, especially in an emergency. The leaders of France, Spain, Italy and Portugal have all recently warned the future of the EU is now in danger. In Austria, garden centres, DIY stores and small shops reopened last week, but with strict rules on social distancing.Customers have to wear masks, as they do in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Denmark reopened kindergartens and primary schools last week. A range of small businesses, includinghairdressers and beauty salons, are reopening on Monday. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping,"Shipping firms have halted crew changes to protect their seafarers With the world in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the shipping industry is already feeling the impact as the global economy heads into a deep recession. Hundreds of ship sailings have been cancelled as first ports in China, and then across the globe, have seen trade fall away - with millions of workers and consumers in lockdown. Caught in the centre of this have been the world's 1.6 million seafarers, on 50,000 tankers and cargo carriers. Many of them are unable to leave their ships, or find themselves stuck in hotels without pay and unable to get flights home. Every month, 100,000 merchant mariners come to the end of their contracts on their ships and need to be flown home. But the pandemic has halted this. Since the coronavirus outbreak Chinese border guards have been checking the health of crews ""Working at sea is often described as similar to being in prison, except there is no TV,"" says former ship's navigator Nick Chubb. ""Though my experience was usually positive, a feeling of deep fatigue sets in towards the end of a contract. I once had a four-month contract on an oil tanker extended by three weeks, and found it incredibly difficult to deal with. ""Some of these seafarers have spent nine months away from their families already. And it's not looking particularly likely they'll be able to go home any time soon,"" adds Mr Chubb, who is now a director for the maritime technology intelligence platform Thetius. The world's biggest shipping firm, AP Moller-Maersk, is one of those which has halted its crew changes, and says its done so to protect them, by lessening the number of social interactions they need to have. It adds that ""the rapid changes to global travel poses a risk of stranding seafarers in locations from where they are unable to leave, or get sufficient assistance"". The cost of shipping an item around the world is just a fraction of its final retail price Yet even before the coronavirus outbreak, the industry was grappling with major issues. First, the need to move to cleaner fuels because of the introduction of the 2020 sulphur emissions cap by the International Maritime Organization. Second, the fallout from the US-China trade war, and the failure of Washington and Beijing to implement the first phase of their trade agreement. ""Shipping lines have had a very hard time making money in the past ten years,"" says Alan Murphy, chief executive of analysts Sea-Intelligence in Copenhagen. For example, for a $100 (Â£80) pair of trainers, the cost of ocean transport will be a fraction of that - just 10c. This makes the distance that goods travel to market irrelevant in cost terms. And it is why China, with its low labour costs, has become the world's main manufacturer. China accounts for seven of the world's 10 busiest container ports Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst with Bimco, the world's largest international shipping association, warned at a recent webinar that 2020 could become increasingly harsh for the industry. ""We need to make sure that local ports and terminals are kept open, to make sure that food and goods are kept flowing to where it's needed - because that's where shipping hands a lifeline to the global public."" Faced with the rippling disruptions to supply and demand around the globe, shipping firms have been scaling back operations. So far, 384 sailings have been cancelled, and the first half of 2020 could see a 25% fall in shipping, with a 10% drop for the year overall, says Sea-Intelligence. Chinese ports have resumed sailings in April, but many ports serving key consumer markets are still operating well below capacity. The industry has not yet had to lower prices, but if shipping firms are forced to do so, and freight rates fall by 20% - as they did after the 2008 financial crisis - and were shipping volumes to remain 10% lower, ""we could see operating losses of some $20-23bn"", says Mr Murphy. ""That would wipe out the shipping firms' last eight years' worth of profits,"" he adds. Oil tankers are now in big demand, as the major fall in the price of crude has led to stockpiling There are a lot of unknowns in the preceding sentences, and Sea-Intelligence stresses it is not yet clear how long it will take for fractured global supply chains to get back to normal once lockdowns are ended. For consumers, there could well be periodic shortages to come, says Jody Cleworth, of consultants Marine Transport International. ""In developing nations like South Africa there's an almost complete shutdown in exports, whereby only critical goods are moving through ports. So the seasonal goods we expect in Europe in summer would be limited from such countries. ""For example, charcoal for your summer barbecue. At the moment those containers are not being moved out of South Africa, so they will not be arriving in the UK for their intended dates,"" he says. But there is one exception to this gloom: the oil tanker sector. Demand for oil tankers has been rising following the oil price falls, which have sent the tanker sector ""sky-high"", says Nick Chubb of Thetius. ""There are ships that are being chartered now for $230,000 a day as offshore floating storage for when the oil prices recover. It's almost a tale of two industries,"" he says. But given the impact of Covid-19 on economic activity, energy demand in 2020 is likely to be substantially lower, and it is possible these tankers may be storing oil for a while to come. More from theBBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Will we ever take cruise holidays again? Will coronavirus reverse globalisation? How are food supply networks coping with coronavirus? Should street food vendors be cleared off the streets? Coronavirus hits tourism in 'Teflon Thailand' So what will be the effect of Covid-19 on the shipping industry beyond 2020? With virtually no cargo moving by air, shipping could become even more crucial. Already 90% of world trade by volume goes by sea. Yet many analysts expect the drop in demand across Europe and North America to have a longer-term impact. ""We could be talking a decade, at least, of difficulty,"" suggests Nick Chubb of Thetius. Alan Murphy says the pandemic will trigger questions about the shape and sustainability of world trade - and globalisation. ""A lot of protectionist arguments are going to be made against outsourcing. ""It will have a very profound impact on how global supply chains are organised. It is going to be a political topic in coming years."" Are you a sailor stranded away from home because of coronavirus?You can share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

""The dynamics of this US market are different from those directly driving UK produced Brent but we will not escape the impact,"" said OGUK boss Deirdre Michie. ""Ours is not just a trading market; every penny lost spells more uncertainty over jobs,"" she said. The oil industry has been struggling with both tumbling demand and in-fighting among producers about reducing output. Earlier this month, Opec members and its allies finally agreed a record deal to slash global output by about 10%. The deal was the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. But many analysts say the cuts were not big enough to make a difference. ""It hasn't taken long for the market to recognise that the Opec+ deal will not, in its present form, be enough to balance oil markets,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axicorp. The leading exporters - Opec and allies such as Russia - have already agreed to cut production by a record amount. In the United States and elsewhere, oil-producing businesses have made commercial decisions to cut output. But still the world has more crude oil than it can use. And it's not just about whether we can use it. It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products. Capacity is filling fast on land and at sea. As that process continues it's likely to bear down further on prices. It will take a recovery in demand to really turn the market round and that will depend on how the health crisis unfolds. There will be further supply cuts as private sector producers respond to the low prices, but it's hard to see that being on a sufficient scale to have a fundamental impact on the market. For US drivers, the decline in oil prices - which have fallen by about two-thirds since the start of the year - has had an impact at the pumps, albeit not as dramatic as Monday's decline might suggest. ""The silver lining is, if you for various reason actually need to be on the roads, you're filling up for far less than you would have been even four months ago,"" Mr Glickman said. ""The problem for most of us is even if you could fill up, where are you going to go?"" US President Donald Trump has said the government will buy oil for the country's national reserve. But concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity, with stockpiles at Cushing, the main delivery point in the US for oil, rising almost 50% since the start of March, according to ANZ Bank. Mr Innes said: ""It's a dump at all cost as no one, and I mean no one, wants delivery of oil with Cushing storage facilities filling by the minute.""

RAF plane en route to Turkey amid NHS kit row,"An RAF aircraft has departed the UK for Turkey to pick up a delayed delivery of protective kit amid a row over a shortage in the NHS. The plane left at around 17:00 BST on Monday to collect 400,000 gowns. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the daily No 10 briefing the government was working ""around the clock"" to address the lack of protective gear. It comes as another 449 coronavirus deaths were recorded in UK hospitals, taking the total number to 16,509. But the number of new confirmed infections was ""flattening out"", the UK's deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Dame Angela Maclean, told the briefing. Meanwhile,more than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage billthrough the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday morning. What protective gear do NHS staff need? 'Enormous strain' on protective kit for NHS Minute's silence for NHS virus death staff The row over a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the NHS has intensified over the last few days. This video can not be played ""Are you ashamed?"" â BBC News health editor Hugh Pym challenges Chancellor Rishi Sunak over PPE Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers complain that a lack of adequate kit such as gowns, masks and gloves puts them at increased risk of catching coronavirus and of spreading it to their patients. The children of Josiane Ekoli, a nurse from Leeds who died after contracting the disease, said on Monday that her death could have been prevented ""if they gave my mum the proper equipmentin the first place"". Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said the shortage of PPE was ""uppermost"" in people's minds and the government would ""pursue every possible option"" to secure more PPE. He said ministers were trying to resolve problems around the consignment, which had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but was hit by ""unexpected"" delays. However, he said there were regular shipments expected from other sources, and cited a delivery of 140,000 gowns from Myanmar. Mr Sunak said: ""We're improving our sourcing internationally and domestically to make sure we can get the PPE we need in what is a very challenging international context. ""But people on the front line can rest assured that we're doing absolutely everything we can, and straining everything we can, to get the equipment they need."" The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the first of three expected RAF transport aircraft departed from Brize Norton for Turkey on Monday. This video can not be played Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital show how health care workers put on PPE Earlier, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said there was ""no doubt"" some hospital trusts were already experiencing shortages of the gowns. He said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day. Mr Hopson also said too much focus should not be placed on individual consignments. He gave the example of an expected consignment of 200,000 gowns from China, which turned out to be 20,000 gowns when it arrived last week. Downing Street said the government had now delivered one billion pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline staff. Speaking at the government briefing, Public Health England's medical director Prof Yvonne Doyle said a lack of PPE was ""a concern"". However, she denied that PPE guidance had been downgraded based on availability of equipment rather than safety standards, Public Health England changed its advice on Fridayto allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". Prof Doyle said: ""The guidance remains exactly the same. And that is a very precautionary set of advice - it's quite the opposite to putting people at risk because there aren't enough supplies. ""It's trying to ensure that people are well secured and safe when there may not be enough supplies, and it also stresses how important it is not to take risks."" Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland currently had ""adequate stocks"" of all the main items of PPE but gowns were one of the items ""under most pressure"". The owner of a healthcare service in Hampshire providing care to people in their own home said PPE was the ""biggest challenge"" her organisation faced. Alice Ushumba said she was struggling to get hold of enough masks, and that some staff had resigned because they didn't feel safe with the protective equipment available. ""We're going into people's houses who might have Covid but we don't have anything to protect ourselves except perhaps a little plastic apron and gloves,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The latest UK death total of 449 was the lowest daily figure announced since 6 April. The new figures also showed that the number of new infections - 4,676 - was the lowest for four days. Prof Maclean told the daily briefing that infections in the UK were ""flattening out"", and that the number of patients in hospitals in London had fallen for seven consecutive days. She added she hoped the fall would be ""replicated"" across the UK. The number of new deaths announced - 449 - is the lowest for two weeks. Last week the figures were hovering between 700 and 900, before dropping below 600 on Sunday. That is, of course, good news. Although the figures for the past two days should be treated with caution. They cover the weekend and we know reporting and recording delays can mean figures drop before rising again. But the falls are big enough to suggest we may soon start seeing the number of new deaths coming down. The numbers in hospital with coronavirus have already started dropping gradually so the signs are there that we are beginning to turn the corner. Mr Sunak said there were ""encouraging signs we are making progress"" in tackling the virus but added that the lockdown restrictions needed to remain in place. He reiterated the government's message that the UK needed to meet five tests set down last week before exiting the lockdown - which include increasing testing in the community, and being certain there was no risk of a second peak. ""We are not there yet and it is very clear that, for now, what we should focus on is following the guidance, staying home to protect the NHS,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told colleagues his concerns that relaxing lockdown measures too sooncould lead to a second outbreak of coronavirus. He is understood to have had a video call with his deputy, Dominic Raab, on Friday to discuss the crisis.

"More than 140,000 firms seek help under jobs scheme","More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"". ""It is not my current company's fault - they want to help us as much as they can - it's the government that is ignoring us."" On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that the wage subsidy schemewould be extended by a further month, until the end of June. The move came afterthe government confirmed that lockdown restrictions in the UK would continuefor ""at least"" another three weeks. Mr Harra declined to predict how much the scheme would cost. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated a price tag of Â£42bn, but that was before the government extended the scheme by a month. He said he was confident that HMRC could cope with the demand for the scheme. ""We have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims that we could receive - there are well over two million Pay-As-You-Earn schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those."" It's a massive feat of engineering, an unprecedented reverse plumbing of the tax system. Instead of sucking money out of millions of paypackets, HMRC is pumping cash in to throw companies and employees a lifeline. The early signs are promising - calls answered, online forms submitted. But now the hard work - to get the money in place for payday - starts. HMRC says funds should be available within six days. The intervening time is used to check firms are playing by the rules - not illicitly claiming for imaginary employees, for example. But the head of the tax office has admitted they won't catch every fraudulent case; there has to be a trade-off between speed and compliance. The smooth start will be a relief to Rishi Sunak, the scheme's architect . But what of those who started jobs after 28 February? Also, he's already extended the length of the scheme once - will he have to do that again, and at what cost? And, as Denmark has done, might he consider withholding help to companies registered in tax havens? With the amount he's already had to tackle, it's easy to forget Mr Sunak has been chancellor for less than three months - but several questions remain. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""With April's payday approaching, it is essential that the application process is smooth and that payments are made as soon as possible. ""Any delay would exacerbate the cash crisis many companies are facing and could threaten jobs and businesses,"" he added. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the government will cover 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per worker, per month before tax. Bosses will pay workers and reclaim the money from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online after the service goes live on 20 April. The minimum amount of time that an employee can be furloughed is three weeks, and firms are not expected to start receiving money until at least the end of April. What does it mean if I have been furloughed by work? According to new research by the Resolution Foundation, the take-up of the scheme has been higher than initially anticipated. It estimates that eight million workers could be furloughed over the coming weeks. It found that those working in low-paid sectors - such as hospitality or retail - are worst-affected, with almost half of the workforce expected to be put on paid leave. Daniel Tomlinson, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The government's welcome Job Retention Scheme is what stands between Britain experiencing high unemployment over the coming months, and catastrophic depression-era levels of long-term joblessness. ""It is proving particularly essential in big, low-paying sectors like hospitality and retail, where around half the workforce are no longer working."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Should Indians pay for their own  tests?,"A doctor takes a swab sample of a resident at a Covid-19 coronavirus testing drive inside the Dharavi slums Thyrocare, a private diagnostic laboratory in India, had just started testing for Covid-19, when the Supreme Court ordered all tests to be carried out free. âWe thought the order would say the rich would pay, and the government would pay for the poor,â says Arokiaswamy Velumani, Thyrocareâs founder. At 4,500 rupees ($59; Â£47), itâs not a cheap test. But the court did not clarify if and how private labs would be reimbursed. Panic stricken,some, including Thyrocare, put testing on hold,external. An anxious federal government petitioned the court to reconsider - which it did. According to the new order, issued on 13 April, the government will reimburse private labs for testing the 500 million people covered by a flagship public health insurance scheme. The rest would have to pay. But the volte-face sparked a bigger question: can India scale up testing for Covid-19 if itâs not free? A steep price tag India's numbers - 15,712  active cases and 507 deaths - are relatively low for a country of 1.3bn. Many believe this is because it's still testing too little - as of Sunday there had been 386,791. But scaling up is a challenge. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has approved only one homegrown testing kit so far, imports are delayed because of a global surge in demand, and the protective gear and medical staff required to conduct tests are in short supply. Also the sheer size of Indiaâs population, and the resources needed to reach every corner of the country, is daunting. All of this has made testing expensive. Itâs free at government hospitals and labs - and for months they were the only ones permitted to even test for coronavirus. But soon private players were roped in to support Indiaâs underfunded and struggling public health system. The government capped the price of a test at 4,500 rupees at home, or 3,500 rupees in a hospital, based on the recommendations of an expert committeeincluding heads of private health firms,external. But the figure, says Malini Aisola, from the All India Drug Action Network, a health sector watchdog, is ""arbitrary"". Onevirologist said,externalwhen he calculated the cost, it worked out to around 700 rupees. ""If the private sector was part of the process of deciding the cost, the government should release the breakdown,â argues Ms Aisola. But private lab owners say itâs a fair price. âThe supply chains are clogged - everyone is working on advance payments,â says Zoya Brar, founder and CEO of Core Diagnostics. She says that the basic RT-PCR test kit - widely used to diagnose HIV and influenza - costs around 1,200 rupees. And this is supplemented with an extraction kit, used to pull DNA and RNA, another kind of genetic code, from the sample. âThis is in short supply and when itâs available, weâre getting it for around 1,000 rupees, which is a blessing.â And then, she adds, there are the overheads - personal protective equipment (PPE) for staff; employeesâ salaries; and the cost of running the lab overall. Thyrocare's Dr Velumani says he is also paying higher salaries than usual because staff are being pressured to stop working by their families who are scared they may contract the virus. The case for free testing Right now, Indians are getting tested only if a doctor advises them to do so. But the long wait at government hospitals, and the prohibitive cost at private ones, could deter even those with symptoms from showing up. âIf you want to contain a pandemic, you canât have testing determined by cost,â says Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at Delhiâs Jawaharlal Nehru University. And making it free only for the poorest Indians doesnât help either, according to some economists. âThereâs a big chunk of people just above the poverty line that are also struggling and there are middle-class workers who have been laid off and canât afford to pay for their families to get tested,â says Vivek Dehejia, an economist. More importantly, the asymptomatic nature of the virus in many people means that India may soon have no choice but to begin mass testing. âIf you really want to push up testing rates across the country, you canât expect everyone to pay out of their pockets - for themselves and their families - especially if theyâre not showing any symptoms,â Mr Dehejia says. Singapore and South Korea have both been lauded for their aggressive testing, which is funded by the government. Vietnam, perhaps more comparable to India, has focused more on isolating infected people, but the government still foots the bill for testing. âYou cannot contain the virus unless you know who has it,â says Prof Ghosh. âSo itâs in your interest to make sure there is universal access [to testing].â Who should pay? Economists who spoke to the BBC made a range of suggestions - including employers chipping in, and insurance covering it - but all seemed to agree the government should do more. Already, it is paying for the lionâs share of testing, however, Mr Dehejia says it should ""encourage and subsidise free testing"". âYou cannot rely on private charity to get you out of an international public health emergency.â But India's health sector is poorly funded - it receives just about 1.3% of GDP - and is largely unregulated. Health insurance is not mandatory, and the market is fragmented - most policies cover hospitalisation but not diagnosis or medicines. And now with private hospitals in the mix, itâs going to be harder for the government to retain control of its testing strategy. A prominent hospital chain has just madetesting mandatory at the time of admission,external, which runs counter to current guidelines, recommending testing only for those with symptoms or who have come in contact with a positive case. Of course, testing could become cheaper as more homegrown kits are approved, and supply outstrips demand. Some states are also experimenting with standardised collection points - such as mobile centres or kiosks -  which means fewer PPE suits and lower transport costs. India is also considering pool testing, which involves collecting a large number of samples and testing them in one go. If the test is negative, nobody has the virus but if itâs positive, everyone who gave a sample has to be tested individually. âItâs definitely a good way to reduce costs - as long as itâs done efficiently and smartly,â Ms Brar says. But the more immediate solution, she says, is to perhaps regulate prices. âIf you can fix the price of the raw materials, you can fix the overall price.â A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Together At Home: Nine things,"Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Sheryl Crow were among more than 100 performers and guest stars Lady Gaga's ridiculously star-studded Together At Home concert saw everyone from Paul McCartney to Taylor Swift come together in support of front-line workers during the coronavirus crisis. The eight-hour broadcast saw more than 100 musicians performing in their living rooms, and broadcast on TV and streaming services around the globe. Under the circumstances, the quality varied wildly - but there was a voyeuristic thrill to seeing inside the apartments where pop stars are spending the lockdown. Star-studded concert celebrates health workers Excerpts of the show will be broadcast on BBC One from 19:15 BST on Sunday, along with UK exclusive performances from the likes of Little Mix, Tom Jones and Rag 'N' Bone Man. Until then, here are some of the highlights, lowlights and other things we spotted during the Living Room Live Aid. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Taylor Swift once said she would never play Soon You'll Get Better live, because the subject matter - her mother's cancer diagnosis - was too emotionally difficult. But she powered through it on Sunday night, her eyes clenched firmly shut for most of the performance. In the context of the coronavirus pandemic, the lines about bargaining with God in hospital waiting rooms carried extra emotional heft, as they summoned thoughts of people suffering from the virus, and the worries of their loved ones. When Swift's voice caught on the line,""What am I supposed to do if there's no you?"" more than a few of us choked up with her. Allow YouTube content?

Never in a million years would we suggest that The Rolling Stones were playing to a backing track... but unless Charlie Watts has a magic armchair, there's no way those drum sounds were coming from his living room. What will his mum say when she sees this? (Puth is at his parents' house, so we half expected her to walk in and yell at him halfway through his performance of See You Again.) For the most part, though, pop stars made an effort to tidy up - or at least shove all of the unwashed dishes just out of shot. But we were impressed by Delta Goodrem conspicuously positioning her camera to point at her awards cabinet. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

The home videos provided a fascinating insight into singers' home recording set-ups. Sheryl Crow won easily, performing from the professional studio she installed in her backyard barn in Tennessee. Let's just look at that room from another angle... How many guitars does one multi-platinum-selling recording artist need? But Crow was one of the lucky ones. Other artists were apparently reduced to playing a backing track off CD and singing into their laptop, while The Killers were apparently playing Mr Brightside on a Casio keyboard. Technical problems were particularly apparent during the pre-show - but even Paul McCartney managed to record his video contribution in portrait mode instead of landscape. Rookie error! (Unless he thought he was going on TikTok instead of a major international simulcast.) However, organisers Global Citizen said the lack of polish was partially deliberate. Showing stars struggling with the technology helped reinforce the message of solidarity. ""We don't want to make [it] more professional,""CEO Hugh Evans told Variety,external. ""I think right now everyone is understanding that people are (singing) from their homes. We're not planning to dial up the production, because we want the money to go toward the cause. Because we really believe that's what matters most."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

What, you expected J Lo to turn up in a smock with her hair tied up in a dishrag? Let's face it, that was never going to happen. Lopez stayed true to form, conjuring up all the the glitz and glamour we've missed during the lockdown as she performed a syrupy version of Barbara Streisand's People while bathed in the warm glow of a hundred fairy lights. If the lockdown has you feeling low, you're not alone. ""It's really strange,"" said pop star Christine And The Queens. ""It's all about screens now and no human contact, and I know it can be draining emotionally. It's the fourth week here in France and it's been quite intense. ""I know it's hard [but] don't hesitate to reach out to people virtually if you feel down,"" she added. The singer, whose real name is Heloise Letissier, went on to play People, I've Been Sad - a vulnerable and intimate song that shared her own struggles with happiness. It was one of the night's most affecting performances. Not everyone who took part had a home studio or the ability to play with their regular band, which led to some clever video treatments. Keith Urban, who is in lockdown with his wife Nicole Kidman, became his own backing band - with three Keiths all playing simultaneously on a cover of Steve Winwood's Higher Love. John Legend put together a colourful clip for his single Bigger Love that featured several dancers interacting with one another, despite being in self-isolation (with a glorious twist right at the end).

One member of the K-Pop band SuperMdrew an exclusive artwork for fans,externallive during his band's performance of With You. And chat show host Jimmy Fallon teamed up with dozens of healthcare workers for acoronavirus-themed cover of Men Without Hats' Safety Dance,external. ""We can dance, we can dance, everybody's washing their hands,"" the rewritten lyrics declared. ""Hi guys, I'm Ellie Goulding and I'm going to play some songs for you,"" said (you guessed it) Ellie Goulding. But the singer only got to run through one track before the show cut away to Christine And The Queens. It turned out that musicians had been asked to record a handful of numbers, with the recordings scattered throughout the eight-hour event. Goulding, nestled amongst some zebra-print cushions, turned up again several hours later to play an acoustic version of Burn. Presumably organisers they felt that, in the pick-and-mix era of music streaming, people wouldn't stick around for a full 15-minute, Live Aid-style set from each artist. But it also lent the show a sense of pace it might have lacked without the multiple camera angles and frenetic editing viewers have come to expect. It could shape the format of benefit concerts for years to come. The entire extravaganza can be re-watched on streaming platforms right now.

New York couples marry over Zoom,"This Jewish wedding in New York was one of the last before the lockdown New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has signed an order allowing online marriages, as many weddings are cancelled under lockdown restrictions. From now on, people in the US state will be able to apply for marriage licences remotely and clerks allowed to conduct ceremonies virtually. Mr Cuomo joked that the decision meant there was now ""no excuse"" for couples not to tie the knot. ""You can do it by Zoom. Yes or no?"" he said in his briefing on Saturday. The decision comes after New York state extended lockdown measures until 15 May. More than 13,000 people have died of coronavirus in New York city alone. Allow Twitter content?

Social media reaction to the decision was mixed. Some questioned why couples would choose to hold weddings when their families and friends are unable to join them, or criticised the governor for not prioritising other decisions. But others pointed out that during a pandemic, marriage could offer practical benefits, such as allowing couples to share health insurance coverage. Some people have already turned to online celebrations to mark what would have been their special day. This video can not be played Doctors Zoe and Tom were thrown a virtual celebration when their wedding was cancelled But unless the weddings have been arranged in advance - and both their venues and officiants are still available despite lockdown - many of these ceremonies are not legally binding. New York isn't the first place to turn to the internet to offer a legal solution. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recently announced that citizens and residents would be allowed to get married online, after the justice ministry created a website for couples to submit required documents. A virtual ceremony, complete with a registrar and witnesses, can then take place. Similar measures have been introduced in the US state of Colorado,external, where couples are being allowed to apply for marriage licences online. Meanwhile,one county in Ohio is allowing people to obtain marriage licences online in specific circumstances,external, such as when one of the partners is a health care worker, suffers from a serious illness or has health insurance issues.

"67,000 furlough claims made in first 30 minutes","More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"". ""It is not my current company's fault - they want to help us as much as they can - it's the government that is ignoring us."" On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that the wage subsidy schemewould be extended by a further month, until the end of June. The move came afterthe government confirmed that lockdown restrictions in the UK would continuefor ""at least"" another three weeks. Mr Harra declined to predict how much the scheme would cost. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated a price tag of Â£42bn, but that was before the government extended the scheme by a month. He said he was confident that HMRC could cope with the demand for the scheme. ""We have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims that we could receive - there are well over two million Pay-As-You-Earn schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those."" It's a massive feat of engineering, an unprecedented reverse plumbing of the tax system. Instead of sucking money out of millions of paypackets, HMRC is pumping cash in to throw companies and employees a lifeline. The early signs are promising - calls answered, online forms submitted. But now the hard work - to get the money in place for payday - starts. HMRC says funds should be available within six days. The intervening time is used to check firms are playing by the rules - not illicitly claiming for imaginary employees, for example. But the head of the tax office has admitted they won't catch every fraudulent case; there has to be a trade-off between speed and compliance. The smooth start will be a relief to Rishi Sunak, the scheme's architect . But what of those who started jobs after 28 February? Also, he's already extended the length of the scheme once - will he have to do that again, and at what cost? And, as Denmark has done, might he consider withholding help to companies registered in tax havens? With the amount he's already had to tackle, it's easy to forget Mr Sunak has been chancellor for less than three months - but several questions remain. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""With April's payday approaching, it is essential that the application process is smooth and that payments are made as soon as possible. ""Any delay would exacerbate the cash crisis many companies are facing and could threaten jobs and businesses,"" he added. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the government will cover 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per worker, per month before tax. Bosses will pay workers and reclaim the money from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online after the service goes live on 20 April. The minimum amount of time that an employee can be furloughed is three weeks, and firms are not expected to start receiving money until at least the end of April. What does it mean if I have been furloughed by work? According to new research by the Resolution Foundation, the take-up of the scheme has been higher than initially anticipated. It estimates that eight million workers could be furloughed over the coming weeks. It found that those working in low-paid sectors - such as hospitality or retail - are worst-affected, with almost half of the workforce expected to be put on paid leave. Daniel Tomlinson, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The government's welcome Job Retention Scheme is what stands between Britain experiencing high unemployment over the coming months, and catastrophic depression-era levels of long-term joblessness. ""It is proving particularly essential in big, low-paying sectors like hospitality and retail, where around half the workforce are no longer working."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI business lobby group, welcomed the launch of the online application service for firms. ""Rolling out the job retention scheme will make a huge difference to tens of thousands of firms and millions of people, protecting jobs and living standards throughout the UK,"" she said.

Harry and Meghan plan to freeze out tabloids,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have told the UK's tabloid press they are ending all co-operation with them.Â In a letter to editors of all the Sun, Mirror, Mail and Express titles and websites, a representative said the pair had taken the step due to ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. Harry and Meghan said they refused to ""offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion"". The couple have relocated to California after stepping back as senior royals. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Royal Family tree and line of succession How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life In the letter, the couple's public relations representative wrote it was ""gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media"" has printed ""distorted, false or invasive"" articles. ""There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society,"" the letter said. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue."" The BBC was told that the letter had been sent to the editors of the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express newspapers. The new policy will apply to the four newspapers, their Sunday editions and associated websites,the Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson reported,external. The Daily Star, which was not specifically mentioned, is published by the same group that publishes the Mirror and Express titles. The ban on engagement with the papers will mean that the couple's PR team will no longer even answer calls from the papers asking them to confirm whether claims made about the couple are true or not. Outlining the new policy of ""no corroboration and zero engagement"" with all the publications that received it, the letter said the measure would also protect the couple's communications team ""from the side of the industry that readers never see"". ""This policy is not about avoiding criticism,"" the letter continued. ""It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie."" Prince Harry has spoken in the past of seeing - as a young child - the effect media intrusion had on his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales The letter said the couple will continue to work with other media and ""young, up-and-coming journalists"" to raise awareness of the issues and causes they care about. Why the Royal Family rarely go to court Meghan's father 'would testify in privacy case' Meghan sues Mail on Sunday over private letter In recent days, photographs of the Sussexes delivering food to vulnerable people in Los Angeles have been published by two of the newspapers to receive the letter. And it comes ahead of a court hearing this week ina legal case Meghan has brought against the publisher of the Mail on Sundayover the publication of a letter written to the duchess by her estranged father. The couple officially stepped back as senior working members of the Royal Family at the end of March as part of a transition followingan announcement of their intention to become financially independent in January.. As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation. Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracyâ particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account. It has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or printâeven when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they knowâas well as complete strangersâhave their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue. With that said, please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever. What they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion. We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected.

The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes home,"The MSC Magnifica's world cruise was supposed to last 117 days, before being cut short The three last cruise ships still sailing with passengers will dock today - and one has had quite the odyssey. The MSC Magnifica left Europe in January, and was in the other corner of the world when ports began to close. With nowhere to go, the Swiss-owned ship started the long journey home. Its passengers, used to a new port every few days, last felt land six weeks ago. On Monday those passengers will finally get off in Marseille, having last disembarked in Wellington. Their voyage has included political storms, presidential pleas, one death, and - despite it all - plenty of fun. When the Magnifica left Genoa, Italy, on 5 January, the world looked very different. The ""unknown pneumonia"", as it was called, did not have a name. No one had died,the World Health Organization said,external, and just 59 people were infected, all in Wuhan. It is safe to say most of the Magnifica's 1,760 passengers - mainly Italian, French, and German - had not heard of the virus. And so, as they watched the sunset from the boat's Bar del Sole, or ate in the Quattro Venti restaurant, spirits were high. At the helm was Captain Roberto Leotta, from the small town of Riposto in Sicily. Captain Leotta has worked on cruises for 32 years, after three years on tankers and one in the Italian navy. Like many people from Riposto, his father and grandfathers were sailors. ""It is something that is in my DNA,"" he tells the BBC. Captain Leotta: ""Sailing is a tradition in my family, and a tradition in my town"" After leaving Europe, the ship stopped in Cape Verde, off the west coast of Africa, before heading across the Atlantic. By the time they docked in Brazil on 19 January, the virus had left China, and Captain Leotta had noticed. ""We were always in contact with all the local authorities,"" he says. ""[But it was] after South America the situation became more concerning."" The ship left Chile on 21 February, reaching Pitcairn in the South Pacific three days later. By now, cruise ships were in the news. Ports wereclosing their doors. Passengers fromquarantined ships were dying. And the Pacific island of Aitutaki - just east of the International Date Line, population 2,000 - was worried. Ruby Princess: How did debacle happen? Diamond Princess: Criticism over cruise quarantine Grand Princess: Virus-hit ship docks in California Westerdam: How did it end up in Cambodia? The Magnifica was due in Aitutaki, famed for its turquoise lagoon and white sand, on 2 March. But as the coronavirus crept closer, local concerns grew. The island relies on cruise money but they asked the national government - the Cook Islands - to ban all cruises. The ship, which was virus-free, was allowed to dock on the main island, Rarotonga, but not Aitutaki. For the first time, Covid-19 had changed the plans of the MSC Magnifica's passengers. One of those passengers was Andy Gerber, then aged 69, from Bern in Switzerland. The Magnifica was his 20th cruise. In Auckland - the next stop after the Cook Islands - he enjoyed a beer in the sunshine; in Napier he admired the art deco; in Wellington he rode the cable car. But the big one was Sydney, a week after Wellington, where he would turn 70. ""A long time ago I reserved a steakhouse to celebrate with a bunch of friends,"" he tells the BBC. Until Australia, the Magnifica's itinerary was a blessing. In January, as the coronavirus emerged in Asia, the ship was far away in South America - where the virus wasn't recorded until late February. When it visited New Zealand, just five cases had been confirmed - all of them travellers, or their partners or relatives. But as the Magnifica approached Tasmania on 14 March, the coronavirus had caught up with the cruise ship. The island had six cases, and things were getting worse. The ship had permission to dock in Hobart, but Captain Leotta knew passengers may return with more than souvenirs. ""We decided it was much better for our passengers to remain safely on board,"" he says. The world - which seemed so big when they left Genoa in January - was suddenly much smaller. ""It was clear,"" says Captain Leotta, ""that there was basically nowhere to go."" And so, in Sydney, the captain confirmed the news: the world cruise was over. They were heading home. The trip of a lifetime had become half the trip of a lifetime. Instead of the steakhouse, Andy Gerber celebrated his long-awaited 70th on board the ship, as the sights of Sydney were tantalisingly in view. How did he feel? ""At first - terrible!"" he says. ""But after the shock, we were grateful the captain decided not to let us ashore, as this meant we were 99.999% clean [of the virus]."" When the cruise was cancelled, passengers were allowed off - under strict conditions - in Sydney and Melbourne, if they wished to make their own way home. A few hundred did so, but most settled down for the ride: five weeks, 12,000 miles [19,000km], and a whole new meaning to long-haul. The ship was supposed to head north to New Caledonia in the South Pacific. Instead it went south, and sailed straight into a political storm. Andy Gerber celebrating his birthday on board When a cruise ship wants to dock, it must provide the port with medical records, to show there are no contagious diseases on board. As the Magnifica approached Fremantle in Western Australia, the records showed around 250 people had visited the medical room in the past two weeks. Many were for painkillers, or dressings - routine visits. Crucially, there was no sign of Covid-19 on board. The Magnifica wanted only to refuel and resupply in Fremantle - not disembark. So, as he sailed up the coast, Captain Leotta was surprised to see the news conference from Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan. ""Currently more than 250 passengers [on the Magnifica] have reported upper respiratory illnesses,"" Mr McGowan announced. ""This morning I have contacted the prime ministerâ¦I will not allowwhat happened in Sydneyto happen here. ""We will not allow passengers or crew to wander the streets. This is a non-negotiable position."" After Mr McGowan's news conference, a small group of protesters welcomed the Magnifica in Fremantle Somehow, Mr McGowan had the wrong information. Wires were crossed. The Magnifica was leading the news, when its passengers were healthy - and didn't want to get off anyway. The company insisted there were no respiratory diseases or flu symptoms on board. But Western Australia then accused MSC of ""inconsistent advice"" - something MSC denied. Either way, when it arrived in Fremantle, the ship was greeted by the police and border force - to make sure no one got off - and a handful of protesters. ""Let's say that was not nice,"" says Captain Leotta. ""It was disappointing, first of all because it was fake news. It was wrong. And you can imagine, this news went all around the world immediately."" Despite the disagreement, the Magnifica was allowed to resupply in Fremantle, before heading onwards. But it would soon be in the headlines again. Magnifica passengers, photographed from the shore in Fremantle As the TV crews filmed the Magnifica in Fremantle, and the politicians gave their news conferences, Anura Herath was below decks, out of sight, working hard as usual. Being a chef on a cruise ship is hard enough. It's even harder when the passengers aren't disembarking for meals. But Anura, from Kandy in Sri Lanka, is used to hard work. The 31-year-old has been a chef for seven years, since graduating from a hotel school in Sri Lanka. After working in his home country, he moved to hotels in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, before joining MSC in August 2017. ""In Dubai, the salary is enough, but I could not save much,"" he says. ""So I decided to join the cruise line, because I can save, and I can travel the world."" After Australia, the Magnifica's plan was to sail to Dubai for a ""technical stop"". But that, too, became impossible so they decided on Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka. By now, Anura didn't want to sail back to Europe. Would he be quarantined, and if so, for how long? How would he get home? And so, he went to his bosses with a plan: let me off in Colombo. Anura Herath's career has taken him around the world - this picture was taken in Ushuaia, at the southern tip of Argentina Although it seemed to make sense, Sri Lanka would not allow anyone to disembark. He would have to see his homeland appear, and then disappear, from below deck. So, on 4 April - two days before Colombo - Anura, while wearing his chef's whites, recorded a 94-second video message for the Sri Lankan president and prime minister. Let me off, he said in Sinhalese. I am the only Sri Lankan on board. It will be too hard to get back from Italy. After publishing the message, Anura went to work. He shared it with a journalist friend in Sri Lanka, but didn't expect much. After finishing work in the small hours, he went back to his cabin. ""I tried to sleep, but my family called me and told me to look on Facebook,"" he says. ""So I looked - and so many people were sharing this message."" On Ape Rata - the Sri Lankan site that picked it up - the video was watched half a million times. Now everyone wanted to speak to the chef from Kandy. ""Politicians, navy, army, so many people called,"" he says. ""It was like a dream. Everything was very fast."" The Sri Lankan president decided to relax the rules and so, as the Magnifica arrived in Colombo to refuel, the navy brought Anura ashore. ""I prayed for it, but I didn't believe it would come,"" he says ""Everybody helped me - all the Sri Lankans."" For Captain Leotta - who had the final say - it was another first in a journey full of them. ""We were proud of him,"" he says. ""He really did the impossible to get off the ship."" As it turned out, Anura wasn't the only one to get off in Colombo. A 75-year-old German woman, who needed urgent (non-Covid) care, was also taken ashore and, sadly, later died. As for Anura, he is still in quarantine at the naval centre in Boossa, but hopes to see his mother in Kandy soon. This video can not be played The cruise ship cancellations have led to cleaner canals in Venice As it pulls into Marseille on Monday, the Magnifica will be one of three cruises still sailing with passengers, the Cruise Lines International Association says. The other two are also due to disembark today: the Pacific Princess in Los Angeles, and the Costa Deliziosa in Barcelona (it will also drop off passengers in Genoa afterwards). For Andy Gerber, who turned 70 in Sydney harbour, life on board ""the last cruise ship on Earth"" has been enjoyable, despite the lack of shore visits. ""There is still plenty to do if you want,"" he says. ""Gym, games, shows, dance classesâ¦ ""We have two pools and perfect weather, plenty to eat and drink, and we have made a lot of friends - especially during all these sea days."" A Facebook forum is also upbeat. Covid-19 never reached the Magnifica and neither, it seems, did cabin fever. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak While there are some complaints - mainly about other passengers - there are plenty of pictures of singing and dancing. A picture of one performance on 10 April is captioned: ""Maybe this is the only theatre in the world still open."" And - despite it all - the man at the helm also has happy memories of his truncated tour. ""We found ourselves [globally] in a situation where Covid-19 has been isolating people, and distancing people,"" says Captain Leotta. ""Here was the opposite. We became like a family - our guests and our crew together. The spirit has been beautiful."" But what of the cruise industry? Can it recover from the bad press, the cancelled bookings, and all the other problems Covid-19 brought? ""We will return to cruising, and we will return better prepared than before with more experience. We are learning a lot, we will be there stronger than ever before."" Will we ever cruise again?

"Virgin Atlantic will fold without aid, Branson warns","Sir Richard moved to Necker Island 14 years ago Sir Richard Branson has pledged his luxury island resort as collateral to help get a UK government bailout of his stricken airline Virgin Atlantic. The billionaire Virgin Group boss saidin an open letter to staff,externalhe was not asking for a handout, but a commercial loan, believed to be Â£500m. The airline's survival was in doubt, and his Necker Island home in the Caribbean could be mortgaged, he said. It comes as Virgin Group's airline in Australia enters administration. Virgin Australia collapses into administration Both airlines have been hit hard by the global coronavirus lockdown, and Sir Richard has appealed to governments in both countries for help. However, he has been criticised for appealing for taxpayer aid rather than drawing on his huge wealth. Sir Richard's fortune is thought to be well over Â£4bn. The large US airline Delta owns 49% of Virgin Atlantic. Sir Richard said in his letter to staff: ""Many airlines around the world need government support and many have already received it."" The crisis facing airlines, and the staff they employ, was ""unprecedented,"" he said. Despite his wealth, this did not mean he had ""cash in a bank account ready to withdraw"". And he hit back at criticism that he was a tax exile who did not deserve help, saying he and his wife ""did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands and in particular Necker Island"". He said Necker would be offered as security for any loans. ""As with other Virgin assets, our team will raise as much money against the island as possible to save as many jobs as possible around the group,"" Sir Richard said. Allow Twitter content?

In his letter to staff, Sir Richard said: ""We will do everything we can to keep the airline [Virgin Atlantic] going - but we will need government support to achieve that in the face of the severe uncertainty surrounding travel today and not knowing how long the planes will be grounded for. ""This would be in the form of a commercial loan - it wouldn't be free money and the airline would pay it back (as EasyJet will do for the Â£600m loan the government recently gave them)."" He pointed out that Virgin Atlantic started with one plane 36 years ago, before adding: ""Over those years it has created real competition for British Airways, which must remain fierce for the benefit of our wonderful customers and the public at large."" Sir Richard offered to inject Â£250m into the Virgin Group last month, with most of that going to the airline. Earlier this month, Rolls-Royce, Airbus, Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group sent letters to the government highlighting the importance of Virgin Atlantic to the UK's manufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, Virgin Australia - in which Sir Richard holds a stake of around 10% - is going into administration. The carrier has been forced to cancel nearly all of its flights during the coronavirus crisis and been unable to restructure its debts. The Australian government offered some support, but refused a request from the company for a A$1.4bn (Â£720m) loan. The airline is part-owned by Sir Richard along with Etihad, Singapore Airlines and China's HNA. ""The brilliant Virgin Australia team is fighting to survive and need support to get through this catastrophic global crisis,"" Sir Richard said. ""We are hopeful that Virgin Australia can emerge stronger than ever, as a more sustainable, financially viable airline."" He warned: ""If Virgin Australia disappears, Qantas would effectively have a monopoly of the Australian skies. We all know what that would lead to."" Sir Richard also addressed the fierce criticism he has faced in recent weeks over his tax situation. Critics have pointed out he has paid no UK income tax since moving to the tax-free British Virgin Islands 14 years ago. Sir Richard is the 312th richest person in the world with an estimated $5.2bn fortune, according to the Bloomberg billionaires index. ""I've seen lots of comments about my net worth - but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw,"" he said. ""Over the years significant profits have never been taken out of the Virgin Group, instead they have been reinvested in building businesses that create value and opportunities."" Turning to the question of living abroad he said: ""Joan and I did not leave Britain for tax reasons but for our love of the beautiful British Virgin Islands (BVI) and in particular Necker Island, which I bought when I was 29 years old, as an uninhabited island on the edges of the BVI. ""Over time, we built our family home here. The rest of the island is run as a business, which employs 175 people."" Coronavirus: Who is still flying?

US oil prices drop to 21-year low as demand dries upCoronavirus downturn has put major pressure on oil prices with demand slumping and storage running out.BusinessComments,"The price of US oil has turned negative for the first time in history. That means oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands over fears that storage capacity could run out in May. Demand for oil has all but dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. As a result, oil firms have resorted to renting tankers to store the surplus supply and that has forced the price of US oil into negative territory. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Record deal to cut oil output ends price war Coronavirus: Who is still flying? Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping ""This is off-the-charts wacky,"" said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The demand shock was so massive that it's overwhelmed anything that people could have expected."" The severe drop on Monday was driven in part by a technicality of the global oil market. Oil is traded on its future price and May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday. Traders were keen to offload those holdings to avoid having to take delivery of the oil and incur storage costs. June prices for WTI were also down, but trading at above $20 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude - the benchmark used by Europe and the rest of the world, which is already trading based on June contracts - was also weaker, down 8.9% at less than $26 a barrel. Mr Glickman said the historic reversal in pricing was a reminder of the strains facing the oil market and warned that June prices could also fall, if lockdowns remain in place. ""I'm really not optimistic about the prospects for oil companies or oil prices,"" he said. OGUK, the business lobby for the UK's offshore oil and gas sector, said the negative price of US oil would affect firms operating in the North Sea. ""The dynamics of this US market are different from those directly driving UK produced Brent but we will not escape the impact,"" said OGUK boss Deirdre Michie. ""Ours is not just a trading market; every penny lost spells more uncertainty over jobs,"" she said. The oil industry has been struggling with both tumbling demand and in-fighting among producers about reducing output. Earlier this month, Opec members and its allies finally agreed a record deal to slash global output by about 10%. The deal was the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. But many analysts say the cuts were not big enough to make a difference. ""It hasn't taken long for the market to recognise that the Opec+ deal will not, in its present form, be enough to balance oil markets,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axicorp. The leading exporters - Opec and allies such as Russia - have already agreed to cut production by a record amount. In the United States and elsewhere, oil-producing businesses have made commercial decisions to cut output. But still the world has more crude oil than it can use. And it's not just about whether we can use it. It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products. Capacity is filling fast on land and at sea. As that process continues it's likely to bear down further on prices. It will take a recovery in demand to really turn the market round and that will depend on how the health crisis unfolds. There will be further supply cuts as private sector producers respond to the low prices, but it's hard to see that being on a sufficient scale to have a fundamental impact on the market. For US drivers, the decline in oil prices - which have fallen by about two-thirds since the start of the year - has had an impact at the pumps, albeit not as dramatic as Monday's decline might suggest. ""The silver lining is, if you for various reason actually need to be on the roads, you're filling up for far less than you would have been even four months ago,"" Mr Glickman said. ""The problem for most of us is even if you could fill up, where are you going to go?"" US President Donald Trump has said the government will buy oil for the country's national reserve. But concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity, with stockpiles at Cushing, the main delivery point in the US for oil, rising almost 50% since the start of March, according to ANZ Bank. Mr Innes said: ""It's a dump at all cost as no one, and I mean no one, wants delivery of oil with Cushing storage facilities filling by the minute.""

Coronavirus 'in Afghan palace',"There is no suggestion that Mr Ghani has been infected Dozens of members of staff working at Afghanistan's presidential palace have tested positive for coronavirus, according to media reports. Twenty cases were initially reported, but on Sunday the New York Times said the number had risen to 40. The Afghan government has not commented and there is no suggestion that President Ashraf Ghani himself has been infected. Mr Ghani, 70, reportedly lost part of his stomach to cancer in the 1990s. ""Twenty-odd people are infected with COVID-19 in the presidential palace. However, it is [being] kept under wraps to ensure no panic is caused,"" one government official told AFP on Saturday. Afghanistan's technocrat with a temper A Twitter post published by the presidential palace on Thursday showed Mr Ghani chairing a cabinet meeting via video link, but the account has since shared photos of the president meeting Iranian officials in person - albeit at a distance.

Afghan government figures from Saturday showed 933 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Afghanistan as a whole, with 33 deaths. While the numbers appear low, the country has limited access to testing and the health system has suffered under decades of conflict.

"The 'last cruise ship on Earth' finally comes homeFrom political storms to presidential pleas, it has been quite a journey for the MSC Magnifica.","The MSC Magnifica's world cruise was supposed to last 117 days, before being cut short The three last cruise ships still sailing with passengers will dock today - and one has had quite the odyssey. The MSC Magnifica left Europe in January, and was in the other corner of the world when ports began to close. With nowhere to go, the Swiss-owned ship started the long journey home. Its passengers, used to a new port every few days, last felt land six weeks ago. On Monday those passengers will finally get off in Marseille, having last disembarked in Wellington. Their voyage has included political storms, presidential pleas, one death, and - despite it all - plenty of fun. When the Magnifica left Genoa, Italy, on 5 January, the world looked very different. The ""unknown pneumonia"", as it was called, did not have a name. No one had died,the World Health Organization said,external, and just 59 people were infected, all in Wuhan. It is safe to say most of the Magnifica's 1,760 passengers - mainly Italian, French, and German - had not heard of the virus. And so, as they watched the sunset from the boat's Bar del Sole, or ate in the Quattro Venti restaurant, spirits were high. At the helm was Captain Roberto Leotta, from the small town of Riposto in Sicily. Captain Leotta has worked on cruises for 32 years, after three years on tankers and one in the Italian navy. Like many people from Riposto, his father and grandfathers were sailors. ""It is something that is in my DNA,"" he tells the BBC. Captain Leotta: ""Sailing is a tradition in my family, and a tradition in my town"" After leaving Europe, the ship stopped in Cape Verde, off the west coast of Africa, before heading across the Atlantic. By the time they docked in Brazil on 19 January, the virus had left China, and Captain Leotta had noticed. ""We were always in contact with all the local authorities,"" he says. ""[But it was] after South America the situation became more concerning."" The ship left Chile on 21 February, reaching Pitcairn in the South Pacific three days later. By now, cruise ships were in the news. Ports wereclosing their doors. Passengers fromquarantined ships were dying. And the Pacific island of Aitutaki - just east of the International Date Line, population 2,000 - was worried. Ruby Princess: How did debacle happen? Diamond Princess: Criticism over cruise quarantine Grand Princess: Virus-hit ship docks in California Westerdam: How did it end up in Cambodia? The Magnifica was due in Aitutaki, famed for its turquoise lagoon and white sand, on 2 March. But as the coronavirus crept closer, local concerns grew. The island relies on cruise money but they asked the national government - the Cook Islands - to ban all cruises. The ship, which was virus-free, was allowed to dock on the main island, Rarotonga, but not Aitutaki. For the first time, Covid-19 had changed the plans of the MSC Magnifica's passengers. One of those passengers was Andy Gerber, then aged 69, from Bern in Switzerland. The Magnifica was his 20th cruise. In Auckland - the next stop after the Cook Islands - he enjoyed a beer in the sunshine; in Napier he admired the art deco; in Wellington he rode the cable car. But the big one was Sydney, a week after Wellington, where he would turn 70. ""A long time ago I reserved a steakhouse to celebrate with a bunch of friends,"" he tells the BBC. Until Australia, the Magnifica's itinerary was a blessing. In January, as the coronavirus emerged in Asia, the ship was far away in South America - where the virus wasn't recorded until late February. When it visited New Zealand, just five cases had been confirmed - all of them travellers, or their partners or relatives. But as the Magnifica approached Tasmania on 14 March, the coronavirus had caught up with the cruise ship. The island had six cases, and things were getting worse. The ship had permission to dock in Hobart, but Captain Leotta knew passengers may return with more than souvenirs. ""We decided it was much better for our passengers to remain safely on board,"" he says. The world - which seemed so big when they left Genoa in January - was suddenly much smaller. ""It was clear,"" says Captain Leotta, ""that there was basically nowhere to go."" And so, in Sydney, the captain confirmed the news: the world cruise was over. They were heading home. The trip of a lifetime had become half the trip of a lifetime. Instead of the steakhouse, Andy Gerber celebrated his long-awaited 70th on board the ship, as the sights of Sydney were tantalisingly in view. How did he feel? ""At first - terrible!"" he says. ""But after the shock, we were grateful the captain decided not to let us ashore, as this meant we were 99.999% clean [of the virus]."" When the cruise was cancelled, passengers were allowed off - under strict conditions - in Sydney and Melbourne, if they wished to make their own way home. A few hundred did so, but most settled down for the ride: five weeks, 12,000 miles [19,000km], and a whole new meaning to long-haul. The ship was supposed to head north to New Caledonia in the South Pacific. Instead it went south, and sailed straight into a political storm. Andy Gerber celebrating his birthday on board When a cruise ship wants to dock, it must provide the port with medical records, to show there are no contagious diseases on board. As the Magnifica approached Fremantle in Western Australia, the records showed around 250 people had visited the medical room in the past two weeks. Many were for painkillers, or dressings - routine visits. Crucially, there was no sign of Covid-19 on board. The Magnifica wanted only to refuel and resupply in Fremantle - not disembark. So, as he sailed up the coast, Captain Leotta was surprised to see the news conference from Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan. ""Currently more than 250 passengers [on the Magnifica] have reported upper respiratory illnesses,"" Mr McGowan announced. ""This morning I have contacted the prime ministerâ¦I will not allowwhat happened in Sydneyto happen here. ""We will not allow passengers or crew to wander the streets. This is a non-negotiable position."" After Mr McGowan's news conference, a small group of protesters welcomed the Magnifica in Fremantle Somehow, Mr McGowan had the wrong information. Wires were crossed. The Magnifica was leading the news, when its passengers were healthy - and didn't want to get off anyway. The company insisted there were no respiratory diseases or flu symptoms on board. But Western Australia then accused MSC of ""inconsistent advice"" - something MSC denied. Either way, when it arrived in Fremantle, the ship was greeted by the police and border force - to make sure no one got off - and a handful of protesters. ""Let's say that was not nice,"" says Captain Leotta. ""It was disappointing, first of all because it was fake news. It was wrong. And you can imagine, this news went all around the world immediately."" Despite the disagreement, the Magnifica was allowed to resupply in Fremantle, before heading onwards. But it would soon be in the headlines again. Magnifica passengers, photographed from the shore in Fremantle As the TV crews filmed the Magnifica in Fremantle, and the politicians gave their news conferences, Anura Herath was below decks, out of sight, working hard as usual. Being a chef on a cruise ship is hard enough. It's even harder when the passengers aren't disembarking for meals. But Anura, from Kandy in Sri Lanka, is used to hard work. The 31-year-old has been a chef for seven years, since graduating from a hotel school in Sri Lanka. After working in his home country, he moved to hotels in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, before joining MSC in August 2017. ""In Dubai, the salary is enough, but I could not save much,"" he says. ""So I decided to join the cruise line, because I can save, and I can travel the world."" After Australia, the Magnifica's plan was to sail to Dubai for a ""technical stop"". But that, too, became impossible so they decided on Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka. By now, Anura didn't want to sail back to Europe. Would he be quarantined, and if so, for how long? How would he get home? And so, he went to his bosses with a plan: let me off in Colombo. Anura Herath's career has taken him around the world - this picture was taken in Ushuaia, at the southern tip of Argentina Although it seemed to make sense, Sri Lanka would not allow anyone to disembark. He would have to see his homeland appear, and then disappear, from below deck. So, on 4 April - two days before Colombo - Anura, while wearing his chef's whites, recorded a 94-second video message for the Sri Lankan president and prime minister. Let me off, he said in Sinhalese. I am the only Sri Lankan on board. It will be too hard to get back from Italy. After publishing the message, Anura went to work. He shared it with a journalist friend in Sri Lanka, but didn't expect much. After finishing work in the small hours, he went back to his cabin. ""I tried to sleep, but my family called me and told me to look on Facebook,"" he says. ""So I looked - and so many people were sharing this message."" On Ape Rata - the Sri Lankan site that picked it up - the video was watched half a million times. Now everyone wanted to speak to the chef from Kandy. ""Politicians, navy, army, so many people called,"" he says. ""It was like a dream. Everything was very fast."" The Sri Lankan president decided to relax the rules and so, as the Magnifica arrived in Colombo to refuel, the navy brought Anura ashore. ""I prayed for it, but I didn't believe it would come,"" he says ""Everybody helped me - all the Sri Lankans."" For Captain Leotta - who had the final say - it was another first in a journey full of them. ""We were proud of him,"" he says. ""He really did the impossible to get off the ship."" As it turned out, Anura wasn't the only one to get off in Colombo. A 75-year-old German woman, who needed urgent (non-Covid) care, was also taken ashore and, sadly, later died. As for Anura, he is still in quarantine at the naval centre in Boossa, but hopes to see his mother in Kandy soon. This video can not be played The cruise ship cancellations have led to cleaner canals in Venice As it pulls into Marseille on Monday, the Magnifica will be one of three cruises still sailing with passengers, the Cruise Lines International Association says. The other two are also due to disembark today: the Pacific Princess in Los Angeles, and the Costa Deliziosa in Barcelona (it will also drop off passengers in Genoa afterwards). For Andy Gerber, who turned 70 in Sydney harbour, life on board ""the last cruise ship on Earth"" has been enjoyable, despite the lack of shore visits. ""There is still plenty to do if you want,"" he says. ""Gym, games, shows, dance classesâ¦ ""We have two pools and perfect weather, plenty to eat and drink, and we have made a lot of friends - especially during all these sea days."" A Facebook forum is also upbeat. Covid-19 never reached the Magnifica and neither, it seems, did cabin fever. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak While there are some complaints - mainly about other passengers - there are plenty of pictures of singing and dancing. A picture of one performance on 10 April is captioned: ""Maybe this is the only theatre in the world still open."" And - despite it all - the man at the helm also has happy memories of his truncated tour. ""We found ourselves [globally] in a situation where Covid-19 has been isolating people, and distancing people,"" says Captain Leotta. ""Here was the opposite. We became like a family - our guests and our crew together. The spirit has been beautiful."" But what of the cruise industry? Can it recover from the bad press, the cancelled bookings, and all the other problems Covid-19 brought? ""We will return to cruising, and we will return better prepared than before with more experience. We are learning a lot, we will be there stronger than ever before."" Will we ever cruise again?

UK donates Â£20m to speed up coronavirus vaccine,"This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine The government has donated Â£20 million towards a break-neck plan to produce a vaccine to combat the deadly new coronavirus. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the money would help the UK lead the way indeveloping a new inoculation. It comes as the death toll in China increased to 361 with the total number of cases there now above 17,000. Meanwhile 11 Britons flown back from Wuhan - the outbreak's epicentre - have begun two weeks in quarantine. The additional evacuees -who travelled from China via France- joined 83 people already in group isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The government's Â£20m investment will go to CEPI - the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations - a global body aiming to fast-track a vaccine within six to eight months.

Speaking on her third day in quarantine, she said she had ""some interaction"" with the others in her flat. ""People go [to the lobby] to collect things and also pick up food and some people will stand having their food together, but all wearing masks,"" she said.

Nick Triggle - BBC Health correspondent The number of new deaths announced â 449 â is the lowest for two weeks. Last week the figures were hovering between 700 and 900, before dropping below 600 on Sunday. That is, of course, good news. Although the figures for the past two days should be treated with caution. They cover the weekend and we know reporting and recording delays can mean figures drop before rising again. But the falls are big enough to suggest we may soon start seeing the number of new deaths coming down. The numbers in hospital with coronavirus have already started dropping gradually so the signs are there that we are beginning to turn the corner. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Daniel Tomlinson, an economist at the Resolution Foundation, says since the job retention scheme launched this morning, one million employees have been uploaded onto the government system. ""This is an incredibly important scheme,"" he says. The economist points to estimates indicating around eight million people could be furloughed and put on the job retention scheme across the UK. He adds unemployment may still reach three million, but it would have risen to ""astronomical levels"" without the scheme. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More than 140,000 firms have applied for grants. from the UK government's job retention scheme opened today, RIshi Sunak says. The grants they receive will help pay the wages of more than a million people, he promises, as the government aims to keep as many people as possible in their existing jobs. HMRC chief executive Jim Harra earlier told the BBC's Today programmethat employers had made 67,000 job claimsin the first 30 minutes. UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak The UK's Chancellor Rishi Sunak says he wants to address the issue of PPE - which the government has been criticised on in recent days. He says it is an âinternational challengeâ for all countries. The government is working hard to get the PPE NHS staff need, he says, and receiving shipments of PPE regularly. He also says the government is ""working to resolve the Turkish shipment following unexpected delays"" -more on that here. And today the UK has ""unloaded 140,000 gowns from Myanmar"". He says they are continuing to pursue âevery possible optionâ for procurement. Â© 2025 BBC.

Job protection furlough scheme goes live,"More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"". ""It is not my current company's fault - they want to help us as much as they can - it's the government that is ignoring us."" On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that the wage subsidy schemewould be extended by a further month, until the end of June. The move came afterthe government confirmed that lockdown restrictions in the UK would continuefor ""at least"" another three weeks. Mr Harra declined to predict how much the scheme would cost. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated a price tag of Â£42bn, but that was before the government extended the scheme by a month. He said he was confident that HMRC could cope with the demand for the scheme. ""We have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims that we could receive - there are well over two million Pay-As-You-Earn schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those."" It's a massive feat of engineering, an unprecedented reverse plumbing of the tax system. Instead of sucking money out of millions of paypackets, HMRC is pumping cash in to throw companies and employees a lifeline. The early signs are promising - calls answered, online forms submitted. But now the hard work - to get the money in place for payday - starts. HMRC says funds should be available within six days. The intervening time is used to check firms are playing by the rules - not illicitly claiming for imaginary employees, for example. But the head of the tax office has admitted they won't catch every fraudulent case; there has to be a trade-off between speed and compliance. The smooth start will be a relief to Rishi Sunak, the scheme's architect . But what of those who started jobs after 28 February? Also, he's already extended the length of the scheme once - will he have to do that again, and at what cost? And, as Denmark has done, might he consider withholding help to companies registered in tax havens? With the amount he's already had to tackle, it's easy to forget Mr Sunak has been chancellor for less than three months - but several questions remain. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""With April's payday approaching, it is essential that the application process is smooth and that payments are made as soon as possible. ""Any delay would exacerbate the cash crisis many companies are facing and could threaten jobs and businesses,"" he added. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the government will cover 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per worker, per month before tax. Bosses will pay workers and reclaim the money from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online after the service goes live on 20 April. The minimum amount of time that an employee can be furloughed is three weeks, and firms are not expected to start receiving money until at least the end of April. What does it mean if I have been furloughed by work? According to new research by the Resolution Foundation, the take-up of the scheme has been higher than initially anticipated. It estimates that eight million workers could be furloughed over the coming weeks. It found that those working in low-paid sectors - such as hospitality or retail - are worst-affected, with almost half of the workforce expected to be put on paid leave. Daniel Tomlinson, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The government's welcome Job Retention Scheme is what stands between Britain experiencing high unemployment over the coming months, and catastrophic depression-era levels of long-term joblessness. ""It is proving particularly essential in big, low-paying sectors like hospitality and retail, where around half the workforce are no longer working."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

""Rolling out the job retention scheme will make a huge difference to tens of thousands of firms and millions of people, protecting jobs and living standards throughout the UK,"" she said.

"'Low confidence' over arrival of PPE from TurkeySome hospital trusts are already short of protective gowns, according to NHS Providers.UK","An RAF aircraft has departed the UK for Turkey to pick up a delayed delivery of protective kit amid a row over a shortage in the NHS. The plane left at around 17:00 BST on Monday to collect 400,000 gowns. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the daily No 10 briefing the government was working ""around the clock"" to address the lack of protective gear. It comes as another 449 coronavirus deaths were recorded in UK hospitals, taking the total number to 16,509. But the number of new confirmed infections was ""flattening out"", the UK's deputy chief scientific adviser, Prof Dame Angela Maclean, told the briefing. Meanwhile,more than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage billthrough the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday morning. What protective gear do NHS staff need? 'Enormous strain' on protective kit for NHS Minute's silence for NHS virus death staff The row over a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the NHS has intensified over the last few days. This video can not be played ""Are you ashamed?"" â BBC News health editor Hugh Pym challenges Chancellor Rishi Sunak over PPE Doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers complain that a lack of adequate kit such as gowns, masks and gloves puts them at increased risk of catching coronavirus and of spreading it to their patients. The children of Josiane Ekoli, a nurse from Leeds who died after contracting the disease, said on Monday that her death could have been prevented ""if they gave my mum the proper equipmentin the first place"". Speaking in Downing Street, Mr Sunak said the shortage of PPE was ""uppermost"" in people's minds and the government would ""pursue every possible option"" to secure more PPE. He said ministers were trying to resolve problems around the consignment, which had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but was hit by ""unexpected"" delays. However, he said there were regular shipments expected from other sources, and cited a delivery of 140,000 gowns from Myanmar. Mr Sunak said: ""We're improving our sourcing internationally and domestically to make sure we can get the PPE we need in what is a very challenging international context. ""But people on the front line can rest assured that we're doing absolutely everything we can, and straining everything we can, to get the equipment they need."" The Ministry of Defence confirmed that the first of three expected RAF transport aircraft departed from Brize Norton for Turkey on Monday. This video can not be played Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital show how health care workers put on PPE Earlier, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said there was ""no doubt"" some hospital trusts were already experiencing shortages of the gowns. He said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome, NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day. Mr Hopson also said too much focus should not be placed on individual consignments. He gave the example of an expected consignment of 200,000 gowns from China, which turned out to be 20,000 gowns when it arrived last week. Downing Street said the government had now delivered one billion pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline staff. Speaking at the government briefing, Public Health England's medical director Prof Yvonne Doyle said a lack of PPE was ""a concern"". However, she denied that PPE guidance had been downgraded based on availability of equipment rather than safety standards, Public Health England changed its advice on Fridayto allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". Prof Doyle said: ""The guidance remains exactly the same. And that is a very precautionary set of advice - it's quite the opposite to putting people at risk because there aren't enough supplies. ""It's trying to ensure that people are well secured and safe when there may not be enough supplies, and it also stresses how important it is not to take risks."" Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland currently had ""adequate stocks"" of all the main items of PPE but gowns were one of the items ""under most pressure"". The owner of a healthcare service in Hampshire providing care to people in their own home said PPE was the ""biggest challenge"" her organisation faced. Alice Ushumba said she was struggling to get hold of enough masks, and that some staff had resigned because they didn't feel safe with the protective equipment available. ""We're going into people's houses who might have Covid but we don't have anything to protect ourselves except perhaps a little plastic apron and gloves,"" she told BBC Radio 4's World at One. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The latest UK death total of 449 was the lowest daily figure announced since 6 April. The new figures also showed that the number of new infections - 4,676 - was the lowest for four days. Prof Maclean told the daily briefing that infections in the UK were ""flattening out"", and that the number of patients in hospitals in London had fallen for seven consecutive days. She added she hoped the fall would be ""replicated"" across the UK. The number of new deaths announced - 449 - is the lowest for two weeks. Last week the figures were hovering between 700 and 900, before dropping below 600 on Sunday. That is, of course, good news. Although the figures for the past two days should be treated with caution.

But the falls are big enough to suggest we may soon start seeing the number of new deaths coming down. The numbers in hospital with coronavirus have already started dropping gradually so the signs are there that we are beginning to turn the corner. Mr Sunak said there were ""encouraging signs we are making progress"" in tackling the virus but added that the lockdown restrictions needed to remain in place. He reiterated the government's message that the UK needed to meet five tests set down last week before exiting the lockdown - which include increasing testing in the community, and being certain there was no risk of a second peak. ""We are not there yet and it is very clear that, for now, what we should focus on is following the guidance, staying home to protect the NHS,"" he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told colleagues his concerns that relaxing lockdown measures too sooncould lead to a second outbreak of coronavirus. He is understood to have had a video call with his deputy, Dominic Raab, on Friday to discuss the crisis.

"Millions to claim as government job site goes liveThe Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme will cover 80% of workers' monthly wages up to Â£2,500.Business","More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"".

Government unveils Â£1.3bn scheme to help start-ups,"The government has announced a Â£1.25bn package to support innovative new companies that are not eligible for existing coronavirus rescue schemes. It will match up to Â£250m of private investment and add Â£550m to an existing loan and grant scheme for smaller firms that focus on research and development. Adding it up, that totals Â£800m of new money to support fledgling firms. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said start-ups would help power the UK's growth after the coronavirus crisis. ""This new, world-leading fund will mean they can access the capital they need at this difficult time, ensuring dynamic, fast-growing firms across all sectors will be able to continue to create new ideas and spread prosperity,"" he said. Newly-founded companies often lose money in their early years, which makes them ineligible for the government's emergency loan scheme. But it also makes them a risky investment. It took some of the world's most well known and valuable firms - including Amazon and Tesla - years to turn a profit. Uber is yet to make any profit at all. However, the government is keen to ensure that the economic impact of the coronovirus does not kill off some of the UK's fastest growing and most innovative companies. Nevertheless, the rescue package comes with strings attached. To qualify to receive the government money, a company must have raised Â£250,000 privately in the last five years. On top of that, any money put in by the government must be matched by private investors. And, if the money is not repaid, the government will take an ownership stake in the company. The package has been broadly welcomed by the entrepreneur community but some have warned that - as with other coronavirus support mechanisms - complexity is the enemy of speed. And it's speed that is all important. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay and wages LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health As of last week, just over Â£1bn in government-backed loans had been approved out of a total support package of Â£330bn. Under the scheme, the government guarantees 80% of each of the loans, which are issued by banks. But many firms have complained that those banks have been slow to lend cash because they would be left to cover 20% of losses on loans that cannot be repaid. That has put pressure on the Treasury to increase the government guarantee to 100% to accelerate the approval process. Treasury officials have raised the spectre of widespread abuse of the programme if the government were to fully guarantee all loans to coronavirus-affected companies. But the Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey, has said that increasing the government guarantee would make the process ""less complicated"". And a former senior Treasury official, who did not want to be named, warned that Mr Sunak's department was trying to be ""too clever by half"", a tacit admission - perhaps - that in a time of economic crisis, there is no such thing as a blunt instrument. Meanwhile, the head of the International Monetary Fund, Kristilan Georgieva, told the BBC that governments around the world should pay out money as fast as possible but, she said, ""keep the receipts"".

US oil prices drop to 21-year low as demand dries upCoronavirus downturn has put major pressure on oil prices with demand slumping and storage running out.Business,"The price of US oil has turned negative for the first time in history. That means oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands over fears that storage capacity could run out in May. Demand for oil has all but dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. As a result, oil firms have resorted to renting tankers to store the surplus supply and that has forced the price of US oil into negative territory. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Record deal to cut oil output ends price war Coronavirus: Who is still flying? Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping ""This is off-the-charts wacky,"" said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""The demand shock was so massive that it's overwhelmed anything that people could have expected."" The severe drop on Monday was driven in part by a technicality of the global oil market. Oil is traded on its future price and May futures contracts are due to expire on Tuesday. Traders were keen to offload those holdings to avoid having to take delivery of the oil and incur storage costs. June prices for WTI were also down, but trading at above $20 per barrel. Meanwhile, Brent Crude - the benchmark used by Europe and the rest of the world, which is already trading based on June contracts - was also weaker, down 8.9% at less than $26 a barrel. Mr Glickman said the historic reversal in pricing was a reminder of the strains facing the oil market and warned that June prices could also fall, if lockdowns remain in place. ""I'm really not optimistic about the prospects for oil companies or oil prices,"" he said. OGUK, the business lobby for the UK's offshore oil and gas sector, said the negative price of US oil would affect firms operating in the North Sea. ""The dynamics of this US market are different from those directly driving UK produced Brent but we will not escape the impact,"" said OGUK boss Deirdre Michie. ""Ours is not just a trading market; every penny lost spells more uncertainty over jobs,"" she said. The oil industry has been struggling with both tumbling demand and in-fighting among producers about reducing output. Earlier this month, Opec members and its allies finally agreed a record deal to slash global output by about 10%. The deal was the largest cut in oil production ever to have been agreed. But many analysts say the cuts were not big enough to make a difference. ""It hasn't taken long for the market to recognise that the Opec+ deal will not, in its present form, be enough to balance oil markets,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at Axicorp. The leading exporters - Opec and allies such as Russia - have already agreed to cut production by a record amount. In the United States and elsewhere, oil-producing businesses have made commercial decisions to cut output. But still the world has more crude oil than it can use. And it's not just about whether we can use it. It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products. Capacity is filling fast on land and at sea. As that process continues it's likely to bear down further on prices. It will take a recovery in demand to really turn the market round and that will depend on how the health crisis unfolds. There will be further supply cuts as private sector producers respond to the low prices, but it's hard to see that being on a sufficient scale to have a fundamental impact on the market. For US drivers, the decline in oil prices - which have fallen by about two-thirds since the start of the year - has had an impact at the pumps, albeit not as dramatic as Monday's decline might suggest. ""The silver lining is, if you for various reason actually need to be on the roads, you're filling up for far less than you would have been even four months ago,"" Mr Glickman said. ""The problem for most of us is even if you could fill up, where are you going to go?"" US President Donald Trump has said the government will buy oil for the country's national reserve. But concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity, with stockpiles at Cushing, the main delivery point in the US for oil, rising almost 50% since the start of March, according to ANZ Bank. Mr Innes said: ""It's a dump at all cost as no one, and I mean no one, wants delivery of oil with Cushing storage facilities filling by the minute.""

"Disney stops paying 100,000 workers during downturnEntertainment giant Disney will stop paying nearly half its workforce as it battles virus shutdowns.Business","Walt Disney will stop paying more than 100,000 employees from this week as it struggles with coronavirus closures. The world's biggest entertainment group operates theme parks and hotels in the US, Europe and Asia. Stopping pay for almost half of its workforce will save Disney up to $500m (Â£400m) a month, according to the Financial Times. Disney made operating income of $1.4bn for its parks, experiences and products in the last three months of 2019. The company said it will provide full healthcare benefits for staff placed on unpaid leave and urged its US employees to apply for government benefits through the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package.Â Disney Plus racks up 50m subscribers in five months US jobless claims surge for third week Why Bob Iger's Disney departure is a big deal The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits has been surging since its national lockdown, rising above six million. Protesters have taken to the streets in the US, demanding the reopening of economies. The travel and leisure sectors were the first to be hit financially from coronavirus shutdowns. Airlines have been struggling to survive with many asking for financial assistance from governments. But Disney's fortunes for its online streaming site Disney Plus are much better, with more than 50m subscribers in just five months since it was launched. Last month Walt Disney said its executive chairman Bob Iger would give up his entire salary during the pandemic while chief executive Bob Chapek will take a 50% pay cut. Mr Iger is one of highest paid executives in the entertainment sector, earning $47.5m last year as chairman and chief executive. When the theme parks reopen, Mr Iger has forecast that temperature checks of visitors could become part of its normal routine along with bag checks.

In the United States and elsewhere, oil-producing businesses have made commercial decisions to cut output. But still the world has more crude oil than it can use. And it's not just about whether we can use it. It's also about whether we can store it until the lockdowns are eased enough to generate some additional demand for oil products. Capacity is filling fast on land and at sea. As that process continues it's likely to bear down further on prices. It will take a recovery in demand to really turn the market round and that will depend on how the health crisis unfolds. There will be further supply cuts as private sector producers respond to the low prices, but it's hard to see that being on a sufficient scale to have a fundamental impact on the market. For US drivers, the decline in oil prices - which have fallen by about two-thirds since the start of the year - has had an impact at the pumps, albeit not as dramatic as Monday's decline might suggest. ""The silver lining is, if you for various reason actually need to be on the roads, you're filling up for far less than you would have been even four months ago,"" Mr Glickman said. ""The problem for most of us is even if you could fill up, where are you going to go?"" US President Donald Trump has said the government will buy oil for the country's national reserve. But concern continues to mount that storage facilities in the US will run out of capacity, with stockpiles at Cushing, the main delivery point in the US for oil, rising almost 50% since the start of March, according to ANZ Bank. Mr Innes said: ""It's a dump at all cost as no one, and I mean no one, wants delivery of oil with Cushing storage facilities filling by the minute.""

"Disney stops paying 100,000 workers during downturn","Walt Disney will stop paying more than 100,000 employees from this week as it struggles with coronavirus closures. The world's biggest entertainment group operates theme parks and hotels in the US, Europe and Asia. Stopping pay for almost half of its workforce will save Disney up to $500m (Â£400m) a month, according to the Financial Times. Disney made operating income of $1.4bn for its parks, experiences and products in the last three months of 2019. The company said it will provide full healthcare benefits for staff placed on unpaid leave and urged its US employees to apply for government benefits through the $2tn coronavirus stimulus package.Â Disney Plus racks up 50m subscribers in five months US jobless claims surge for third week Why Bob Iger's Disney departure is a big deal The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits has been surging since its national lockdown, rising above six million. Protesters have taken to the streets in the US, demanding the reopening of economies. The travel and leisure sectors were the first to be hit financially from coronavirus shutdowns. Airlines have been struggling to survive with many asking for financial assistance from governments. But Disney's fortunes for its online streaming site Disney Plus are much better, with more than 50m subscribers in just five months since it was launched. Last month Walt Disney said its executive chairman Bob Iger would give up his entire salary during the pandemic while chief executive Bob Chapek will take a 50% pay cut. Mr Iger is one of highest paid executives in the entertainment sector, earning $47.5m last year as chairman and chief executive. When the theme parks reopen, Mr Iger has forecast that temperature checks of visitors could become part of its normal routine along with bag checks.

Millions to claim as government job site goes live,"More than 140,000 firms have applied for help to pay their wage bill through the government's job retention scheme, which went live on Monday. The programme funds 80% of workers' wages, up to Â£2,500 a month, if they are put on leave. Speaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the money would help pay the wages of more than a million people. But many more than that are expected to be ""furloughed"" due to the lockdown. The Treasury said the system can process up to 450,000 applications an hour. Employers should receive the money within six working days of making an application, it said. The chancellor said the scheme would help people who could have lost their jobs if they had not been furloughed. Employers had made 67,000 job claims within half an hour of the system going live at 08:00, HMRC chief executive Jim Harra told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Harra said: ""The big payroll date this month is on the 30th, so employers can claim anytime today, tomorrow or on Wednesday, and there's time to get that money into their account for the 30th of April."" Mike Cherry, the national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses said the system had ""held up"" under the weight of applications, adding that employers had generally found it straightforward to submit the information required. ""Of course this is only day one,"" he said. ""The real mark of success for this scheme will be money in employer back accounts by the end of the month."" Jenna Sanders, 35, from Manchester has missed out on the furlough scheme because she started her job too late. The airline flight attendant began her role on 9 March, so missed the original cut-off date of 28 February. The government then said it was extending the scheme to anyone who had started by 19 March. ""But the small print stated that your employer had to have made a 'Real Time Information' submission to HMRC by that date,"" Jenna says. ""That is only ever done two days before you get paid, and I get paid at the end of the month, so I am still in this no man's land."" Her previous employer, Thomas Cook, cannot furlough her because it went bust last year. And while her current employer has kept her on on unpaid leave, she feels ""massively let down"". ""It is not my current company's fault - they want to help us as much as they can - it's the government that is ignoring us."" On Friday, Mr Sunak announced that the wage subsidy schemewould be extended by a further month, until the end of June. The move came afterthe government confirmed that lockdown restrictions in the UK would continuefor ""at least"" another three weeks. Mr Harra declined to predict how much the scheme would cost. Last week, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated a price tag of Â£42bn, but that was before the government extended the scheme by a month. He said he was confident that HMRC could cope with the demand for the scheme. ""We have scaled our IT system to cope with the maximum number of claims that we could receive - there are well over two million Pay-As-You-Earn schemes and our system is big enough to handle a claim from every one of those."" It's a massive feat of engineering, an unprecedented reverse plumbing of the tax system. Instead of sucking money out of millions of paypackets, HMRC is pumping cash in to throw companies and employees a lifeline. The early signs are promising - calls answered, online forms submitted. But now the hard work - to get the money in place for payday - starts. HMRC says funds should be available within six days. The intervening time is used to check firms are playing by the rules - not illicitly claiming for imaginary employees, for example. But the head of the tax office has admitted they won't catch every fraudulent case; there has to be a trade-off between speed and compliance. The smooth start will be a relief to Rishi Sunak, the scheme's architect . But what of those who started jobs after 28 February? Also, he's already extended the length of the scheme once - will he have to do that again, and at what cost? And, as Denmark has done, might he consider withholding help to companies registered in tax havens? With the amount he's already had to tackle, it's easy to forget Mr Sunak has been chancellor for less than three months - but several questions remain. Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""With April's payday approaching, it is essential that the application process is smooth and that payments are made as soon as possible. ""Any delay would exacerbate the cash crisis many companies are facing and could threaten jobs and businesses,"" he added. Under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, the government will cover 80% of workers' wages, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per worker, per month before tax. Bosses will pay workers and reclaim the money from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online after the service goes live on 20 April. The minimum amount of time that an employee can be furloughed is three weeks, and firms are not expected to start receiving money until at least the end of April. What does it mean if I have been furloughed by work? According to new research by the Resolution Foundation, the take-up of the scheme has been higher than initially anticipated. It estimates that eight million workers could be furloughed over the coming weeks. It found that those working in low-paid sectors - such as hospitality or retail - are worst-affected, with almost half of the workforce expected to be put on paid leave. Daniel Tomlinson, economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The government's welcome Job Retention Scheme is what stands between Britain experiencing high unemployment over the coming months, and catastrophic depression-era levels of long-term joblessness. ""It is proving particularly essential in big, low-paying sectors like hospitality and retail, where around half the workforce are no longer working."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WILL I GET PAID IF I CAN'T WORK?Rules on sick pay and wages LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health High Street chains such as Oasis and Warehouse, as well as fast food firms KFC and McDonald's, have all furloughed staff as their work has come to a standstill under lockdown. Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI business lobby group, welcomed the launch of the online application service for firms. ""Rolling out the job retention scheme will make a huge difference to tens of thousands of firms and millions of people, protecting jobs and living standards throughout the UK,"" she said. ""Ensuring support gets to where it's needed most - fast - is of the utmost importance."" Is your company applying for the furlough scheme?

Asda cancels orders with clothing suppliersSome suppliers are reportedly angry that the supermarket chain's clothing range is still on sale.,"Asda is cancelling a quarter of orders with clothing suppliers despite seeing record food sales during the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket chain has also told suppliers that it would only pay for part of such cancelled orders. A spokesperson for the supermarket said that Covid-19 had ""had a significant impact"" on the fashion industry. According to reports in the Sunday Times,external, the move has angered suppliers as the range is still on sale. One supplier told the newspaper that the ""behaviour is totally unacceptable"". They added that it was ""ridiculous"" for the firm, which is owned by US retailer Walmart, ""not to pay for orders"". Government extends furlough scheme to pay staff Green's retail empire could close over 100 stores Asda told the BBC that suppliers will be paid 30% of the order value for those that have not yet been finished, and half for those that have. That rises to 60% for manufacturers based in Bangladesh. It has committed to paying the costs within seven working days, as well as agreeing suppliers can resell items or donate them to charity. ""We have longstanding and valued relationships with our suppliers, and want to help them weather this crisis,"" the Asda spokesperson added. The move comes as the chain has seen a surge in demand for groceries as UK consumers are staying at home amid lockdown measures. The supermarket says its warehouse and in-store colleagues are focused on ""getting food onto our shelves for essential retail"". Asda recently launched a recruitment drive for 5,000 temporary staff in an attempt to keep up with demand Meanwhile it has invested in additional storage space for products that it says it is struggling to sell due to the coronavirus pandemic. The supermarket said that it had seen ""severe downturn in the demand for clothing"", along with disruption caused by factory closures. Other retailers such as Primark have recently opted to cancel orders with their suppliers too. High Street chain New Look informedits suppliers earlier this month that payment for stock already sitting in its shops or distribution centres would be delayed ""indefinitely"". Garment manufacturers based in Asia recently told the BBCthat they had seen unreasonable demands from big clients, mainly in the US and UK. ""Some brands are showing a true sense of partnership and high level of ethics in trying to ensure at least enough cash flow to pay workers,"" said Amit Mahtaney, the chief executive of Tusker Apparel Jordan. ""But we've also experienced demands for cancellations for goods that are ready or are work in progress, or discounts for outstanding payments and for goods in transit. They are also asking for a 30 to 120-day extensions on previously agreed payment terms."" After growing criticism, some brands such as H&M and Zara-owner Inditex committed to pay in full for existing orders from clothing manufacturers. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"Harry and Meghan plan to freeze out tabloidsThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex accuse popular newspapers of publishing ""salacious gossip"" for clicks.UK","The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have told the UK's tabloid press they are ending all co-operation with them.Â In a letter to editors of all the Sun, Mirror, Mail and Express titles and websites, a representative said the pair had taken the step due to ""distorted, false or invasive"" stories. Harry and Meghan said they refused to ""offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion"". The couple have relocated to California after stepping back as senior royals. In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together Royal Family tree and line of succession How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life In the letter, the couple's public relations representative wrote it was ""gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media"" has printed ""distorted, false or invasive"" articles. ""There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society,"" the letter said. ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they know - as well as complete strangers - have their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue."" The BBC was told that the letter had been sent to the editors of the Sun, the Daily Mail, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express newspapers. The new policy will apply to the four newspapers, their Sunday editions and associated websites,the Guardian's media editor Jim Waterson reported,external. The Daily Star, which was not specifically mentioned, is published by the same group that publishes the Mirror and Express titles. The ban on engagement with the papers will mean that the couple's PR team will no longer even answer calls from the papers asking them to confirm whether claims made about the couple are true or not. Outlining the new policy of ""no corroboration and zero engagement"" with all the publications that received it, the letter said the measure would also protect the couple's communications team ""from the side of the industry that readers never see"". ""This policy is not about avoiding criticism,"" the letter continued. ""It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie."" Prince Harry has spoken in the past of seeing - as a young child - the effect media intrusion had on his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales The letter said the couple will continue to work with other media and ""young, up-and-coming journalists"" to raise awareness of the issues and causes they care about. Why the Royal Family rarely go to court Meghan's father 'would testify in privacy case' Meghan sues Mail on Sunday over private letter In recent days, photographs of the Sussexes delivering food to vulnerable people in Los Angeles have been published by two of the newspapers to receive the letter. And it comes ahead of a court hearing this week ina legal case Meghan has brought against the publisher of the Mail on Sundayover the publication of a letter written to the duchess by her estranged father. The couple officially stepped back as senior working members of the Royal Family at the end of March as part of a transition followingan announcement of their intention to become financially independent in January.. As The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now settle into the next chapter of their lives and no longer receive any publicly funded support, we are writing to set a new media relations policy, specifically as it pertains to your organisation. Like you, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe that a free press is a cornerstone to any democracyâ particularly in moments of crisis. At its best, this free press shines light on dark places, telling stories that would otherwise go untold, standing up for what's right, challenging power, and holding those who abuse the system to account. It has been said that journalism's first obligation is to the truth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex agree wholeheartedly. It is gravely concerning that an influential slice of the media, over many years, has sought to insulate themselves from taking accountability for what they say or printâeven when they know it to be distorted, false, or invasive beyond reason. When power is enjoyed without responsibility, the trust we all place in this much-needed industry is degraded. There is a real human cost to this way of doing business and it affects every corner of society. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have watched people they knowâas well as complete strangersâhave their lives completely pulled apart for no good reason, other than the fact that salacious gossip boosts advertising revenue. With that said, please note that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will not be engaging with your outlet. There will be no corroboration and zero engagement. This is also a policy being instated for their communications team, in order to protect that team from the side of the industry that readers never see. This policy is not about avoiding criticism. It's not about shutting down public conversation or censoring accurate reporting. Media have every right to report on and indeed have an opinion on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, good or bad. But it can't be based on a lie. They also want to be very clear: this is not in any way a blanket policy for all media. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to working with journalists and media organisations all over the world, engaging with grassroots media, regional and local media, and young, up-and-coming journalists, to spotlight issues and causes that so desperately need acknowledging. And they look forward to doing whatever they can to help further opportunities for more diverse and underrepresented voices, who are needed now more than ever. What they won't do is offer themselves up as currency for an economy of click bait and distortion. We are encouraged that this new approach will be heard and respected.

Collins, Martha Buckley, Matt Cannon, Lucy Webster, Max Matza, Helier Cheung, Ritu Prasad and Jude Sheerin. Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Washington As with the furore over ventilators, so with the furore over testing. That was President Trumpâs theme today, first on his Twitter account and then at the White House briefing.""It used to be ventilators, ventilators, ventilators,"" he said. ""Now itâs testing, testing, testing.""Trump has accused the ""Do Nothing Democrats"" of playing a ""dangerous political game"" by insisting there is a shortage of tests for coronavirus.But governors from both parties have insistently called for more federal help in order to do the testing necessary before they can ease up on stay-at-home orders.Trump told us their demands for tests was overblown, just as it had been in the case of ventilators.""Nobody that needed a ventilator didnât get one,"" he said, declaring that the governors already had tremendous testing capacity in their states about which they didnât know: ""hundreds and hundreds of laboratories"" and thousands of pieces of equipment available at federal locations. The president brought up experts and officials to fill in the details for us and lay out the maps of where these supplies are located.But for him the bottom line was political. He claimed that ""they"" â presumably the Do Nothing Democrats â didnât ""catch him"" on ventilators and so thought theyâd ""get him"" on testing. Quoting an apocryphal story about US Founding Father George Washington confessing to chopping down a cherry tree as a boy, Trump tells the White House briefing room: ""I cannot tell a lie."" He made the comment as he called on a journalist whom he had earlier promised could ask a question. Moments later, Trump said: ""I haven't left the White House in months.â A PBS reporter said: âYou held a rally in March.â Trump shrugs: âDid I hold a rally? Iâm sorry, I held a rally!â Marianna BradyBBC News On 26 March, Chicago stopped for a moment of gratitude: People took to their balconies, porches and rooftops, cheering and ringing bells in the dark winter night. The applause was for the healthcare workers, first responders and service-industry employees on the frontlines of the pandemic who were risking their lives every day to save people from the virus wreaking havoc around the world. But for hospital cleaner Candice Martinez, the recognition of nurses and doctors has left her feeling empty. ""It's disappointing to me that us 'lower level employees' aren't getting any kind of recognition for what we are doing."" As an Environmental Services Worker at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Ms Martinez is responsible for cleaning the rooms while patients are in hospital or after they are discharged or moved. She is one of the thousands of essential employees in the city who still have to go to work despite the crisis. And one of the 12,571 cases of Covid-19 identified in Chicago. Read the full story here. Trump is asked why the governor of Maryland bought 500,000 testing kits from South Korea when the White House says the states have the ability to do all of the testing that they need. ""The governor of Maryland could have called Mike Pence. He could have saved a lot of money but that's OK,"" says Trump, pointing to a map of testing facilities in Maryland. ""I don't think he needed to go to South Korea. He needed to get a little knowledge,"" he adds. The White House has claimed that states have local laboratories that are capable of doing all the testing that they need. But states say that they are lacking the test kits themselves, rather than the labs in which to check them. Trump pledges to personally look into the case of a business owner who was denied a loan through coronavirus relief funds because of a criminal past. Fox News correspondent John Roberts tells the president he received an email from a man in the north-west who owns a supply business. He says he was refused a loan from the Small Business Administration because he has a non-violent felony from the past five years. As a result he has had to let go 50 employees, many of whom are former criminals trying to get back into society. Roberts queries why the businessman was denied a loan. Trump says: ""If you give me the name of the company and his name Iâll have that checked out, Iâll do that."" The president adds of small business funding, referring to his own company: ""I know I didn't get any."" Natalie ShermanNew York business reporter Oil prices turned negative on Monday as economies on coronavirus lockdowns around the world cause a historic drop in energy demand. The cost of the US oil benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, for a barrel to be delivered in May plunged to a price of roughly negative $37, as sellers took a loss rather than pay for storage costs. The price of oil for June was also down, though trading higher, at above $20 per barrel, while Brent crude â the other major benchmark - fell more than 7% to about $26 per barrel. The falls come as analysts expect oil demand to contract to levels last seen in 1995, as businesses around the world remain shut and many people remain at home. The International Monetary Fund has predicted the global economy could contract by 3% this year, as coronavirus restrictions bring activity to a halt. Last month, as the rules took hold in Europe and the US, business surveys showed record-setting declines in orders and output in many countries. For its part, the World Trade Organization has warned that global trade could fall by up to a third this year - more than double the 12.5% drop in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Even a recent deal among major oil producers to cut supply by record levels has failed to ease the glut. Since the start of the year, energy prices have fallen by more than 60%. Asked about the sub-zero oil prices, Trump says that short-sellers are to blame. ""Much of it has to do with short sellers. A lot of people got caught,"" says Trump. ""And there are a lot of people not too happy because they got caught.â He calls the record-low prices ""more of a financial thing than an oil situation"". It's ""largely a financial squeeze"", he adds. The current cost oil is negative $37 per barrel, Trump says, noting that he expects the price to jump back up soon. As well as Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina (which we told you about earlier), here's how some other states are planning to relax lockdown rules: Facebook has said it will remove pages and events involved in the organisation of protests that violate state laws on social distancing in the US during the pandemic. The company said it has already removed the promotion of anti-lockdown events in California, New Jersey and Nebraska after consultation with state governments. Protests against coronavirus lockdowns were held in states across the US on Sunday. Hundreds of protesters flouted social-distancing guidelines in defiance of restrictions intended to stem the spread of coronavirus and save lives. Similar events that âdefy governmentâs guidance on social distancing arenât allowed on Facebookâ, a spokesman said on Monday. Appearing on ABCâs Good Morning America on Monday, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was asked whether the organisation of anti-lockdown protests on the platform amounted to âharmful misinformationâ. âWe do classify that as harmful misinformation and we take that down,"" Zuckerberg said, adding that debates about policy would not be stifled. The removal of events has provoked a backlash from conservatives, among them Donald Trump Jr, who accused Facebook of quashing free speech. The US president has expressed support for the protests, suggesting âsome governors have gone too farâ in placing restrictions on life. Washingon state, once the US epicentre, saw one of the biggest protests this weekend Across the country, some groups of Americans are taking to the streets in protest of lockdown orders aimed at limiting the spread of Covid-19. The demonstrations come amid 782,159 confirmed Covid-19 cases nationwide and 41,816 deaths. Numbers are still rising, though infection rates appear to be slowing in some regions. But protesters in more than a dozen states say the stay-at-home measures imposed by state governments to control the spread of coronavirus are an overreaction. As one militia leader in Illinois put it to the BBC: ""Re-open my state or we will re-open it ourselves."" Protests have varied in size across the country - from a few dozen protesters in Virginia and Oregon to rallies of thousands in Michigan and Washington state. Read the full story here. Trump asks Army Corp of Engineer General Todd Semonite to provide an update on the southern US border wall. Semonite had been speaking about the military's effort to build field hospitals at population centres around the US when Trump asked ""how about the wall?"" He then asked the general to speak on ""the quality of that wall in terms of its power for stopping people that shouldn't be coming into our country"". Trump has claimed the wall will help prevent infections from entering the US - however, health experts have pointed out that there are already outbreaks occurring in every state. Many of the initial coronavirus cases in the US were linked to people travelling from China or Europe. Construction of the wall has continued during the pandemic - but local residents in border towns in Arizona have said they fear the influx of construction workers could spread the virus. In response to Trump, Semonite said ""construction is going very, very smooth"", adding that 164 miles have been built as of today. As he leaves the briefing, he adds: ""I have a lot of building to do."" Trump says New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is going to visit him in the Oval Office tomorrow afternoon, and that he'll be joined by ""some of his people"". ""We look forward to that,"" the president adds. Cuomo and Trump have previously gone back and forth over each other's responses to the outbreak. During Cuomo's briefing a few days ago, Trump tweeted: ""Stop talking!"" President Trump now turns to the price of oil, which turned negative for the first time in history on Monday - meaning that oil producers are paying buyers to take the commodity off their hands, over fears that storage capacity could run out. The price of oil, Trump says, is âat a level thatâs very interesting to a lot of peopleâ. Trump says that, with the price plummeting, the US would seek to fill up its petroleum reserves. âWeâre filling up our national petroleum reserves, the strategic reserves. Weâre looking to put as much as 75 million barrels into the reserves. That would top it out,â he says. He expressed confidence that his administration can ""get it for the right price"". Demand for oil has dried up as lockdowns across the world have kept people inside. The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, fell as low as minus $37.63 a barrel. Trump says governors ""just don't understand"" how to carry out testing. It comes as governors complain that the federal government has not helped states get testing supplies from overseas. Trump says the Republican governor of Maryland Mike Hogan, and the Democratic governor of Illinois JB Pritzker, ""didnât understand too much what was going on"" with testing. He says Vice-President Mike Pence spoke on the phone with governors today to tell him about their ""tremendous capacity"" to do tests at local labs. Both governors have been critical of the federal response, and earlier today, Hogan attacked Trump for claiming that states had the testing capacity they needed in order to reopen. ""To try to push this off and say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing - that somehow we arenât doing our job, is just absolutely false,"" Hogan told MSNBC. On Tuesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the governmentâs top infectious disease expert, told AP news that the US did not yet have an adequate testing and tracing procedure in place to reopen the economy. President Donald Trump's daily briefing is starting now. He is joined by members of the coronavirus task force including senior co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx, and Vice-President Mike Pence.  Georgia's governor has announced that restaurants, hair salons, gyms, bowling alleys and some movie theaters will be allowed to reopen on Friday. It comes as the governor of Tennessee says that by 1 May the ""vast majority of businesses"" will be allowed to reopen. Meanwhile, the South Carolina governor has allowed residents to return to previously closed beaches starting on Tuesday. Non-essential retail businesses will also be allowed to reopen, as long as they can adhere to social distancing guidelines. The White House coronavirus task force briefing is due to begin imminently. It comes as anti-lockdown protests spread in the US, and Facebook bans anti-quarantine demonstrators from using the website to organise in-person gatherings. President Donald Trump also continues to be criticised by state governors for not doing enough to help provide testing equipment. On Monday, a governor from Trump's own Republican party said his Korean-speaking wife had arranged a sale of 500,000 test kits from a company in South Korea. The 2020 event would have marked the 50th anniversary of the NYC Pride March No events will be granted a permit in New York City in the month of June, meaning the 50th anniversary Pride parade is cancelled, as is the Puerto Rican Day Parade, celebrating its 63rd anniversary. The announcement was made by Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference earlier on Monday. De Blasio has heavily criticised the federal governmentâs handling of the outbreak in New York - the epicentre within the US. ""The absence of testing from day one never allowed us to fight this war the right way,"" he told MSNBC. ""If we had had testing in the beginning, we could have done a very intensive containment strategy."" We reported earlier that US oil prices have dropped into negative values for the first time in history. In this graph, you can see just how dramatic the price crash was. In practice, the negative dip means producers have resorted to paying buyers to take oil off their hands, as rapidly decreasing demand has led many producers to fear they'll run out of storage space by May.

'Enormous strain' on protective kit for NHSThe education secretary says a delayed delivery of protective equipment will now arrive on Monday.UK,"An ""enormous strain"" has been put on the system for obtaining protective kit for NHS staff and care workers, the education secretary has said. Some 400,000 gowns had been expected to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, but the government said it had been delayed. Gavin Williamson was asked by the BBC why British suppliers offering to make protective kit had not been contacted. He responded that government hoped to speak to them within the next 24 hours, and the gowns should arrive on Monday. ""I think we all recognise the enormous strain that has been placed on the whole system and we also recognise that right across the globe people are trying to get the same items of PPE from quite a limited number of suppliers,"" Mr Williamson said at the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. BBC Health editor Hugh Pym also asked why stocks had been allowed to run down over the last couple of years, and why more was not done to boost them in March and February. The education secretary said ""every resource of government"" had been deployed to expand supplies of PPE and ventilators. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries, meanwhile, said the UK remained an ""international exemplar"" of pandemic preparedness, adding there had been challenges but the government was ""always looking ahead"". 'Critical' to get protective kit to front line No date for when schools will reopen - Williamson Lifting lockdown requires 'balanced judgement' The pledge to take delivery of more protective kit came after warnings that some hospitals' intensive care units could run out of gowns this weekend. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, described the delay as ""very concerning"". ""Healthcare workers desperately need proper and effective protection now - by whatever means possible,"" he said, adding: ""This really is a matter of life and death."" Public Health England changed its advice on Friday to allow the NHS to re-use gowns if stock was running low, saying ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". It asked staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". The guidance also said hospitals could reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which were likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said for the guidance on the use of protective equipment to be properly followed, it was ""absolutely critical above everything else that we have the supplies of PPE going out to the front line"". But the Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. The delay to the consignment is a real worry, both in the short and long-term. It is clear the pandemic stocks we have been largely relying on to date are running out, at least in terms of gowns and visors. It has left us depending on international supply - certainly for gowns - as we do not seem to be able to manufacture them ourselves. Given the international demand for them, this threatens to be an on-going issue that could cause problems for months to come. Staff are understandably worried - they are putting their lives at risk. Ministers and their officials are clearly working hard to do what they can. But in the future, serious questions will need to be asked about why this situation has arisen in the first place. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the UK had built up stocks of PPE in expectation of a flu pandemic - as well as to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - but he said there was a ""worldwide pressure"" on supplies. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said ""serious mistakes have been made"" by the government in tackling the outbreak. He told Sky News: ""We know that our front-line NHS staff don't have the PPE, that they've been told this weekend that they won't necessarily have the gowns which are vital to keep them safe."" The government has appointed Lord Deighton, who headed the organising committee of the London Olympics, to resolve problems with supplies and distribution of PPE.

At the briefing, Trump also stressed that the coronavirus outbreak had shown that it was vital to bring ""supply chains"" and production back to the US - and not rely on imports in times of crisis. On Iran, the US president said he was willing to provide aid to Tehran to tackle the coronavirus, if the government of the Middle Eastern nation asked for it. In 2018, Trumppulled out of a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers andlater reinstated American sanctions on Iran's oil industry and other key sectors of the country's economy.

""A lot of good things are happening,"" he says.  President Trump will soon address the nation for his daily press briefing US President Donald Trump will take the podium shortly for his daily coronavirus briefing. The president in recent days has been engaged in tug-of-war with governors over who has the authority to reopen states after virus shut downs. Yesterday, he said that a number of states have announced ""concrete steps to begin a safe, gradual and phased opening"", though some governors have warned against the lifting of restrictions until more testing is available. Rebecca MorelleScience correspondent, BBC News The UK is gearing up to use the blood of coronavirus survivors to treat people who are ill in hospital with the disease. NHS Blood and Transplant has started approaching some people who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate their blood so they can begin a trial to assess the treatment. The hope is that the antibodies they have built up will help to clear the virus in others. Scientists have welcomed the plan - and University Hospital of Wales has already announced a trial. But some researchers have warned the UK has moved too slowly compared with other countries. In the US, a national plasma project - involving 1,500 hospitals - has already started. Scientists still need to assess how effective the therapy is. But with no current treatments for Covid-19, the hope is it could help until a vaccine is found. It's been a difficult time for the hospitality sector, including pubs and bars. Belfast establishment Hatfield House thought it had shown some initiative with a Guinness-on-wheels service, which was proving popular. Mobile bar staff had been pouring drinks out of refitted vans into plastic glasses while wearing latex gloves. The drinks were then left on the doorstep with no contact with customers. But in a Facebook post a spokesperson for the pub said police want them to shut down the venture because it breaches licensing legislation. Belfast District Commander Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts said: ""PSNI is aware of employees from licensed premises dispensing alcohol at various locations in Belfast from an adapted vehicle. ""Yesterday [Saturday] officers on patrol in south Belfast spoke with a number of individuals and files are now being prepared for submission to the Public Prosecution Service in relation to potential breaches of the Licensing (NI) Order 1996.""  Canada's capital city appears empty amid coronavirus lockdown measures Coronavirus deaths have topped 41,000 in the US as governors face mounting pressure to reopen their states. What else is happening in the US and Canada?   The number of coronavirus-related deaths in the US has now surpassed 41,000, according to Johns Hopkins. The US university - which has been tracking the outbreak since shortly after it erupted in China late last year - says there are now more than 746,000 confirmed infections across America, with the New York state being the worst-hit. On Sunday,protesters took to the streets in states across the US, demanding that governors reopen economies shut by the pandemic.  A surgeon at London's Barts Health NHS Trusthas written a touching ballad,externalin memory of NHS and other key workers who have lost their lives fighting Covid-19. Charlie Knowles, 52, hopes the song raises money for families of people who have died or been incapacitated by coronavirus. He said: ""This is close to home for me. People are dying, and itâs a reality that I donât think even we as doctors are used to. ""We face death - when I go and see people who have been stabbed and things like that - but you're not the person at risk normally. ""And now we are at risk and thatâs a different feeling to what weâve had before."" The music video shows the faces and names of healthcare workers who lost their lives. The UK has been largely blessed with good weather during the past few days but the government has asked the public to adhere to the coronavirus restrictions for ""at least"" another three weeks from 16 April.

Vincent Asaro celebrates after a judge found him not-guilty in the 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK International Airport The Bonanno family crime boss who inspired Martin Scorsese's film Goodfellas has won an early release from a Missouri prison over concerns about coronavirus. Vincent Asaro, 85, was serving an eight year sentence after pleading guilty in 2017 to ordering associates to torch the car of a person who cut him off at a traffic stop. A federal judge ordered Asaroâs early release this week saying that the mobster - who suffered a stroke last year - said in her ruling that if Asaro were to contract the virus âgiven his age and current state, it is not unlikely that the consequences would be direâ. Asaro was found not guilty in the 2015 trial over the infamous 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK Airport in New York, where masked robbers made off with more than $5m in cash and $1m in jewelry - depicted in Scorseseâs film.   Sir Tom Jones and Little Mix are among the UK artists featuring ina British version of the star-studded One World: Together At Home concert.

Rebecca MorelleScience correspondent, BBC News The UK is gearing up to use the blood of coronavirus survivors to treat people who are ill in hospital with the disease. NHS Blood and Transplant has started approaching some people who have recovered from Covid-19 to donate their blood so they can begin a trial to assess the treatment. The hope is that the antibodies they have built up will help to clear the virus in others. Scientists have welcomed the plan - and University Hospital of Wales has already announced a trial. But some researchers have warned the UK has moved too slowly compared with other countries. In the US, a national plasma project - involving 1,500 hospitals - has already started. Scientists still need to assess how effective the therapy is. But with no current treatments for Covid-19, the hope is it could help until a vaccine is found.

But in a Facebook post a spokesperson for the pub said police want them to shut down the venture because it breaches licensing legislation. Belfast District Commander Chief Superintendent Jonathan Roberts said: ""PSNI is aware of employees from licensed premises dispensing alcohol at various locations in Belfast from an adapted vehicle. ""Yesterday [Saturday] officers on patrol in south Belfast spoke with a number of individuals and files are now being prepared for submission to the Public Prosecution Service in relation to potential breaches of the Licensing (NI) Order 1996.""

Charlie Knowles, 52, hopes the song raises money for families of people who have died or been incapacitated by coronavirus. He said: ""This is close to home for me. People are dying, and itâs a reality that I donât think even we as doctors are used to.
