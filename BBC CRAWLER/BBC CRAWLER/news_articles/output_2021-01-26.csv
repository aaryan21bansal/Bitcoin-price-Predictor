AstraZeneca defends EU vaccine rollout plan,"The head of AstraZeneca has defended its rollout of the coronavirus vaccine in the EU, amid tension with member states over delays in supply. Pascal Soriottold Italian newspaper La Repubblica,externalthat his team was working ""24/7 to fix the very many issues of production of the vaccine"". He said production was ""basically two months behind where we wanted to be"". He also said the EU's late decision to sign contracts had given limited time to sort out hiccups with supply. Mr Soriot, chief executive of the UK-Swedish multinational, said a contract with the UK had been signed three months before the one with the EU, giving more time for glitches to be ironed out. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Cases, deaths and vaccinations by country He told La Repubblica that problems in ""scaling up"" vaccine production were being experienced at two plants, one in the Netherlands and one in Belgium. ""It's complicated, especially in the early phase where you have to really sort out all sorts of issues,"" he said. ""We believe we've sorted out those issues, but we are basically two months behind where we wanted to be."" He added: ""We've also had teething issues like this in the UK supply chain. But the UK contract was signed three months before the European vaccine deal. So with the UK we have had an extra three months to fix all the glitches we experienced. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said a vaccine targeting the South African variant was being worked on ""Would I like to do better? Of course. But, you know, if we deliver in February what we are planning to deliver, it's not a small volume. We are planning to deliver millions of doses to Europe, it is not small."" Mr Soriot also said AstraZeneca was working on a vaccine with Oxford University that would target the South African variant of the coronavirus. Scientists have warned there is a chancethe South African variant may harm the effectiveness of current vaccines. The AstraZeneca vaccine is already being used in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to give it the green light at the end of this month. The bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. The EU has ordered 600 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is already being used on patients around the bloc. But Pfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeks because of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant. In response to the delays, the EU has said it might restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc would have to ""provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries"". She said the 27-member EU bloc would ""take any action required to protect its citizens"". European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, addressing the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum (WEF), usually held in Davos, said:  ""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations."" Have you been affected by vaccine supply issues? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

German government rejects 'mixed-up' jab reports,"Germany has begun its mass vaccination campaign as the virus spreads Germany's health ministry and AstraZeneca have rejected German media reports on Monday that cast doubt on the effectiveness of the drug-maker's vaccine in the elderly. AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish company, described the reports as ""completely incorrect"" while the health ministry said key data had been misreported. The media reports quoted anonymous German government sources. They come amid tension between the EU and AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies. The European Union has said it may restrict exports of vaccines made in the blocin response to AstraZeneca saying it cannot supply the agreed numbers of doses due to production problems. Bogus reports, accidental finds - the Oxford vaccine story What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Cases, deaths and vaccinations by country The reports emerged in Handelsblatt, a respected financial daily, and the mass-circulation Bild, quoting sources within Germany's governing coalition. Germany and the wider EU are relying on millions of doses of the AstraZeneca product, alongside the BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Handelsblatt reported that the German government was working on the basis of only 8% efficacy among those over 65, compared with over 90% for the other vaccines. Vaccination centres have been established throughout Germany The AstraZeneca jab is expected to be approved by the EU's medicine's regulator, the EMA, in the next few days. But Bild suggested that it may not be approved by the EMA for use in the elderly. The EMA's head, Emer Cooke, has been asked by MEPs about the efficacy of the vaccine in older people. She said studies carried out so far were on a very small quantity of the elderly population. Her agency, she said, what trying to work out ""what the data means for the populations that were studied and what can be expected for populations that have not been studied"". EMA approval, she added, could be granted for ""a particular age group or for a wider age group"". AstraZeneca said: ""Reports that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine efficacy is as low as 8% in adults over 65 years are completely incorrect."" In November, the firm had published data in the leading medical journal The Lancet ""demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose"". AstraZeneca chief Pascal Soriot, in an interview with Italy's La Repubblica, explained that the Oxford team started vaccinating older people later,externalso it did not have ""a huge number of older people that had been vaccinated"". ""But we have strong data showing very strong antibody production against the virus in the elderly, similar to what we see in younger people."" He said it was possible that some countries ""out of caution"" would use the AstraZeneca vaccine just for younger people. Full trial data in December showed the vaccine was 70% effective in all adults, and it was approved for use by the UK's MHRA regulator. Reacting to Monday's German media coverage, the German health ministry said on Tuesday that it ""appears two things have been mixed up in the reports"" and that 8% actually referred to the number of volunteers of a certain age taking part in the study - not the efficacy rate. ""Around 8% of the volunteers in AstraZeneca's efficacy studies were between 56 and 69 years old and 3-4% are above 70 years old,"" said the ministry in a statement. ""However, this does not mean that it is effective only in 8% of older people."" The statement also noted that ""fewer older people were involved in AstraZeneca's first studies than in those of other manufacturers"". Health Minister Jens Spahn, interviewed by German radio, refused to be drawn on what he called ""speculation"" and said he would await the EU regulator's decision.

Italian PM resigns in split over Covid response,"Mr Conte hopes to form a new and stronger government after losing his majority in the Senate Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned - and it is not clear if he will be able to form and lead a new coalition government. Parties are divided over spending in the coronavirus crisis, in which more than 85,000 Italians have died. Mr Conte met President Sergio Mattarella, who may ask him to form a stronger government. Last week he lost his Senate majority. But someone else could become Italy's PM, or a snap election could be called. The law professor, who has headed coalition governments since 2018, tendered his resignation to the president. And now Mr Conte is discussing the political crisis with Senate president Elisabetta Casellati. Italy political crisis erupts over Covid spending Italian PM wins crucial vote to stay in power President Mattarella is expected to spend two days in talks with party leaders, as it is up to the president to decide the next move. The centrist coalition government was plunged into crisis two weeks ago when former PM Matteo Renzi pulled his small, liberal Italia Viva party out of it. He said he would only return if Mr Conte accepted a list of demands. Mr Conte survived a vote of confidence in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, last week. He then won a Senate vote, but without an absolute majority. The lack of a majority would restrict government business - hence the political shake-up. Mr Renzi's main objection was to Mr Conte's plans for spending â¬209bn (Â£186bn; $254bn) of EU recovery funds - part of a â¬750bn EU rescue for the Covid crisis. This video can not be played How the lockdown last year left some Italians struggling to get food Mr Renzi says EU funds should be invested in promising sectors like digital and green technologies, and wants MPs, rather than technocrats, to decide on the allocations. But he also wants more investment in the embattled health service. Italy, now mired in recession, was at the epicentre of the pandemic in Europe last year. Mr Renzi governed Italy in 2014-2016, but currently his Italia Viva party is polling below 3%. And so Italy's 66th government since World War Two comes to a close. A country of seemingly perennial political crises has chosen the worst possible time to face another - in the grip of a pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 Italians and unleashed the worst economic collapse in decades. That's why Giuseppe Conte may manage to come back with a new revamped government, arguing the need to avoid the turmoil of fresh elections at such a difficult time. Added to that, polls suggest an early vote would be won by the far right. So Mr Conte is hoping that the threat of losing their seats might tempt enough centrist politicians to jump the opposition ship and join a reformed coalition. Italy's 29th prime minister since the war is hoping to return asâ¦ Italy's 29th prime minister since the war. But his opponents are circling. And he won't have much time to convince parliament that he can become the new, stronger comeback kid. There are several options: Mr Conte could be asked to stay on as PM, but he would need to revamp some of his policies and make some new appointments to win back a parliamentary majority He could persuade some non-aligned senators to join a new coalition if Mr Renzi refuses to support a Conte-led government The main parties in the outgoing coalition - anti-establishment Five Star (M5S) and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) - could agree to serve under a new PM, perhaps with one or two other parties Mr Conte could persuade one or more right-wing parties to join a new coalition led by him. But that option is seen as unlikely, as right-wing parties are ahead in opinion polls, so a snap election would favour them. Mr Conte, an independent technocrat, has led two very different, successive governments. For 15 months he headed a coalition between M5S and the far-right League, whose leader Matteo Salvini pulled out in a failed bid to force elections. Since then he has led a four-party, centre-left coalition dominated by M5S and the PD. The Italians struggling to feed their families.

Cut jury size to clear courts backlog - Labour,"Labour is calling for juries to be cut from 12 members to seven, to stem the ""gravest crisis"" in the justice system since World War Two. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said action was needed to clear the backlog of thousands of cases. He argued that smaller juries and the use of more temporary courts would allow socially distanced trials. The government has not ruled out such a move but insists measures it is taking to clear the backlog are working. Last weekfour criminal justice watchdogswarned that courts in England and Wales were straining under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic. Close courts or face strikes, union warns 'Trials may collapse' as Covid delays continue Locations of 10 temporary courts revealed Jury trials ground to a halt at the start of the first lockdown, when people were advised to stay at home except in limited circumstances. When they resumed, there were severe delays and numerous cancellations due to social-distancing requirements. Recent figures revealed that the number of unheard cases in crown courts had reached a record 54,000. The backlog means some from last year may not go before a jury until 2022, and it could be years before the courts get back on track. Labour wants the temporary return of so-called ""wartime juries"" of seven rather than 12 members to speed up the process. ""Victims of rape, murder, domestic abuse, robbery and assault are facing delays of up to four years because of the government's failure to act,"" Mr Lammy said. He also urged the government to speed up the rollout of temporary ""Nightingale courts"" to hear civil, family and tribunals work, as well as non-custodial crime cases. Ten of thesewere announced in July 2020 to help deal with the backlog in court proceedings, and 20 arenow in operation across,externalEngland and Wales. Leading lawyers are sceptical about Labour's proposal to reach back into wartime history. The Criminal Bar Association - representing barristers who prosecute and defend trials - says a panel of seven may allow more courtrooms to be used, but it wouldn't solve what it says is chronic underfunding - and potentially undermines one of the most important safeguards in our society. The Law Society, for solicitors, wants to see evidence that smaller panels would ease backlogs without risking injustices. The Ministry of Justice's internal modelling calculated last year that reduced juries would lead to a 10% increase in cases - but that was before courtrooms received new Covid-proof screens that have allowed more trials to run. Scotland's courts are using cinemas to host juries - and while that is not being actively discussed in England, it's not been ruled out either. Even if juries were slimmed, courts would still need to tightly control the number of defendants who can use their cells and courtroom docks to meet Public Health England's guidelines. In April last year, the head of judiciary in England and Wales, Lord Burnett,backed the idea of reducing the number of jurorsif social distancing continued. In June, Justice Secretary Robert Bucklandtold the BBC he was ""very attracted""by the idea of smaller juries, as had happened in wartime, and judge-only trials in less serious cases. The Ministry of Justice says it has now installed plastic screens in more than 450 courtrooms and jury deliberation rooms to reduce Covid risks. It says the safety measures are designed for 12-person juries and that the impact of lowering the number of jurors would be negligible. However, a spokesman said nothing was being ruled out and ministers were continuing to consider every option available to ensure courts recover quickly. ""This approach is already delivering results, with magistrates' backlogs falling significantly and the number of cases being dealt with in the crown courts reaching pre-Covid levels last month,"" he added. The spokesman also said: ""We know more must be done and are investing Â£110m into a range of measures to drive this recovery further, including opening more Nightingale courts.""

Xbox sales boom as virus maintains grip on economy,"Microsoft profits rose 33% in the quarter Microsoft has reported booming demand for its Xbox gaming consoles as the pandemic continues to lift the fortunes of the American tech giant. Its Azure cloud computing services also got a boost due to a surge in working and learning from home. The gains helped push the firm's overall revenue up 17% to a record $43.1bn (Â£31.4bn). But its growth came as the virus continues to weigh on other industries. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said the firm is benefiting from a long-term shift in behaviour. ""What we have witnessed over the past year is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry,"" he said. Xbox sales jumped 40% in the three months to 31 December while Azure services soared 50%. The virus continues to weigh on industries outside of tech The pandemic has prompted many firms to switch to remote working, while keeping many entertainment options outside of the home off-limits. Microsoft has seized on the changes, focusing energy on updating its remote work software options. The firm also released two new Xbox consoles in November, helping to boost the performance of its personal computing unit. Microsoft's gaming business topped $5bn in quarterly sales for the first time ever due to gaming subscriptions and sales as well as new consoles. The firm said profits in the quarter rose 33% compared with last year to $15.5bn. Its shares - which climbed roughly 40% last year - were up another 4% in after-hours trade, ""These were blow out numbers that will be another feather in the cap for the tech sector as the cloud growth party is just getting started,"" said Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. But the gains enjoyed by tech firms like Microsoft stand in contrast to the ongoing struggles seen in other industries such as hospitality, retail and travel. Coffee chain Starbucks on Tuesday said its sales in the last three months of 2020 fell roughly 5% compared to 2019, driven by a drop in business in the US where concerns about Covid-19 have prompted authorities to urge people to stay at home. In China, where the virus is under more control, sales rose 5%, the company said. The firm said it expected business to return to growth in the next few months, including in the critical US market. But profits in the quarter dropped 30% to $622.2m compared with last year, sending the firm's shares lower in after-hours trade.

Some people out of mine-flooded homes for six months,"This video can not be played Cerys Thomas said her mother's conservatory windows were blown open by the force of the water Some residents flooded out of their homes after a mine blow-out will not be able to return for at least six months, the Coal Authority has said. Eighty peoplewere evacuated from Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday and residents wereurged to stay away due to safety fears. Some have returned but others will be out for months, and the Coal Authority (CA) could buy a small number of homes. Water flowing out of Drummau Mountain has found a ""new path"", it said. This video can not be played The Coal Authority explains what is known so far about the Skewen mine ""blow-out"" The CA said the ""blow out"" was caused by a blockage underground which led to the water breaking out to find the easiest path. Is Wales' coalmining heritage behind flooding? Flood victims face 'months' before returning home Financial help offered to flood victims Chief executive Lisa Pinney said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months but a new water management system will have to be built deep underground to divert the water, which will take at least six months. She said the authority was looking at ""every option"" to get as many people back in their homes as quickly and safely as possible, including buying some homes from residents. At least 80 people had to leave their homes in the village after flooding Water is now coming out of the ground at the junction of Drummau Road and Goshen Park in the village. According to the authority, there is a mineshaft at the junction of Goshen Park. Water had been flowing through an underground channel there. However a blockage has formed in it, and water has built up in the channel over time, causing the blow out. This video can not be played Teresa Dalling says a river of orange water rushed through the village on Thursday Ms Pinney said: ""There's a lot of water coming off the mountain, off the extensive, very ancient mine-workings on the hills above. ""Water, when it's found a path, that tends to be its new path. What we need to do is put in this new permanent solution, so that it is properly managed and it will have a new permanent pipeline which will take it safely through the village and out to a discharge point."" A temporary water diversion will remain in place in the meantime. She said the authority was focusing on alternative access to get as many people back in their homes ""on a permanent basis"" as soon as possible. However she cautioned: ""There will be at least a small number [for] who that will be a longer period of time. ""I hope it will be a very, very small number [who will have to leave for six months]. There are different options and we need to have that discussion with anybody that it might affect."" Firefighters in Skewen helped evacuate people from their homes The authority does not think any houses are structurally unsafe and does not use compulsory purchase orders on properties. Ms Pinney said: ""We do sometimes buy houses if the residents are happy to sell them and we have a reason for needing to do that so for example if there was a case of real subsidence for example."" The water rushed through the streets of Skewen A dedicated residents' phone line on 0800 2884268 will go live from Wednesday at 09:00 GMT and Neath Port Talbot council is puttingupdates on its website,external. The number will be staffed every day from 9am to 5pm until Friday, 5 February including the weekend, and then from Monday to Friday for as long as needed. Appointments to discuss remedial work, what financial support is available and arranging liaison with insurers if relevant would be available over the phone or video call. Covid secure face-to-face appointments will also be available at Neath Port Talbot council's incident support centre at Abbey Primary School on Thursday, Friday and some days next week. Ms Pinney said they were working to get residents in as soon as possible so that insurance assessors could come in and people could start work on their homes.

"'Hard to compute sorrow' of 100,000 deaths - PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces UK deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000 More than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" for the government's actions, saying: ""We truly did everything we could."" ""I'm deeply sorry for every life lost,"" he said. A total of 100,162 deaths have been recorded in the UK, the first European nation to pass the landmark. Earlier, figures from the ONS, which are based on death certificates,showed there had been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began. The government's daily figures,externalrely on positive tests and are slightly lower. Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Kuenssberg: Grim milestone in an abnormal year UK deaths likely to come down slowly, Whitty warns Mr Johnson told Tuesday's Downing Street news conference that it was ""hard to compute the sorrow contained in this grim statistic"". He gave his ""deepest condolences"" to those who had lost loved ones, including ""fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and the many grandparents who've been taken"". The UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. A surge in cases in recent weeks - driven in part by a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus - has left the UK with one of the highest coronavirus death rates globally. A further 20,089 coronavirus cases were recorded on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. The number of people in hospital remains high, as do the UK's daily death figures. Mr Johnson said the coronavirus infection rate remained ""pretty forbiddingly high"" despite lockdown restrictions which have been in place in England since 5 January. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons - including for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much ofScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. Mr Johnson said he would set out more detail in ""the next few days and weeks"" about ""when and how we want to get things open again"". It's a terrible milestone - and one that represents unimaginable loss. Most of the deaths have come in two waves - the sharp, sudden surge in the spring followed by a slow and sustained rise throughout autumn and winter. Mistakes have been made - the delay locking down back in March is one that is often cited even by the government's own advisers. The UK, like much of Europe, was also woefully underprepared with limited testing and contact tracing systems. But the ageing population, high rates of obesity, the fact the UK is a global hub and its inter-connectedness with Europe are also factors that meant we were tragically never going to escape lightly once the virus got a foothold. Speaking alongside the prime minister, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, described it as a ""very sad day"". He saidthe number of people dying ""will come down relatively slowlyover the next two weeks - and will probably remain flat for a while now"". Prof Whitty added the new coronavirus variant had changed the UK's situation ""very substantially"" with infection rates ""just about holding"" due to lockdown restrictions. But he said the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK ""has been coming down"" and the number of people in hospital with Covid has ""flattened off"" - including in London, the South East and East of England. However, there were ""some areas"" where the hospital figures were ""still not convincingly reducing"", he said. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said there had been ""continuing improvements in hospital treatment for severely sick coronavirus patients"". He said he expected more treatments within the next six to 18 months, adding: ""We can see a world in which coronavirus may be more treatable, but for now, it's a combination of reducing infections and getting vaccinations done."" One day there will be a public inquiry - maybe several - seeking to understand why so many died. Last summer, back when the government was subsidising people to eat out at restaurants, Boris Johnson said there would be an independent inquiry into the government's handling of Covid, but gave no details or dates. He still hasn't, despite a recent call from bereaved families, trade unions and charities for lessons to be learnt now. The gravest public health crisis for a century would have tested any government. But as the pandemic has worsened, the criticisms and questions have mounted - about the timing of lockdowns, the rollout of test and trace and the failure to protect care homes last spring. There is now pressure on Boris Johnson from some Tory MPs to ease restrictions as soon as the most vulnerable are vaccinated. But this evening a sombre prime minister said the government would first do everything it could to minimise further loss of life. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said it was a ""sobering moment in the pandemic"", saying: ""Each death is a person who was someone's family member and friend."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""national tragedy"" to have reached 100,000 deaths. The government had been ""behind the curve at every stage"" of the pandemic and had not learnt lessons over the summer, he added. The epidemiologist whose modelling in part prompted the UK's first national lockdown said more action in the autumn of last year could have saved lives. Prof Neil Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of keeping case numbers at a reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the deaths we've seen, not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths we've seen in the last four or five months, could have been avoided."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the death toll was ""heartbreaking"" and warned there was a ""tough period ahead"". ""The vaccine offers the way out, but we cannot let up now,"" he added. More than 6.8 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest figures.

About 80 people were evacuated duringflooding thought to be related to mine works in Skewen, Neath, while 30 were evacuated in Bangor-on-Dee, Wrexham. The Welsh Government said it would work with councils to deliver Â£500-Â£1,000 payments to affected households. Environment minister, Lesley Griffiths, said people across Wales were facing the ""twin problems"" of floods and the coronavirus pandemic. She said: ""We will support people in these circumstances just as we did in the aftermath of storms Ciara and Dennis last year, by working with local authorities to make support payments of between Â£500 and Â£1,000 available for each household flooded."" Severeflood warnings,externalremain in place across Wales as river levels remain high. In the Lower Dee Valley a severe flood warning remains in force, from Llangollen to Trevalyn Meadow, and a major incident was declared in Bangor-on-Dee. Wrexham council leader Mark Pritchard said teams worked to ensure the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, made on Wrexham Industrial Estate, was not lost in the floods. Firefighters in Skewen waded through water up to their thighs amidst reports of evacuated homes About 80 people were evacuated in Skewen, including residents of a care home, after at least eight streets were left under water. Emergency services said there were no injuries and all those evacuated had been found accommodation, but people are asked to avoid the area. In Denbighshire, a bridge linking Trefnant to Tremeirchion over the River Clwyd collapsed in the storm. The council said it would be investigating the cause of the flooding, which forced road closures and evacuations. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said the River Dee, which runs through Bangor-on-Dee, was at its highest recorded level since the water gauge became operational in 1996 - 16.45m (54ft). It urged people across Wales to remain vigilant, with river levels not set to have peaked until late Thursday evening, adding they would remain high until Friday morning.

North East Wales Search and Rescue helped people whose homes were flooded in New Broughton, Wrexham Wockhardt UK, which manufactures the vaccine, said at about 16:00 GMT on Wednesday, excess water surrounded part of its buildings. ""The site is now secure and free from any further flood damage and operating as normal,"" it said. The clean-up has begun in Ruthin A multi-agency statement described the situation in Bangor-on-Dee as a ""major incident"". It said: ""As a severe weather warning indicates that there is a risk to life... ""The evacuation effort continues, with all routes in and out of the village currently closed to the public due to the flooding."" LIVE: Storm Christoph disruption Evacuations amid Storm Christoph floods and snow Earlier, some residents in Ruthin weretold to leave their homes- people have been told Covid rules allow them leave their homes in an emergency. Meanwhile, a man's body was recovered from theRiver Taff near Blackweir in Cardiff. Dozens of ducks and chickens, and 12 huskies were rescued by the RSPCA from a flooded farm in Bangor, while they also took hay to two donkeys stranded by flood water in Mold. Some 12 huskies had to be rescued after their kennels flooded Dave Brown said the flooding in his home in Broughton, Flintshire, was horrific and his mother-in-law was rescued by firefighters. ""You don't realise the damage water does and everything that floats - the sheer volume of water. I am 6ft tall and it almost took me out,"" he said. Dave Brown's mother-in-law was rescued from their home in Broughton, Flintshire Wrexham council said some of the people forced to leave their homes were with relatives, while it found others accommodation after having to initially seek refuge in a church hall. Nine properties in Berse Road in New Broughton were also evacuated. The situation in Ruthin, Denbighshire, overnight was ""horrendous"", town councillor Stephen Beach said. ""The whole of Ruthin was on edge,"" he said. ""Some people were accommodated at the leisure centre, and others were offered places to stay by local residents. The community was superb. ""It was the sheer volume of water that came down - there was no stopping it."" Flood warnings across Wales Weather and flood warnings A yellow weatherwarning for ice for Wales,externalhas been issued by the Met Office until 10:00 GMT on Friday, with concerns it could lead to travel disruption, slips and falls. Numerous flood warnings and alerts remain in place across Wales,including two severe flood warnings,external. The agency said flood defences were being used and river levels at Holt, Wrexham, would remain high for some time.""There is therefore a significant risk of localised flooding problems and due to that the severe flood warning will remain in place until the levels drop,"" Keith Iven of NRW said In Monmouthshire roads were closed following flooding, and the council said while water levels at the River Usk were dropping, a ""second peak"" on the River Wye had been expected on Thursday night. The council had warned people living in Riverside Park, Monmouth, may be impacted and council workers were prepared to offer support. River Tywi has burst its banks in Carmarthen, affecting nearby businesses Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it had attended 98 flooding-related incidents It said it deployed swift water rescue teams to rescue 13 people from vehicles in floodwater. It also winched vehicles from water and pumped water from properties. In Cardiff, emergency services attended a crash involving a number of vehicles at about 07:40 on the A4232 between Culverhouse Cross and the M4. No-one was seriously injured, but both carriageways were closed for just over an hour. The road has since reopened.

Teachers and students have protested in France to demand better working conditions during the pandemic Thanks for joining us today. Here are some of the biggest developments from around the world.  Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has abandoned plans to allow some children out of their homes for the first time in 10 months. They've been cooped up to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under-15s have been unable to legally go outside since March - one of the toughest virus restrictions on children anywhere in the world. It has had an effect on their schooling and mental health, as well as the economy because family trips have been impossible. Last week though, the government finally said 10 to 14-year-olds would be allowed out from February. But President Duterte has now rescinded that order after the more contagious UK variant of the virus was discovered. Duterte told children they'd have to continue watching TV instead. While the UK reaches a milestone in terms of the number of deaths today, it is one year ago that the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand, officials had maintained that the virus outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact, coronavirus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. We look back at thosefive critical days early on in the outbreak. Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor This video can not be played Inside the hospital: âAmong all the doom and gloom thereâs positivesâ Despite the strains coronavirus is putting on the system, as hospital admissions for coronavirus continue at a high rate, there is still kindness and new life in NHS hospitals. I went to Kings Mill Hospital, part of Sherwood Forest Hospitals Trust, to meet the patients and staff. Among them was the Reverend Edith Dawson who told me sweeties and a smile go a long way at the moment. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Jamie Brownâs dad Tony was 65 when he died with Covid-19 last March. As the UK registers more than 100,000 deaths of people with coronavirus, today, 5 Live has been hearing from people about how they are coping with the grief at losing their loved ones to coronavirus. Jamie Brownâs dad Tony was 65 when he died with Covid-19 last March. Speaking to 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty, Jamie said his dad was beginning to retire, but travelling to London one day a week, when he became ill. ""He was meant to be putting his feet up, having worked incredibly hard to do so - and that was taken away from him."" Jamie is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group and says the group helped him realise heâs ""one in a sea of people who are feeling this... collective grief and collective rage (that) youâve been so terribly let down"". Listen back on the free BBC Sounds app. Jake HortonBBC Reality Check President Joe Biden has said that the US might be able to
boost its daily vaccination roll-out targets after criticising the Trump
administrationâs record. Biden, who has described the previous vaccine programme
as a ""dismal failure"", has committed to getting 100 million vaccine doses done
in his first 100 days and has since said: ""I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than one million a day."" Is he right about the vaccine roll-out under the Trump
administration? As of 20 January, when Biden became US president, about
16.5 million vaccines had been administered. That is some way off the Trump administration's target of
vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020. In fact, fewer than three million people had received a jab
by 31 December. Vaccinations have sped up since the start of the year. The daily average for the week before Trump left office
was less than 900,000, according toOur World in Data,external. That figure has since risen above one million doses a day,
and Biden has come under some
scrutiny for not setting a more ambitious target. When you look at the countries doing the most vaccinations by population, the US is fourth after Israel, the UAE and the UK in terms of doses per 100 people. Read more here Reality Check Israel has the highest per capita vaccination rate in the
world - but vaccines are yet to be rolled out to Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, viewed as occupied territories by the international community. Israelâs health minister says it is the Palestinian
Authorityâs responsibility to provide healthcare under an interim deal for
self-rule in Palestinian areas. But UN human rights experts say there are international rules about the duty of an occupying power to
provide healthcare - although Israel often argues it isn't technically
occupying the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem are entitled to be
vaccinated against Covid - they have Israeli residency status. And medics
working in Palestinian hospitals there are also getting vaccines. Some health experts and business leaders have also called
for Israel to include other Palestinians in its vaccine programme, as around
tens of thousands of  Palestinians travel daily to work in Israel and in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the
West Bank â said they are doing deals with four companies that will provide
enough vaccines for 70% of its people, and will get another 20% from the World
Health Organization-backed Covax scheme. But there are few details at the moment about when vaccines
will start or who will receive them. Read more here Among the figures on the pandemic in the UK today came news that more than 6.85m people have had a coronavirus vaccination first dose. Another 279,757 people had received a jab as of Monday,official figures show.,external One of those getting a vaccination on Tuesday was actress and TV presenter Floella Benjamin,who tweeted a picture of the occasion,external. Baroness Benjamin, 71, who made her name as the host of TV's Play School in the 1970s, is now a campaigner for young people. Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Denmark Mink farmers in Denmark - the worldâs largest producer of mink pelts until a coronavirus mass cull - have been given a compensation package worth more than 19 billion Danish kroner (Â£2.2bn). It was voted through by MPs late on Monday. The agriculture minister said it was a chance to move on, while the Danish mink breeders association said the industry would never return, as China and Poland could produce mink furs much more cheaply. Mink farmers were ordered to destroy their entire stock of about 17 million animals last November, over fears that a mutant strain of Covid-19 could pass from mink to humans. But chaos followed. The scientific basis of the order came into question, and mass graves appeared to be poisoning soil and water supplies. The issue led to the resignation of the previous agriculture minister. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Some of the worst violence was in Rotterdam The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations? There are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians. Some feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew. The unrest was initially seen as a response to the first ""stay-at-home"" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. This video can not be played Netherlands: Third night of anti-lockdown riots Away from UK news now, and nearby, in the Netherlands, the Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs. Shops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra condemned the violence, saying: ""It's scum doing this"". More than 180 arrests have been made. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". The criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte. A night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 (03:30 GMT) was imposed last Saturday to help to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine. Read more here This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: 'The rate of mortality will come down relatively slowly' England's Chief Medical Officer, Prof Chris Whitty says while the coronavirus death rate has flattened, it remains at a very high rate, and ""there will unfortunately be additional deaths"". He was speaking at this afternoon's Downing Street briefing. There have been more than 3.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 100,000 people have died, government figures show. You canlook up how many cases are near to you here. Reality Check At his Downing Street briefing this evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âI think the amount we invested in the NHS, even before the pandemic began, was
more than any time in modern memory.â In 2018, the government pledged that
spending on the NHS in England would increase by Â£20.5bn by 2023-24. This meant that the NHS budget
would increase by 3.2% a year, once inflation was accounted for. However, it is still substantially
below the 6% annual growth seen under the Labour governments in power between
1997 and 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Itâs important when comparing
spending to include inflation, because it accounts for the fact that things get
more expensive over the years. Since the crisis began, the NHS
budget has increased dramatically. In the most recent year, the
Department of Health and Social Careâs budget went up by Â£50bn, but it is still
unclear whether the health service will receive more money once the crisis has
ended. ""She was a passionate, caring, humorous and larger-than-life character."" ""He is one of a kind and will be greatly missed."" ""He had such a zest for life."" More than 100,000 lives have been lost to coronavirus in the UK - victims of a pandemic that has claimed two million deaths worldwide. We have gathered tributes to more than 680 of those who have died - including words of remembrance from friends, family and colleagues. Read the tributes here. George BowdenBBC News The UK government is expected to announce plans for a form of hotel quarantine for international arrivals into the country. While exact details of the policy remain unclear, similar schemes are already in place across the world, including in Australia and New Zealand. Some travellers have been telling us about their experiences. After finally securing her family's place in Australia's quarantine system, Keri McMenamin prepared for the worst - and ordered a vacuum cleaner. The 38-year-old was returning to the country with her husband and two children after securing a job offer - leaving the UK in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic last year. ""It is literally luck of the draw,"" she says of where her family would spend 14 days together once they arrived. ""You didn't know what to expect.""

Amber set up her Grief Gang podcast after her mum Sue died The figure of more than 100,000 deaths is a devastating number and it leaves behind many thousands of grieving friends and families. So how can you support someone through the loss of a loved one? ""For every person who dies, around eight to 10 people are significantly affected,"" psychotherapist Julia Samuel tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Restrictions on going to funerals and rules around household mixing mean the normal support networks might not be as easy to reach. ""Your friend will need your support for a lifetime,"" Amber Jeffrey says. Amber set up the Grief Gang podcast andInstagram page,externalafter her mum Sue died. She said the idea was to reach out to others like her. Here's what you can do to help someone dealing with grief. Radio 4 PM The epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the UK government to impose the
first lockdown last March says he believes more action in the
autumn of last year could have saved lives. Speaking as more than 100,000 deaths were recorded,
Prof Neil Ferguson  told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme: ""The new variant was unpredictable and did change our understanding of
how much was needed to control spread, but we did just let the autumn wave get
too far."" Asked if there was one thing that could have made a
difference, he added: âIn some sense back in March we had much less information to go on
than in September. ""Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back
in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of
keeping case numbers at reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the
deaths weâve seen - not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths weâve seen in
the last four or five months - could have been avoided.â  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Speaking to 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty, Jamie said his dad was beginning to retire, but travelling to London one day a week, when he became ill.

Listen back on the free BBC Sounds app. Jake HortonBBC Reality Check President Joe Biden has said that the US might be able to
boost its daily vaccination roll-out targets after criticising the Trump
administrationâs record. Biden, who has described the previous vaccine programme
as a ""dismal failure"", has committed to getting 100 million vaccine doses done
in his first 100 days and has since said: ""I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than one million a day."" Is he right about the vaccine roll-out under the Trump
administration? As of 20 January, when Biden became US president, about
16.5 million vaccines had been administered. That is some way off the Trump administration's target of
vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020. In fact, fewer than three million people had received a jab
by 31 December. Vaccinations have sped up since the start of the year. The daily average for the week before Trump left office
was less than 900,000, according toOur World in Data,external. That figure has since risen above one million doses a day,
and Biden has come under some
scrutiny for not setting a more ambitious target. When you look at the countries doing the most vaccinations by population, the US is fourth after Israel, the UAE and the UK in terms of doses per 100 people. Read more here Reality Check Israel has the highest per capita vaccination rate in the
world - but vaccines are yet to be rolled out to Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, viewed as occupied territories by the international community. Israelâs health minister says it is the Palestinian
Authorityâs responsibility to provide healthcare under an interim deal for
self-rule in Palestinian areas. But UN human rights experts say there are international rules about the duty of an occupying power to
provide healthcare - although Israel often argues it isn't technically
occupying the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem are entitled to be
vaccinated against Covid - they have Israeli residency status. And medics
working in Palestinian hospitals there are also getting vaccines. Some health experts and business leaders have also called
for Israel to include other Palestinians in its vaccine programme, as around
tens of thousands of  Palestinians travel daily to work in Israel and in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the
West Bank â said they are doing deals with four companies that will provide
enough vaccines for 70% of its people, and will get another 20% from the World
Health Organization-backed Covax scheme. But there are few details at the moment about when vaccines
will start or who will receive them. Read more here Among the figures on the pandemic in the UK today came news that more than 6.85m people have had a coronavirus vaccination first dose. Another 279,757 people had received a jab as of Monday,official figures show.,external One of those getting a vaccination on Tuesday was actress and TV presenter Floella Benjamin,who tweeted a picture of the occasion,external. Baroness Benjamin, 71, who made her name as the host of TV's Play School in the 1970s, is now a campaigner for young people. Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Denmark Mink farmers in Denmark - the worldâs largest producer of mink pelts until a coronavirus mass cull - have been given a compensation package worth more than 19 billion Danish kroner (Â£2.2bn). It was voted through by MPs late on Monday. The agriculture minister said it was a chance to move on, while the Danish mink breeders association said the industry would never return, as China and Poland could produce mink furs much more cheaply. Mink farmers were ordered to destroy their entire stock of about 17 million animals last November, over fears that a mutant strain of Covid-19 could pass from mink to humans. But chaos followed. The scientific basis of the order came into question, and mass graves appeared to be poisoning soil and water supplies. The issue led to the resignation of the previous agriculture minister. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Some of the worst violence was in Rotterdam The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations? There are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians. Some feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew. The unrest was initially seen as a response to the first ""stay-at-home"" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. This video can not be played Netherlands: Third night of anti-lockdown riots Away from UK news now, and nearby, in the Netherlands, the Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs. Shops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra condemned the violence, saying: ""It's scum doing this"". More than 180 arrests have been made. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". The criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte. A night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 (03:30 GMT) was imposed last Saturday to help to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine.

There have been more than 3.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 100,000 people have died, government figures show. You canlook up how many cases are near to you here. Reality Check At his Downing Street briefing this evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âI think the amount we invested in the NHS, even before the pandemic began, was
more than any time in modern memory.â In 2018, the government pledged that
spending on the NHS in England would increase by Â£20.5bn by 2023-24. This meant that the NHS budget
would increase by 3.2% a year, once inflation was accounted for. However, it is still substantially
below the 6% annual growth seen under the Labour governments in power between
1997 and 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Itâs important when comparing
spending to include inflation, because it accounts for the fact that things get
more expensive over the years. Since the crisis began, the NHS
budget has increased dramatically. In the most recent year, the
Department of Health and Social Careâs budget went up by Â£50bn, but it is still
unclear whether the health service will receive more money once the crisis has
ended. ""She was a passionate, caring, humorous and larger-than-life character."" ""He is one of a kind and will be greatly missed."" ""He had such a zest for life.""

autumn of last year could have saved lives. Speaking as more than 100,000 deaths were recorded,
Prof Neil Ferguson  told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme: ""The new variant was unpredictable and did change our understanding of
how much was needed to control spread, but we did just let the autumn wave get
too far."" Asked if there was one thing that could have made a
difference, he added: âIn some sense back in March we had much less information to go on
than in September. ""Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back
in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of
keeping case numbers at reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the
deaths weâve seen - not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths weâve seen in
the last four or five months - could have been avoided.â  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Vaccine supply fears grow,"Reports suggest AstraZeneca may have warned of a 60% cut to doses available The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive. AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers. The EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding ""fair distribution"". The UK's vaccine minister warned of ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"". AstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant. Read our latest reports on Covid here Vaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates. Separately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people. Last week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems andPfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower. In response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to ""provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Cases, deaths and vaccinations by country She said the 27-member EU bloc would ""take any action required to protect its citizens"". German Health Minister Jens Spahn backed her call, saying: ""This is not about EU first, this is about Europe's fair share."" Chancellor Angela Merkel told the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum, usually held in Davos, there should be a ""fair distribution"" across the world. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told forum: ""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations."" A worker with Covid vaccines sets out to inoculate patients in Dillenberg, Germany The row could affect supplies to the UK of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Responding to the EU's comments, the UK's Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawisaid on Tuesday that supplies were ""tight""and warned against what he called ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"", adding: ""No-one is safe until the whole world is safe."" He said he was confident the UK would receive enough doses to meet its targets - a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. The EU has already faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines, which it buys on behalf of all member states. Ms Kyriakides tweeted that Monday's talks with AstraZeneca ""resulted in dissatisfaction,externalwith the lack of clarity and insufficient explanations"". She said the EU had requested ""a detailed planning of vaccine deliveries"" and the next meeting with the company would be held on Wednesday. AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish multinational headquartered in England, said it was ""doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible"". The AstraZeneca vaccine is being used already in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to green light it at the end of this month. The bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Last week, AstraZeneca said ""reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain"" meant the number of initial doses for EU member states would be lower. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. An AstraZeneca partner plant in Belgium involved in the ""viral vector"" process - the delivery of genetic material into cells - is thought to be the problem. But one German member of the European Parliament, Peter Liese, told Reuters news agency that the statement that there were difficulties in the EU supply chain but not elsewhere was ""flimsy"" and there should be ""no problem to get the vaccine from the UK to the continent"". European officials familiar with Monday's EU-AstraZeneca meeting said the company had offered to bring forward deliveries by a week to 7 February, but this did not mean an increase in supplies for the quarter. The Serum Institute of India also produces a large amount of AstraZeneca jabs, but has no immediate plans to divert to the EU. Other nations, including Australia and Thailand, have said they have also been told of a drop in AstraZeneca supply. The AstraZeneca reduction is a serious blow in the wake of Pfizer-BioNTech's statement. Pfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeksbecause of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, which is already being used on patients around the bloc. Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to inoculate 70% of adults in the EU by the end of August. By Stephanie Hegarty, BBC Population correspondent As the diplomatic tussle goes on between vaccine-producing countries in Europe there could be a rare bit of good news for the rest of the world, including the lower-income countries already struggling to secure a supply. Covax, an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization that aims to distribute vaccines around the world more fairly, says it doesn't expect its supply of vaccines to be affected. Most of that supply is coming from a producer in India with some also manufactured in South Korea. Covax says it's on schedule to deliver its first vaccines in lower-income countries in February, helped by the fact that the US under President Joe Biden recently committed $4bn (Â£3.5bn) to the scheme. Covax: The global plan to share vaccines fairly Germany's health ministry on Tuesday firmly denied reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for AstraZeneca among the elderly. The reports, including in the Handelsblatt economic daily, cited sources saying the efficacy was as low as 8% in the over 65s. But the ministry said its review of the data in the reports ""did not allow this assumption"" and that it ""appears that two things have been mixed up in the reports"". AstraZeneca issued a statement saying the reports were ""completely incorrect"", adding: ""In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose."" UK Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the reports had created ""confusion and concern"" and risked ""adding to the spread of disinformation"".

"'Hard to compute sorrow' of 100,000 deaths - PMBoris Johnson says he takes ""full responsibility"" for the UK government's response to the pandemic.UK","This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces UK deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000 More than 100,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, after 1,631 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were recorded in the daily figures. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he took ""full responsibility"" for the government's actions, saying: ""We truly did everything we could."" ""I'm deeply sorry for every life lost,"" he said. A total of 100,162 deaths have been recorded in the UK, the first European nation to pass the landmark. Earlier, figures from the ONS, which are based on death certificates,showed there had been nearly 104,000 deaths since the pandemic began. The government's daily figures,externalrely on positive tests and are slightly lower. Why is the UK's death toll so bad? Kuenssberg: Grim milestone in an abnormal year UK deaths likely to come down slowly, Whitty warns Mr Johnson told Tuesday's Downing Street news conference that it was ""hard to compute the sorrow contained in this grim statistic"". He gave his ""deepest condolences"" to those who had lost loved ones, including ""fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and the many grandparents who've been taken"". The UK is the fifth country to pass 100,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. A surge in cases in recent weeks - driven in part by a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus - has left the UK with one of the highest coronavirus death rates globally. A further 20,089 coronavirus cases were recorded on Tuesday, continuing a downward trend in the number of UK cases seen in recent days. The number of people in hospital remains high, as do the UK's daily death figures. Mr Johnson said the coronavirus infection rate remained ""pretty forbiddingly high"" despite lockdown restrictions which have been in place in England since 5 January. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and only go out for limited reasons - including for food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much ofScotland,WalesandNorthern Ireland. Mr Johnson said he would set out more detail in ""the next few days and weeks"" about ""when and how we want to get things open again"". It's a terrible milestone - and one that represents unimaginable loss. Most of the deaths have come in two waves - the sharp, sudden surge in the spring followed by a slow and sustained rise throughout autumn and winter. Mistakes have been made - the delay locking down back in March is one that is often cited even by the government's own advisers. The UK, like much of Europe, was also woefully underprepared with limited testing and contact tracing systems. But the ageing population, high rates of obesity, the fact the UK is a global hub and its inter-connectedness with Europe are also factors that meant we were tragically never going to escape lightly once the virus got a foothold. Speaking alongside the prime minister, Prof Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, described it as a ""very sad day"". He saidthe number of people dying ""will come down relatively slowlyover the next two weeks - and will probably remain flat for a while now"". Prof Whitty added the new coronavirus variant had changed the UK's situation ""very substantially"" with infection rates ""just about holding"" due to lockdown restrictions. But he said the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK ""has been coming down"" and the number of people in hospital with Covid has ""flattened off"" - including in London, the South East and East of England. However, there were ""some areas"" where the hospital figures were ""still not convincingly reducing"", he said. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said there had been ""continuing improvements in hospital treatment for severely sick coronavirus patients"". He said he expected more treatments within the next six to 18 months, adding: ""We can see a world in which coronavirus may be more treatable, but for now, it's a combination of reducing infections and getting vaccinations done."" One day there will be a public inquiry - maybe several - seeking to understand why so many died. Last summer, back when the government was subsidising people to eat out at restaurants, Boris Johnson said there would be an independent inquiry into the government's handling of Covid, but gave no details or dates. He still hasn't, despite a recent call from bereaved families, trade unions and charities for lessons to be learnt now. The gravest public health crisis for a century would have tested any government. But as the pandemic has worsened, the criticisms and questions have mounted - about the timing of lockdowns, the rollout of test and trace and the failure to protect care homes last spring. There is now pressure on Boris Johnson from some Tory MPs to ease restrictions as soon as the most vulnerable are vaccinated. But this evening a sombre prime minister said the government would first do everything it could to minimise further loss of life. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said it was a ""sobering moment in the pandemic"", saying: ""Each death is a person who was someone's family member and friend."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""national tragedy"" to have reached 100,000 deaths. The government had been ""behind the curve at every stage"" of the pandemic and had not learnt lessons over the summer, he added. The epidemiologist whose modelling in part prompted the UK's first national lockdown said more action in the autumn of last year could have saved lives. Prof Neil Ferguson told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of keeping case numbers at a reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the deaths we've seen, not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths we've seen in the last four or five months, could have been avoided."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the death toll was ""heartbreaking"" and warned there was a ""tough period ahead"". ""The vaccine offers the way out, but we cannot let up now,"" he added. More than 6.8 million people in the UK have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest figures.

Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has abandoned plans to allow some children out of their homes for the first time in 10 months. They've been cooped up to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under-15s have been unable to legally go outside since March - one of the toughest virus restrictions on children anywhere in the world. It has had an effect on their schooling and mental health, as well as the economy because family trips have been impossible. Last week though, the government finally said 10 to 14-year-olds would be allowed out from February. But President Duterte has now rescinded that order after the more contagious UK variant of the virus was discovered. Duterte told children they'd have to continue watching TV instead. While the UK reaches a milestone in terms of the number of deaths today, it is one year ago that the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand, officials had maintained that the virus outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact, coronavirus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. We look back at thosefive critical days early on in the outbreak.

administrationâs record. Biden, who has described the previous vaccine programme
as a ""dismal failure"", has committed to getting 100 million vaccine doses done
in his first 100 days and has since said: ""I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than one million a day."" Is he right about the vaccine roll-out under the Trump
administration? As of 20 January, when Biden became US president, about
16.5 million vaccines had been administered. That is some way off the Trump administration's target of
vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020. In fact, fewer than three million people had received a jab
by 31 December. Vaccinations have sped up since the start of the year. The daily average for the week before Trump left office
was less than 900,000, according toOur World in Data,external. That figure has since risen above one million doses a day,
and Biden has come under some
scrutiny for not setting a more ambitious target. When you look at the countries doing the most vaccinations by population, the US is fourth after Israel, the UAE and the UK in terms of doses per 100 people. Read more here Reality Check Israel has the highest per capita vaccination rate in the
world - but vaccines are yet to be rolled out to Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, viewed as occupied territories by the international community. Israelâs health minister says it is the Palestinian
Authorityâs responsibility to provide healthcare under an interim deal for
self-rule in Palestinian areas. But UN human rights experts say there are international rules about the duty of an occupying power to
provide healthcare - although Israel often argues it isn't technically
occupying the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem are entitled to be
vaccinated against Covid - they have Israeli residency status. And medics
working in Palestinian hospitals there are also getting vaccines. Some health experts and business leaders have also called
for Israel to include other Palestinians in its vaccine programme, as around
tens of thousands of  Palestinians travel daily to work in Israel and in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the
West Bank â said they are doing deals with four companies that will provide
enough vaccines for 70% of its people, and will get another 20% from the World
Health Organization-backed Covax scheme. But there are few details at the moment about when vaccines
will start or who will receive them. Read more here Among the figures on the pandemic in the UK today came news that more than 6.85m people have had a coronavirus vaccination first dose.

Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Denmark Mink farmers in Denmark - the worldâs largest producer of mink pelts until a coronavirus mass cull - have been given a compensation package worth more than 19 billion Danish kroner (Â£2.2bn). It was voted through by MPs late on Monday. The agriculture minister said it was a chance to move on, while the Danish mink breeders association said the industry would never return, as China and Poland could produce mink furs much more cheaply. Mink farmers were ordered to destroy their entire stock of about 17 million animals last November, over fears that a mutant strain of Covid-19 could pass from mink to humans. But chaos followed. The scientific basis of the order came into question, and mass graves appeared to be poisoning soil and water supplies. The issue led to the resignation of the previous agriculture minister.

Reality Check At his Downing Street briefing this evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âI think the amount we invested in the NHS, even before the pandemic began, was
more than any time in modern memory.â In 2018, the government pledged that
spending on the NHS in England would increase by Â£20.5bn by 2023-24. This meant that the NHS budget
would increase by 3.2% a year, once inflation was accounted for. However, it is still substantially
below the 6% annual growth seen under the Labour governments in power between
1997 and 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Itâs important when comparing
spending to include inflation, because it accounts for the fact that things get
more expensive over the years. Since the crisis began, the NHS
budget has increased dramatically. In the most recent year, the
Department of Health and Social Careâs budget went up by Â£50bn, but it is still
unclear whether the health service will receive more money once the crisis has
ended. ""She was a passionate, caring, humorous and larger-than-life character."" ""He is one of a kind and will be greatly missed."" ""He had such a zest for life.""

how much was needed to control spread, but we did just let the autumn wave get
too far."" Asked if there was one thing that could have made a
difference, he added: âIn some sense back in March we had much less information to go on
than in September. ""Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back
in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of
keeping case numbers at reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the
deaths weâve seen - not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths weâve seen in

Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has abandoned plans to allow some children out of their homes for the first time in 10 months. They've been cooped up to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under-15s have been unable to legally go outside since March - one of the toughest virus restrictions on children anywhere in the world. It has had an effect on their schooling and mental health, as well as the economy because family trips have been impossible. Last week though, the government finally said 10 to 14-year-olds would be allowed out from February. But President Duterte has now rescinded that order after the more contagious UK variant of the virus was discovered. Duterte told children they'd have to continue watching TV instead. While the UK reaches a milestone in terms of the number of deaths today, it is one year ago that the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand, officials had maintained that the virus outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact, coronavirus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. We look back at thosefive critical days early on in the outbreak.

Speaking to 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty, Jamie said his dad was beginning to retire, but travelling to London one day a week, when he became ill.

Curfew stays despite 'scum' riots in Dutch cities,"This video can not be played Maaike NeufÃ©glise said she found blood on the floor of her shop alongside upturned stands and damaged equipment The Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs across the Netherlands. Shops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said: ""It's scum doing this"". More than 180 arrests have been made. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". The criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Shop-owners in Rotterdam, Den Bosch and other cities spent Tuesday morning cleaning up the debris from Monday night's violence. Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb sent a passionate message to ""shameless thieves"" who had caused the damage: ""Does it make you feel good that you've helped ruin your city? To wake up with a bag full of stolen stuff beside you?"" Dutch PM condemns curfew riots A night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 was imposed last Saturday to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine. Mr Hoekstra said they would not ""capitulate to a few idiots"" and anyone who caused damage should be tracked down and be made to pay for it. Some of the worst damage was caused in the southern city of Den Bosch The Netherlands has had nearly a million confirmed Covid cases since the start of the outbreak, with more than 13,500 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University in the US, which is tracking the pandemic. Riot police clashed with protesters in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, as well as Amersfoort, Den Bosch, Alphen and Helmond. Some of the worst disturbances were in the south of Rotterdam where police said 10 officers were hurt. Most of the rioters were youths or young men, and Amsterdam's mayor appealed to parents to keep young people indoors. This video can not be played Dutch police have described it as the worst unrest in four decades Fires were lit on the streets of The Hague, where police on bicycles attempted to move small clusters of men who threw stones and fireworks. In Den Bosch in the south, rioters set off fireworks, broke windows, looted a supermarket and overturned cars. A local woman told Dutch radio that masked youths had left a trail of destruction in the city centre. ""I saw windows smashed and fireworks going off. Really crazy, just like a war zone,"" she said. Several cities have vowed to introduce emergency measures in an effort to prevent more disturbances Roads into Den Bosch were closed to stop people joining the rioters and Mayor Jack Mikkers imposed an emergency order banning gatherings on Tuesday. The region's chief prosecutor, Heleen Rutgers, urged parents to ensure teenagers stayed at home.  ""Start talking about how to respond to calls on social media to go and turn up somewhere,"" she told public broadcaster NOS. In some southern cities, such as Maastricht and Breda, football fans marched through the centres promising to protect them from rioters. Ex-football international Robin van Persie appealed to people in Rotterdam to keep ""our beautiful city"" intact. The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations?

But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. There has been widespread shock at the violence. In Rotterdam, where police used water cannon against the rioters, the mayor signed an emergency decree, giving police broader powers of arrest. The prime minister said the police had the government's full support: ""The riots have nothing to do with protesting or fighting for freedom."" Rotterdam shop-owner Emrah KÃ¶ker said he had no words for what he had seen. ""How can this happen in the Netherlands?"" he asked Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. The justice minister said he challenged anyone to explain what looting a shop had to do with coronavirus. In Den Bosch, Maaike NeufÃ©glise said the damage to her shop was heartbreaking and ran into thousands of euros. ""Everything's ruined. I saw the videos, it was a complete invasion. There must have been 40 people in our store,"" she told broadcaster Omroep Brabant. The city's mayor said police had struggled to respond to the violence because they were needed in other nearby towns. Netherlands: Third night of anti-lockdown riots.

People out of mine-flooded homes for six months,"This video can not be played Cerys Thomas said her mother's conservatory windows were blown open by the force of the water Some residents flooded out of their homes after a mine blow-out will not be able to return for at least six months, the Coal Authority has said. Eighty peoplewere evacuated from Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday and residents wereurged to stay away due to safety fears. Some have returned but others will be out for months, and the Coal Authority (CA) could buy a small number of homes. Water flowing out of Drummau Mountain has found a ""new path"", it said. This video can not be played The Coal Authority explains what is known so far about the Skewen mine ""blow-out"" The CA said the ""blow out"" was caused by a blockage underground which led to the water breaking out to find the easiest path. Is Wales' coalmining heritage behind flooding? Flood victims face 'months' before returning home Financial help offered to flood victims Chief executive Lisa Pinney said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months but a new water management system will have to be built deep underground to divert the water, which will take at least six months. She said the authority was looking at ""every option"" to get as many people back in their homes as quickly and safely as possible, including buying some homes from residents. At least 80 people had to leave their homes in the village after flooding Water is now coming out of the ground at the junction of Drummau Road and Goshen Park in the village. According to the authority, there is a mineshaft at the junction of Goshen Park. Water had been flowing through an underground channel there. However a blockage has formed in it, and water has built up in the channel over time, causing the blow out.

""Water, when it's found a path, that tends to be its new path. What we need to do is put in this new permanent solution, so that it is properly managed and it will have a new permanent pipeline which will take it safely through the village and out to a discharge point."" A temporary water diversion will remain in place in the meantime. She said the authority was focusing on alternative access to get as many people back in their homes ""on a permanent basis"" as soon as possible. However she cautioned: ""There will be at least a small number [for] who that will be a longer period of time. ""I hope it will be a very, very small number [who will have to leave for six months]. There are different options and we need to have that discussion with anybody that it might affect."" Firefighters in Skewen helped evacuate people from their homes The authority does not think any houses are structurally unsafe and does not use compulsory purchase orders on properties. Ms Pinney said: ""We do sometimes buy houses if the residents are happy to sell them and we have a reason for needing to do that so for example if there was a case of real subsidence for example.""

School to withdraw places for Covid-breach pupils,"The school's head teacher said it was unacceptable staff were being put at risk A school has threatened to withdraw places for pupils who have told teachers they are visiting people outside their households. Yew Tree Community School in Oldham said several children had admitted visiting friends, neighbours and family contrary to Covid-19 lockdown rules. Head teacher Martine Buckley said she would take the action when ""parents were putting staff in danger"". The Department for Education said ""all vulnerable"" pupils should go to school. During the current lockdown schools are open only to pupils listed as vulnerable and the children of key workers. Families can form ""childcare bubbles,external"" with one other household, and children who live with two parents who live separately can move between households - but any further mixing is forbidden. When could lockdown rules be reviewed? Will schools reopen before Easter? What is the risk of schools spreading coronavirus? In a letter posted on the Chadderton school's Facebook page, Mrs Buckley said she was ""upset"" to be writing it ""but I feel I must"". ""Our lovely children are open and honest and they tell us about their lives and activities,"" she said. ""A number of them are telling us that they are visiting friends, neighbours and family which is against the law. ""Our teachers and support staff are putting their own safety at risk to look after your children and they should be confident you are doing your bit to follow the lockdown rules. ""I am afraid I will have to withdraw the offer of a place in school to children whose parents are putting us in danger."" Yew Tree is a primary school in Chadderton, Oldham While a number of parents applauded the message, others have been angered. One man told the BBC his two grandchildren were at the school and children as young as four have been asked about their activities at home, which was ""out of order"". ""My granddaughters are pretty intimidated by the tone,"" he said. ""Asking them questions like that and then the answers off the back of that. They come to a decision of whether they are going to displace them or not."" The school has about 660 pupils aged between four and 11. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said during the current lockdown, schools were ""open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers"". ""We expect schools to work with families to ensure all critical worker children are given access to a place if this is required,"" she added. ""We encourage all vulnerable children to attend.""

Vaccine supply fears grow amid EU export threat,"Reports suggest AstraZeneca may have warned of a 60% cut to doses available The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive. AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers. The EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding ""fair distribution"". The UK's vaccine minister warned of ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"". AstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant. Read our latest reports on Covid here Vaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates. Separately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people. Last week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems andPfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower. In response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to ""provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Cases, deaths and vaccinations by country She said the 27-member EU bloc would ""take any action required to protect its citizens"". German Health Minister Jens Spahn backed her call, saying: ""This is not about EU first, this is about Europe's fair share."" Chancellor Angela Merkel told the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum, usually held in Davos, there should be a ""fair distribution"" across the world. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told forum: ""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations."" A worker with Covid vaccines sets out to inoculate patients in Dillenberg, Germany The row could affect supplies to the UK of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Responding to the EU's comments, the UK's Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawisaid on Tuesday that supplies were ""tight""and warned against what he called ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"", adding: ""No-one is safe until the whole world is safe."" He said he was confident the UK would receive enough doses to meet its targets - a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. The EU has already faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines, which it buys on behalf of all member states. Ms Kyriakides tweeted that Monday's talks with AstraZeneca ""resulted in dissatisfaction,externalwith the lack of clarity and insufficient explanations"". She said the EU had requested ""a detailed planning of vaccine deliveries"" and the next meeting with the company would be held on Wednesday. AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish multinational headquartered in England, said it was ""doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible"". The AstraZeneca vaccine is being used already in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to green light it at the end of this month. The bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Last week, AstraZeneca said ""reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain"" meant the number of initial doses for EU member states would be lower. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. An AstraZeneca partner plant in Belgium involved in the ""viral vector"" process - the delivery of genetic material into cells - is thought to be the problem. But one German member of the European Parliament, Peter Liese, told Reuters news agency that the statement that there were difficulties in the EU supply chain but not elsewhere was ""flimsy"" and there should be ""no problem to get the vaccine from the UK to the continent"". European officials familiar with Monday's EU-AstraZeneca meeting said the company had offered to bring forward deliveries by a week to 7 February, but this did not mean an increase in supplies for the quarter. The Serum Institute of India also produces a large amount of AstraZeneca jabs, but has no immediate plans to divert to the EU. Other nations, including Australia and Thailand, have said they have also been told of a drop in AstraZeneca supply. The AstraZeneca reduction is a serious blow in the wake of Pfizer-BioNTech's statement. Pfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeksbecause of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, which is already being used on patients around the bloc. Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to inoculate 70% of adults in the EU by the end of August. By Stephanie Hegarty, BBC Population correspondent As the diplomatic tussle goes on between vaccine-producing countries in Europe there could be a rare bit of good news for the rest of the world, including the lower-income countries already struggling to secure a supply. Covax, an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization that aims to distribute vaccines around the world more fairly, says it doesn't expect its supply of vaccines to be affected. Most of that supply is coming from a producer in India with some also manufactured in South Korea. Covax says it's on schedule to deliver its first vaccines in lower-income countries in February, helped by the fact that the US under President Joe Biden recently committed $4bn (Â£3.5bn) to the scheme. Covax: The global plan to share vaccines fairly Germany's health ministry on Tuesday firmly denied reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for AstraZeneca among the elderly. The reports, including in the Handelsblatt economic daily, cited sources saying the efficacy was as low as 8% in the over 65s. But the ministry said its review of the data in the reports ""did not allow this assumption"" and that it ""appears that two things have been mixed up in the reports"". AstraZeneca issued a statement saying the reports were ""completely incorrect"", adding: ""In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose."" UK Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the reports had created ""confusion and concern"" and risked ""adding to the spread of disinformation"".

Arena operator denies 'sacrificing safety',"Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the 2017 bombing The operator of the Manchester Arena has denied it ""deliberately sacrificed safety"" in the aftermath of the 2017 bombing. An inquiry has heard how security failurescontributed to the arena being unsafe on the night of the attack. Venue operator SMG has disputed claims it ""was akin to the worst kind of Dickensian factory owner, deliberately and cynically sacrificing safety"". British Transport Police (BTP) has admitted it made mistakes. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device as fans left the arena following an Ariana Grande concert. What is the Manchester Arena Inquiry? The road to the Manchester Arena bombing Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 years Andrew O'Connor QC, representing SMG, told the inquiry the firm had always accepted responsibility for security in the City Room, where the bomb exploded. But he denied the firm had sought to ""blame others,"" adding it had ""simply sought to explain how SMG discharged its responsibilities"". ""It is for that purpose and not for prevarication, finger-pointing or buck passing that we have sought to explain to you SMG's relationship with all the other organisations involved,"" he added. Mr O'Connor said the company accepted there were ""shortcomings"" with its written risk assessments but maintained it ""did have a system for assessing terrorism-related risk"". The public inquiry into the bombing will look at whether the attack could have been prevented Patrick Gibbs QC, representing BTP, told the inquiry the force made five key mistakes on the night of the bombing. This included having no officers on patrol at Victoria station when Abedi made his final journey to the arena and not having an officer in the City Room at the end of the concert. Other mistakes included failing to complete a written risk-assessment for the concert, officers not following instructions from their duty sergeant and that PC Stephen Corke, the most experienced officer on duty, was not at the arena complex for the end of the event. BTP has since made significant changes to its procedures since the attack, the inquiry was told. These include monthly meetings with the arena operators to discuss events.

Five days that shaped the outbreak,"A year ago, the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand officials had maintained that the outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact the virus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. This is the story of five critical days early in the outbreak. By 30 December, several people had been admitted to hospitals in the central city of Wuhan, having fallen ill with high fever and pneumonia. The first known case was a man in his 70s who had fallen ill on 1 December. Many of those were connected to a sprawling live animal market, Huanan Seafood Market, and doctors had begun to suspect this wasn't regular pneumonia. Samples from infected lungs had been sent to genetic sequencing companies to identify the cause of the disease, and preliminary results had indicated a novel coronavirus similar to Sars. The local health authorities and the country's Center for Disease Control (CDC) had already been notified, but nothing had been said to the public. Although no-one knew it at the time, between 2,300 and 4,000 people were by now likely infected, according to arecent model by MOBS Lab at Northeastern University in Boston,external. The outbreak was also thought to be doubling in size every few days. Epidemiologists say that at this early part of an outbreak, each day and even each hour is critical. Wuhanâs Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was sealed off on 1 January 2020 At around 16:00 on 30 December, the head of the Emergency Department at Wuhan Central Hospital was handed the results of a test carried out by sequencing lab Capital Bio Medicals in Beijing. She went into a cold sweat as she read the report, according to an interview given later to Chinese state media. At the top were the alarming words: ""SARS CORONAVIRUS"". She circled them in bright red, and passed it on to colleagues over the Chinese messaging site WeChat. Within an hour and a half, the grainy image with its large red circle reached a doctor in the hospital's ophthalmology department, Li Wenliang. He shared it with his hundreds-strong university class group, adding the warning, ""Don't circulate the message outside this group. Get your family and loved ones to take precautions."" When Sars spread through southern China in late 2002 and 2003, Beijing covered up the outbreak, insisting that everything was under control. This allowed the virus to spread around the world. Beijing's response invoked international criticism and - worryingly for a regime deeply concerned about stability - anger and protests within China. Between 2002 and 2004, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill almost 800 worldwide. Robert Maguire of the WHO and a Chinese doctor visit a Sars patient in Guangzhou, China â April 2003 Over the coming hours, screen shots of Li's message spread widely online. Across China, millions of people began talking about Sars online. It would turn out that the sequencers made a mistake - this was not Sars, but a new coronavirus very similar to it. But this was a critical moment. News of a possible outbreak had escaped. The Wuhan Health Commission was already aware that there was something going on in the city's hospitals. That day, officials from the National Health Commission in Beijing arrived, and lung samples were sent to at least five state labs in Wuhan and Beijing to sequence the virus in parallel. Residential housing blocks, Wuhan, China Now, as messages suggesting the possible return of Sars began flying over Chinese social media, the Wuhan Health Commission sent two orders out to hospitals. It instructed them to report all cases direct to the Health Commission, and told them not to make anything public without authorisation. Within 12 minutes, these orders were leaked online. It might have taken a couple more days for the online chatter to make the leap from Chinese-speaking social media to the wider world if it wasn't for the efforts of veteran epidemiologist Marjorie Pollack. The deputy editor of ProMed-mail, an organisation which sends out alerts on disease outbreaks worldwide, received an email from a contact in Taiwan, asking if she knew anything about the chatter online. Dr Marjorie Pollack is an epidemiologist based in New York Back in February 2003, ProMed had been the first to break the news of Sars. Now, Pollack had deja vu. ""My reaction was: 'We're in trouble,'"" she told the BBC. Three hours later, she had finished writingan emergency post,external, requesting more information on the new outbreak. It was sent out to ProMed's approximately 80,000 subscribers at one minute to midnight. As word began to spread, Professor George F Gao, director general of China's Center for Disease Control [CDC], was receiving offers of help from contacts around the world. China revamped its infectious disease infrastructure after Sars - and in 2019, Gao had promised that China's vast online surveillance system would be able to prevent another outbreak like it. But two scientists who contacted Gao say the CDC head did not seem alarmed. ""I sent a really long text to George Gao, offering to send a team out and do anything to support them,"" Dr Peter Daszak, the president of New York-based infectious diseases research group EcoHealth Alliance, told the BBC. But he says that all he received in reply was a short message wishing him Happy New Year. Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, George F Gao â 22 January 2020 Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in New York was also trying to reach Gao. Just as he was having dinner to ring in the New Year, Gao returned his call. The details Lipkin reveals about their conversation offer new insights into what leading Chinese officials were prepared to say at this critical point. ""He had identified the virus. It was a new coronavirus. And it was not highly transmissible. This didn't really resonate with me because I'd heard that many, many people had been infected,"" Lipkin told the BBC. ""I don't think he was duplicitous, I think he was just wrong."" Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin Lipkin says he thinks Gao should have released the sequences they had already obtained. My view is that you get it out. This is too important to hesitate."" Gao, who refused the BBC's requests for an interview, has told state media that the sequences were released as soon as possible, and that he never said publicly that there was no human-to-human transmission. That day, the Wuhan Health Commission issued a press release stating that 27 cases of viral pneumonia had been identified, but that there was no clear evidence of human to human transmission. TV channel CGTN reporting 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" It would be a further 12 days before China shared the genetic sequences with the international community. The Chinese government refused multiple interview requests by the BBC. Instead, it gave us detailed statements on China's response, which state that in the fight against Covid-19 China ""has always acted with openness, transparency and responsibility, and â¦ in a timely manner.""

International law stipulates that new infectious disease outbreaks of global concern be reported to the World Health Organization within 24 hours. But on 1 January the WHO still had not had official notification of the outbreak. The previous day, officials there had spotted the ProMed post and reports online, so they contacted China's National Health Commission. ""It was reportable,"" says Professor Lawrence Gostin, Director of the WHO Collaborating Center on national and global health law at Georgetown University in Washington DC, and a member of the International Health Regulations roster of experts. ""The failure to report clearly was a violation of the International Health Regulations."" Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist who would become the agency's Covid-19 technical lead, joined the first of many emergency conference calls in the middle of the night on 1 January. ""We had the assumptions initially that it may be a new coronavirus. For us it wasn't a matter of if human to human transmission was happening, it was what is the extent of it and where is that happening."" Dr Maria Van Kerkhove It was two days before China responded to the WHO. But what they revealed was vague - that there were now 44 cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause. China says that it communicated regularly and fully with the WHO from 3 January. But recordings of internal WHO meetings obtained by the Associated Press (AP) news agency some of which were shared with PBS Frontline and the BBC, paint a different picture, revealing the frustration that senior WHO officials felt by the following week. ""'There's been no evidence of human to human transmission' is not good enough. We need to see the data,"" Mike Ryan WHO's health emergencies programme director is heard saying. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland The WHO was legally required to state the information it had been provided by China. Although they suspected human to human transmission, the WHO were not able to confirm this for a further three weeks. ""Those concerns are not something they ever aired publicly.  Instead, they basically deferred to China,"" says AP's Dake Kang. ""Ultimately, the impression that the rest of the world got was just what the Chinese authorities wanted.  Which is that everything was under control. Which of course it wasn't."" The number of people infected by the virus was doubling in size every few days, and more and more people were turning up at Wuhan's hospitals. But now - instead of allowing doctors to share their concerns publicly - state media began a campaign that effectively silenced them. On 2 January, China Central Television ran a story about the doctors who spread the news about an outbreak four days earlier. The doctors, referred to only as ""rumour mongers"" and ""internet users"", were brought in for questioning by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau and 'dealt with' 'in accordance with the law'. One of the doctors was Li Wenliang, the eye doctor whose warning had gone viral. He signed a confession. In February,the doctor died of Covid-19. Chinese doctor, Dr Li Wenliang, in his hospital bed The Chinese government says that this is not evidence that it was trying to suppress news of the outbreak, and that doctors like Li were being urged not to spread unconfirmed information. But the impact of this public dressing down was critical. For though it was becoming apparent to doctors that there was, in fact, human-to-human transmission, they were prevented from going public. A health worker from Li's hospital, Wuhan Central, told us that over the next few days ""there were so many people who had a fever. It was out of control. We started to panic. [But] The hospital told us that we were not allowed to speak to anyone."" Medical staff at Jin Yintan Hospital, Wuhan - 17 January 2020 The Chinese government told us that ""it takes a rigorous scientific process to determine if a new virus can be transmitted from person to person"". The authorities would continue to maintain for a further 18 days that there was no human-to-human transmission. Labs across the country were racing to map the complete genetic sequence of the virus. Among them was a renowned virologist in Shanghai, Professor Zhang Yongzhen who began sequencing on 3 January. After having worked for two days straight, he obtained a complete sequence. His results revealed a virus that was similar to Sars, and therefore likely transmissible. Prof Zhang Yongzhen On 5 January, Zhang's office wrote to the National Health Commission advising taking precautionary measures in public places. ""On that very day, he was working to try and get information released as soon as possible, so the rest of the world could see what it was and so we could get diagnostics going"", says Zhang's research partner, Professor Edward Holmes an evolutionary virologist at the University of Sydney. But Zhang could not make his findings public. On January 3, the National Health Commission had sent a secret memorandum to labs banning unauthorised scientists from working on the virus and disclosing the information to the public. ""What the notice effectively did,"" says AP's Dake Kang, ""is it silenced individual scientists and laboratories from revealing information about this virus and potentially allowing word of it to leak out to the outside world and alarm people."" None of the labs went public with the genetic sequence of the virus. China continued to maintain it was viral pneumonia with no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. It would be six days before it announced that the new virus was a coronavirus, and even then, it did not share any genetic sequences to allow other countries to develop tests and begin tracing the spread of the virus. Prof Edward Holmes Three days later, on 11 January, Zhang decided it was time to put his neck on the line. As he boarded a plane between Beijing and Shanghai, he authorised Holmes to release the sequence. The decision came at a personal cost - his lab was closed the next day for ""rectification"" - but his action broke the deadlock. The next day state scientists released the sequences they had obtained. The international scientific community swung into action, and a toolkit for a diagnostic test was publicly available by 13 January. Despite the evidence from scientists and doctors, China would not confirm there was human-to-human transmission until 20 January. Illustration of spike proteins (red) of Covid-19 binding with receptors (blue) on a target human cell At the beginning of any emerging disease outbreak, says health law expert Lawrence Gostin, it's always chaotic. ""It was always going to be very difficult to control this virus, from day one. But by the time we knew [the international community] it was transmissible human to human, I think the cat was already out the bag, it already spread. ""That was the shot we had, and we lost it."" As Wang Linfa, a bat virologist at Duke-Nus Medical School in Singapore, says: ""January 20th is the dividing line, before that the Chinese could have done much better. After that, the rest of the world should be really on high alert and do much better."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Residents out of mine-flooded homes for six months,"This video can not be played Cerys Thomas said her mother's conservatory windows were blown open by the force of the water Some residents flooded out of their homes after a mine blow-out will not be able to return for at least six months, the Coal Authority has said. Eighty peoplewere evacuated from Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, on Thursday and residents wereurged to stay away due to safety fears. Some have returned but others will be out for months, and the Coal Authority (CA) could buy a small number of homes. Water flowing out of Drummau Mountain has found a ""new path"", it said. This video can not be played The Coal Authority explains what is known so far about the Skewen mine ""blow-out"" The CA said the ""blow out"" was caused by a blockage underground which led to the water breaking out to find the easiest path. Is Wales' coalmining heritage behind flooding? Flood victims face 'months' before returning home Financial help offered to flood victims Chief executive Lisa Pinney said work to cap the mine shaft would take three months but a new water management system will have to be built deep underground to divert the water, which will take at least six months. She said the authority was looking at ""every option"" to get as many people back in their homes as quickly and safely as possible, including buying some homes from residents. At least 80 people had to leave their homes in the village after flooding Water is now coming out of the ground at the junction of Drummau Road and Goshen Park in the village. According to the authority, there is a mineshaft at the junction of Goshen Park. Water had been flowing through an underground channel there. However a blockage has formed in it, and water has built up in the channel over time, causing the blow out. This video can not be played Teresa Dalling says a river of orange water rushed through the village on Thursday Ms Pinney said: ""There's a lot of water coming off the mountain, off the extensive, very ancient mine-workings on the hills above. ""Water, when it's found a path, that tends to be its new path. What we need to do is put in this new permanent solution, so that it is properly managed and it will have a new permanent pipeline which will take it safely through the village and out to a discharge point."" A temporary water diversion will remain in place in the meantime. She said the authority was focusing on alternative access to get as many people back in their homes ""on a permanent basis"" as soon as possible. However she cautioned: ""There will be at least a small number [for] who that will be a longer period of time. ""I hope it will be a very, very small number [who will have to leave for six months]. There are different options and we need to have that discussion with anybody that it might affect."" Firefighters in Skewen helped evacuate people from their homes The authority does not think any houses are structurally unsafe and does not use compulsory purchase orders on properties. Ms Pinney said: ""We do sometimes buy houses if the residents are happy to sell them and we have a reason for needing to do that so for example if there was a case of real subsidence for example."" The water rushed through the streets of Skewen A dedicated residents' phone line on 0800 2884268 will go live from Wednesday at 09:00 GMT and Neath Port Talbot council is puttingupdates on its website,external. The number will be staffed every day from 9am to 5pm until Friday, 5 February including the weekend, and then from Monday to Friday for as long as needed. Appointments to discuss remedial work, what financial support is available and arranging liaison with insurers if relevant would be available over the phone or video call. Covid secure face-to-face appointments will also be available at Neath Port Talbot council's incident support centre at Abbey Primary School on Thursday, Friday and some days next week. Ms Pinney said they were working to get residents in as soon as possible so that insurance assessors could come in and people could start work on their homes.

The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly,"The US has pledged to donate 500 million more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to poorer nations from next year - bringing its total commitment to more than one billion. ""To beat the pandemic here, we need to beat it everywhere,"" US President Joe Biden told a virtual Covid-19 summit. The donation will be routed through Covax - the international scheme designed to ensure low-income countries aren't left behind in the fight against Covid. It came amid growing warnings over the pace of global vaccinations, and inequity of access. Covax,externalwas created last year to ensure that Covid vaccines are made available around the world, with richer countries subsidising costs for poorer nations. The scheme hopes to distribute enough vaccines to protect at least 20% of the population in 92 low- or medium-income countries - starting with healthcare workers and the most vulnerable groups. Its initial goal was to provide two billion doses of vaccines worldwide in 2021, and 1.8 billion doses to 92 poorer countries by early 2022. Covax is run by a number of international organisations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the UN children's charity, Unicef. Ghana was the first country to receive Covax vaccines in February. Since then, more than 303 million doses have been shipped through Covax to 142 countries around the world, including Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia and Fiji. Most doses are going to poorer countries, but some have been sent to wealthier countries such as Canada,which defended its request. Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Covax works with with governments and vaccine manufacturers around the world. Supporters include the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the UAE, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and Portugal. Countries have pledged to donate both money and surplus doses from their own vaccine supplies. The US joined Covax after President Biden took office in January 2021 The UK, Japan, Canada and the European Union are among those to have committed to supplying tens of millions of doses. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus previously criticised wealthier nations for ""gobbling up"" the global vaccine supply. G7 countries have purchased over a third of the world's vaccine supply, despite making up only 13% of the global population. Six vaccines have been given ""emergency use authorisation"" by the WHO, meaning they can be shared via Covax: AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Janssen, Moderna, Sinopharm and Sinovac. However, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses have been delivered so far. Moderna has agreed to supply 500 million doses at its ""lowest-tiered price"", but most won't be available until 2022. Covax has been criticised for being slow. Some initial targets were missed, partly as a result of the poor health infrastructure in many of the recipient countries, and partly because of vaccine hesitancy. Covax supplied AstraZeneca Covid vaccines arriving in Madagascar in May 2021 Deliveries were also delayed because of the deteriorating situation in India. Officials thererestricted exports to protect their own populationamid soaring infection rates. Theseare set to resume from October. Covax has told the BBC that too many donations have come in small quantities, at the last minute and with little time left before they expire. This makes it very hard to get them to where they are needed. Representatives of the scheme also note that only a small percentage of the pledges made earlier this year have turned into actual doses. Unicef executive director Henrietta Fore said countries needed to ""accelerate their donation plans"", with low-income nations unable to wait any longer. While many high-income countries have now given at least one shot to more than half their populations, only 2% of people in low-income countries have had their first dose, according to data from the University of Oxford. Covax says it is now expecting to hit its ""key milestone"" of releasing two billion doses for delivery some time early next year. Why are vaccines being destroyed in Africa? Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? In total, some six billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in over 195 countries worldwide. However, while some countries have fully vaccinated a large amount of their population, many others have only just begun, or in some cases are still waiting for their first doses to arrive. Covax aims to close that gap. ""With a fast-moving pandemic, no one is safe, unless everyone is safe,"" the WHO says on its website. But even if Covax meets its goal to vaccinate 20% of the population in its 92 target countries, that's well short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic. The WHO has suggested that figure is at least 70%. People may also need booster doses to remain protected.

Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has abandoned plans to allow some children out of their homes for the first time in 10 months. They've been cooped up to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under-15s have been unable to legally go outside since March - one of the toughest virus restrictions on children anywhere in the world. It has had an effect on their schooling and mental health, as well as the economy because family trips have been impossible. Last week though, the government finally said 10 to 14-year-olds would be allowed out from February. But President Duterte has now rescinded that order after the more contagious UK variant of the virus was discovered. Duterte told children they'd have to continue watching TV instead. While the UK reaches a milestone in terms of the number of deaths today, it is one year ago that the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand, officials had maintained that the virus outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact, coronavirus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. We look back at thosefive critical days early on in the outbreak.

Listen back on the free BBC Sounds app. Jake HortonBBC Reality Check President Joe Biden has said that the US might be able to
boost its daily vaccination roll-out targets after criticising the Trump
administrationâs record. Biden, who has described the previous vaccine programme
as a ""dismal failure"", has committed to getting 100 million vaccine doses done
in his first 100 days and has since said: ""I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than one million a day."" Is he right about the vaccine roll-out under the Trump
administration? As of 20 January, when Biden became US president, about
16.5 million vaccines had been administered. That is some way off the Trump administration's target of
vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020. In fact, fewer than three million people had received a jab
by 31 December. Vaccinations have sped up since the start of the year. The daily average for the week before Trump left office
was less than 900,000, according toOur World in Data,external. That figure has since risen above one million doses a day,
and Biden has come under some
scrutiny for not setting a more ambitious target. When you look at the countries doing the most vaccinations by population, the US is fourth after Israel, the UAE and the UK in terms of doses per 100 people. Read more here Reality Check Israel has the highest per capita vaccination rate in the
world - but vaccines are yet to be rolled out to Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, viewed as occupied territories by the international community. Israelâs health minister says it is the Palestinian
Authorityâs responsibility to provide healthcare under an interim deal for
self-rule in Palestinian areas. But UN human rights experts say there are international rules about the duty of an occupying power to
provide healthcare - although Israel often argues it isn't technically
occupying the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem are entitled to be
vaccinated against Covid - they have Israeli residency status. And medics
working in Palestinian hospitals there are also getting vaccines. Some health experts and business leaders have also called
for Israel to include other Palestinians in its vaccine programme, as around
tens of thousands of  Palestinians travel daily to work in Israel and in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the
West Bank â said they are doing deals with four companies that will provide
enough vaccines for 70% of its people, and will get another 20% from the World
Health Organization-backed Covax scheme. But there are few details at the moment about when vaccines
will start or who will receive them. Read more here Among the figures on the pandemic in the UK today came news that more than 6.85m people have had a coronavirus vaccination first dose. Another 279,757 people had received a jab as of Monday,official figures show.,external One of those getting a vaccination on Tuesday was actress and TV presenter Floella Benjamin,who tweeted a picture of the occasion,external. Baroness Benjamin, 71, who made her name as the host of TV's Play School in the 1970s, is now a campaigner for young people. Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Denmark Mink farmers in Denmark - the worldâs largest producer of mink pelts until a coronavirus mass cull - have been given a compensation package worth more than 19 billion Danish kroner (Â£2.2bn). It was voted through by MPs late on Monday. The agriculture minister said it was a chance to move on, while the Danish mink breeders association said the industry would never return, as China and Poland could produce mink furs much more cheaply. Mink farmers were ordered to destroy their entire stock of about 17 million animals last November, over fears that a mutant strain of Covid-19 could pass from mink to humans. But chaos followed. The scientific basis of the order came into question, and mass graves appeared to be poisoning soil and water supplies. The issue led to the resignation of the previous agriculture minister. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Some of the worst violence was in Rotterdam The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations? There are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians. Some feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew. The unrest was initially seen as a response to the first ""stay-at-home"" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. This video can not be played Netherlands: Third night of anti-lockdown riots Away from UK news now, and nearby, in the Netherlands, the Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs. Shops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra condemned the violence, saying: ""It's scum doing this"". More than 180 arrests have been made. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". The criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte. A night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 (03:30 GMT) was imposed last Saturday to help to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine.

There have been more than 3.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 100,000 people have died, government figures show. You canlook up how many cases are near to you here. Reality Check At his Downing Street briefing this evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âI think the amount we invested in the NHS, even before the pandemic began, was
more than any time in modern memory.â In 2018, the government pledged that
spending on the NHS in England would increase by Â£20.5bn by 2023-24. This meant that the NHS budget
would increase by 3.2% a year, once inflation was accounted for. However, it is still substantially
below the 6% annual growth seen under the Labour governments in power between
1997 and 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Itâs important when comparing
spending to include inflation, because it accounts for the fact that things get
more expensive over the years. Since the crisis began, the NHS
budget has increased dramatically. In the most recent year, the
Department of Health and Social Careâs budget went up by Â£50bn, but it is still
unclear whether the health service will receive more money once the crisis has
ended. ""She was a passionate, caring, humorous and larger-than-life character."" ""He is one of a kind and will be greatly missed."" ""He had such a zest for life.""

autumn of last year could have saved lives. Speaking as more than 100,000 deaths were recorded,
Prof Neil Ferguson  told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme: ""The new variant was unpredictable and did change our understanding of
how much was needed to control spread, but we did just let the autumn wave get
too far."" Asked if there was one thing that could have made a
difference, he added: âIn some sense back in March we had much less information to go on
than in September. ""Had we acted both earlier and with greater stringency back
in September when we first saw case numbers going up, and had a policy of
keeping case numbers at reasonably low levels, then I think a lot of the
deaths weâve seen - not all by any means, but a lot of the deaths weâve seen in
the last four or five months - could have been avoided.â  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Farmers breach Delhi's Red Fort in huge protest,"This video can not be played India police fire tear gas as farmers break through barricades A rally against agriculture reforms in India turned violent on Tuesday, after protesting farmers broke through police barricades to storm Delhi's historic Red Fort complex. On foot and in tractors, the protesters were part of a huge rally planned for India's Republic Day. Many protesters diverted from agreed routes and clashes broke out with police. One protester died and more than 80 police officers were injured. Mobile internet services were suspended in parts of Delhi and some metro stations closed as security forces scrambled to restore order. The government is yet to comment on the violence, but reports say Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting with Delhi police to discuss the situation. Some protesters hoisted flags at the top of the dome on the Red Fort The government says the reforms that spurred the protests will liberalise the agriculture sector, but farmers say they will lose income. Tens of thousands of them have been striking on the outskirts of Delhi since November, demanding the laws be repealed. Last week they rejected a government offer to put the laws on hold. It is one of the longest farmers-led protests India has ever seen, pitting the community against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government. Police allowed Tuesday's rally on the condition that it would not interrupt the annual Republic Day parade in central Delhi. Republic Day is a national holiday that marks the anniversary of India officially adopting its constitution on 26 January 1950. Farmers were given specific routes for the rally, which would largely be confined to the outskirts. But a group of them converged on the historic Red Fort. They breached security and clambered onto the walls and domes of the fortress, even hoisting flags alongside the national flag. By Tuesday afternoon, police said they had removed protesters from the complex, but the situation remained tense. ""We came here to deliver a message to the Modi government, our job is done. We will go back now,"" one protesting farmer told NDTV. In pictures: Farmers clash with police in Delhi How Modi misread the mood of India's angry farmers India farmers: The viral image that defines a protest Other protesters broke through police barricades and marched towards central Delhi, where India's parliament is located. Images from the ITO metro station junction - on the route to central Delhi - showed police clashing with farmers and using tear gas and batons. Protesters driving tractors appeared to be deliberately trying to run over police personnel. Local media reported injuries on both sides. At least one protester died at the junction when his tractor overturned as police fired tear gas. BBC correspondents said protesters outnumbered the police at the ITO junction, leaving them struggling to control the crowd.

Big rise in redundancies among young people,"The number of people out of work in the UK has continued to rise, with those aged 25 to 34 facing the biggest risk of losing their jobs. In the three months to November, people in that age group had a redundancy rate of 16.2 per 1,000, a fivefold increase on the same period a year earlier. Unemployment rose to 5% from 4.9% as Covid continued to hit the jobs market. Some 1.72 million were jobless,the Office for National Statistics said,external, the highest level in five years. That was 418,000 more than in the same period the previous year, the biggest increase since late 2009. Abigail Ward, 27, freely admits that she was ""a bit naive"" when she began her latest job hunt after being made redundant as a store manager at J Crew in London last September. Having spent the past five years since graduating in retail management, she has a passion for bricks-and-mortar retail and ""the value of face-to-face customer interactions"" - and it's an area she wants to stay in. ""I knew it would be hard, but I've been in this position before,"" she told the BBC. ""Back then, it only took me three or four weeks to find a role and maybe 10 job applications, so it all happened quite seamlessly, whereas this time around, it's definitely been a lot more difficult. ""I've probably sent off around 30 to 40 job applications in the last six months, the majority of which just go into the abyss. You never hear a word."" However, Abigail has managed to get to the final interview stage for a job - ""with me and just one other candidate"" - on four separate occasions. ""Unfortunately, I've missed out on each of those occasions,"" she says. ""There are so many hundreds of applications and it's so competitive,"" she adds. ""It's definitely been a big challenge."" What are my rights if I am made redundant? The hospitality industry was worst hit by the rise in joblessness, followed by manufacturing. In both sectors, the number of people unemployed was up by more than 50,000 on the previous year. Across all age groups, redundancies rose to a record high of 14.2 per 1,000 people. However, job vacancies also rose, with 81,000 new openings reported in the three months. ONS deputy chief executive Sam Beckett told the BBC that the UK had not seen such rises in unemployment since the global financial crisis. ""Payroll numbers show the number of workers on payroll have fallen by over 828,000 since the pandemic began,"" she added. Firms planned 800,000 redundancies last year UK borrowing hits highest December level on record Employment was still at ""relatively high levels"" compared with other countries, Ms Beckett said, but workers aged 16 to 24 were suffering some of the biggest falls in employment. However, she added: ""We've currently got over 4.5 million people on the furlough scheme, so that does complicate the picture when you're trying to interpret what's going on in the labour market."" While the main rate of unemployment has reached 5% for the first time in nearly five years, and this morning's numbers saw the largest increase in the numbers unemployed since the financial crisis, the chancellor must now be tempted to extend the furlough scheme to co-ordinate with the rollout of the post-vaccination reopening of the economy. There are some bad numbers in this release, as would be expected from the pandemic restrictions, but they were expected to be a little worse. In the quarter to November, there were 418,000 extra unemployed over the same period in 2019 - the sharpest annual rise since the 2009 financial crisis. The rate of redundancies reached a record of 14 per 1,000 people. Loss of jobs was concentrated in sectors such as retail and hospitality, most affected by social restrictions, which were reintroduced at the end of the period. Young people also faced the sharpest drops in employment. The jobs numbers are yet to reflect the current return to national lockdowns. Though a significant rise over the past few pandemic-afflicted months, unemployment at 5% is still low by international standards and is being kept in check by the government's job retention furlough scheme. The current plan is to end the costly scheme in April, which economists expect would see a sharp jump in jobless figures to 6% or 7%. But as the government continues to communicate caution about how fast restrictions on the economy will be lifted, business groups are adamant that the scheme needs to be extended into the early summer, or at least linked to the success of the vaccination programme. ""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped - and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. ""Whilst the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine, we're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families. ""Our Plan for Jobs includes grants and loans so that firms can keep employees on, the furlough scheme to help protect jobs, and programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills so that people can find their first job, their next job or a new job if needed,"" Mr Sunak added. With no end in sight to the current lockdown measures, many firms fear that they may not be able to survive the pandemic, with pubs and restaurants bearing the brunt of the restrictions. ""The pandemic continues to rip through the labour market,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. ""A return to tighter restrictions late last year will have stretched businesses' ability to retain staff. Meanwhile, the furlough scheme will have provided an invaluable cushion for many firms, preventing unemployment from edging up even further."" It is ""crucial"" for the chancellor to extend the furlough scheme and other Covid-19 economic support beyond the spring, he said. ""The forthcoming Budget is a vital moment to help firms retain, retrain and rehire workers as the vaccine rolls out. In particular, the government should provide a relief for employers' National Insurance contributions and support reskilling opportunities to shore up the recovery.""

Farmers breach Delhi's Red Fort in huge protestFarmers angry at market reforms smashed their way through police lines to march into central Delhi.,"This video can not be played India police fire tear gas as farmers break through barricades A rally against agriculture reforms in India turned violent on Tuesday, after protesting farmers broke through police barricades to storm Delhi's historic Red Fort complex. On foot and in tractors, the protesters were part of a huge rally planned for India's Republic Day. Many protesters diverted from agreed routes and clashes broke out with police. One protester died and more than 80 police officers were injured. Mobile internet services were suspended in parts of Delhi and some metro stations closed as security forces scrambled to restore order. The government is yet to comment on the violence, but reports say Home Minister Amit Shah held a meeting with Delhi police to discuss the situation. Some protesters hoisted flags at the top of the dome on the Red Fort The government says the reforms that spurred the protests will liberalise the agriculture sector, but farmers say they will lose income. Tens of thousands of them have been striking on the outskirts of Delhi since November, demanding the laws be repealed. Last week they rejected a government offer to put the laws on hold. It is one of the longest farmers-led protests India has ever seen, pitting the community against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government. Police allowed Tuesday's rally on the condition that it would not interrupt the annual Republic Day parade in central Delhi. Republic Day is a national holiday that marks the anniversary of India officially adopting its constitution on 26 January 1950. Farmers were given specific routes for the rally, which would largely be confined to the outskirts. But a group of them converged on the historic Red Fort. They breached security and clambered onto the walls and domes of the fortress, even hoisting flags alongside the national flag. By Tuesday afternoon, police said they had removed protesters from the complex, but the situation remained tense. ""We came here to deliver a message to the Modi government, our job is done. We will go back now,"" one protesting farmer told NDTV. In pictures: Farmers clash with police in Delhi How Modi misread the mood of India's angry farmers India farmers: The viral image that defines a protest Other protesters broke through police barricades and marched towards central Delhi, where India's parliament is located. Images from the ITO metro station junction - on the route to central Delhi - showed police clashing with farmers and using tear gas and batons. Protesters driving tractors appeared to be deliberately trying to run over police personnel. Local media reported injuries on both sides. At least one protester died at the junction when his tractor overturned as police fired tear gas. BBC correspondents said protesters outnumbered the police at the ITO junction, leaving them struggling to control the crowd. ""We have been appealing to farmers to go by the pre-approved route but some of them broke police barricades, attacked police personnel,"" a senior police officer told ANI news agency. ""We are appealing to farmers' unions to help maintain peace."" Union leaders issued similar appeals, condemning and distancing themselves from the violence.

"Parcel price shock: 'I had to pay to get my gift'It's not just shoppers facing surprise costs when EU parcels arrive, but what is behind the charges?Business","Lili Piraki was sent earrings from Greece, but had to pay to receive them A couple of weeks ago Lili Piraki, a London-based journalist, was surprised by a text out of the blue from delivery firm DHL. She was delighted to hear a friend had sent her a present: a pair of gold earrings from Greece. She was less impressed that she would have to pay nearly Â£30 in taxes to receive the gift. The extra charges are a result of new post-Brexit rules that came into force on 1 January. Despite the free trade deal agreed before Christmas, which promised to smooth the UK's exit from the EU,new taxes and charges now apply,externalto almost everything that goes back and forth between the two, including gifts, second hand items, products bought on Amazon or eBay and from private sellers. Retailers warn they could burn goods stuck in EU EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change Five surprising consequences of Brexit After wereported recently on Londoner Ellie Huddleston's shock at being asked to pay Â£82 to receive a Â£200 coat, dozens of you got in touch asking why they were being charged extra. So we asked some experts to run through five readers' experiences to explain the new charges. Sascha Grillo was charged an extra Â£12 when he tried to make an online purchase Londoner Sascha Grillo was trying to add to his model collection by ordering a new car from a seller in Germany, but when he typed into the website that he wanted delivery to the UK, the price leapt up from Â£50 to Â£62. ""I was shocked, because I thought that with the Brexit deal, this wouldn't happen,"" he said. ""I thought day-to-day commercial transactions would remain the same, but this is not the case."" He decided not to buy. Sascha collects model cars which he often orders from overseas Why was he charged more? The free trade deal means there are no quotas or tariffs on the goods traded between the EU and UK, but that doesn't mean there are no extra taxes or costs. Since 1 January the UK is no longer part of the EU VAT regime, so the UK government is applying VAT (sales tax) at 20% on goods from the EU, explains Gary Rycroft, a partner at Joseph A Jones & Co Solicitors. In Sascha's case the new tax was applied at the ""point of sale"", in other words when he clicked to order. That is how the system is supposed to work on all goods worth under Â£135, says Martyn James from the free complaints website Resolver. UK VAT accounts for Â£10 of the extra Â£12 that Sascha was asked to pay. Sellers may also be charging higher delivery fees to cover any extra paperwork or border delays they may face. Karishma Neog, an IT professional based in Bristol, has a weakness for designer handbags. In the first week of January she ordered two, one for her and one as a present, from a retailer in Paris, spending Â£600 plus Â£25 for delivery. When they arrived she was charged an extra Â£123. ""I had no inkling it was going to be the case,"" she says. There was no mention of it on the seller's site. Why was she charged? As with Sascha's cars, the charge was probably for UK VAT. But because Karishma's handbags were worth more than Â£135 she wasn't charged when she clicked to buy. Instead, when you buy more expensive items the VAT is applied when the items reach you. Michelle Dale from accountants UHY Hacker Young says the other possibility is that Karishma was charged customs duties. If you're buying something that comes from the EU, the free trade deal means you won't pay any customs duties. But, while Karishma's bags came from a seller in Paris, they may not be made from French materials, they might not even be made in France. The devil is in the detail when it comes to these ""rules of origin"" says Gary Rycroft. But they only apply to items over Â£135 that come from outside the UK and EU. So if you're buying a pricier item, it is always worth asking if any additional customs charges will apply. Lili Piraki isn't the only one who was charged to receive a present. Even if the gift was wrapped and posted by a friend or relative it can still incur extra fees. Some readers thought they'd avoided extra charges by posting before Christmas, but many deliveries ran late, and so - because they arrived after 1 January - came with an extra bill to pay. The first thing Lili knew about the earrings from her friend was a series of texts from DHL asking for Â£28.85. ""I received a message from DHL saying in order to receive my gift I had to pay the taxes. I didn't even know anyone had sent me anything."" She checked all the details to be sure it wasn't a scam, and then paid the charges. Why was she charged? Gifts worth less than Â£39 don't attract any extra charges, explains Michelle Dale. But gifts over that, like gold earrings, are eligible for VAT and (if it's over Â£135) customs duties. And it's always the recipient who receives the bill. When former soldier Hamish Clarke was stationed in Germany in the 1970s he developed an interest in modern European pottery. He still adds to his collection, buying on marketplaces or direct from sellers in Germany and Belgium. He spied four pieces of pottery he liked on eBay and agreed a price of â¬160 [Â£142] with the seller. ""When I tried to pay for it, it was asking for â¬191 euros,"" he says. He wondered whether the charges might have been avoided if he had bought directly from the seller. Why was he charged? There's no way around the import VAT, says Michelle Dale, and it applies to second hand items as well as gifts, even if you've bought them from a private individual. EBay already has its system set up,externalto charge the extra VAT upfront.Amazon says VAT will always be charged at point of sale,externalon its site too. But the system won't be running smoothly yet everywhere, warns Martyn James. Jemima Brown ordered a Â£150 pair of boots from a UK company to be delivered to her home in Auvergne, France. ""A week later I received an email from La Poste telling me that when the parcel was delivered it would only be handed over if I paid the â¬88 [Â£78] import duty,"" she says. The documentation said it was â¬43 for VAT, â¬30 for customs tariffs, and â¬15 handling fees. She rang the company which said she could reject the delivery and receive a full refund. Why was she charged? Shoppers on the continent buying from UK firms face the same rules as UK shoppers do in reverse so Jemima would have had to pay VAT and customs charges, because the boots or the materials they were made from, originated from outside the EU. Michelle Dale thinks Jemima was lucky to be able to reject the delivery so easily. Some firms are changing their terms and conditions so that customers have to cover the extra charges, even when goods are returned. Gary Rycroft says if a retailer doesn't make it clear that you might face extra fees, you could argue that these were ""hidden costs"" that you shouldn't have to pay. But don't expect that to be an easy battle to win.

Parcel price shock: 'I had to pay to get my gift',"Lili Piraki was sent earrings from Greece, but had to pay to receive them A couple of weeks ago Lili Piraki, a London-based journalist, was surprised by a text out of the blue from delivery firm DHL. She was delighted to hear a friend had sent her a present: a pair of gold earrings from Greece. She was less impressed that she would have to pay nearly Â£30 in taxes to receive the gift. The extra charges are a result of new post-Brexit rules that came into force on 1 January. Despite the free trade deal agreed before Christmas, which promised to smooth the UK's exit from the EU,new taxes and charges now apply,externalto almost everything that goes back and forth between the two, including gifts, second hand items, products bought on Amazon or eBay and from private sellers. Retailers warn they could burn goods stuck in EU EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change Five surprising consequences of Brexit After wereported recently on Londoner Ellie Huddleston's shock at being asked to pay Â£82 to receive a Â£200 coat, dozens of you got in touch asking why they were being charged extra. So we asked some experts to run through five readers' experiences to explain the new charges. Sascha Grillo was charged an extra Â£12 when he tried to make an online purchase Londoner Sascha Grillo was trying to add to his model collection by ordering a new car from a seller in Germany, but when he typed into the website that he wanted delivery to the UK, the price leapt up from Â£50 to Â£62. ""I was shocked, because I thought that with the Brexit deal, this wouldn't happen,"" he said. ""I thought day-to-day commercial transactions would remain the same, but this is not the case."" He decided not to buy. Sascha collects model cars which he often orders from overseas Why was he charged more? The free trade deal means there are no quotas or tariffs on the goods traded between the EU and UK, but that doesn't mean there are no extra taxes or costs. Since 1 January the UK is no longer part of the EU VAT regime, so the UK government is applying VAT (sales tax) at 20% on goods from the EU, explains Gary Rycroft, a partner at Joseph A Jones & Co Solicitors. In Sascha's case the new tax was applied at the ""point of sale"", in other words when he clicked to order. That is how the system is supposed to work on all goods worth under Â£135, says Martyn James from the free complaints website Resolver. UK VAT accounts for Â£10 of the extra Â£12 that Sascha was asked to pay. Sellers may also be charging higher delivery fees to cover any extra paperwork or border delays they may face. Karishma Neog, an IT professional based in Bristol, has a weakness for designer handbags. In the first week of January she ordered two, one for her and one as a present, from a retailer in Paris, spending Â£600 plus Â£25 for delivery. When they arrived she was charged an extra Â£123. ""I had no inkling it was going to be the case,"" she says. There was no mention of it on the seller's site. Why was she charged? As with Sascha's cars, the charge was probably for UK VAT. But because Karishma's handbags were worth more than Â£135 she wasn't charged when she clicked to buy. Instead, when you buy more expensive items the VAT is applied when the items reach you. Michelle Dale from accountants UHY Hacker Young says the other possibility is that Karishma was charged customs duties. If you're buying something that comes from the EU, the free trade deal means you won't pay any customs duties. But, while Karishma's bags came from a seller in Paris, they may not be made from French materials, they might not even be made in France. The devil is in the detail when it comes to these ""rules of origin"" says Gary Rycroft. But they only apply to items over Â£135 that come from outside the UK and EU. So if you're buying a pricier item, it is always worth asking if any additional customs charges will apply. Lili Piraki isn't the only one who was charged to receive a present. Even if the gift was wrapped and posted by a friend or relative it can still incur extra fees. Some readers thought they'd avoided extra charges by posting before Christmas, but many deliveries ran late, and so - because they arrived after 1 January - came with an extra bill to pay. The first thing Lili knew about the earrings from her friend was a series of texts from DHL asking for Â£28.85. ""I received a message from DHL saying in order to receive my gift I had to pay the taxes. I didn't even know anyone had sent me anything."" She checked all the details to be sure it wasn't a scam, and then paid the charges. Why was she charged? Gifts worth less than Â£39 don't attract any extra charges, explains Michelle Dale. But gifts over that, like gold earrings, are eligible for VAT and (if it's over Â£135) customs duties. And it's always the recipient who receives the bill. When former soldier Hamish Clarke was stationed in Germany in the 1970s he developed an interest in modern European pottery. He still adds to his collection, buying on marketplaces or direct from sellers in Germany and Belgium. He spied four pieces of pottery he liked on eBay and agreed a price of â¬160 [Â£142] with the seller. ""When I tried to pay for it, it was asking for â¬191 euros,"" he says. He wondered whether the charges might have been avoided if he had bought directly from the seller. Why was he charged? There's no way around the import VAT, says Michelle Dale, and it applies to second hand items as well as gifts, even if you've bought them from a private individual. EBay already has its system set up,externalto charge the extra VAT upfront.Amazon says VAT will always be charged at point of sale,externalon its site too. But the system won't be running smoothly yet everywhere, warns Martyn James. Jemima Brown ordered a Â£150 pair of boots from a UK company to be delivered to her home in Auvergne, France. ""A week later I received an email from La Poste telling me that when the parcel was delivered it would only be handed over if I paid the â¬88 [Â£78] import duty,"" she says. The documentation said it was â¬43 for VAT, â¬30 for customs tariffs, and â¬15 handling fees. She rang the company which said she could reject the delivery and receive a full refund. Why was she charged? Shoppers on the continent buying from UK firms face the same rules as UK shoppers do in reverse so Jemima would have had to pay VAT and customs charges, because the boots or the materials they were made from, originated from outside the EU. Michelle Dale thinks Jemima was lucky to be able to reject the delivery so easily. Some firms are changing their terms and conditions so that customers have to cover the extra charges, even when goods are returned. Gary Rycroft says if a retailer doesn't make it clear that you might face extra fees, you could argue that these were ""hidden costs"" that you shouldn't have to pay. But don't expect that to be an easy battle to win.

Co-op and Morrisons payment problems investigated,"Co-op, Morrisons and their payments processing provider ACI say they are investigating an IT glitch that created problems for card payments in stores. Long queues were seen outside some of the Co-op's convenience stores from Sunday amid the snow, with some shoppers asked to use cash. Co-op and Morrisons said customers were no longer experiencing problems but they, and ACI, were studying the cause. One MP said the problem exposed the risks of letting cash use ""wither"". ACI, which provides real-time payments processing for the retailers, said: ""We are working closely with the IT teams at our partners to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. We apologise to shoppers for any inconvenience caused."" The issue comes as contactless payments have taken off in the UK during the pandemic, with fewer consumers using cash to pay for groceries. People shopping more locally in lockdown, says Co-op Morrisons first UK supermarket to pay Â£10 an hour Waitrose and Co-op cut prices for 'tough times' Customers complained about the issue on social media.

However in other stores, the problem was intermittent, impacting some payment card brands, but not others.

"School to withdraw places for Covid-breach pupilsSeveral pupils at the school admitted visiting other households, breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules.","The school's head teacher said it was unacceptable staff were being put at risk A school has threatened to withdraw places for pupils who have told teachers they are visiting people outside their households. Yew Tree Community School in Oldham said several children had admitted visiting friends, neighbours and family contrary to Covid-19 lockdown rules. Head teacher Martine Buckley said she would take the action when ""parents were putting staff in danger"". The Department for Education said ""all vulnerable"" pupils should go to school. During the current lockdown schools are open only to pupils listed as vulnerable and the children of key workers. Families can form ""childcare bubbles,external"" with one other household, and children who live with two parents who live separately can move between households - but any further mixing is forbidden. When could lockdown rules be reviewed? Will schools reopen before Easter? What is the risk of schools spreading coronavirus? In a letter posted on the Chadderton school's Facebook page, Mrs Buckley said she was ""upset"" to be writing it ""but I feel I must"". ""Our lovely children are open and honest and they tell us about their lives and activities,"" she said. ""A number of them are telling us that they are visiting friends, neighbours and family which is against the law. ""Our teachers and support staff are putting their own safety at risk to look after your children and they should be confident you are doing your bit to follow the lockdown rules. ""I am afraid I will have to withdraw the offer of a place in school to children whose parents are putting us in danger."" Yew Tree is a primary school in Chadderton, Oldham While a number of parents applauded the message, others have been angered. One man told the BBC his two grandchildren were at the school and children as young as four have been asked about their activities at home, which was ""out of order"". ""My granddaughters are pretty intimidated by the tone,"" he said. ""Asking them questions like that and then the answers off the back of that. They come to a decision of whether they are going to displace them or not."" The school has about 660 pupils aged between four and 11. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said during the current lockdown, schools were ""open for vulnerable children and the children of critical workers"".

Five days that shaped the outbreakBefore Wuhan was locked down in January 2020 officials said the outbreak was under control.,"A year ago, the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand officials had maintained that the outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact the virus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. This is the story of five critical days early in the outbreak. By 30 December, several people had been admitted to hospitals in the central city of Wuhan, having fallen ill with high fever and pneumonia. The first known case was a man in his 70s who had fallen ill on 1 December. Many of those were connected to a sprawling live animal market, Huanan Seafood Market, and doctors had begun to suspect this wasn't regular pneumonia. Samples from infected lungs had been sent to genetic sequencing companies to identify the cause of the disease, and preliminary results had indicated a novel coronavirus similar to Sars. The local health authorities and the country's Center for Disease Control (CDC) had already been notified, but nothing had been said to the public. Although no-one knew it at the time, between 2,300 and 4,000 people were by now likely infected, according to arecent model by MOBS Lab at Northeastern University in Boston,external. The outbreak was also thought to be doubling in size every few days. Epidemiologists say that at this early part of an outbreak, each day and even each hour is critical. Wuhanâs Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was sealed off on 1 January 2020 At around 16:00 on 30 December, the head of the Emergency Department at Wuhan Central Hospital was handed the results of a test carried out by sequencing lab Capital Bio Medicals in Beijing. She went into a cold sweat as she read the report, according to an interview given later to Chinese state media. At the top were the alarming words: ""SARS CORONAVIRUS"". She circled them in bright red, and passed it on to colleagues over the Chinese messaging site WeChat. Within an hour and a half, the grainy image with its large red circle reached a doctor in the hospital's ophthalmology department, Li Wenliang. He shared it with his hundreds-strong university class group, adding the warning, ""Don't circulate the message outside this group. Get your family and loved ones to take precautions."" When Sars spread through southern China in late 2002 and 2003, Beijing covered up the outbreak, insisting that everything was under control. This allowed the virus to spread around the world. Beijing's response invoked international criticism and - worryingly for a regime deeply concerned about stability - anger and protests within China. Between 2002 and 2004, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill almost 800 worldwide. Robert Maguire of the WHO and a Chinese doctor visit a Sars patient in Guangzhou, China â April 2003 Over the coming hours, screen shots of Li's message spread widely online. Across China, millions of people began talking about Sars online. It would turn out that the sequencers made a mistake - this was not Sars, but a new coronavirus very similar to it. But this was a critical moment. News of a possible outbreak had escaped. The Wuhan Health Commission was already aware that there was something going on in the city's hospitals. That day, officials from the National Health Commission in Beijing arrived, and lung samples were sent to at least five state labs in Wuhan and Beijing to sequence the virus in parallel. Residential housing blocks, Wuhan, China Now, as messages suggesting the possible return of Sars began flying over Chinese social media, the Wuhan Health Commission sent two orders out to hospitals. It instructed them to report all cases direct to the Health Commission, and told them not to make anything public without authorisation. Within 12 minutes, these orders were leaked online. It might have taken a couple more days for the online chatter to make the leap from Chinese-speaking social media to the wider world if it wasn't for the efforts of veteran epidemiologist Marjorie Pollack. The deputy editor of ProMed-mail, an organisation which sends out alerts on disease outbreaks worldwide, received an email from a contact in Taiwan, asking if she knew anything about the chatter online. Dr Marjorie Pollack is an epidemiologist based in New York Back in February 2003, ProMed had been the first to break the news of Sars. Now, Pollack had deja vu. ""My reaction was: 'We're in trouble,'"" she told the BBC. Three hours later, she had finished writingan emergency post,external, requesting more information on the new outbreak. It was sent out to ProMed's approximately 80,000 subscribers at one minute to midnight. As word began to spread, Professor George F Gao, director general of China's Center for Disease Control [CDC], was receiving offers of help from contacts around the world. China revamped its infectious disease infrastructure after Sars - and in 2019, Gao had promised that China's vast online surveillance system would be able to prevent another outbreak like it. But two scientists who contacted Gao say the CDC head did not seem alarmed. ""I sent a really long text to George Gao, offering to send a team out and do anything to support them,"" Dr Peter Daszak, the president of New York-based infectious diseases research group EcoHealth Alliance, told the BBC. But he says that all he received in reply was a short message wishing him Happy New Year. Director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control, George F Gao â 22 January 2020 Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in New York was also trying to reach Gao. Just as he was having dinner to ring in the New Year, Gao returned his call. The details Lipkin reveals about their conversation offer new insights into what leading Chinese officials were prepared to say at this critical point. ""He had identified the virus. It was a new coronavirus. And it was not highly transmissible. This didn't really resonate with me because I'd heard that many, many people had been infected,"" Lipkin told the BBC. ""I don't think he was duplicitous, I think he was just wrong."" Epidemiologist Ian Lipkin Lipkin says he thinks Gao should have released the sequences they had already obtained. My view is that you get it out. This is too important to hesitate."" Gao, who refused the BBC's requests for an interview, has told state media that the sequences were released as soon as possible, and that he never said publicly that there was no human-to-human transmission. That day, the Wuhan Health Commission issued a press release stating that 27 cases of viral pneumonia had been identified, but that there was no clear evidence of human to human transmission. TV channel CGTN reporting 27 cases of ""viral pneumonia"" It would be a further 12 days before China shared the genetic sequences with the international community. The Chinese government refused multiple interview requests by the BBC. Instead, it gave us detailed statements on China's response, which state that in the fight against Covid-19 China ""has always acted with openness, transparency and responsibility, and â¦ in a timely manner.""

Part two -54 Days: America and the Pandemic- will be on BBC Two on Tuesday 2 February at 21:00. A BBC/PBS Frontline co-production. International law stipulates that new infectious disease outbreaks of global concern be reported to the World Health Organization within 24 hours. But on 1 January the WHO still had not had official notification of the outbreak. The previous day, officials there had spotted the ProMed post and reports online, so they contacted China's National Health Commission. ""It was reportable,"" says Professor Lawrence Gostin, Director of the WHO Collaborating Center on national and global health law at Georgetown University in Washington DC, and a member of the International Health Regulations roster of experts. ""The failure to report clearly was a violation of the International Health Regulations."" Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist who would become the agency's Covid-19 technical lead, joined the first of many emergency conference calls in the middle of the night on 1 January. ""We had the assumptions initially that it may be a new coronavirus. For us it wasn't a matter of if human to human transmission was happening, it was what is the extent of it and where is that happening."" Dr Maria Van Kerkhove It was two days before China responded to the WHO. But what they revealed was vague - that there were now 44 cases of viral pneumonia of unknown cause. China says that it communicated regularly and fully with the WHO from 3 January. But recordings of internal WHO meetings obtained by the Associated Press (AP) news agency some of which were shared with PBS Frontline and the BBC, paint a different picture, revealing the frustration that senior WHO officials felt by the following week. ""'There's been no evidence of human to human transmission' is not good enough. We need to see the data,"" Mike Ryan WHO's health emergencies programme director is heard saying. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland The WHO was legally required to state the information it had been provided by China. Although they suspected human to human transmission, the WHO were not able to confirm this for a further three weeks. ""Those concerns are not something they ever aired publicly.  Instead, they basically deferred to China,"" says AP's Dake Kang. ""Ultimately, the impression that the rest of the world got was just what the Chinese authorities wanted.  Which is that everything was under control. Which of course it wasn't."" The number of people infected by the virus was doubling in size every few days, and more and more people were turning up at Wuhan's hospitals. But now - instead of allowing doctors to share their concerns publicly - state media began a campaign that effectively silenced them. On 2 January, China Central Television ran a story about the doctors who spread the news about an outbreak four days earlier. The doctors, referred to only as ""rumour mongers"" and ""internet users"", were brought in for questioning by the Wuhan Public Security Bureau and 'dealt with' 'in accordance with the law'. One of the doctors was Li Wenliang, the eye doctor whose warning had gone viral. He signed a confession. In February,the doctor died of Covid-19. Chinese doctor, Dr Li Wenliang, in his hospital bed The Chinese government says that this is not evidence that it was trying to suppress news of the outbreak, and that doctors like Li were being urged not to spread unconfirmed information. But the impact of this public dressing down was critical. For though it was becoming apparent to doctors that there was, in fact, human-to-human transmission, they were prevented from going public. A health worker from Li's hospital, Wuhan Central, told us that over the next few days ""there were so many people who had a fever. It was out of control. We started to panic. [But] The hospital told us that we were not allowed to speak to anyone."" Medical staff at Jin Yintan Hospital, Wuhan - 17 January 2020 The Chinese government told us that ""it takes a rigorous scientific process to determine if a new virus can be transmitted from person to person"". The authorities would continue to maintain for a further 18 days that there was no human-to-human transmission. Labs across the country were racing to map the complete genetic sequence of the virus. Among them was a renowned virologist in Shanghai, Professor Zhang Yongzhen who began sequencing on 3 January. After having worked for two days straight, he obtained a complete sequence. His results revealed a virus that was similar to Sars, and therefore likely transmissible. Prof Zhang Yongzhen On 5 January, Zhang's office wrote to the National Health Commission advising taking precautionary measures in public places. ""On that very day, he was working to try and get information released as soon as possible, so the rest of the world could see what it was and so we could get diagnostics going"", says Zhang's research partner, Professor Edward Holmes an evolutionary virologist at the University of Sydney. But Zhang could not make his findings public. On January 3, the National Health Commission had sent a secret memorandum to labs banning unauthorised scientists from working on the virus and disclosing the information to the public. ""What the notice effectively did,"" says AP's Dake Kang, ""is it silenced individual scientists and laboratories from revealing information about this virus and potentially allowing word of it to leak out to the outside world and alarm people."" None of the labs went public with the genetic sequence of the virus. China continued to maintain it was viral pneumonia with no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission. It would be six days before it announced that the new virus was a coronavirus, and even then, it did not share any genetic sequences to allow other countries to develop tests and begin tracing the spread of the virus. Prof Edward Holmes Three days later, on 11 January, Zhang decided it was time to put his neck on the line. As he boarded a plane between Beijing and Shanghai, he authorised Holmes to release the sequence. The decision came at a personal cost - his lab was closed the next day for ""rectification"" - but his action broke the deadlock. The next day state scientists released the sequences they had obtained. The international scientific community swung into action, and a toolkit for a diagnostic test was publicly available by 13 January. Despite the evidence from scientists and doctors, China would not confirm there was human-to-human transmission until 20 January. Illustration of spike proteins (red) of Covid-19 binding with receptors (blue) on a target human cell At the beginning of any emerging disease outbreak, says health law expert Lawrence Gostin, it's always chaotic. ""It was always going to be very difficult to control this virus, from day one. But by the time we knew [the international community] it was transmissible human to human, I think the cat was already out the bag, it already spread. ""That was the shot we had, and we lost it."" As Wang Linfa, a bat virologist at Duke-Nus Medical School in Singapore, says: ""January 20th is the dividing line, before that the Chinese could have done much better. After that, the rest of the world should be really on high alert and do much better."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Big rise in redundancies among young peoplePeople aged 25 to 34 face the highest risk of redundancy as Covid pushes up the jobless rate to 5%.Business,"The number of people out of work in the UK has continued to rise, with those aged 25 to 34 facing the biggest risk of losing their jobs. In the three months to November, people in that age group had a redundancy rate of 16.2 per 1,000, a fivefold increase on the same period a year earlier. Unemployment rose to 5% from 4.9% as Covid continued to hit the jobs market. Some 1.72 million were jobless,the Office for National Statistics said,external, the highest level in five years. That was 418,000 more than in the same period the previous year, the biggest increase since late 2009. Abigail Ward, 27, freely admits that she was ""a bit naive"" when she began her latest job hunt after being made redundant as a store manager at J Crew in London last September. Having spent the past five years since graduating in retail management, she has a passion for bricks-and-mortar retail and ""the value of face-to-face customer interactions"" - and it's an area she wants to stay in. ""I knew it would be hard, but I've been in this position before,"" she told the BBC. ""Back then, it only took me three or four weeks to find a role and maybe 10 job applications, so it all happened quite seamlessly, whereas this time around, it's definitely been a lot more difficult. ""I've probably sent off around 30 to 40 job applications in the last six months, the majority of which just go into the abyss. You never hear a word."" However, Abigail has managed to get to the final interview stage for a job - ""with me and just one other candidate"" - on four separate occasions. ""Unfortunately, I've missed out on each of those occasions,"" she says. ""There are so many hundreds of applications and it's so competitive,"" she adds. ""It's definitely been a big challenge."" What are my rights if I am made redundant? The hospitality industry was worst hit by the rise in joblessness, followed by manufacturing. In both sectors, the number of people unemployed was up by more than 50,000 on the previous year. Across all age groups, redundancies rose to a record high of 14.2 per 1,000 people. However, job vacancies also rose, with 81,000 new openings reported in the three months. ONS deputy chief executive Sam Beckett told the BBC that the UK had not seen such rises in unemployment since the global financial crisis. ""Payroll numbers show the number of workers on payroll have fallen by over 828,000 since the pandemic began,"" she added. Firms planned 800,000 redundancies last year UK borrowing hits highest December level on record Employment was still at ""relatively high levels"" compared with other countries, Ms Beckett said, but workers aged 16 to 24 were suffering some of the biggest falls in employment. However, she added: ""We've currently got over 4.5 million people on the furlough scheme, so that does complicate the picture when you're trying to interpret what's going on in the labour market."" While the main rate of unemployment has reached 5% for the first time in nearly five years, and this morning's numbers saw the largest increase in the numbers unemployed since the financial crisis, the chancellor must now be tempted to extend the furlough scheme to co-ordinate with the rollout of the post-vaccination reopening of the economy. There are some bad numbers in this release, as would be expected from the pandemic restrictions, but they were expected to be a little worse. In the quarter to November, there were 418,000 extra unemployed over the same period in 2019 - the sharpest annual rise since the 2009 financial crisis. The rate of redundancies reached a record of 14 per 1,000 people. Loss of jobs was concentrated in sectors such as retail and hospitality, most affected by social restrictions, which were reintroduced at the end of the period. Young people also faced the sharpest drops in employment. The jobs numbers are yet to reflect the current return to national lockdowns. Though a significant rise over the past few pandemic-afflicted months, unemployment at 5% is still low by international standards and is being kept in check by the government's job retention furlough scheme. The current plan is to end the costly scheme in April, which economists expect would see a sharp jump in jobless figures to 6% or 7%. But as the government continues to communicate caution about how fast restrictions on the economy will be lifted, business groups are adamant that the scheme needs to be extended into the early summer, or at least linked to the success of the vaccination programme. ""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped - and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. ""Whilst the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine, we're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families. ""Our Plan for Jobs includes grants and loans so that firms can keep employees on, the furlough scheme to help protect jobs, and programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills so that people can find their first job, their next job or a new job if needed,"" Mr Sunak added. With no end in sight to the current lockdown measures, many firms fear that they may not be able to survive the pandemic, with pubs and restaurants bearing the brunt of the restrictions. ""The pandemic continues to rip through the labour market,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. ""A return to tighter restrictions late last year will have stretched businesses' ability to retain staff. Meanwhile, the furlough scheme will have provided an invaluable cushion for many firms, preventing unemployment from edging up even further."" It is ""crucial"" for the chancellor to extend the furlough scheme and other Covid-19 economic support beyond the spring, he said. ""The forthcoming Budget is a vital moment to help firms retain, retrain and rehire workers as the vaccine rolls out. In particular, the government should provide a relief for employers' National Insurance contributions and support reskilling opportunities to shore up the recovery.""

Non-Welsh speaking parents 'need home-school help',"This video can not be played Time out of school has affected some children who have not established their language skills Parents in English-speaking homes whose children go to Welsh-language schools need more support during lockdown, the Welsh language commissioner has said. Some parents said time away from face-to-face schooling was affecting younger children who have not fully established their language skills. One mother said ""not only do you not know how to help them, you don't know what the question is to start with"". The Welsh Government said it had given guidance to Welsh-medium schools.

Angela Crabtree said her nine-year-old daughter Ffion had to help her younger sisters Angela Crabtree, from Caerphilly, said her daughters were partly reliant on her eldest child Ffion to translate Welsh schoolwork. Ms Crabtree, who is on furlough, said keeping up Welsh-language skills had been a challenge for her three daughters, Ffion, Natalie and Chloe, who go to Ysgol Gynradd Gymraeg Caerffili.

'18 months' for plans to rebuild storm-hit bridge,"This video can not be played Drone footage captures the extent of the damage the bridge over the River Clwyd It could take 18 months to draw up plans to rebuild a bridge which was swept away during last week's Storm Christoph, a council has warned. Llanerch bridge, between Trefnant and Tremeirchion in Denbighshire, is a backroad link to the A55. The grade II-listed bridge crosses the River Clwyd and villagers now face a seven-mile detour. Meanwhile, some people in Skewen, Neath Port Talbot, can return home later after flooding caused by the storm. Denbighshire council said diversions would go through St Asaph while Llanerch bridge was repaired. Financial help offered to flood victims Flood-hit villagers could be out of homes for days Dewi Davies of Tremeirchion community council warned repairing the bridge posed a ""challenge"". ""It means it takes much longer now to go from Tremeirchion to Trefnant or St Asaph,"" he said. ""I know of one couple that have a horse in stables on the other side of the river - so it's a seven-mile journey each way, twice a day, for them now. ""It's quite a challenge and we're starting to think about how long we'll need to live with it. Are we talking a year, two, three, or maybe much longer than that?"" Drone footage showed the damage caused by Storm Christoph Vale of Clwyd Conservative MP James Davies said the bridge should be rebuilt: ""There are many who would wish to see the bridge replaced like-for-like, although I appreciate that the new structure will need to take into account the challenges posed by modern-day and projected river flows."" Denbighshire council's Meirick Lloyd Davies suggested the structure could be widened, similar to the one in Llangollen. But the Trefnant ward councillor added: ""We will need money from the Welsh Government and I hope the UK government are also ready to throw something into the bucket because it is very expensive."" A council spokesman said: ""We will seek to resolve this as soon as we are able. ""Final plans for the bridge will involve a number of third parties and it could take up to 18 months or more to resolve."" The Welsh Government said the condition of the structure was the responsibility of the owner, with local authorities having powers to ensure listed structures were preserved. This video can not be played Cerys Thomas said her mother's conservatory windows were blown open by the force of the water South Wales was also hit by Storm Christoph on Thursday and in Skewen about 80 people were evacuated as water rushed through the village on Thursday. The Coal Authority said initial checks suggested water built up in a mine shaft, causing a""blow out""which flooded properties. Those living in Jubilee Crescent and Dunevor Road have been told they can return home, but others will have to wait until the Coal Authority has made further investigations. Helicopter crew rescues family trapped by floods Council leader Rob Jones toldBreakfast with Claire Summers: ""We haven't got the exact figures of the number of people who will be able to return home today, there's going to be further assessments this morning. ""As early as we can, we will release the names of the streets of those people who will be able to go back, but it will be conditional. They need to go back in a controlled manner. We've still got Covid around."" He added houses would need to have their electrics checked and information would be provided on how to do this.

Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has abandoned plans to allow some children out of their homes for the first time in 10 months. They've been cooped up to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under-15s have been unable to legally go outside since March - one of the toughest virus restrictions on children anywhere in the world. It has had an effect on their schooling and mental health, as well as the economy because family trips have been impossible. Last week though, the government finally said 10 to 14-year-olds would be allowed out from February. But President Duterte has now rescinded that order after the more contagious UK variant of the virus was discovered. Duterte told children they'd have to continue watching TV instead. While the UK reaches a milestone in terms of the number of deaths today, it is one year ago that the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand, officials had maintained that the virus outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact, coronavirus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. We look back at thosefive critical days early on in the outbreak.

BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played Jamie Brownâs dad Tony was 65 when he died with Covid-19 last March. As the UK registers more than 100,000 deaths of people with coronavirus, today, 5 Live has been hearing from people about how they are coping with the grief at losing their loved ones to coronavirus. Jamie Brownâs dad Tony was 65 when he died with Covid-19 last March. Speaking to 5 Liveâs Naga Munchetty, Jamie said his dad was beginning to retire, but travelling to London one day a week, when he became ill. ""He was meant to be putting his feet up, having worked incredibly hard to do so - and that was taken away from him."" Jamie is a member of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group and says the group helped him realise heâs ""one in a sea of people who are feeling this... collective grief and collective rage (that) youâve been so terribly let down"". Listen back on the free BBC Sounds app. Jake HortonBBC Reality Check President Joe Biden has said that the US might be able to
boost its daily vaccination roll-out targets after criticising the Trump
administrationâs record. Biden, who has described the previous vaccine programme
as a ""dismal failure"", has committed to getting 100 million vaccine doses done
in his first 100 days and has since said: ""I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than one million a day."" Is he right about the vaccine roll-out under the Trump
administration? As of 20 January, when Biden became US president, about
16.5 million vaccines had been administered. That is some way off the Trump administration's target of
vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020. In fact, fewer than three million people had received a jab
by 31 December. Vaccinations have sped up since the start of the year. The daily average for the week before Trump left office
was less than 900,000, according toOur World in Data,external. That figure has since risen above one million doses a day,
and Biden has come under some
scrutiny for not setting a more ambitious target. When you look at the countries doing the most vaccinations by population, the US is fourth after Israel, the UAE and the UK in terms of doses per 100 people. Read more here Reality Check Israel has the highest per capita vaccination rate in the
world - but vaccines are yet to be rolled out to Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, viewed as occupied territories by the international community. Israelâs health minister says it is the Palestinian
Authorityâs responsibility to provide healthcare under an interim deal for
self-rule in Palestinian areas. But UN human rights experts say there are international rules about the duty of an occupying power to
provide healthcare - although Israel often argues it isn't technically
occupying the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem are entitled to be
vaccinated against Covid - they have Israeli residency status. And medics
working in Palestinian hospitals there are also getting vaccines. Some health experts and business leaders have also called
for Israel to include other Palestinians in its vaccine programme, as around
tens of thousands of  Palestinians travel daily to work in Israel and in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the
West Bank â said they are doing deals with four companies that will provide
enough vaccines for 70% of its people, and will get another 20% from the World
Health Organization-backed Covax scheme. But there are few details at the moment about when vaccines
will start or who will receive them. Read more here Among the figures on the pandemic in the UK today came news that more than 6.85m people have had a coronavirus vaccination first dose. Another 279,757 people had received a jab as of Monday,official figures show.,external One of those getting a vaccination on Tuesday was actress and TV presenter Floella Benjamin,who tweeted a picture of the occasion,external. Baroness Benjamin, 71, who made her name as the host of TV's Play School in the 1970s, is now a campaigner for young people. Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Denmark Mink farmers in Denmark - the worldâs largest producer of mink pelts until a coronavirus mass cull - have been given a compensation package worth more than 19 billion Danish kroner (Â£2.2bn). It was voted through by MPs late on Monday. The agriculture minister said it was a chance to move on, while the Danish mink breeders association said the industry would never return, as China and Poland could produce mink furs much more cheaply. Mink farmers were ordered to destroy their entire stock of about 17 million animals last November, over fears that a mutant strain of Covid-19 could pass from mink to humans. But chaos followed. The scientific basis of the order came into question, and mass graves appeared to be poisoning soil and water supplies. The issue led to the resignation of the previous agriculture minister. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Some of the worst violence was in Rotterdam The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations? There are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians. Some feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew. The unrest was initially seen as a response to the first ""stay-at-home"" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. This video can not be played Netherlands: Third night of anti-lockdown riots Away from UK news now, and nearby, in the Netherlands, the Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs. Shops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra condemned the violence, saying: ""It's scum doing this"". More than 180 arrests have been made. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". The criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte. A night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 (03:30 GMT) was imposed last Saturday to help to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine.

There have been more than 3.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 100,000 people have died, government figures show. You canlook up how many cases are near to you here. Reality Check At his Downing Street briefing this evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:
âI think the amount we invested in the NHS, even before the pandemic began, was
more than any time in modern memory.â In 2018, the government pledged that
spending on the NHS in England would increase by Â£20.5bn by 2023-24. This meant that the NHS budget
would increase by 3.2% a year, once inflation was accounted for. However, it is still substantially
below the 6% annual growth seen under the Labour governments in power between
1997 and 2010, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Itâs important when comparing
spending to include inflation, because it accounts for the fact that things get
more expensive over the years. Since the crisis began, the NHS
budget has increased dramatically. In the most recent year, the
Department of Health and Social Careâs budget went up by Â£50bn, but it is still
unclear whether the health service will receive more money once the crisis has
ended. ""She was a passionate, caring, humorous and larger-than-life character."" ""He is one of a kind and will be greatly missed."" ""He had such a zest for life.""

After finally securing her family's place in Australia's quarantine system, Keri McMenamin prepared for the worst - and ordered a vacuum cleaner.

Brexit parcel shock: 'I had to pay to get my gift',"Lili Piraki was sent earrings from Greece, but had to pay to receive them A couple of weeks ago Lili Piraki, a London-based journalist, was surprised by a text out of the blue from delivery firm DHL. She was delighted to hear a friend had sent her a present: a pair of gold earrings from Greece. She was less impressed that she would have to pay nearly Â£30 in taxes to receive the gift. The extra charges are a result of new post-Brexit rules that came into force on 1 January. Despite the free trade deal agreed before Christmas, which promised to smooth the UK's exit from the EU,new taxes and charges now apply,externalto almost everything that goes back and forth between the two, including gifts, second hand items, products bought on Amazon or eBay and from private sellers. Retailers warn they could burn goods stuck in EU EU firms stop UK deliveries over Brexit tax change Five surprising consequences of Brexit After wereported recently on Londoner Ellie Huddleston's shock at being asked to pay Â£82 to receive a Â£200 coat, dozens of you got in touch asking why they were being charged extra. So we asked some experts to run through five readers' experiences to explain the new charges. Sascha Grillo was charged an extra Â£12 when he tried to make an online purchase Londoner Sascha Grillo was trying to add to his model collection by ordering a new car from a seller in Germany, but when he typed into the website that he wanted delivery to the UK, the price leapt up from Â£50 to Â£62. ""I was shocked, because I thought that with the Brexit deal, this wouldn't happen,"" he said. ""I thought day-to-day commercial transactions would remain the same, but this is not the case."" He decided not to buy. Sascha collects model cars which he often orders from overseas Why was he charged more? The free trade deal means there are no quotas or tariffs on the goods traded between the EU and UK, but that doesn't mean there are no extra taxes or costs. Since 1 January the UK is no longer part of the EU VAT regime, so the UK government is applying VAT (sales tax) at 20% on goods from the EU, explains Gary Rycroft, a partner at Joseph A Jones & Co Solicitors. In Sascha's case the new tax was applied at the ""point of sale"", in other words when he clicked to order. That is how the system is supposed to work on all goods worth under Â£135, says Martyn James from the free complaints website Resolver. UK VAT accounts for Â£10 of the extra Â£12 that Sascha was asked to pay. Sellers may also be charging higher delivery fees to cover any extra paperwork or border delays they may face. Karishma Neog, an IT professional based in Bristol, has a weakness for designer handbags. In the first week of January she ordered two, one for her and one as a present, from a retailer in Paris, spending Â£600 plus Â£25 for delivery. When they arrived she was charged an extra Â£123. ""I had no inkling it was going to be the case,"" she says. There was no mention of it on the seller's site. Why was she charged? As with Sascha's cars, the charge was probably for UK VAT. But because Karishma's handbags were worth more than Â£135 she wasn't charged when she clicked to buy. Instead, when you buy more expensive items the VAT is applied when the items reach you. Michelle Dale from accountants UHY Hacker Young says the other possibility is that Karishma was charged customs duties. If you're buying something that comes from the EU, the free trade deal means you won't pay any customs duties. But, while Karishma's bags came from a seller in Paris, they may not be made from French materials, they might not even be made in France. The devil is in the detail when it comes to these ""rules of origin"" says Gary Rycroft. But they only apply to items over Â£135 that come from outside the UK and EU. So if you're buying a pricier item, it is always worth asking if any additional customs charges will apply. Lili Piraki isn't the only one who was charged to receive a present. Even if the gift was wrapped and posted by a friend or relative it can still incur extra fees. Some readers thought they'd avoided extra charges by posting before Christmas, but many deliveries ran late, and so - because they arrived after 1 January - came with an extra bill to pay. The first thing Lili knew about the earrings from her friend was a series of texts from DHL asking for Â£28.85. ""I received a message from DHL saying in order to receive my gift I had to pay the taxes. I didn't even know anyone had sent me anything."" She checked all the details to be sure it wasn't a scam, and then paid the charges. Why was she charged? Gifts worth less than Â£39 don't attract any extra charges, explains Michelle Dale. But gifts over that, like gold earrings, are eligible for VAT and (if it's over Â£135) customs duties. And it's always the recipient who receives the bill. When former soldier Hamish Clarke was stationed in Germany in the 1970s he developed an interest in modern European pottery. He still adds to his collection, buying on marketplaces or direct from sellers in Germany and Belgium. He spied four pieces of pottery he liked on eBay and agreed a price of â¬160 [Â£142] with the seller. ""When I tried to pay for it, it was asking for â¬191 euros,"" he says. He wondered whether the charges might have been avoided if he had bought directly from the seller. Why was he charged? There's no way around the import VAT, says Michelle Dale, and it applies to second hand items as well as gifts, even if you've bought them from a private individual. EBay already has its system set up,externalto charge the extra VAT upfront.Amazon says VAT will always be charged at point of sale,externalon its site too. But the system won't be running smoothly yet everywhere, warns Martyn James. Jemima Brown ordered a Â£150 pair of boots from a UK company to be delivered to her home in Auvergne, France. ""A week later I received an email from La Poste telling me that when the parcel was delivered it would only be handed over if I paid the â¬88 [Â£78] import duty,"" she says. The documentation said it was â¬43 for VAT, â¬30 for customs tariffs, and â¬15 handling fees. She rang the company which said she could reject the delivery and receive a full refund. Why was she charged? Shoppers on the continent buying from UK firms face the same rules as UK shoppers do in reverse so Jemima would have had to pay VAT and customs charges, because the boots or the materials they were made from, originated from outside the EU. Michelle Dale thinks Jemima was lucky to be able to reject the delivery so easily. Some firms are changing their terms and conditions so that customers have to cover the extra charges, even when goods are returned. Gary Rycroft says if a retailer doesn't make it clear that you might face extra fees, you could argue that these were ""hidden costs"" that you shouldn't have to pay. But don't expect that to be an easy battle to win.

Coronavirus: Seafarers stuck at sea âa humanitarian crisisâ,"The fate of more than 200,000 seafarers who play a crucial role in keeping global trade flowing is being labelled a ""humanitarian crisis at sea"". More than 300 firms and organisations are urging for them to be treated as ""key workers"", so they can return home without risking public health. More than 90% of global trade - from household goods to medical supplies - is moved by sea. But governments have banned crew from coming ashore amid Covid-19 fears. Large firms including shipping titan AP Moller-Maersk, oil firms BP and Shell, consumer giant Unilever and mining groups Rio Tinto and Vale, as well as maritime transporters, unions, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and other supply chain partners have signed the Neptune Declaration on Seafarer Wellbeing and Crew Change. They are calling for all countries to designate seafarers as key workers and implement crew change protocols. 'Cabin fever': Sailors tell of months stuck on ships Seafarers in limbo as coronavirus hits shipping The 400,000 seafarers who can't go home The signees of the Neptune Declaration are warning global leaders that ignoring the risk to crews' mental and physical wellbeing threatens global supply chains, which are crucial to vaccinating the world from coronavirus. The firms and organisations hope that world leaders, gathering at this year's virtual Davos Forum, will heed their call. ""Unified, prompt action from governments and other key stakeholders is needed to protect the lives and livelihoods of the 1.6 million seafaring men and women who serve us all across the seas, and who continue to face extreme risk to their safety and earnings,"" said WEF's head of supply chain and transport Margi Van Gogh. This video can not be played India coronavirus: The stranded sailor yet to meet his daughter ""By granting stranded seafarers key worker status, and by prioritising vaccine allocation for transport crew, we can prevent a deepening humanitarian and economic crisis."" According to latest data from the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) and international ship owners body Bimco, there are 1.6 million seafarers serving on internationally trading merchant ships worldwide. Typically, ICS estimates around 100,000 seafarers are rotated every month, with 50,000 staff disembarking and 50,000 crew embarking ships to comply with international maritime regulations, governing safe working hours and crew welfare. Seafarers usually work 10-12 hours shifts, seven days a week to man ships, on four or six-month-long contracts, followed by a period of leave. But due to the coronavirus crisis and travel bans brought in by many governments to combat new variants of Covid-19, hundreds of thousands of crew are spending extended periods at sea, far beyond the expiry of their contracts. For those who have been at sea for months longer than their contract stipulates, there is a growing risk to their mental and physical wellbeing. ""Seafarers are the unacceptable collateral damage on the war on Covid-19 and this must stop,"" said ICS secretary general Guy Platten. ""If we want to maintain global trade seafarers must not be put to the back of the vaccine queue. You can't inject a global population without the shipping industry and most importantly our seafarers. We are calling on the supply chain to take action to support seafarers now.""

Michael BristowBBC World Service Asia Pacific editor Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has abandoned plans to allow some children out of their homes for the first time in 10 months. They've been cooped up to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Under-15s have been unable to legally go outside since March - one of the toughest virus restrictions on children anywhere in the world. It has had an effect on their schooling and mental health, as well as the economy because family trips have been impossible. Last week though, the government finally said 10 to 14-year-olds would be allowed out from February. But President Duterte has now rescinded that order after the more contagious UK variant of the virus was discovered. Duterte told children they'd have to continue watching TV instead. While the UK reaches a milestone in terms of the number of deaths today, it is one year ago that the Chinese government locked down the city of Wuhan. For weeks beforehand, officials had maintained that the virus outbreak was under control - just a few dozen cases linked to a live animal market. But in fact, coronavirus had been spreading throughout the city and around China. We look back at thosefive critical days early on in the outbreak.

Listen back on the free BBC Sounds app. Jake HortonBBC Reality Check President Joe Biden has said that the US might be able to
boost its daily vaccination roll-out targets after criticising the Trump
administrationâs record. Biden, who has described the previous vaccine programme
as a ""dismal failure"", has committed to getting 100 million vaccine doses done
in his first 100 days and has since said: ""I think we may be able to get that to 1.5 million a day, rather than one million a day."" Is he right about the vaccine roll-out under the Trump
administration? As of 20 January, when Biden became US president, about
16.5 million vaccines had been administered. That is some way off the Trump administration's target of
vaccinating 20 million people by the end of 2020. In fact, fewer than three million people had received a jab
by 31 December. Vaccinations have sped up since the start of the year. The daily average for the week before Trump left office
was less than 900,000, according toOur World in Data,external. That figure has since risen above one million doses a day,
and Biden has come under some
scrutiny for not setting a more ambitious target. When you look at the countries doing the most vaccinations by population, the US is fourth after Israel, the UAE and the UK in terms of doses per 100 people. Read more here Reality Check Israel has the highest per capita vaccination rate in the
world - but vaccines are yet to be rolled out to Palestinians in Gaza and the
West Bank, viewed as occupied territories by the international community. Israelâs health minister says it is the Palestinian
Authorityâs responsibility to provide healthcare under an interim deal for
self-rule in Palestinian areas. But UN human rights experts say there are international rules about the duty of an occupying power to
provide healthcare - although Israel often argues it isn't technically
occupying the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in occupied East Jerusalem are entitled to be
vaccinated against Covid - they have Israeli residency status. And medics
working in Palestinian hospitals there are also getting vaccines. Some health experts and business leaders have also called
for Israel to include other Palestinians in its vaccine programme, as around
tens of thousands of  Palestinians travel daily to work in Israel and in
Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the
West Bank â said they are doing deals with four companies that will provide
enough vaccines for 70% of its people, and will get another 20% from the World
Health Organization-backed Covax scheme. But there are few details at the moment about when vaccines
will start or who will receive them. Read more here Among the figures on the pandemic in the UK today came news that more than 6.85m people have had a coronavirus vaccination first dose. Another 279,757 people had received a jab as of Monday,official figures show.,external One of those getting a vaccination on Tuesday was actress and TV presenter Floella Benjamin,who tweeted a picture of the occasion,external. Baroness Benjamin, 71, who made her name as the host of TV's Play School in the 1970s, is now a campaigner for young people. Diggers tipped piles of dead mink into trenches in Denmark Mink farmers in Denmark - the worldâs largest producer of mink pelts until a coronavirus mass cull - have been given a compensation package worth more than 19 billion Danish kroner (Â£2.2bn). It was voted through by MPs late on Monday. The agriculture minister said it was a chance to move on, while the Danish mink breeders association said the industry would never return, as China and Poland could produce mink furs much more cheaply. Mink farmers were ordered to destroy their entire stock of about 17 million animals last November, over fears that a mutant strain of Covid-19 could pass from mink to humans. But chaos followed. The scientific basis of the order came into question, and mass graves appeared to be poisoning soil and water supplies. The issue led to the resignation of the previous agriculture minister. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Some of the worst violence was in Rotterdam The ignition of discontent has rocked the core of Dutch society. In the absence of any legitimate way to socialise, is this simply an outlet for young men to feel part of something, their masks concealing their identities and enabling them to violently channel their frustrations? There are more sinister influences at play. Messages on social media, overt and covert, have whipped up anger. Misinformation has even been spread by some politicians. Some feared a curfew would be a tipping point, as Dutch restrictions tighten while some neighbouring countries relax their rules. The vast majority of people in the Netherlands are peacefully observing the curfew. The unrest was initially seen as a response to the first ""stay-at-home"" order imposed since Nazi occupation during World War Two. That notion has been dismissed by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who said the rioters were simply criminals and would be treated as such. But there are simmering anxieties in Dutch towns and cities, and with less than two months before a general election, voters are vulnerable and the streets volatile. This video can not be played Netherlands: Third night of anti-lockdown riots Away from UK news now, and nearby, in the Netherlands, the Dutch government says it will not lift a curfew, after a third night of violent protests against increased Covid curbs. Shops in Rotterdam and other cities were looted and Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra condemned the violence, saying: ""It's scum doing this"". More than 180 arrests have been made. The Dutch chief of police said the riots no longer had ""anything to do with the basic right to demonstrate"". The criminal violence had to stop, said Prime Minister Mark Rutte. A night-time curfew from 21:00 (20:00 GMT) to 04:30 (03:30 GMT) was imposed last Saturday to help to halt the spread of the virus. Anyone caught violating it faces a â¬95 (Â£84) fine.

EU to tighten vaccine exports amid AstraZeneca rowThe EU says it is unacceptable that AstraZeneca is cutting the number of pledged vaccine doses.,"Reports suggest AstraZeneca may have warned of a 60% cut to doses available The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive. AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers. The EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding ""fair distribution"". The UK's vaccine minister warned of ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"". AstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant. Read our latest reports on Covid here Vaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates. Separately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people. Last week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems andPfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower. In response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to ""provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries"".

Co-op and Morrisons see queues over payments outage,"Co-op, Morrisons and their payments processing provider ACI say they are investigating an IT glitch that created problems for card payments in stores. Long queues were seen outside some of the Co-op's convenience stores from Sunday amid the snow, with some shoppers asked to use cash. Co-op and Morrisons said customers were no longer experiencing problems but they, and ACI, were studying the cause. One MP said the problem exposed the risks of letting cash use ""wither"". ACI, which provides real-time payments processing for the retailers, said: ""We are working closely with the IT teams at our partners to resolve the problem as quickly as possible. We apologise to shoppers for any inconvenience caused."" The issue comes as contactless payments have taken off in the UK during the pandemic, with fewer consumers using cash to pay for groceries. People shopping more locally in lockdown, says Co-op Morrisons first UK supermarket to pay Â£10 an hour Waitrose and Co-op cut prices for 'tough times' Customers complained about the issue on social media.

A Co-op spokesman told the BBC: ""All card transactions are being processed as usual and our payment process partner is investigating after we experienced an intermittent issue. ""We would like to apologise to customers for any inconvenience caused during that time.""

At some stores, customers queuing outside were warned on Monday evening that transactions had to be ""cash-only"" due to the ongoing issue. Some customers said they had to use the convenience store's cash machine to withdraw money to pay for purchases. However in other stores, the problem was intermittent, impacting some payment card brands, but not others. Shadow economic secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""This shows the dangers of letting the cash network just wither away as use declines.

Facebook News feature launches in UKThe UK is the second market - after the US - to get Facebook's latest news feature.Technology,"Facebook News, the social network's dedicated section for news content, is launching in the UK. The UK is the second market to get Facebook News, which launched in the United States last year. Several major news publishers, including Channel 4, Sky News, and The Guardian have signed deals with Facebook to provide content. It comes as the tech industry's relationship with the media comes under increased scrutiny. Google last week threatened to pull out of Australiaif forced by law to enter commercial agreements with news publishers - somethingabout which Facebook has also expressed concern.

Google to pay for 'high quality' news in new deal Facebook News is the social network's own attempt to address the long-running friction between it and news publishers, as advertising spend has increasingly moved to the large tech firms instead of individual news outlets. The new feature is set to go live on Tuesday afternoon, Facebook said. The new feature is a dedicated tab,externalwithin the Facebook mobile app, accessible by tapping the three-line icon for more options. The tab features a mix of major daily news stories and ""personalised"" news selected for each reader based on their interests, as decided by Facebook's algorithm. Facebook says it pays publishers ""for content that is not already on the platform"", and says the feature will also provide publishers with new advertising and subscription ""opportunities"". The dedicated news feed will have personalisation controls, Facebook says That may be partly based on data from the United States, which Facebook says shows more than 95% of traffic on Facebook News is from people who have not read those publications before. The social network says the new product is a ""a multi-year investment that puts original journalism in front of new audiences"". And news organisations, for which new readers are often in short supply, are signing up. In November,when it first announced the product was heading to the UK,,externalmajor names such as The Economist, The Independent, and Cosmopolitan were already on board. Ahead of Tuesday's launch, The Daily Mail, Financial Times and Telegraph were also announced, among others. BBC News has not signed a commercial deal with Facebook News, but may still appear on the tab through public posts it makes on the Facebook platform. Facebook also says that this new product is a direct result of discussions with the news industry, with which it has often been at loggerheads. The tech giant is responsible for driving a lot of traffic around the internet, and a story which performs well on Facebook will often attract more readers than one which does not. But Facebook has also repeatedly made changes to its algorithms over the years which have affected news organisations, sometimes with little notice. It has also encouraged organisations to use its features such as instant articles, or to make video content for Facebook. However, it envisions Facebook News as a better solution than earlier attempts, and one it plans to roll out to other countries - including France and Germany - in the near future. ""Our goal has always been to work out the best ways we can support the industry in building sustainable business models,"" Facebook said in its blog post about the UK launch.

EU to tighten vaccine exports amid AstraZeneca rowThe EU says it is unacceptable that AstraZeneca is cutting the number of pledged vaccine doses.Europe,"Reports suggest AstraZeneca may have warned of a 60% cut to doses available The EU has warned Covid vaccine producers they must deliver agreed supplies, amid fears reductions could seriously hamper its inoculation drive. AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech have both said production problems mean they cannot supply the expected numbers. The EU warned it could restrict exports of vaccines made in the bloc, with Germany's health minister demanding ""fair distribution"". The UK's vaccine minister warned of ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"". AstraZeneca is mainly produced in the UK, while the UK's supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine come from the company's Belgian plant. Read our latest reports on Covid here Vaccine supply has become a critical issue as nations seek to stem high infection rates. Separately, the German health ministry joined AstraZeneca in strongly denying some reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for its vaccine among older people. Last week, AstraZeneca told the EU it was falling behind on its supply target because of production problems andPfizer-BioNTech has also said supplies of its vaccine will be lower. In response, EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has now said companies making Covid vaccines in the bloc will have to ""provide early notification whenever they want to export vaccines to third countries"". What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Cases, deaths and vaccinations by country She said the 27-member EU bloc would ""take any action required to protect its citizens"". German Health Minister Jens Spahn backed her call, saying: ""This is not about EU first, this is about Europe's fair share."" Chancellor Angela Merkel told the virtual version of the annual World Economic Forum, usually held in Davos, there should be a ""fair distribution"" across the world. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen earlier told forum: ""Europe invested billions to help develop the world's first Covid-19 vaccines. And now, the companies must deliver. They must honour their obligations."" A worker with Covid vaccines sets out to inoculate patients in Dillenberg, Germany The row could affect supplies to the UK of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Responding to the EU's comments, the UK's Minister for Covid Vaccine Deployment Nadhim Zahawisaid on Tuesday that supplies were ""tight""and warned against what he called ""the dead end of vaccine nationalism"", adding: ""No-one is safe until the whole world is safe."" He said he was confident the UK would receive enough doses to meet its targets - a first dose to 15 million of the most vulnerable by mid-February and to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. The EU has already faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines, which it buys on behalf of all member states. Ms Kyriakides tweeted that Monday's talks with AstraZeneca ""resulted in dissatisfaction,externalwith the lack of clarity and insufficient explanations"". She said the EU had requested ""a detailed planning of vaccine deliveries"" and the next meeting with the company would be held on Wednesday. AstraZeneca, a UK-Swedish multinational headquartered in England, said it was ""doing everything it can to bring its vaccine to millions of Europeans as soon as possible"". The AstraZeneca vaccine is being used already in the UK but has not yet been approved by the EU, although the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is expected to green light it at the end of this month. The bloc signed a deal in August for 300 million doses, with an option for 100 million more. The EU had hoped that, as soon as approval was given, delivery would start straight away, with some 80 million doses arriving in the 27 nations by March. This video can not be played Sofia Bettiza explains why some countries are far ahead of others in the vaccination race Last week, AstraZeneca said ""reduced yields at a manufacturing site within our European supply chain"" meant the number of initial doses for EU member states would be lower. Officials have not confirmed publicly how big the shortfall will be, but Reuters news agency reported that deliveries would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of this year. An AstraZeneca partner plant in Belgium involved in the ""viral vector"" process - the delivery of genetic material into cells - is thought to be the problem. But one German member of the European Parliament, Peter Liese, told Reuters news agency that the statement that there were difficulties in the EU supply chain but not elsewhere was ""flimsy"" and there should be ""no problem to get the vaccine from the UK to the continent"". European officials familiar with Monday's EU-AstraZeneca meeting said the company had offered to bring forward deliveries by a week to 7 February, but this did not mean an increase in supplies for the quarter. The Serum Institute of India also produces a large amount of AstraZeneca jabs, but has no immediate plans to divert to the EU. Other nations, including Australia and Thailand, have said they have also been told of a drop in AstraZeneca supply. The AstraZeneca reduction is a serious blow in the wake of Pfizer-BioNTech's statement. Pfizer-BioNTech said last week it was delaying shipments for the next few weeksbecause of work to increase capacity at its Belgian plant. The EU has ordered 600 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech, which is already being used on patients around the bloc. Ursula von der Leyen has pledged to inoculate 70% of adults in the EU by the end of August. By Stephanie Hegarty, BBC Population correspondent As the diplomatic tussle goes on between vaccine-producing countries in Europe there could be a rare bit of good news for the rest of the world, including the lower-income countries already struggling to secure a supply. Covax, an initiative spearheaded by the World Health Organization that aims to distribute vaccines around the world more fairly, says it doesn't expect its supply of vaccines to be affected. Most of that supply is coming from a producer in India with some also manufactured in South Korea. Covax says it's on schedule to deliver its first vaccines in lower-income countries in February, helped by the fact that the US under President Joe Biden recently committed $4bn (Â£3.5bn) to the scheme. Covax: The global plan to share vaccines fairly Germany's health ministry on Tuesday firmly denied reports in German media of a lower efficacy rate for AstraZeneca among the elderly. The reports, including in the Handelsblatt economic daily, cited sources saying the efficacy was as low as 8% in the over 65s. But the ministry said its review of the data in the reports ""did not allow this assumption"" and that it ""appears that two things have been mixed up in the reports"". AstraZeneca issued a statement saying the reports were ""completely incorrect"", adding: ""In November, we published data in The Lancet demonstrating that older adults showed strong immune responses to the vaccine, with 100% of older adults generating spike-specific antibodies after the second dose."" UK Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the reports had created ""confusion and concern"" and risked ""adding to the spread of disinformation"".

UK unemployment rate continues to rise,"The number of people out of work in the UK has continued to rise, with those aged 25 to 34 facing the biggest risk of losing their jobs. In the three months to November, people in that age group had a redundancy rate of 16.2 per 1,000, a fivefold increase on the same period a year earlier. Unemployment rose to 5% from 4.9% as Covid continued to hit the jobs market. Some 1.72 million were jobless,the Office for National Statistics said,external, the highest level in five years. That was 418,000 more than in the same period the previous year, the biggest increase since late 2009. Abigail Ward, 27, freely admits that she was ""a bit naive"" when she began her latest job hunt after being made redundant as a store manager at J Crew in London last September. Having spent the past five years since graduating in retail management, she has a passion for bricks-and-mortar retail and ""the value of face-to-face customer interactions"" - and it's an area she wants to stay in. ""I knew it would be hard, but I've been in this position before,"" she told the BBC. ""Back then, it only took me three or four weeks to find a role and maybe 10 job applications, so it all happened quite seamlessly, whereas this time around, it's definitely been a lot more difficult. ""I've probably sent off around 30 to 40 job applications in the last six months, the majority of which just go into the abyss. You never hear a word."" However, Abigail has managed to get to the final interview stage for a job - ""with me and just one other candidate"" - on four separate occasions. ""Unfortunately, I've missed out on each of those occasions,"" she says. ""There are so many hundreds of applications and it's so competitive,"" she adds. ""It's definitely been a big challenge."" What are my rights if I am made redundant? The hospitality industry was worst hit by the rise in joblessness, followed by manufacturing. In both sectors, the number of people unemployed was up by more than 50,000 on the previous year. Across all age groups, redundancies rose to a record high of 14.2 per 1,000 people. However, job vacancies also rose, with 81,000 new openings reported in the three months. ONS deputy chief executive Sam Beckett told the BBC that the UK had not seen such rises in unemployment since the global financial crisis. ""Payroll numbers show the number of workers on payroll have fallen by over 828,000 since the pandemic began,"" she added. Firms planned 800,000 redundancies last year UK borrowing hits highest December level on record Employment was still at ""relatively high levels"" compared with other countries, Ms Beckett said, but workers aged 16 to 24 were suffering some of the biggest falls in employment. However, she added: ""We've currently got over 4.5 million people on the furlough scheme, so that does complicate the picture when you're trying to interpret what's going on in the labour market."" While the main rate of unemployment has reached 5% for the first time in nearly five years, and this morning's numbers saw the largest increase in the numbers unemployed since the financial crisis, the chancellor must now be tempted to extend the furlough scheme to co-ordinate with the rollout of the post-vaccination reopening of the economy. There are some bad numbers in this release, as would be expected from the pandemic restrictions, but they were expected to be a little worse. In the quarter to November, there were 418,000 extra unemployed over the same period in 2019 - the sharpest annual rise since the 2009 financial crisis. The rate of redundancies reached a record of 14 per 1,000 people. Loss of jobs was concentrated in sectors such as retail and hospitality, most affected by social restrictions, which were reintroduced at the end of the period. Young people also faced the sharpest drops in employment. The jobs numbers are yet to reflect the current return to national lockdowns. Though a significant rise over the past few pandemic-afflicted months, unemployment at 5% is still low by international standards and is being kept in check by the government's job retention furlough scheme. The current plan is to end the costly scheme in April, which economists expect would see a sharp jump in jobless figures to 6% or 7%. But as the government continues to communicate caution about how fast restrictions on the economy will be lifted, business groups are adamant that the scheme needs to be extended into the early summer, or at least linked to the success of the vaccination programme. ""This crisis has gone on far longer than any of us hoped - and every job lost as a result is a tragedy,"" said Chancellor Rishi Sunak. ""Whilst the NHS is working hard to protect people with the vaccine, we're throwing everything we've got at supporting businesses, individuals and families. ""Our Plan for Jobs includes grants and loans so that firms can keep employees on, the furlough scheme to help protect jobs, and programmes like Kickstart alongside record investment in skills so that people can find their first job, their next job or a new job if needed,"" Mr Sunak added. With no end in sight to the current lockdown measures, many firms fear that they may not be able to survive the pandemic, with pubs and restaurants bearing the brunt of the restrictions. ""The pandemic continues to rip through the labour market,"" said Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors. ""A return to tighter restrictions late last year will have stretched businesses' ability to retain staff. Meanwhile, the furlough scheme will have provided an invaluable cushion for many firms, preventing unemployment from edging up even further."" It is ""crucial"" for the chancellor to extend the furlough scheme and other Covid-19 economic support beyond the spring, he said. ""The forthcoming Budget is a vital moment to help firms retain, retrain and rehire workers as the vaccine rolls out. In particular, the government should provide a relief for employers' National Insurance contributions and support reskilling opportunities to shore up the recovery.""

The trials and tribulations of home-schooling,"Clare Ferguson-Walker says she has struggled with home-schooling her two children As kitchen tables are turned back into classrooms across Wales, parents admit they are struggling with the return to home-schooling. For Clare Ferguson-Walker from Tavernspite, Pembrokeshire, the experience has been a ""nightmare"". She said trying to educate her two children alongside work has resulted in her relying on universal credit. Getting to grips withhome-schooling in the first lockdownwas ""a shock to the system"". ""My heart goes out to teachers, I can't imagine what it was like for them putting together all these packages,"" she said.

When I have managed to pin him down he's been 'go away, dinosaur mother, I know how to do it!' ""I'm not au fait with these subjects I haven't done for years. It's different to how I learned at school."" As a single parent, Clare said she had found it difficult to juggle home-schooling with her work. ""At first, in the summer, we were doing Joe Wicks exercises every day then some work. Then it fell into chaos. I tried really hard at the beginning to be organised. ""I'm an artist and sculptor - that work ended and my income has dried up so I'm on universal credit. ""It's incredibly tough financially. Life has revolved around looking after the kids,"" she said. By the end of the year, she said the pressure had all become too much. ""The thought of going through that again in the winter months - without sunny days in the garden - the stress really got to me. ""I was finding myself going repeatedly from the kettle to the fridge and back again in this weird loop, thinking what do I do now? ""It was like being a caged animal, like one of those bears that starts to pace in a cage. The kids had gone feral by then. ""I think it's been horrendous for young people and families - we can't even rely on grandparents. Mental health struggles are at an all-time high,"" she said. ""The one positive is I've got to know my kids a hell of a lot more and there have been times that have been lovely. ""I think they've learned more sat around the kitchen table when we've been talking about what's going on, they've learned about rational thinking, the importance of science and not jumping to conclusions. Jayne Palmer advises not sitting down at a desk Jayne Palmer from Cardiff, who home-educated both her sons, said there was too much pressure on parents to replicate traditional classroom learning. ""This is not an ideal circumstance for home-education families either because they are not used to being locked indoors. ""I think there's far too much emphasis in continuing the set curriculum. Right now it's a complete waste of time. There's pressure to compete in a system parents weren't even involved in. It is far more important to ""create and interest in learning,"" she said. ""There's been a tendency of families to rush to buy desks and chairs and pens. What we find is the best way forward is not to sit down and teach your children - watch documentaries with them, play online games with historical content, practise reading to them, do some cooking, Lego or gardening.""

Yellen to be first female US treasury secretary,"Janet Yellen has been confirmed as the first ever female US treasury secretary in a Senate vote. Ms Yellen, who headed the US central bank from 2014 to 2018, earlier won bipartisan support from members of the Senate Finance Committee. She will be responsible for guiding the Biden administration's economic response to the pandemic. The US is struggling to rebound economically from the hit caused by the coronavirus pandemic. At her confirmation hearing on 19 January, Ms Yellen urged Congress to approve trillions more in pandemic relief and economic stimulus, saying that lawmakers should ""act big"" without worrying about national debt. Biden economic plans challenged at Yellen hearing Yellen tipped as first US female treasury secretary In response, Republican senators warned the former Federal Reserve head this was not the time for ""a laundry list"" of liberal reforms. Ms Yellen disagreed, highlighting the fact that many families whose incomes have fallen were not reached by jobless programmes. She argued that plans to raise taxes must be seen in the context of financing bigger investments necessary to make the US economy competitive. ""The focus now is not on tax increases. It is on programmes to help us get through the pandemic,"" she stressed. Janet Yellen was previously chair of the US Federal Reserve. She was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the central bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality. Before then-President Barack Obama named her to lead the Fed in 2014, she had served as one of its board members for a decade, including four years as vice-chair. Janet Yellen speaking at a press conference in 2017 as US Federal Reserve Chair Donald Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. However, her climb to the top of the economics profession had made her a feminist icon in the economics world. When she left the Fed in 2018, many paid tribute to her leadership by imitating her signature look of a blazer with a popped collar. Ms Yellen is seen as someone able to satisfy both progressive and centrist members of Mr Biden's Democratic party. Her nomination to lead the Fed in 2014 won support from some Republicans. Her focus on employment, rather than inflation, gave her a reputation of favouring low interest rates, which spur economic activity by making it less expensive to borrow money. But under her leadership, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 - albeit less aggressively than some more conservative commentators supported. Her stewardship of that process has won praise on Wall Street, even as it remains hotly debated.

Facebook News feature launches in UK,"Facebook News, the social network's dedicated section for news content, is launching in the UK. The UK is the second market to get Facebook News, which launched in the United States last year. Several major news publishers, including Channel 4, Sky News, and The Guardian have signed deals with Facebook to provide content. It comes as the tech industry's relationship with the media comes under increased scrutiny. Google last week threatened to pull out of Australiaif forced by law to enter commercial agreements with news publishers - somethingabout which Facebook has also expressed concern. And French publishers recently agreed a deal with Google on how a new EU copyright law about news excerpts should be applied. Could Google really leave Australia? Google to pay for 'high quality' news in new deal Facebook News is the social network's own attempt to address the long-running friction between it and news publishers, as advertising spend has increasingly moved to the large tech firms instead of individual news outlets. The new feature is set to go live on Tuesday afternoon, Facebook said. The new feature is a dedicated tab,externalwithin the Facebook mobile app, accessible by tapping the three-line icon for more options. The tab features a mix of major daily news stories and ""personalised"" news selected for each reader based on their interests, as decided by Facebook's algorithm. Facebook says it pays publishers ""for content that is not already on the platform"", and says the feature will also provide publishers with new advertising and subscription ""opportunities"". The dedicated news feed will have personalisation controls, Facebook says That may be partly based on data from the United States, which Facebook says shows more than 95% of traffic on Facebook News is from people who have not read those publications before. The social network says the new product is a ""a multi-year investment that puts original journalism in front of new audiences"". And news organisations, for which new readers are often in short supply, are signing up. In November,when it first announced the product was heading to the UK,,externalmajor names such as The Economist, The Independent, and Cosmopolitan were already on board. Ahead of Tuesday's launch, The Daily Mail, Financial Times and Telegraph were also announced, among others. BBC News has not signed a commercial deal with Facebook News, but may still appear on the tab through public posts it makes on the Facebook platform. Facebook also says that this new product is a direct result of discussions with the news industry, with which it has often been at loggerheads. The tech giant is responsible for driving a lot of traffic around the internet, and a story which performs well on Facebook will often attract more readers than one which does not. But Facebook has also repeatedly made changes to its algorithms over the years which have affected news organisations, sometimes with little notice. It has also encouraged organisations to use its features such as instant articles, or to make video content for Facebook. However, it envisions Facebook News as a better solution than earlier attempts, and one it plans to roll out to other countries - including France and Germany - in the near future. ""Our goal has always been to work out the best ways we can support the industry in building sustainable business models,"" Facebook said in its blog post about the UK launch. ""As we invest more in news, and pay publishers for more content in more countries, we will work with them to support the long-term viability of newsrooms.""

"Cancel developing countries' debt, MPs urge","The UK government should cancel the debt owed by developing countries struggling with the impact of Covid-19, MPs have said. The International Development Committee warned that the pandemic was fuelling extreme poverty and food insecurity. It was also disrupting routine healthcare, such as tuberculosis immunisations, it added. The Foreign Office said it was spending Â£1.3bn to protect livelihoods, improve health systems and distribute vaccines. More than two million people around the world have died after contracting coronavirus, with almost 100 million cases reported. Appearing before the Commons International Development Committee, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he wanted the UK to be a ""force for good in the world"" as it fought the pandemic. He defended the government's decision to cut overseas aid spending next year, saying there were ""no easy choices"" given the hit to the public finances from the pandemic. Covid map: Where have the two million deaths been? Backlash over cut to UK overseas aid budget The cuts mean the UK will fail to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid in 2021-2, a target that was enshrined into UK law in 2015. Mr Raab said he hoped the UK would be able to reach 0.7% again as ""soon as possible"" but this would only happen once the long-term damage to the UK's balance sheet had been ""corrected"". Labour said the government was ""betraying the world's poorest."" Shadow international development secretary Preet Kaur Gill said: ""This move signals a retreat from the world stage, damages the UK's reputation and will only show our allies and detractors that Britain under Boris Johnson is no longer interested in fulfilling our moral or legal responsibilities. ""Labour are committed to spending 0.7% of Gross National Income on aid to tackle global poverty and injustice and will oppose any attempt from this government to damage this country's reputation."" Mr Raab said he took seriously warnings from Conservative MPs and ex-ministers that to press ahead with the cuts without passing new legislation would be unlawful. Former Solicitor General Lord Garnier said earlier on Tuesday that Mr Raab's ""reputation"" and the government's domestic and international standing would be damaged if it was seen to ""flout a clear legal obligation"". In tough financial times,Mr Raab said the UK needed to ""make the most"" of its Â£10bn spending,external, avoiding ""salami-slicing"" budgets and focusing on a handful of priorities such as climate, biodiversity, conflict prevention and helping the ""bottom billions"" out of extreme poverty. ""I think we should unabashedly be proud and confident about the moral responsibility we have to make the world a better place,"" he said. ""At the same time, I see a range of grittier strategic interests in dealing with climate change and humanitarian suffering and indeed trade."" The Foreign Office took over responsibility for overseas aid in September after absorbing the Department for International Development. On debt cancellation, the committee said that, due to disruption caused by the pandemic, millions of people in developing countries were more at risk from diseases such as tuberculosis because of missed immunisations. Millions were more likely to lose their livelihoods because of the global recession and millions of women were more exposed to sexual violence. The MPs want the government to provide more aid to address the problems and cancel long-term national debt that was diverting cash away from those in need. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We'll only be safe from coronavirus when we're all safe - which is why the UK is leading global efforts to fight this pandemic, committing up to Â£1.3bn of new UK aid to find and equitably distribute a vaccine, strengthen health systems, protect livelihoods and support the global economy."" They added that the UK would use its 2021 presidency of the G7 group of leading economies ""to help the world build back stronger and fairer after the pandemic"". This would include ""promoting open societies, championing gender equality and girls' education, and setting out new international approaches to global health security and climate action"", the spokesperson said. The UK has announced it will step up its efforts to help other countries, including some of the poorest in the world, to find new variants of Covid-19. In a speech in London, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK would share its world-leading genomics expertise worldwide to help countries identify new mutations of the virus and protect global health security.

Grayling leads MPs' charge to save hedgehogs,"A group of MPs is calling for hedgehog nesting sites to get the same protections as those for bats and badgers, in an effort to boost numbers. Former Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has tabled an amendment to the Environment Bill, which he said would help ""Britain's favourite animal"". The spiky mammals should be on developers' ""radar"" when they are planning a project, he added. A report in 2018 suggested UK hedgehog numbers had halved since 2000. Rough estimates put the population at one million, compared with 30 million during the 1950s. Hedgehog numbers 'down by half' Hedgehog road deaths in UK 'as high as 335,000' Johnson's newt-counting claim questioned Mr Grayling's amendment would add hedgehogs the list of protected animals under the Wildlife and Countryside Act. This would place a legal obligation on developers to search for the animals and take action to reduce the risk to them from building. Chris Grayling said hedgehogs should feature on property developers' surveys It is illegal to kill or capture hedgehogs using certain methods but Mr Grayling said: ""It seems wrong to me, for example, that whenever a developer has to carry out a wildlife survey before starting work on a project that the hedgehog is not on anyone's radar. ""It is Britain's favourite animal, its numbers are declining and it should be as well protected as any other popular but threatened British animal."" Former cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Andrew Mitchell and Dame Cheryl Gillan are among 13 fellow Conservative MPssupporting Mr Grayling's amendment.,external Labour's Hilary Benn and Debbie Abrahams have also signed it. The Environment Bill - which seeks to write environmental principles into UK law for the first time - will be debated in the House of Commons on Tuesday. It includes setting legally binding targets to improve air quality, water, biodiversity and waste reduction by 2037. But some Conservative backbenchers say this is much too slow. They want the targets brought forward to 2030 at the latest. An amendment from the Conservative MP, Chris Loder, calls for unmissable targets to reduce plastics waste. It comes as a report from Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency claims that the UK's 10 largest supermarket chains put plastic equivalent to the weight of 90 Eiffel Towers on to the market in 2019. The study found that while the number of single-use carrier bags fell by more than a third, more than one and a half billion plastic ""bags for life"" were issued by the top brands, and that 2.5 billion plastic water bottles were sold or given away. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the bill would help ""improve the environment for future generations"". It added that ministers were ""ambitious"" to ""drive a world-leading programme of environmental reform"". For Labour, shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard said the bill should be prioritised to complete its passage in this session of Parliament. He added that the UK needed legislation that ""recognises the urgency of the crisis and doesn't go backwards"".

Pandemic prompts Super Bowl ad rethink in US,"Budweiser has said it will not advertise its beer during the Super Bowl this year, joining a growing number of big brands sitting out the annual American football championship. The event remains one of the most-watched in the US each year, drawing more than 100 million viewers in 2020. The advertisements are often as much a conversation-starter as the game itself, sometimessparking controversy. Firms say the virus has made finding the right message especially difficult. Others are grappling with financial hits caused by the pandemic, which has dampened spending on many items, while also casting more than 10 million Americans out of work, resurfacing racial and economic inequalities and sharpening political divisions. Budweiser's parent company, Anheuser-Busch, said it planned to reallocate the money it would have spent on a 30-second Budweiser spot during the game to support an Ad Council campaign promoting coronavirus vaccination. How coronavirus is changing the adverts you see Buccaneers to face Chiefs in Super Bowl It is the first time the flagship brand will not make a game-time appearance in 37 years. Budweiser's 2021 Super Bowl ad highlights coronavirus vaccines and pandemic challenges being overcome ""This commitment is an investment in a future where we can all get back together safely over a beer"",it said,external, adding that it would still promote some of its other brands, such as Bud Light, during the game. On Monday, Budweiser released a full 90-second Super Bowl ad on YouTube entitled ""Bigger Picture"", which showed US citizens overcoming pandemic challenges together and aimed to raise awareness about Covid-19 vaccines. Coke, Pepsi and Hyundai are among the other major names also planning to forego airtime during the broadcast. Coca-Cola said it had made the ""difficult choice"" to ""ensure we are investing in the right resources during these unprecedented times"". The firm did not advertise during the 2019 game either. Hyundai cited ""marketing priorities"" and the timing of upcoming vehicle launches. Pepsi has alsosaid,externalit would not promote its flagship soda during the game. Instead, it is spending money on an advert airing to promote the Super Bowl halftime show it has sponsored for almost a decade. The Super Bowl boasts some of the most expensive advertising slots all year Given all the economic, political and health questions of 2020, companies may have felt it was prudent to pull back - especially several months ago, when they would have had to start planning for such a high-profile night, said Kimberly Whitler, professor at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business ""It's the biggest night of TV watching and so they have to plan it months in advance,"" she said. ""There was so much uncertainty that to go and invest in a Super Bowl ad might have actually felt or seemed frivolous at the time."" The decision goes ""beyond finances"", she added. ""It's also, 'How do we identify the right tone that will match the moment'."" This year's Super Bowl will see star quarterback Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off against reigning champions the Kansas City Chiefs on 7 February. Last year, firms spent an average of $5.25m (Â£3.8m) for a 30-second spot during the championship, driving Super Bowl ad spending to a record $450m,according to Kantar consultancy,external. The firm has said its research suggests Super Bowl ads are ""typically 20 times more effective"" in changing a brand's perception than a normal advert. Anheuser-Busch, an official sponsor of the National Football League, is typically one of the night's top spenders, so the absence of its flagship brand may create its own buzz, said Satya Menon, a Chicago-based managing partner of of ROI practice at Kantar. Chipotle's very first Super Bowl commercial is entitled, ""Can a burrito change the world?"" ""Budweiser in particular is a very established brand ... so for them, it's all about generating love and goodwill and maybe this is another way,"" she says. ""They do have a lot of pre-game advertising out there. When people have the expectation that they wil be there and then they don't see the brand, they'll start thinking why are they not."" Meanwhile, the sports showdown still seems to be finding plenty of firms ready to fill spots left by the stalwarts. Names of newcomers include Chipotle andFiverr,external, a freelance platform that has seen business soar during the pandemic. ""It doesn't get any bigger than the Super Bowl from a branding and marketing perspective,""said Fiverr's chief marketing officer Gali Arnon,external. ""We believe this is a major opportunity for us to introduce the world to Fiverr in a unique and creative way."" Many of this year's advertisers are firms coming from the e-commerce sector, which have benefited from the pandemic, Ms Menon said. And though audience numbers for NFL games have slipped this year, for those firms making their game-night debuts, Ms Menon says she still expects ads to have a big impact - even if the pandemic puts a damper on the traditional Super Bowl parties and other festivities, which can make championship feel like an unofficial national holiday. ""There isn't very much going on in life, so it will always have that great reach,"" she says. ""Some of that excitement may not be there, but watching will definitely be there.""

Dutch shocked to be Europe's vaccination stragglers,"A new test and vaccination centre near Assen The Dutch army is cleared to help hospitals, intensive care units borrow beds from other wards, patients are sent to Germany for treatment, routine operations are postponed, a nationwide lockdown is in place - and still no vaccinations. In a proudly well-organised country, with a well-funded health service, the first Dutch nationals will receive their coronavirus jabs on Wednesday - ten days after their European neighbours and nearly a month after the UK. The Dutch government has come in for stinging criticism. One former public health director, Roel Coutinho, warned the country's ""shameful"" vaccination strategy was ""going to cost lives"". During an emergency debate in parliament, opposition politicians called the approach ""chaotic and confusing"". ""Striking mismanagement by government,"" was the assessment of Tim, a doctor in general practice here. ""We've almost had a year to plan ahead, arrange logistics and update software. But it's all coming down to the last moment."" ""Embarrassing,"" lamented Arjen Joosse, a Dutch oncologist. ""Too slow in preparation and wrong choices."" The pandemic has put Dutch hospitals under severe pressure One of the main delays was caused by an IT system which needed to be upgraded to allow local health authorities to track appointments and check which vaccine each patient has received. The systemic delays since the start of the pandemic are symptomatic of the Netherlands' bureaucratic health service, set up for efficiency but with many disparate elements making it inflexible. Covid-19 has exposed it as sluggish when required to respond to rapidly shifting realities. Tim, the Dutch GP (he declined to give his full name), told me: ""We're lacking a crisis commander in what is essentially a war-like situation"". Alan Wouda, a 23-year old student, said the Dutch were ""blinded by ournuchterheid(sobriety) - too stubborn to acknowledge we made mistakes"". Another student, Joelle Hibbel, asked ""is it possible to be baffled and raging with anger at the same time?"" ""That's how I feel about how the Dutch government is handling the pandemic in general and the vaccination process in particular."" The embattled health minister, Hugo de Jonge, said the Dutch were ""prioritising safety"", and suggested some countries like the UK had cut corners to start vaccinating sooner. The UK gave emergency approval to the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, but the EU's European Medicines Agency took longer to issue a conditional marketing authorisation. Mr De Jonge initially defended the late start and dismissed criticism by saying ""it's not a competition"". Mass vaccinations will be available in all 25 Dutch local health authority locations by 18 January. The Netherlands assumed the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine would be ready for use first. Unlike the Pfizer one, it does not need to be stored at extremely low temperatures and so can be administered more easily by local medics. But that meant the logistics were not in place to distribute the Pfizer/BioNTech drug when it arrived in the Netherlands on 27 December. Mr De Jonge eventually conceded this week that he could have acted faster. ""We have proven insufficiently agile to be able to accommodate the changes,"" he said. ""I could have asked the health boards earlier to prepare... because of their knowledge and expertise with large-scale vaccination campaigns."" With parliamentary elections on 17 March, some parties are keen to appeal to voters anxious about the rapid development of these vaccines. Rival hashtags like #ikwildieprikniet (I don't want the jab) and #ikwildieprik (I want the jab) have been routinely trending on Twitter. Neighbours in The Hague have received calling cards stamped with QR codes through their letterboxes, with a link to anti-vaccination propaganda. Activist groups like ""Virus Truth"" have staged regular protests outside parliament. The leader of the populist Forum for Democracy Party, Thierry Baudet, is among the most staunch and influential sceptics. He continues to claim in tweets that Covid is hardly worse than the flu.But Covid is five to 25 times more deadly than a seasonal flu infection, despite the ongoing myths. A recentIpsos survey of 1,000 people in the Netherlands,externalfound initial reluctance to receive the vaccine subsiding, with approximately 75% now willing to be immunised. Read more on the Dutch coronavirus crisis: Rule-resistant Dutch ordered to mask up indoors Celebs face backlash over Dutch Covid rebellion This video can not be played The glass cabin allows families to see each other in real time The Netherlands brought in a relatively relaxed, so-called ""intelligent"" lockdown during the first Covid wave. But it is now facing record high infection rates and has been forced to introduce stricter measures, some of which it had initially ruled out. Face masks only became mandatory inside public places last month. Delft: Streets normally busy with cyclists are emptied by the lockdown ""Judge us in six months time"" was among the responses tomy report last Aprilthat the Dutch were gambling with a high-risk strategy. As the vaccines roll out, once again the request is: don't judge us yet. The first Dutch person to be inoculated will be Sanna Elkadiri, a 39-year-old care home nurse. Seventeen of the 124 residents in her institution reportedly died within a month. Ms Elkadiri will receive the jab in Veghel, one of three locations where vaccination will start on Wednesday. The Dutch health ministry has made an initial 30,000 vaccines available for a select group of healthcare workers. When asked about the delay, the ministry told the BBC it had been busy upgrading IT systems and training call-centre staff on the scripts to use with people booking their vaccinations.

Extra Â£50m pledged for virus-hit grassroots sport,"Grassroots clubs have stated that many could go out of business due to the pandemic An extra Â£50m is being directed towards grassroots sport after a ""significant hit"" to activity levels amid the coronavirus pandemic. Funding agency Sport England - which has already invested Â£220m since the start of the crisis - announced the additional money as part of a new 10-year strategy. Thousands of clubs, swimming pools, leisure centres and gyms have been forced to shut in recent months. With many children having done no sport outside of PE lessons since the start of November, and schools now shut across the county, emphasis will be placed on supporting young people to get active. Earlier this month, figures showed the majority of young people failed to meet the recommended 60 minutes of daily exercise in the last academic year. Almost a third of children were classed as 'inactive' as a result of the first lockdown, not even doing 30 minutes. Another focus in the new 'Uniting the Movement' strategy will be tackling the long-standing inequalities that have existed within the sport sector and reinforced by the recent disruption. New data shows the pandemic has disproportionately affected people from lower socio-economic groups and BAME backgrounds, for whom there was already a clear pattern of low activity. ""This strategy comes at a critical time"" said Tim Hollingsworth, the chief executive of Sport England. ""We have made significant funding available, but many organisations are struggling, and activity levels have taken a significant hit. ""At the heart of all this is a ruthless focus on providing opportunities to people and communities that have traditionally been left behind."" Andy Reed, Chair of the Sport for Development Coalition, said: ""The impact of the pandemic, growing social challenges and subsequent widening inequalities mean we urgently need a new social contract with sport and physical activity, focused on the wider social outcomes that sport can deliver."" ""We must expand understanding, recognition and investment in the contribution that sport can make beyond health and wellbeing, to addressing loneliness and social isolation, improving educational attainment and employability, to community cohesion, and reducing anti-social behaviour and entry into the justice system."" A group of more than 50 sports bodies have called for a new government action plan and emergency funding to help them survive the pandemic. The Save Our Sports campaign has warned that the activity sector - which employs nearly 600,000 people in the UK and contributes Â£16bn to the economy each year - faces an unprecedented crisis. Huw Edwards, the chief executive of Ukactive, which represents the physical activity industry, said: ""Crucially, before the sector begins its recovery from the impact of Covid-19, it must first survive it. ""The publication of this strategy needs to be accompanied by a new level of urgency and commitment from the government that it will not leave parts of this sector behind, and provide the necessary financial and regulatory support so desperately needed."" But Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston said it was ""placing sport and physical activity at the heart of its coronavirus recovery plan, and Sport England's new strategy provides a strong base to invest in sports organisations, facilities and people"".

Biden adds South Africa to Covid travel bans,"After criticism that his original goal was not bold enough, US President Joe Biden has said he expects the US will soon be able to vaccinate 1.5 million people a day. He had announced last week that 1m vaccines would be administered daily in the first 100 days of his presidency. But some media noted the US had already nearly reached that target under the Trump administration. Mr Biden also renewed Trump-era Covid bans on Monday, adding South Africa. In the first time formally taking reporters' questions during his presidency, Mr Biden said on Monday that he hoped they would be able to get to 1.5 million vaccinations administered daily. ""I think with the grace of God... we'll be able to get that to 1.5 million a day,"" the Democrat said. He added: ""I hope we'll be able to increase as we go along so we'll get to 1.5 million. That's my hope."" Has US vaccine rollout been a 'dismal failure'? Moderna vaccine appears to work against variants 'First Dogs' arrive at the White House Some media had questioned whether the new president's target of one million shots per day was ambitious enough. Last week, at the tail-end of the Trump administration, the US had already reached an average of around 980,000 vaccine doses administered daily. When an Associated Press news agency reporter asked last Thursday why Mr Biden had not aimed higher, he shot back: ""You all said it's not possible. Come on, give me a break man."" But CNN rated,externalthe president's claim about the media as false. During Monday's press conference, a reporter suggested to Mr Biden that he had changed his tone on defeating the public health crisis, pointing out that as a candidate he had vowed to ""shut down"" Covid-19, only to say last week: ""There's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months."" Mr Biden replied: ""What I meant was it took a long time to get here and it's going to take a long time to beat it."" ""I'm confident we will beat this virus,"" he added, ""but we're still going to be talking about it in the summer and dealing with it in the fall."" This video can not be played Five ways President Biden plans to tackle coronavirus in his first 100 days The Biden administration on Monday renewed Trump-era Covid-19 travel bans on non-US visitors from Brazil and most of Europe, including the UK and Ireland. The White House also imposed a new ban on South Africa over its virus variant. Former President Donald Trump had ordered the bans to end on 26 January as one of his final acts in office. The new travel restrictions came as Minnesota recorded the first US case of the Brazil variant from a resident who had recently travelled to that country. ""This case marks the first documented instance of the Brazil P.1 variant in the United States,""said the Minnesota Department of Health,externalon Monday. Trump v Biden on China fact-checked Biden signs more executive orders in Covid fight Biden overturns Trump transgender military ban The unnamed patient lives in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area, said the department. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki confirmed the decision to continue the restrictions on foreign travellers on Monday. She told reporters: ""With the pandemic worsening and more contagious variants spreading, this isn't the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel."" All international travellers must also present a negative test within three days of air travel to the US. Travel restrictions have been in place since mid-March. When Mr Trump ordered a ban on flights from China in February, citing the ""Chinese virus"", Mr Biden railed against Mr Trump's ""hysterical xenophobia"". At the time, the Biden campaign denied the remark was about Mr Trump's travel ban. Ms Psaki was asked on Monday about Mr Biden's stance in light of the ""xenophobic"" remark. She said: ""He was critical of the former president for having a policy that was not more comprehensive than travel restrictions and he conveyed at the time - and more recently - the importance of having a multi-faceted approach."" The US has had more than double the cases of the next highest country, India. There have been over 420,000 deaths - nearly twice as many as Brazil, the second highest - and above 25 million cases. New York City - the most populous urban area in the country - has postponed plans for three mass vaccination sites due to a low supply of vaccine doses. City authorities were co-ordinating plans to turn two baseball stadiums as well as an outlet mall into inoculation hubs, but vaccine supply has not kept up with demand. Staff at Los Angeles airport move passengers through the line at the onsite Covid testing lab Also on Monday, California lifted a stay-at-home order imposed in December as officials said projections for hospital intensive care capacity had improved. The Golden State has been hard hit by a post-holiday surge that stretched hospitals to their limits. Governor Gavin Newsom is facing intense criticism over his refusal to share the data used by his administration to drive Covid policy decisions. State health officials said the metric is complicated, and would only confuse the public if released. The stay-at-home order had been in place for Southern California, the San Joaquin Valley and the Bay Area, which are home to over 90% of the state's residents. The region is still under restrictions, however - non-essential businesses are still to remain closed and restaurants must serve outdoors only. The Biden administration is proposing another economic rescue package, this one worth $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn). However, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday he was against ""an imprecise deluge of borrowed money that would direct huge sums toward those who don't need it"".

Co-op and Morrisons see queues over payments issue,"Co-op, Morrisons and their payments processing provider ACI say they are investigating an IT glitch that created problems for card payments in stores. Long queues were seen outside some of the Co-op's convenience stores from Sunday amid the snow, with some shoppers asked to use cash. Co-op and Morrisons said customers were no longer experiencing problems but they, and ACI, were studying the cause. One MP said the problem exposed the risks of letting cash use ""wither"". ACI, which provides real-time payments processing for the retailers, said: ""We are working closely with the IT teams at our partners to resolve the problem as quickly as possible.

At some stores, customers queuing outside were warned on Monday evening that transactions had to be ""cash-only"" due to the ongoing issue. Some customers said they had to use the convenience store's cash machine to withdraw money to pay for purchases. However in other stores, the problem was intermittent, impacting some payment card brands, but not others. Shadow economic secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden said: ""This shows the dangers of letting the cash network just wither away as use declines. ""The government promised legislation to secure nationwide access to cash a year ago. It hasn't been brought forward.""

PM promises school update 'as soon as we can',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says teachers and pupils will be told âas much as we can, as soon as we canâ about reopening schools The government will tell teachers and parents when schools in England can reopen ""as soon as we can"", the prime minister has said. MPs have called on the government to set out a ""route map"" for reopening amid concerns for children's education. Boris Johnson said he understood why people wanted a timetable but he did not want to lift restrictions while the infection rate was ""still very high"". He would not guarantee schools would reopen before April's Easter break. Mr Johnson said: ""We've now got the R [reproduction rate] down below 1 across the whole of the country, that's a great achievement, we don't want to see a huge surge of infection just when we've got the vaccination programme going so well and people working so hard. ""I understand why people want to get a timetable from me today, what I can tell you is we'll tell you, tell parents, tell teachers as much as we can as soon as we can."" He said the government would be ""looking at the potential of relaxing some measures"" before mid-February, with Downing Street clarifying that this meant looking at the data to decide ""what we may or may not be able to ease from 15 February onwards"". A further 592 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test and another 22,195 cases have been recorded,according to Monday's government figures,external. 'Knackered and confused.' That's just the parents. Will schools reopen before Easter? How is the BBC helping home-schooling families? At Monday's Downing Street press briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said almost four in five of the UK's over-80s have had the vaccine, with nearly 6.6m people in total having had their first dose. But he said the NHS continues to be under ""intense pressure"", with Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, saying there are ""twice the number of people in hospital than we had in the first wave"" of the pandemic. Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast there was ""enormous uncertainty"" and called for the government to set out what the conditions needed to be for pupils to return to schools. The Conservative MP for Harlow suggested the government could consider tighter restrictions in other parts of society and the economy, in order to enable schools to open. Tory MPs were enraged by reports over the weekend that schools might not re-open fully until after the Easter holidays. Ministers say it's the progress of the pandemic that will determine their decision rather than a pre-agreed timetable. Yet whenever the government speaks, parents hear dates. Whether it's that the situation will be reviewed at half-term. Or a pledge to give two weeks' notice when classes will come back. MPs are now pushing for more transparency from the government about how they'll assess the data, and for some ideas between school being mostly closed or totally open. This issue is a perfect metaphor for the situation facing the entire country. Too much hope breeds disappointment, but living with uncertainty is just as hard. And you can come up with a plan but it might have to be junked if the virus has other ideas. Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield joined the call for clarity and told the BBC: ""Children are more withdrawn, they are really suffering in terms of isolation, their confidence levels are falling, and for some there are serious issues."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government wanted to ""see all children back at the very earliest moment"". Schools in England have been closed to most pupils since the national lockdown began on 5 January due to high levels of Covid transmission in the community. There have been calls for teachers to be vaccinated sooner, although it is not clear if that would allow schools to reopen earlier. The majority of pupils in England are learning from home with schools only open to the children of key workers, vulnerable children and those who cannot learn at home Covid death rates among educational professionals are not ""statistically significantly different"" to those in the general population, according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, but secondary school teachers appeared to have an elevated risk compared particularly with people working in office-type jobs. Among secondary school teachers Covid death rates were 39.2 deaths per 100,000 males, compared with 31.4 for all males aged 20 to 64, and 21.2 per 100,000 females, compared with 16.8, but the ONS said these were ""not statistically significantly different than those of the same age and sex in the wider population"". Schools will remain closed inNorthern Ireland, Scotland and Walesuntil at least the February half-term - with the Welsh first minister saying it is""unlikely"" all pupils will return after the break. Gemma Cocker with her children Charlie and Lyla Gemma Cocker from Brighton is one of the many parents struggling to balance childcare, home learning and work. She says she's having to share her work laptop with her son, who has already missed learning time after the family moved home and did not have internet access. ""We didn't have any internet. The school said they had reached their limit so couldn't take him,"" she says. And because her children are young, she says: ""They're never just going to watch a classroom by themselves, you have to be with them the whole time."" Kitty Jones, 11, is in her last year of primary school and she says home learning is ""tricky"" because she is not used to using different remote platforms like Google Classroom and she wants to return ""as soon as possible"". ""I still think that I'm learning a bit, but I don't think I'm learning as much as I would be in person,"" she tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. Holly Agbukor, 18, is studying for her A-levels, says it is ""quite stressful"" learning at home, as it is a ""different environment, so it is not as easy to be fully present in the lessons"". But, she says, while is it ""difficult"" working at home, ""I don't think it is worth the cost of reintroducing the virus into society and making things worse overall"".
