IMF warns of 'darkening' global economic outlook,"The head of the International Monetary Fund has said it will downgrade its expectations for global economic growth this month. Its most recent forecast, issued in April, was for3.6% growth this yearand next. Kristalina Georgieva said the war in Ukraine, higher than expected inflation, and the ongoing Covid pandemic are to blame. These are making the cost of living crisis worse for millions, she said. And the poorest are suffering the most, she added. It comes as inflation in the US - world's biggest economy -reached 9.1%, the highest in more than 40 years. US prices rising at fastest rate for 40 years Ukraine war: Germany fears Russia gas cut may become permanent Ukraine war to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years' Her warning that the global economic outlook ""has darkened significantly"" comes as G20 finance ministers and central bank governors prepare to meet in Bali. Their agenda is full of issues that are troubling the global economy, including rising commodity prices,food security,and the impact of the war in Ukraine given it was a major food exporter. Indonesia's central bank governor Perry Warjiyo is cautious about the prospect of reaching an agreement over the way forward, saying: ""We hope for the best, but of course prepare for the worst"". Ms Georgievasaid in a blog post,externalthat inflation has ""broadened beyond food and energy prices"" in that has led many central banks to increase the cost of borrowing, something she said will ""need to continue"". Ukraine was a major food exporter but the war means it has struggled to export its crops, pushing global prices up Canada became the latest major central bank to increase interest rates, raising its main rate from 1.5% to 2.5% as it tries to tackle inflation that has risen to 7.7%. The bank's governor Tiff Macklem said the higher than expected increase, the biggest in 24 years, ""reflects concern that inflation is too high and it's affecting all Canadians"". The US Federal Reserve is increasingly seen as likely to make a similarly big increase when it meets later this month. It's already madethree increases this year. Higher interest rates are typically used to reduce inflation because they mean companies and individuals need to use more cash to repay loans, rather than spending it on goods and services. Rising energy prices are fuelling inflation worldwide, but the Bank of Canada expects them to fall later this year The IMF says 75 central banks have raised interest rates in the last year, on average, 3.8 times. But if that pattern doesn't continue Ms Georgieva anticipates ""even more harm to growth and employment"", adding: ""Acting now will hurt less than acting later."" There is also a warning that countries which have pumped in billions of dollars to support their economies through the pandemic need to reduce that to dampen the demand for goods and services that is being fuelled by that money. However, cash handouts ""to support vulnerable households"", are still needed, especially those who are suffering most from high energy or food prices, she said. Ms Georgieva said this spending must be funded by cuts elsewhere or new sources of income, other than debt. In the longer term, policies that tackle the global shortage of labour, especially those that encourage more women to work, will help too, she adds. US makes biggest interest rate rise since 1994 UK interest rates hit highest level for 13 years Where are Britain's missing million workers? Economic problems have contributed to widespread protests in Sri Lanka, and the IMF is warning of instability elsewhere With preparations underway for this weekend's G20 meeting, Ms Georgieva says that better global cooperation is needed because ""risks of social instability are rising"" thanks to concerns over food and energy supplies. Such concerns have contributed to thewidespread protests in Sri Lanka, which is suffering it's worst economic crisis since independence more than 70 years ago. The head of the IMF said immediate actions that can be taken include the ending of restrictions on food exports that many countries have imposed since the war in Ukraine started. She also called for the world's richest countries to use the meeting as a chance to help ""provide urgent support"" to those most in need.

Met Police officers charged with common assault,"The pair are set to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court Two Metropolitan Police officers have been charged with common assault by beating after they stopped a man in north-west London. The man was allegedly stopped with excessive force on Wykeham Road, Hendon, on 28 December. Sgt Emily Joshi and PC Ozan Yelken are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday. The Met said the pair had been placed on restricted duties, which would be reviewed. In May, the Met Police received a complaint alleging excessive force had been used and, the following month, the police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), passed a file of evidence to prosecutors who authorised the charges. The Met's Directorate of Professional Standards is aware and misconduct matters ""will be considered"" once criminal proceedings have finished, the Met said. Ch Spt Sara Leach said: ""I know that this charge will, of course, be concerning. We have fully supported the IOPC with their investigation. ""As criminal proceedings are now active, I am unable to provide any more comment as it is really important that we do not undermine or interfere with this case.""

Former Studio 54 owner Fleischman dies at Dignitas,"Actress Raquel Welch, original Studio 54 co-owner Steve Rubell and Mark Fleischman at the club in 1981 Mark Fleischman, who owned legendary New York nightclub Studio 54 in the 1980s, has died by assisted suicide in Switzerland, his former business partner has said. Mr Fleischman, 82, took over the club in 1980 and ran it until 1986. He first became ill in 2016 and was left unable to walk or do many things for himself, but said doctors had not been able to diagnose his condition. He took his life at the Dignitas clinic near Zurich on Wednesday. Daniel Fitzgerald, who co-owned the Century Club in Los Angeles with Mr Fleischman in the 1990s and 2000s, told BBC News: ""I guess he was in more pain than we knew."" Mark Fleischman described Studio 54 as ""an exclusive world where anything could happen"" Mr Fitzgerald organised a ""living wake"",externalfor Mr Fleischman last week and had hoped he would postpone the visit to Switzerland. ""I thought maybe we could convince him not to [go],"" he said. ""We had a really nice party for him and a lot of his friends came, and everyone thought, 'he's going to postpone it a month and we'll see what we can do'. But he was set on doing it."" Assisted dying is legal in Switzerland, and the Dignitas clinic has been open since 2002. Last month,Mr Fleischman told the New York Post,externalhe had trouble speaking, could not dress himself or put on his own shoes, and his wife Mimi had to help him in and out of bed. ""I am taking a gentle way out,"" he said. ""It is the easiest way out for me."" Mark Fleischman (left) with actor Tony Curtis in 1983 Studio 54 opened in 1977 and soon became the hottest venue in the US, with celebrities like Andy Warhol, Bianca Jagger, Liza Minnelli and Elizabeth Taylor flocking to its famous dancefloor. But it closed in 1980 when its two original co-owners were jailed for tax evasion. Mr Fleischman took over and later recounted his time in charge in a book titled Inside Studio 54. ""From the very first night we opened, in 1981, I was swept up in a world of celebrities, drugs, power and sex,"" he wrote. Mark Fleischman with wife Mimi and his book about his time running Studio 54 in 2017 ""Every night, celebrities and stunning women made their way through the crowd, up the stairs to my office to sip champagne and share lines of cocaine using my golden straw or rolled-up $100 bills."" He added: ""I was the guy in control, the owner - the host of the party. It was my duty, my job, to make sure everyone had a good time. It was a responsibility, a heady feeling, one that I gave myself over to wholeheartedly. It was an exclusive world where anything could happen."" Mr Fitzgerald added that while they ran the Century Club, he and Mr Fleischman ""worked really well together for a long time and had a lot of fun together"". ""He would be able to have fun but be really smart at the same time, and be really intelligent about figuring things out. He taught me a lot. He was a great mentor for me.""

I am backing Sunak in Tory leadership race - Hunt,"This video can not be played Watch: 'I'm backing Rishi Sunak' - Jeremy Hunt Ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has given his backing to former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the race to be Conservative leader and prime minister. Mr Hunt was eliminated from the contest after failing to get enough votes, along with Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hunt said Mr Sunak was ""one of the most decent people"" he had met in British politics. Reflecting on his own defeat, Mr Hunt said: ""Politics is about momentum, I'm afraid I didn't have it this time."" In the last Conservative leadership election in 2019, Mr Hunt came second to Boris Johnson. In an interview with BBC political editor Chris Mason, the one-time leadership hopeful said it was a ""privilege"" to run to be prime minister but added: ""You only get one chance to do that, my chance was really in 2019 - politics moves on."" Sunak wins first round of Tory leadership vote Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? He said the current race had produced an ""excellent list of candidates"" which proved that the Conservative Party was ""modern and outward-looking"". ""In a period when we need to rebuild trust with the electorate that shows we are in tune with modern Britain."" Asked why he was supporting Mr Sunak, he said he believed the former chancellor was someone of ""formidable ability who has been thinking about the right thing to do for our economy, for families up and down the country, very hard over the last two years"". He also described Mr Sunak as ""one of the most decent, straight people with the highest standard of integrity that I have ever met in British politics"". ""That is why I would be proud to have him as my next prime minister."" Mr Sunak - whose resignation as chancellor last week helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson - won the first round of voting among Conservative MPs. However, he has faced criticism from some of his former cabinet colleagues including Jacob Rees Mogg who told Sky News Mr Sunak had been responsible for ""endless tax rises... which I think have been economically damaging"". Mr Sunak got 88 votes in the first vote, while Trade minister Penny Mordaunt came second with 67 and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was third on 50. They will face further votes in the next few days along with the remaining candidates Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman. The final two will then go to a ballot of Conservative Party members, and a result is expected on 5 September.

Sri Lankan PM tells military to restore order,"Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go. Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem. On Wednesday, for the second time in less than a week, protesters broke into a highly secure state building. This time it was the prime minister's office. Echoing earlier scenes over the weekend of the occupied president's official residence, people in the prime minister's office lounged on plush sofas snapping photos, while others stood on chairs and desks waving the Sri Lankan flag. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office In a television address, Mr Wickremesinghe called on protesters to leave his occupied office and other state buildings and co-operate with authorities. ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But asked whether the prime minister's statement was an indication that the army might take control, a human rights lawyer in Colombo, Bhavani Fonseka, told the BBC's World at One that Sri Lanka ""doesn't have a history where military has played an active role in politics or government - unlike some of the other countries in the neighbourhood"". ""We have had a very robust democracy and it's been elected representatives in that role. But we are also in an unprecedented situation, so anything is possible,"" she added. Outside the president's office, the BBC's Tessa Wong said armed soldiers stood by impassively watching the protesters celebrate inside the office. And demonstrators ignored the prime minister's calls for the office to be emptied. ""Our goal is for Gota to go home. And Ranil and other cabinet members to go home,"" one protester at the prime minister's office, Nixon Chandranathan, told the BBC. ""We need truthful and honest leaders to build up Sri Lanka now."" How war heroes became villains ""We feel proud,"" Satish Bee, a businessman who came to explore the compound after it was stormed told AFP. ""There's no proper governance in this country. It has never been good... The youngsters, they don't want to continue like this."" The continued unrest came as the news arrived that President Rajapaksa had fled to the Maldives. The president went into hiding and pledged to resignafter his official residence was stormed on Saturday. The leader, who has enjoyed immunity from prosecution as president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. He is, however, yet to submit a formal letter of resignation. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Picking a new leader will also have its difficulties. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded In a press statement on Wednesday Mr Wickremesinghe's team said he had asked the speaker of parliament to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Earlier on Monday, the main opposition leaderSajith Premadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he - like Mr Wickremesinghe - lacks public support. There is also deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership. The six-time Sri Lankan PM who became president A dramatic day and moment of danger for Sri Lanka Sri Lanka opposition chief wants to replace Rajapaksa Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?

"3,000-year-old house found in archaeological dig","The clay pot found by the CAER could be about 3,000 years old An archaeological dig has uncovered what could be the earliest house found in Cardiff. Volunteers and archaeologists from the Caerau and Ely Rediscovering (CAER) Heritage Project, found a clay pot which could be about 3,000 years old. The group were looking for the missing link between the late Iron Age and the early Roman period. Co-director of the project Dr David Wyatt said what they found was ""much more remarkable."" The archaeologists said the roundhouse, located near Cardiff West Community High School, could provide the earliest clues on the origins of Cardiff. Over 300 people have taken part in the dig, at Trelai Park, about half a mile away from the Caerau Hillfort, a heritage site of national significance. Archaeologists and community members had previously discovered finds of Neolithic, Iron Age, Roman and medieval origins at the hillfort. Bronze Age axes and spears declared treasure Race against sea to unearth hillfort history Curious discoveries in Wales Experts believed the settlement dubbed ""Trelai Enclosure"" could provide the missing link between the late Iron Age and early Roman period, showing what happened to people once they had moved on from the hillfort. The pot was found and recovered by archaeologist Tom Hicks and volunteer Charlie Adams But, the roundhouse predates it, a clay pot discovered at the site has given the team a firmer indication of the time period the building can be traced to. Dr Wyatt added that they believed the roundhouse could have been constructed in the mid to late Bronze Age, going back to between 1500 and 1100 BC. ""The enclosure definitely predates the hillfort, people were living here before the hillfort was built. ""It's an incredible development and sheds light on the earliest inhabitants of Cardiff,"" he added. Project co-director Dr Oliver Davis said: ""What we've found is completely unexpected and even more exciting. ""This enclosure could be providing us with the earliest clues on the origins of Cardiff, the pot that's been found is beautifully decorated and preserved - it is extremely rare to find pottery of this quality. ""It's also unusual to find a Bronze Age settlement in Wales - there are only one or two other Bronze Age sites in this country."" It is hoped the 'remarkable discovery' will help archaeologists learn more about people living at the site Nearly 300 volunteers have participated in the dig so far, run by CAER, a partnership between Cardiff University, Action in Caerau and Ely (ACE), local schools, residents and heritage partners. Archaeologist Tom Hicks and volunteers Charlie Adams both found and recovered the pot during the dig. Mr Hicks said: This is a very well-preserved example of Bronze Age pottery, and a significant find for the archaeological record in the region. ""It's a great opportunity for us to learn more about the lives of the people living on the sire around 3,000 years ago."" He added that further scientific analysis may be able to tell what the pot was used for before it ended up in the enclosure ditch, and how or where the pot was made. Headteacher at Cardiff West Community High School, Martin Hullard said: ""We're delighted to be involved in this exciting archaeological project, our students have loved learning about the history that's just a stone's throw away from their school.""

Hanging effigies on bonfire condemned,"Effigies of Michelle O'Neill and Naomi Long were among those hung from a bonfire in Carrickfergus Effigies of female politicians on a County Antrim bonfire have been condemned as ""sheer vileness"" by Justice Minister Naomi Long. An effigy of her was among those hanging from the bonfire, along with representations of Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald. Bonfires are lit in some unionist areas on 11 July each year as part of Battle of the Boyne commemorations. Police said they were aware of images of the incident and were investigating. Alliance Party leader Mrs Long said pictures of the Glenfield bonfire in Carrickfergus had been shared with her. ""It made me sad and depressed that there are people in our community that harbour such vile hatred of anyone else,"" she told BBC News NI. ""What shocked me even more was the fact that among the photographs there were those of children at a fun day happening right beside where these effigies were hanging basically suspended by the neck."" The justice minister described it as unnerving and disturbing, adding: ""You wouldn't be human if it didn't affect you."" ""You think you are hardened to it after so many years but there is always a way to make it even worse,"" she said. ""It is hard to describe that feeling of sheer vileness and hatred that just radiates off something like that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She said the effigies demonstrated ""pure unadulterated sectarian bigotry"" and authorities needed to tackle those behind the displays. Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Gerry Kelly said that the presence of effigies on bonfires was ""wrong, deeply offensive"" and a ""hate crime"". Ms McDonald is leader of his party and Ms O'Neill is the deputy leader. ""There is an onus on unionist political and community leaders to stand up against these displays of sectarian hatred and make it clear there is no place for them in this society,"" he said. Mr Kelly said his party had reported a number of bonfire-related hate crimes to the police. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Democratic Unionist Party leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said while most of the events were ""hugely successful"", the other displays must be ""outrightly condemned as wrong"". ""Throughout my lifetime I have had the privilegeÂ to celebrate and educate others about my identity all over the world,"" he said. ""At no point has burning posters, flags or pictures of serving politicians featured as part of that."" Why are bonfires lit in Northern Ireland? Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said the effigies were utterly vile and did not represent the union and unionist culture he believed in. Following the Eleventh Night, police had already confirmed they were investigating reports of flags and emblems being placed on some bonfires. Thousands of people in unionist areas in Northern Ireland commemorate the anniversary of the battle every summer with bonfires on 11 July and parades on 12 July. The events celebrate the 1690 victory of the Protestant William of Orange - also known as King Billy - over his Catholic father-in-law, King James II. The Eleventh Night bonfire tradition commemorates the preparations for the battle, when large fires were lit to welcome William of Orange and guide him along on his journey.

What Tory candidates think about Northern Ireland,"Many Conservatives want to see changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol Boris Johnson promised to ""Get Brexit Done"" but his successor will inherit a bogged-down dispute about special arrangements that were agreed for Northern Ireland. His government recently introduced a bill in the House of Commons which could override parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - and make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. If passed, the bill would not only affect the UK's relationship with the EU, but also rules for businesses in Northern Ireland and the future of Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont. It collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) walked out in protest against the protocol, pledging not to return unless its concerns were addressed. And there are some other Northern Ireland-related issues which contenders have taken positions on. So where do the candidates stand? TheNorthern Ireland Protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means new checks and controls on commercial goods which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. It is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties, who say it undermines their place in the UK. Other parties - including Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - say the protocol is a necessary compromise to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. The treaty was signed by Boris Johnson in January 2020, as part the Withdrawal Agreement. The EU has put forward its own proposals to ease checks, but negotiations between Brussels and London on how to fix problems with the treaty have stalled. Brussels views the protocol bill as a clear breach of international law and has urged the UK to ""step back"" from its approach. Senior EU figures have warned that Britain risks damaging trust as well as its reputation abroad. The European Commission has launched legal action over Britain's alleged failure to implement parts of the treaty and the BBC understands further so-called infringement proceedings could follow. If the bill becomes law and ministers do start changing parts of the treaty, the EU's suggested it could also impose trade sanctions. This is why you might have heard warnings of a possible trade war. UK access to the EU's Horizon research programme has also been described as collateral damage in the dispute. There is currently a block on the UK re-joining the Â£81.2bn funding scheme. In May, Mr Sunak told Bloomberg that the way the protocol was operating was posing enormous challenges to ""the stability of the situation"" in Northern Ireland. He said it had become a barrier to re-establishing power sharing at Stormont. Mr Sunak said the government's preference was a negotiated settlement and added that he wanted to ensure Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom was secure. At the end of 2021, the Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Sunak urged Boris Johnson and his former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost not to ""blow up "" talks with the EU about the protocol. The paper said Mr Sunak raised concerns over the potential impact this would have had on the economy and that he did not have the same sense of ""urgency"" as others in cabinet about dealing with the protocol. At the time the Treasury declined to comment. He did not vote on the protocol bill at second reading. Mr Sunak's bid to become leader has been supported by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Shailesh Vara. How will the new Tory leader and PM be chosen? In Brussels, many view Boris Johnson as the blustering Brexit poster boy who tried to backtrack on a deal for Northern Ireland that he himself had signed. So while they aren't shedding a tear about his downfall, they're also wary of who might come next. No candidate has disowned the bill that could allow the UK to override parts of the protocol. Indeed one of the contenders, Liz Truss, was responsible for drafting it while another, Suella Braverman (who has since been eliminated) wants to toughen it up. With Jeremy Hunt and Tom Tugendhat also out of the race, diplomats here may hope that someone Penny Mordaunt or Rishi Sunak would take, as they'd see it, a more pragmatic approach. But even though there are candidates who likely wouldn't have chosen the current prime minister's approach, now the bill's in motion, no one appears prepared to stop it. The difference between contenders, in the end, may be between those who really are prepared to risk a so-called trade war with the EU versus those who aren't. But that's a test that won't come for months at least, if at all. For now, the contenders are broadly holding the line set by Mr Johnson. A key watch will be whether anyone in the race signals a desire to give negotiations another push. However don't expect anyone to volunteer the idea that they're open to making concessions to Brussels. A wider question is whether a new prime minister can reset strained relations with the EU. But again, in this contest, that doesn't appear to be a fashionable cause. Ms Truss is the only candidate so far to have mentioned the protocol in the public speech for her leadership bid. As foreign secretary, she was responsible for introducing the bill to scrap parts of the protocol. In her leadership pitch she said: ""In the face of EU intransigence I developed the Northern Ireland Protocol bill. ""It breaks the deadlock in a legal way, upholding the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and preventing the tearing apart of our precious union."" Speaking in the House of Commons when the bill was first debated, she told MPs that due to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". Ina letter to the Financial Times in June,external, Ms Truss said the protocol was undermining the Good Friday Agreement, had created practical problems and ""a growing sense that the rights and aspirations of some parts of the community are being undermined"". She said new legislation was necessary because ""all other options within the current EU mandate are currently exhausted"". What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Euro falls below dollar for first time in 20 years,"The euro has fallen below the dollar for the first time in nearly 20 years as the war in Ukraine pushes the single currency down. A single euro bought $0.998 on the foreign exchange market at 12:45 GMT, down by 0.4% in the day's trading. Fears that Russia may restrict Europe's supplies of energy have increased the chances of recession in the euro area. The European Central Bank has lagged other central banks in raising rates, further weakening the euro. Currencies tend to rise when the relevant central bank increases interest rates, as international investors eye a larger return for holding assets priced in that currency. The dollar has also been strong in recent months, buoyed by the US central bank raising interest rates, and investors seeking the safe haven of dollar assets in times of global turmoil. Eurozone plans first interest rate rise in 11 years Weak pound puts the squeeze on holiday spending A weakening currency will make imports more expensive for eurozone countries, especially goods priced in dollars such as crude oil. That could contribute to even higher inflation in the eurozone, which is already running at 8.6% for June. A spokesperson for the ECB said it does not ""target a particular exchange rate. However we are always attentive to the impact of the exchange rate on inflation, in line with our mandate for price stability."" The bank is expected to start increasing interest rates next week. The euro has fallen almost 12% against the dollar since the start of the year. The single currency has been worth more than the dollar for most of its history. It lagged below the dollar in the years following the currency's launch in 1999, but the last time it traded below the dollar was December 2002 - less than a year after euro notes and coins were introduced for the first time.

"I am backing Sunak in Tory leadership race - HuntThe former health secretary says Rishi Sunak is ""one of the most decent people"" in British politics.UK Politics","This video can not be played Watch: 'I'm backing Rishi Sunak' - Jeremy Hunt Ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has given his backing to former Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the race to be Conservative leader and prime minister. Mr Hunt was eliminated from the contest after failing to get enough votes, along with Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hunt said Mr Sunak was ""one of the most decent people"" he had met in British politics. Reflecting on his own defeat, Mr Hunt said: ""Politics is about momentum, I'm afraid I didn't have it this time."" In the last Conservative leadership election in 2019, Mr Hunt came second to Boris Johnson. In an interview with BBC political editor Chris Mason, the one-time leadership hopeful said it was a ""privilege"" to run to be prime minister but added: ""You only get one chance to do that, my chance was really in 2019 - politics moves on."" Sunak wins first round of Tory leadership vote Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? He said the current race had produced an ""excellent list of candidates"" which proved that the Conservative Party was ""modern and outward-looking"". ""In a period when we need to rebuild trust with the electorate that shows we are in tune with modern Britain."" Asked why he was supporting Mr Sunak, he said he believed the former chancellor was someone of ""formidable ability who has been thinking about the right thing to do for our economy, for families up and down the country, very hard over the last two years"". He also described Mr Sunak as ""one of the most decent, straight people with the highest standard of integrity that I have ever met in British politics"". ""That is why I would be proud to have him as my next prime minister."" Mr Sunak - whose resignation as chancellor last week helped trigger the downfall of Mr Johnson - won the first round of voting among Conservative MPs. However, he has faced criticism from some of his former cabinet colleagues including Jacob Rees Mogg who told Sky News Mr Sunak had been responsible for ""endless tax rises... which I think have been economically damaging"". Mr Sunak got 88 votes in the first vote, while Trade minister Penny Mordaunt came second with 67 and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was third on 50. They will face further votes in the next few days along with the remaining candidates Kemi Badenoch, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman. The final two will then go to a ballot of Conservative Party members, and a result is expected on 5 September.

Sri Lankan PM tells military to restore orderThousands of protesters stormed Prime Minister and Acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe's office.Asia,"Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go. Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem. On Wednesday, for the second time in less than a week, protesters broke into a highly secure state building. This time it was the prime minister's office. Echoing earlier scenes over the weekend of the occupied president's official residence, people in the prime minister's office lounged on plush sofas snapping photos, while others stood on chairs and desks waving the Sri Lankan flag. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office In a television address, Mr Wickremesinghe called on protesters to leave his occupied office and other state buildings and co-operate with authorities. ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But asked whether the prime minister's statement was an indication that the army might take control, a human rights lawyer in Colombo, Bhavani Fonseka, told the BBC's World at One that Sri Lanka ""doesn't have a history where military has played an active role in politics or government - unlike some of the other countries in the neighbourhood"". ""We have had a very robust democracy and it's been elected representatives in that role. But we are also in an unprecedented situation, so anything is possible,"" she added. Outside the president's office, the BBC's Tessa Wong said armed soldiers stood by impassively watching the protesters celebrate inside the office. And demonstrators ignored the prime minister's calls for the office to be emptied. ""Our goal is for Gota to go home. And Ranil and other cabinet members to go home,"" one protester at the prime minister's office, Nixon Chandranathan, told the BBC. ""We need truthful and honest leaders to build up Sri Lanka now."" How war heroes became villains ""We feel proud,"" Satish Bee, a businessman who came to explore the compound after it was stormed told AFP. ""There's no proper governance in this country. It has never been good... The youngsters, they don't want to continue like this."" The continued unrest came as the news arrived that President Rajapaksa had fled to the Maldives. The president went into hiding and pledged to resignafter his official residence was stormed on Saturday. The leader, who has enjoyed immunity from prosecution as president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. He is, however, yet to submit a formal letter of resignation. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Picking a new leader will also have its difficulties. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded In a press statement on Wednesday Mr Wickremesinghe's team said he had asked the speaker of parliament to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Earlier on Monday, the main opposition leaderSajith Premadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he - like Mr Wickremesinghe - lacks public support. There is also deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership.

A dramatic day and moment of danger for Sri Lanka,"The protesters' anger melted away as they entered the PM's compound The day started with a hurried departure and the promise of a resignation. Sri Lankans woke to the news that overnight President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the man whose family had ruled the island with an iron fist for most of the last two decades, had fled the country having promised to leave his job. His rule has given rise to mass protests, as people struggle with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines. At Galle Face Green in the capital Colombo, one of the main centres of the protests, hundreds roamed the streets and listened to fiery speeches from fellow citizens railing against the government and leaders who had steered the country into its worst economic crisis in decades. Some were happy to see the back of Mr Rajapaksa. But for others like protester GP Nimal, his departure was nothing short of thwarted justice. ""We don't like it. We want to keep him. We want our money back! And we want to put all the Rajapaksas in an open prison where they can do farm work,"" he said. As the day wore on, the crowds swelled at Galle Face Green, which took on a festive atmosphere. Then, the mood changed. Word spread that something was happening at the prime minister's office at Flower Road. The unrest there came as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed acting president by the departing Mr Rajapaksa, and declared a state of emergency and regional curfew in the western region which includes the capital. Mr Wickremesinghe has also faced growing popular anger for his role in the crisis, and protesters are calling for him to resign as well. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound.  Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke.  Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. The next hour saw more volleys of tear gas, each round more intense than the last. Soldiers arrived at one end of the avenue and began shooting their canisters high above the crowd. Arcs of smoke streaked across the blue sky, as the canisters transformed into dangerous projectiles. A man fell to the ground, clutching his shoulder after it was hit by flying debris. Each time the choking and sputtering crowd stumbled back through the burning fog of tear gas. But each time they would return, determined. ""Whatever happens, we will keep moving forward,"" they chanted in Sinhalese. Another chant referred to the tear gas: ""They are splitting us apart, but keep moving forward."" Residents from neighbouring compounds brought out hoses and sprayed protesters down. Trucks drove past with people tossing bottles of water to the crowd. Protesters washed each other's faces, passed water around, and even offered bottles to soldiers standing guard at the walls. Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' At the gates, protesters still tried to push through. Then - a breakthrough. The wall of soldiers was either overcome or had pulled back. A path was cleared, and a mighty river of protesters poured in, screaming ""Aragalaya"" (Struggle), the name of their organic protest movement. In that instant, their anger melted away, transformed into joy and disbelief. The occupation of the PM's office was a rare victory for the protesters Screaming and chanting, the jubilant protesters overran the manicured lawn of the prime minister's office, swarming into the stately white building. Protesters hung out of every window and climbed out onto the second floor balcony. Above the sign ""Prime Minister's Office"", they held aloft the Sri Lankan flag and lit a flare, chanting ""Ranil lunatic, Gota lunatic"", delirious with glee. Inside the building, a set of meeting rooms whose walls bore pictures of various international dignitaries who had visited, including the Queen and Prince Charles, were filled with singing protesters clambering onto desks and chairs. Under the warm glow of a large ornate glass chandelier, they sang: ""That's what we said, don't mess with us."" Just outside the doors, a group of armed soldiers watched impassively, as people around them lounged on sofas and snapped selfies. As hundreds of people tried to press in, protesters began setting up their own crowd control measures, holding back people at the doors. Groups were brought in at intervals to gawk at the rooms and take pictures. On the lawn outside, people lay down on the soft grass and trampled through flowerbeds. Someone brought out drums and banged out a rhythm, as people swirled and danced around them. ""I'm feeling great today,"" said protester Nixon Chandranathan as he surveyed the crowd. ""But we are still fighting, still struggling. Our goal is for Gota to go home. And Ranil and other cabinet members to go home. We need truthful and honest leaders to build up Sri Lanka now."" But after months of hopelessness, food and fuel shortages, and excruciating economic pain, the taking of the prime minister's office was a rare victory they could truly savour. The people had won, if at least just for a little while. But it's a moment of danger too for Sri Lanka, and no one knows what will happen next. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population.

'Protests have changed thinking for the better',"Dinithika and her father at Saturday's protests in Colombo Saturday's historic protests in Sri Lanka,which appear to have persuaded both the president and the prime minister to resign, were a ""huge show of willpower by the public"", demonstrator Catherine Mack told BBC News. ""We just want change, for the better - it's not violence,"" says the mother-of-two from the capital, Colombo. ""Having lots of people protest and come out on to the road and demand change - it's really wonderful. It has changed thinking for the better. I hope it will last."" University lecturer Dinithika Appuhamy, 27, who also turned out for the protests in Colombo, says the unity shown by the Sri Lankan people and what they have achieved are cause for celebration, though she cautions that the leaders' resignations are not yet official. Both women are keenly aware of the country's dire economic situation and are hoping that new leadership will restore the country's fortunes. Dinithika can afford the essentials for living, like food and medicine, but she says she knows a ""lot of people who can't"". Many people in Sri Lanka do not have refrigerators, she says, so they drink powdered milk instead of fresh. Supplies have now run out, meaning many babies and children do not have milk to drink. Whilst essentials are still in the supermarket, the powdered milk shelf is empty Some people are living on one meal a day or attempting to grow their own food, she says, but ""if you live in an urban area, you can't magically just grow food in a few months' time"". Fertiliser is now so expensive, she says, that it can usually only be found on the black market. Medical supplies are also running short. Dinithika's father is a cancer patient and recently had his thyroid removed. He relies on daily medication for survival. ""We've stocked up on medicine for six months but beyond that we don't know what to do,"" she says. ""My sister lives in the US, so I hope that she can send medicine to us. But not everyone in Sri Lanka has a daughter in the US."" The lecturer herself has felt the impact of the crisis. She returned to live with her parents in Marawila, 70km (43 miles) from Colombo, a few months ago after power shortages left her little choice. In the relatively rural area where she lives now, internet connections are unstable, making recent government guidance to teach from home difficult. ""It's basically impossible to go in,"" she explains. ""Roads are blocked due to the fuel queues. My internet connection isn't great. Some of my students live in even more rural areas than I do. So it's almost pointless sometimes. An empty petrol station in Dinithika's area, now that fuel supplies have run dry ""Even if we could go into university, there's no power sometimes. I work in an engineering facility. Without electricity you can't do practicals."" When asked about what her future holds, Dinithika fights back tears. ""I had huge prospects for my future,"" she says. ""It's just all sort of gone down the drain. It's come to a point where surviving is the number one priority."" Leisha, a working mother-of-three from Colombo who did not want to give her surname, protests against the government three to four times a week, and describes how fuel queues have now reached their protest site - 3km from the petrol pumps. ""Now the rest of the world is getting back to life as normal and we're stuck with all of this,"" she says, accusing the country's leaders of mismanagement and incompetence. Leisha protesting at Gotagogama on April 13 Wary of politicians who only say ""something to keep you happy for a couple of weeks"", she fears Sri Lanka will come to a standstill soon. Catherine is one of the luckier Sri Lankans who have food, access to private healthcare and a big garden. For ""middle income"" families like hers, the crisis has meant ""inconvenience rather than actual hardship"". Saroja, Catherine's cleaner and neighbour, has no choice but to cook on an open flame in her flat because of fuel shortages But some of the women who join her at the daily protests earn a maximum of 1,500 Sri Lankan rupees (Â£3.40, $4.10) per day which ""they need to stretch to make ends meet"". With bread now at an unaffordable Rs 170, the women and their families have rice for all three meals, with a small serving of vegetable and coconut sambol and sometimes soya meat. Eggs, which cost Rs 50 each now, are rarely on the menu. Many families are forced to cook on open flame in small enclosed spaces, putting themselves and their families in danger. Catherine hopes that a new multi-party government will be formed and Sri Lanka will regain the trust of the international community, leading to aid donations. ""So we can start to get out of this mess,"" she says. ""This is the hope and why we are all protesting."" ""The last few days have got to a breaking point,"" says Dinithika. ""People don't care any more. Why bother working when everything has gone to hell?"" She says she hopes the rest of the world will understand ""how much the Sri Lankan people want the government to go"".

Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office.

A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory. Welcome - here is a recap of the dayâs events in Sri Lanka, where it's approaching 18:00. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sri Lankan PM tells military to restore orderThousands of protesters stormed Prime Minister and Acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe's office.,"Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office on Wednesday. Mr Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has fled the country. But the decision to leave him in charge triggered further protests demanding that the prime minister must also go. Sri Lanka has been suffering from its worst economic crisis in decades. Many blame the Rajapaksa administration for the crisis and see Mr Wickremesinghe, who became prime minister in May, as part of the problem. On Wednesday, for the second time in less than a week, protesters broke into a highly secure state building. This time it was the prime minister's office. Echoing earlier scenes over the weekend of the occupied president's official residence, people in the prime minister's office lounged on plush sofas snapping photos, while others stood on chairs and desks waving the Sri Lankan flag. This video can not be played Watch: Police fire tear gas at Sri Lanka protesters as they storm PM's office In a television address, Mr Wickremesinghe called on protesters to leave his occupied office and other state buildings and co-operate with authorities. ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But asked whether the prime minister's statement was an indication that the army might take control, a human rights lawyer in Colombo, Bhavani Fonseka, told the BBC's World at One that Sri Lanka ""doesn't have a history where military has played an active role in politics or government - unlike some of the other countries in the neighbourhood"". ""We have had a very robust democracy and it's been elected representatives in that role. But we are also in an unprecedented situation, so anything is possible,"" she added. Outside the president's office, the BBC's Tessa Wong said armed soldiers stood by impassively watching the protesters celebrate inside the office. And demonstrators ignored the prime minister's calls for the office to be emptied. ""Our goal is for Gota to go home. And Ranil and other cabinet members to go home,"" one protester at the prime minister's office, Nixon Chandranathan, told the BBC. ""We need truthful and honest leaders to build up Sri Lanka now."" How war heroes became villains ""We feel proud,"" Satish Bee, a businessman who came to explore the compound after it was stormed told AFP. ""There's no proper governance in this country. It has never been good... The youngsters, they don't want to continue like this."" The continued unrest came as the news arrived that President Rajapaksa had fled to the Maldives. The president went into hiding and pledged to resignafter his official residence was stormed on Saturday. The leader, who has enjoyed immunity from prosecution as president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. He is, however, yet to submit a formal letter of resignation. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Picking a new leader will also have its difficulties. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded In a press statement on Wednesday Mr Wickremesinghe's team said he had asked the speaker of parliament to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Earlier on Monday, the main opposition leaderSajith Premadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he - like Mr Wickremesinghe - lacks public support. There is also deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership.

School shooting families express anger at leaked video,"A Texas state senate panel had planned to first show the footage to bereaved families later this week The families of those killed in a mass shooting at a Texas school have expressed anger and outrage after new video was leaked showing the attack. The 82 minutes of CCTV footage from Uvalde, published by a local newspaper, shows the gunman's arrival and police waiting 77 minutes to confront him. But it was published days before officials said they had planned to show the families or release it publicly. The leak of the footage, as well as what it shows, reignited public anger. ""Whoever leaked that video... I pray that you never have to deal with what all the parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles are dealing with. Shame on you,"" one family member said at a press conference in Washington DC. Gloria Cazares, whose daughter was among the 19 children and two teachers killed in the shooting, urged people not to share the video. ""This is the opposite of what the families wanted,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""Our hearts are shattered all over again!"" But other relatives expressed support at the release. ""I am happy it is released. But I wish they would have waited until the family members got to see it beforehand,"" Jesse Rizo, who lost a family member in the shooting, told local CBS affiliate Kens5. The Austin American-Statesman newspaper defended its decision,externalto publish the footage in an editorial late on Tuesday. ""Transparency and unrelenting reporting is a way to bring change,"" it read. ""Our goal is to continue to bring to light what happened at Robb Elementary, which the families and friends of the Uvalde victims have long been asking for."" The teachers who died trying to save their pupils The 'sweet and lovable' children who died in Uvalde The video, which confirms many of the details already given by Texas officials, begins from the moment the gunman crashes his vehicle near the campus. He fires shots at passers-by outside before entering the school building and strolling unimpeded through the corridors. It then shows a pupil returning to class from the bathroom. After spotting the gunman walking down the hall in front of him, the student freezes, turns and flees. The screams of children are redacted throughout the video, but multiple bursts of shots fired by the killer are clearly audible. The first officers arrived in the hallway only three minutes after the assailant had entered the building, but even as several more gather in the building's corridor, none attempt to enter the classroom in which the gunman had barricaded himself with students. Armed officers are also seen approaching the classroom where the shooting took place, but then retreat when gunfire is heard. Officers who arrive later with tactical gear and other equipment also appear hesitant to confront the gunman. They eventually stormed the classroom and shot the 18-year-old dead more than an hour after he first opened fire. The Uvalde attack on 24 May was America's worst school shooting in a decade Texas' public safety chief Steven McCraw has said the on-scene commander, Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, ""waited for radio and rifles, and he waited for shields and he waited for SWAT"". Earlier in June, Mr Arredondo said he had not considered himself the commander and did not order police to hold back.He was placed on administrative leave last month and has since resigned. Mr McCraw has described the police response to the attack as an ""abject failure"" and said officers wasted vital time looking for a classroom key that was ""never needed."" Officials expressed disappointment over the leak of the footage, which a Texas state senate panel had planned to first show to the bereaved families on Sunday. Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, speaking at a town council meeting, called it ""one of the most chicken things I've seen"". ""They didn't need to see the gunman coming in and hear the gunshots. They don't need to relive that, they've been through enough,"" he said.

Energy firms told to review soaring direct debits,"UK energy suppliers have been told to review the way they charge customers by direct debit amid complaints about soaring charges and credit balances. The regulator Ofgem also urged six suppliers to take ""immediate"" action to tackle issues with their charging processes. Some 500,000 households saw direct debit payments double this year, Ofgem said, despite prices rising by 54%. It wants suppliers to check whether such a large increase was justified. The six suppliers singled out included Ecotricity, Good Energy, Green Energy UK, Utilita Energy, TruEnergy and UK Energy Incubator Hub (which has now ceased trading). Ofgem found they had ""moderate to severe"" weaknesses, ranging from inadequate charging processes to lacking a structured approach to setting direct debits. Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem Energy firms ordered to explain direct debit hikes How high will my energy bill go? The watchdog has now ordered all energy suppliers to review the accounts of customers whose direct debit was doubled or more between February and the end of April. Where appropriate, Ofgem said it expected suppliers to adjust any miscalculations, including making repayments if needed, and consider whether a goodwill payment is warranted. Millions of domestic gas and electricity customers cover their bills with an identical direct debit payment every month. This is set by their supplier based on the price, and a customer's previous and predicted energy use. If someone has paid for more energy than they have actually used, a credit balance builds up. ""Suppliers must do all they can, especially during the current gas crisis, to support customers and to recognise the significant worry and concern increased direct debits can cause,"" said Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's chief executive. ""We know there is some excellent service out there, but we want to make sure that it's consistent and standard across the board. It's clear from today's findings on direct debits that there are areas of the market where customers are simply not getting the service they need and rightly expect in these very difficult times."" British Gas, EDF, Scottish Power and SO Energy were given a clean bill of health. Bulb, E.ON, Octopus Energy, Outfox the Market, Ovo, Shell and Utility Warehouse were found to have some minor issues. Consumer groups and the public complained to the regulator about ""bad practices"" by some suppliers - including questions over increases in direct debit demands and credit balances being too high. The regulator has previously accused some firms of using customers' accumulated credit like an ""interest-free company credit card"". On 1 April, yearly bills typically increased by Â£693 for about 18 million households on standard tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, a rise of 54%. And some 4.5 million prepayment customers saw an average increase of Â£708 - from Â£1,309 to Â£2,017. Last month Ofgem announced proposals which included tightening the rules on the level of direct debits that suppliers can charge to ""ensure credit balances do not become excessive"". Ofgem also wants to protect credit balances when suppliers fail so the costs are not picked up by all bill payers. Some companies criticised by Ofgem have hit back. Doug Stewart, Green Energy UK's chief executive, said his company was making improvements in the areas highlighted by the regulator. ""I do feel that given the challenging state of the market, Ofgem needs to resist knocking suppliers, like ourselves, who have survived the market crash and are doing our very best to help customers,"" he said. A spokesman for Utilita said: ""We have been left shocked and disappointed by Ofgem's decision to name and shame suppliers at this time, given we're still working on their follow-up request for additional information and evidence."" TruEnergy said it was ""working with the regulator to demonstrate full compliance"", while Good Energy said it was taking ""rapid action"" to address Ofgem's concerns. ""Ofgem raised just one concern relating to internal documentation. Our direct debit processes are proven to be fair and consistent with no detriment to customers. Ofgem is only serving to create extra anxiety for our customers here, at the worst possible time,"" a Good Energy spokesman said. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, said Ofgem ignored the fact it was installing a new billing system. Dhara Vyas from Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said: ""It is good that the regulator has found that the majority of suppliers have only minor issues with their processes and, where action is required to make further improvements, providers will work with the regulator to ensure these are in place quickly."" Households in England, Wales and Scotland have their bills governed by the energy price cap. That limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and for the standing charge, and is set every six months. From this winter, it is expected that this will change to a three-month period. Earlier this week, Mr Brearley said that prices were likely to rise by more than expected this winter. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April. Starting on Thursday,direct payments will be made to low-income householdsto help with the cost of living and covering energy bills. Has your direct debit been set too high?

Liverpool fans blamed unfairly for Uefa final chaos,"Liverpool fans were initially blamed for the authorities' failures to handle large crowds arriving at the stadium A French inquiry into the security fiasco at the Uefa Champions League final in May has found it was caused by a litany of administrative errors and failings rather than Liverpool fans. The French government initially blamed supporters and fake tickets for the crowd chaos that led to fans being tear-gassed and robbed in Paris. But a Senate report has found authorities blamed them unfairly. Dysfunctional mistakes were made at every level, it said. In their report, entitled Champions League Final: An Unavoidable Fiasco, two Senate committees investigated what went wrong on the night of the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris on 28 May, taking evidence from Liverpool fan and club representatives as well as French officials. Liverpool fans have told the BBC that the problems were caused by digital tickets not working properly on the night, leading to problems at the turnstiles at the Stade de France. A rail strike made things worse, leading to bottlenecks as supporters arrived for the match. As well as being tear-gassed outside the ground, fans were robbed and assaulted by local troublemakers. It then emerged that CCTV footage had been wiped a week later because no request had been made to save it. Laurent Lafon, one of the inquiry's two chairmen, spoke of a dysfunctional chain of events and failings in preparation: ""Everyone went their own way without there being any real co-ordination."" Paris police, Uefa and the French government are all taken to task by the inquiry: Uefa for failing to plan for potential ticketing fraud and the government for shifting the blame on to supporters. Co-chairman Jean-NoÃ«l Buffet identified the police's decision to use its anti-terror policy of pre-screening fans outside a rail station as part of the problem: ""It just required 10,000 to 15,000 people to make this pre-filtering system untenable."" When the Paris prefect decided to abandon the screening because of the risk of a crush, the inquiry said the move had ""created a space in front of the stadium for hooligans, who were then able to surge into it and attack supporters"". This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris In evidence to the Senate committee last month, Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin admitted things could have been better organised and apologised for the ""disproportionate"" use of tear gas. But he maintained Liverpool fans were largely to blame. He had earlier complained that 30,000-40,000 Liverpool fans had arrived at the stadium either with no tickets at all or with forgeries. Uefa made clear there had actually been 2,700 fake tickets on the night. The inquiry report reserved strong condemnation for Mr Darmanin himself: ""It is unfair to have sought to blame supporters of the Liverpool team for the disturbances, as the interior minister has done, to deflect attention from the state's inability to properly manage the crowd and suppress the action of several hundred violent and organised delinquents."" It also found that the use of tear gas on fans had been ""particularly aggressive"". Liverpool fans told the inquiry that security methods used by Paris authorities were reminiscent of those deployed against hooligans in the 1980s. The inquiry accepted that local authorities had little time to prepare for the May final, after it was moved from St Petersburg in mid-March because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it criticised Uefa for failing to legislate for fake paper tickets. The shocking scenes outside the stadium came as an embarrassment to the government ahead of June parliamentary elections and as France plans for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics. The inquiry report will have made uncomfortable listening for two key figures in this saga. GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Police Chief Didier Lallement both cited the behaviour of Liverpool fans as a key factor in the chaos that engulfed the Champions League final. Senators concluded that blaming fans was an ""injustice"" and were asked about sanctions for those who had ""lied"" in their version of events. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin eventually apologised for the chaos outside the Stade de France Sanctions for either appear unlikely at this point. Mr Lallement's retirement has already been delayed as a result of the scandal, reportedly to avoid any impression that he was being sanctioned. Mr Darmanin, already the third most important member of the government, has since been given an extra ministerial portfolio. This was not a formal commission of inquiry and there seems to be little appetite in the government for senior heads to roll. With two major sporting events on France's horizon, the report puts pressure on authorities to consider how they communicate, co-ordinate and make decisions. But few believe France's centralised structures will be easy to change. The interior minister eventually apologised to supporters, but inquiry co-chairman Mr Buffet said he had inflamed the situation by ""spouting rubbish"". Had he admitted he had got it wrong, there wouldn't have been an issue, he said. Responding to the Senate report, the Spirit of Shankly supporters' group called for a full apology from the French government.Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association said French police and Mr Darmanin should ""feel a deep sense of shame"",externaland called on the interior minister to resign. ""When can we expect an apology...?"",externaltweeted metro mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, who was at the game. Pepper spray and crying children at Paris final.

Successful debut flight for Europe's Vega-C rocket,"This video can not be played Watch Vega-C leave the launch pad at the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana Europe has given a successful debut to its new Vega-C rocket. The medium-lift vehicle was sent up from French Guiana to deliver seven satellites to orbit, the largest of which will test Einstein's general theory of relativity. Vega-C has enormous importance for Europe's continued access to space. It's needed to fill a big gap in capability now that Russian rockets are no longer available because of the war in Ukraine. The withdrawal from the market of Moscow's Soyuz launchers earlier this year left European institutional and commercial satellites scrambling for alternative rides. Vega-C will be the obvious option for many, although even before Wednesday's successful maiden flight, the new Italian-led rocket system was fully booked through 2023, 2024 and 2025. And there's a further reason why Vega-C's entry into the launcher business is critical. Its first stage, the segment of the vehicle that gets it up off the ground, is also going to be used on Europe's forthcoming heavy-lift rocket, the Ariane-6. Sharing the stage technology across both launcher systems is expected to lead to significant cost savings. ""The launch demand in Europe in the next couple of years and beyond is going to be high, and Vega-C and Ariane-6 are going to be our workhorses,"" said Josef Aschbacher, the director general of the European Space Agency. ""You should see this maiden flight as the first launch of a new generation of European rockets, the start of a strengthening of the role of Europe in space transportation,"" Giorgio Saccoccia, the president of the Italian Space Agency, told BBC News. Artwork: Ariane-6 (left) and Vega-C (right) will share propulsion technologies to reduce costs Vega-C is an enhancement of the old Vega vehicle introduced in 2012. The upgrade brings greater performance as well as cost reductions. And its designers hope their changes will add increased flexibility, too, to meet the diverse demands of today's satellite operators. Some spacecraft, such as the European Union's Earth observation Sentinels, can weigh a couple of tonnes. At the other end of the spectrum, there's been a surge in the production of shoebox-sized (and smaller) spacecraft. Vega-C will have the ability therefore to fly big, single payload missions, as well as so-called rideshare missions where many tens of little satellites are lofted at once. Another role for Vega-C will be to carry Europe's mini robotic space shuttle to orbit. The Space Rider will take up scientific experiments and return them to Earth. Its first outing is likely to be in 2024. Both the earlier Vega and Vega-C use an upper-stage engine made in Ukraine. This has been the topic of much discussion because of the war in the east European nation. The concern has been whether the conflict might interrupt the supply of these RD-843 motors, produced by Yuzhmash, Ukraine's state-owned aerospace manufacturer. But Avio, the Italian firm responsible for assembling Vega vehicles, says it already has enough in its possession for the short term. Longer-term, a western European alternative is being developed. The Lares-2 ""disco ball"" was released almost 6,000km above the Earth Ukraine, as well as wanting to join the European Union, also wants to become a member of the European Space Agency. One of its key contributions would be engine technology. ""The process has started. It takes about 10 years to go through all the steps to full membership,"" explained Dr Aschbacher. ""I do have a mandate given to me by Esa's member states to discuss with Ukraine and to identify projects or opportunities for cooperation, although given current circumstances this is only happening at a light level. ""But, certainly, there is huge interest on the side of Ukraine to go through all the obligatory steps as quickly as possible."" Wednesday's launch put seven satellites in orbit, including the Lares-2 (Laser Relativity Satellite-2) payload. Looking like a disco ball, it will be tracked very precisely by lasers from the ground. Researchers at Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics say this will enable them to test ""frame dragging"", a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's equations that sees the Earth twist local space-time around with it as it rotates.

Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race. The former equalities minister, who came fourth securing the backing of 40 MPs in today's vote, has justtweeted,externalgratitude for her colleagues' support. ""To win the next election and deliver Conservative solutions to todayâs problems, our party must stand as the party for change,"" she says. ""I have the conviction, the courage, and the clarity of thought to deliver that change."" Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer. Most other Brexiteers have attacked Sunak's record on taxes, but Villiers says the former chancellor is a tax cutter and she has ""real confidence"" he can win the next general election. Chris MasonPolitical editor Team Sunak say ""heâs landed a quarter of the party with eight candidates in the field"". The former chancellor has won 88 of the possible 358 votes in today's opening ballot of Conservative MPs. Tom Tugendhat supporter Damian Green says he is ""absolutely still in this"" and there's ""real momentum there"". ""Tom is offering a clean start,"" he states, and he suspects that Tugendhat - who came fifth in today's ballow with 37 votes - will now pick up some of Jeremy Hunt's supporters. ""Rishi has come ahead,"" he says, and he is the ""most known name in this election,"" he says others are ""scrapping for other slots on the ballot paper"". He says northern MPs are supporting Tom Tugendhat, and ""as the debate continues"" then people will start focusing on whether or not tax cuts ""will be inflationary"", he says. Green says cutting duty on fuel, as Tom Tugendhat proposes, would be anti-inflationary, he says it's ""extraordinary"" that the UK doesn't currently have a long term plan for growth. Another Tugendhat supporter, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says that the MP is putting across a ""positive"" message, and it's still ""all to play for"". Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the
phone in hushed tones outside the result venue. Itâs exactly these kinds of MPs who the remaining candidates
will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm
honouredâ in response to her strong second place. That, and the relatively narrow gap between her and Rishi Sunak are the main headlines from the first vote. One Mordaunt backer in the room said her healthy showing
in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing
suggested Sunakâs lead was hardly overwhelming. Another backing Liz Truss said
it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate. Not changing the ""underlying economic plan"" would mean that the UK can do tax cuts, he adds, ""under the government of Boris Johnson"", but there is ""more headroom to be achieved"" to allow reductions in taxation. People on the right of the party will ""have to think"" about previous statements Penny Mordaunt has made, says Clarke, adding that he himself doesn't agree with Mordaunt on the issue of trans rights and her views on women. Here's the moment that the MPs vying to become the next prime minister learned their fate. Sir Graham Brady read out the results of the ballot of Conservative MPs.

DJ Tim Westwood accused of sexual misconduct,"Tim Westwood in 2021 DJ Tim Westwood is facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by women who say he abused his position in the music industry to exploit them. The 64-year-old is accused of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017. The BBC and the Guardian have heard detailed accounts from seven women in a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. He strenuously denies the allegations. The DJ was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap show on UK radio from 1994. The seven women who spoke to the BBC are all black, and say they met Westwood through his work. Some of them accuse the DJ of abusing his power within the music industry. The women tell their stories in aBBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which airs on BBC Three at 21:00 on Tuesday. Two of them, who were aspiring to work in the industry, say they agreed to come to London to meet him to discuss music. They accuse the DJ of driving them to a flat and initiating unwanted and unexpected sex. One was 19 at the time, while Westwood was 53. Another woman told the BBC she met Westwood, then in his mid-30s, when she was 17 and a member of a R&B group. She says she was subjected to unwanted oral sex after agreeing to meet him. Four further young women accuse the DJ of either touching their bottoms or breasts as they posed for photographs with him at different events where he was performing. The women, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, do not know each other. Some work in the music industry and fear repercussions - with the DJ continuing to have a prominent role in an industry long-criticised for its treatment of darker-skinned black women. Allegations about Westwood's behaviour toward young black women have circulated on social media for some time. In 2020, Westwood issued a statement to the Mail Online hitting out at the ""fabricated allegations"" and said they were false and without foundation. Now, for the first time, following our investigation, women detail their experiences. Warning: Some of the content in their stories may be distressing. When Isabel discovered Tim Westwood was DJing at her local nightclub, she spotted a chance to have her music heard by someone influential. She was 19, and had already been getting studio time - featuring on rappers' tracks as a vocalist. Isabel was young when she realised she could sing. During her strict religious upbringing in the Midlands in the early 2000s, contemporary music was banned at home, but she spent Sundays singing gospel in church. Secretly, however, she would write her own music and dream of a future as a recording artist. By 2010, when she was a university student, she was continuing to pursue a career in music. She knew a national platform like BBC Radio 1 could take her to the next level. ""[Tim Westwood] was the main gatekeeper to get to the level of exposure I needed,"" she says. This video can not be played Isabel described what happened when Tim Westwood picked her up in his car Isabel put together a mixtape of unreleased work and included her contact details inside the CD case. Her best friend together with her stepmum went to the club night with her. They managed to hand the CD to Westwood, and Isabel says the DJ - then aged 53 - called her the next day. The two arranged to meet in London. Her family and friends shared her excitement. ""We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,"" she says. ""He wants to act on this quickly."" Within days, she was on a train to London for an afternoon meeting. Isabel says the plan was to meet at Nike Town on Oxford Street, near BBC Radio 1's studios. She says Westwood was there waiting in a huge American-style car. Isabel assumed they were going to talk about her music over coffee or a drink - a point she wishes she had clarified. ""I don't ask where we're going. And then at this point, we start driving,"" she recalls. But she says her discomfort grew as she realised they were heading out of central London. ""This is where I'm now like 'Oh God, where are we going, what's happening?'"" She says the conversation dried up - to the point where it was almost ""menacingly silent"". She alleges at one point on the journey, the DJ tapped her arm to get her to turn and see that he had undone his trousers and had exposed his genitals. ""I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God. Just don't say anything. Don't look. Don't say anything.' And I'm hoping that's enough for him to justâ¦ not."" Isabel says she felt ""completely powerless"" and ""very, very scared"". She says they eventually arrived at what she believes was Westwood's flat. She remembers it being filled with lots of records. She says she was led to a room, where she refused an offer of a drink. ""He leaves the room and then he comes back completely naked,"" she alleges. ""That's when I noticed that he has got a condom and he has removed it [from the wrapper] and started putting it on."" Isabel says she recognised the condom packet. It had the DJ's face on one side - part of a campaign Westwood did with Durex. ""I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down."" Isabel describes sitting on a chair ""frozen with fear"". She says Westwood held her shoulders and turned her around. ""I knew what was going to happen at this point. So, I'm just like 'Oh my God,' And I remember being like, hunched up and like holding on to the back of the chair, like, scared. ""He almost, like, tapped me on the back of my leg as if he wanted me to move my leg, which I didn't do. And then he sort of did."" Westwood then penetrated her. She says after he finished, she quickly got dressed and sat waiting to leave. She says the DJ seemed annoyed when she asked for a lift to the station. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Isabel recalls going over and over the experience on what felt like a really long journey back north. ""I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad."" She says the encounter led her to drop out from her studies and music career. Isabel's stepmum told the BBC the whole family had been excited about Isabel's chance at a breakthrough. But she knew instinctively that something had happened when Isabel got home and wouldn't talk about the meeting. But she says that after she heard Isabel's account, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was, in part, over worries her family would be disappointed with her. Like others the BBC spoke to, Isabel became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Pamela's story echoes Isabel's. She was just 20 when she met Westwood through friends. It was 2000 and she was working with young people who wanted to break into the music industry. She says the DJ invited her to do work experience with him at BBC Radio 1. He had joined the BBC in 1994, after making a name for himself on pirate and then commercial radio. But his show mostly focused on US artists, and Pamela says the DJ told her he wanted to understand more about the UK scene and ""get a younger audience"". She says the DJ, in his 40s at the time, reassured her ""stern Jamaican"" mother on the phone that her daughter would be OK heading to London. Pamela travelled by train from the Midlands and says Westwood picked her up in a huge American-style car. She says, as they drove, he kept stroking her leg and touching her face. She kept batting his hand away. She says he wasn't concentrating on the road and was swerving so much that a police officer on a motorbike pulled up beside them and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says Westwood apologised - and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela assumed she would be staying in a hotel as part of the work experience, but says the DJ instead drove her to an apartment where she remembers ""records and trainers and oversized clothes everywhere"". She says that at one point, he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. ""I didn't give him any kind of come on. There was no flirtation,"" she says. ""If you are trying to actively touch me and I am pushing your hand away, that means I don't want to do anything with you. If you are trying to remove [an] item of my clothing, and I put it back on, that means I don't want it to be gone. If I'm showing you I'm uncomfortable, why would you just not stop doing it?"" She says she remembers thinking she couldn't get out of the situation. ""I'm in London alone with this man. Now, if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it."" Pamela says she went home as soon as she could. She describes the encounter as ""traumatic"" and ""disgusting"". The work experience Westwood offered didn't take place. We asked the BBC whether any monitoring of any work experience scheme took place but they did not provide an answer to this question. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry about her experience. Pamela is critical of the BBC and other organisations for the ""celebrity status"" Westwood's position afforded him over the years - a position she believes he abused. ""I would describe it as an abuse of power becauseâ¦ who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international."" Westwood fronted the UK version of the hit MTV show Pimp my Ride in 2005, and was also given a drive-time show on BBC Radio 1's sister station 1Xtra, which focused on contemporary black music. Tim Westwood on stage in 2007 at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston He is known for giving a platform to new artists, as well as getting some of the biggest rappers in the world onto his programmes - from Eminem to Cardi B. He eventually left the BBC in 2013 as part of scheduled changes. In a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, BBC News asked the BBC whether it had received any complaints against Westwood during his time in its employment. The corporation said it could ""neither confirm nor deny whether the BBC holds the requested information"". In a statement regarding our investigation, the BBC said ""it does not comment on individuals"", but added that presenters would be expected to comply with strict codes of conduct. In a statement released after publication of this story, the BBC said it was ""shocked to hear of these allegations"". In relation to the FOI request, it clarified it did not ""hold information that is helpful for this investigation"". One woman's story we heard goes back three decades. It was the early 1990s and Tamara had been talent-spotted by producers trying to put together a British R&B group. At that time, songs from American R&B girl groups like TLC and SWV were getting radio play and finding chart success. Tamara says she was manipulated into the situation with Tim Westwood Tamara spent her time in and out of studios recording music - as well as enjoying London's nightlife meeting other artists. One time when she'd seen him around, Westwood, who was then in his mid-30s, suggested they should meet up. She was 17 at the time and believed the meeting was to talk about her career. She says that, at the time, the DJ had ""absolute power"". He picked her up, and after stopping briefly at a radio station, he took her to a flat. According to her,  he started to take down her trousers and underwear. ""Then he began instantaneously to give me oral sex. There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it - that's what was happening."" Tamara says that at first she tried to push his head or his shoulders away but he just continued. ""And then I just realised that I'm in a position where it's already gone too far. I'm in a place, I'm already far from home. I wouldn't know how to get home from here. I was manipulated into that situation - I was led to believe one thing, when he had something else in mind."" Working in the same industry, she says their paths continued to cross. She says Westwood had sex with her several times over the next few years before she cut off the encounters. ""I think it was almost implied by him that OK, because we'd had the first encounter, I would be up for the next encounter and being young and not having the strength and courage to just say 'Look, no, I don't feel right about this because I don't feel right about it.' It just happened."" In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC's Music's Dirty Secrets documentary in 2021 and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. Now 64, Westwood continues to perform at nightclubs around the UK and internationally, hosts freestyle sessions and interviews on his popular YouTube channel and has a Saturday night show on Global's Capital Xtra. Tim Westwood at the Wireless Festival in London in 2019 Four further women have told the BBC about their experiences with the DJ as they posed for photos at events with him. Farah says she was introduced to Westwood in 2000 at an afterparty at Bristol Carnival. She says he put his hand down her top and ""grabbed"" her breast while they were gathered for a group photograph. ""I felt cold and I felt dirty. I felt humiliated - embarrassed that I'd done something wrong,"" she says. The BBC spoke to her friend who recalled Farah telling her years ago about the incident. Another woman, Claire, described meeting Westwood at a club in Ayia Napa, Cyprus in 2009. She recalls that he said ""lemme grab some ass"" as she and a friend posed for a photograph with him, before the DJ put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. She says she ""froze"" and felt ""very intimidated"" by the experience. A third told the BBC she was a huge fan of Westwood's BBC Radio 1Xtra show when she went to an event he was DJing at in Essex - also in 2009. Then aged 19, Loretta also describes feeling his hand snake down her back before he grabbed her bottom while they posed for a picture. ""I felt his hand go back up. And stopped at my neck. And do you know, in that moment I was kind of frozen."" Photos of Tim Westwood with some of the women (blurred) who have spoken out Nyla was in university when she met Westwood at a New Year's Day event in 2017, she told the BBC. She says he described her as the ""pengest girl in the rave"" during his DJ set and then later, while she and her friend recorded a Snapchat video with him, she says he put his hand up inside the back of her skirt. She says she was ""shocked"" and felt ""objectified"". She says the DJ managed to find her Snapchat contact and called her the next day to ask her to ""hang out"". She didn't meet up with him. The BBC has seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during their encounters. Watch on BBC iPlayer None of the women the BBC spoke to have reported their interactions to the police. Some say they are speaking about their experiences in the hope it encourages others to come forward and leads to the DJ being ""held accountable"" for his behaviour. ""It makes it feel like that wasn't completely for nothing,"" Isabel says about coming forward. ""Like, I don't just have this trauma scar for no reason. There's a purpose for other people to not have to experience it."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? If you are able to talk to us please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Tory leadership rivals await result of MPs' votes,"Tory leadership hopefuls face a nervous wait after their colleagues finished their first round of voting in the contest for No 10. The eight candidates who have made it onto the ballot paper need to secure at least 30 votes to stay in the race to become prime minister. A result from the secret ballot is expected around 17.00 BST. Those who make it through will face further votes in the coming days to narrow the field down to a final two. It comes after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becomes the latest MP to hold an event to launch her leadership campaign. She joins Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi on the ballot, as all have secured the required 20 nominations from Tory MPs to make it into the first round. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax With campaigning stepping up a gear, Ms Mordaunt pledged to slash VAT on fuel and raise income tax thresholds. Setting out her stall at a hot, crowded launch event, she also promised parents more flexibility over subsidised childcare and said she would give MPs control over ""social capital pots"" to spend on their local areas. Pitching herself as a team player, she said if she won office she would introduce a ""tighter"" cabinet of ministers with powers across Whitehall. This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt plans to modernise a 'broken' Whitehall Adding that the Conservative Party had ""lost its sense of self"", she also vowed to return to the values of ""small state, low tax, personal responsibility"". Ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid and junior minister Rehman Chishti have dropped out of the race, after failing to pick up enough support. The 30 vote threshold - which has beenintroduced to quickly narrow the field- could see a number of further candidates knocked out. Candidates will also appear at two further hustings events on Wednesday, as the race to secure endorsements heats up. It comes as: Former chancellor Mr Sunak, who has the strongest backing among Tory MPs so far, secured support from cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Grant Shapps Foreign Secretary Ms Truss bagged endorsements from cabinet ministers and Johnson loyalists Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries Mr Hunt's campaign rejected an accusation from Ms Dorries that Mr Sunak's team lent nominations, to make sure he got onto the ballot paper Former foreign secretary Mr Hunt, who has not had a launch event, said he was ""quietly confident"" he would make it through the first round of voting The campaign so far has laid bare Tory divisions over taxation, with a number of candidates attacking the rise in taxes under Mr Sunak's chancellorship. All the contenders are pledging to bring in immediate tax cuts if they win, apart from Mr Sunak who says cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Among those promising to reduce taxes, there aredivisions over which taxes should be cut, and how quickly. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Sunak said tackling inflation is his ""number one economic priority"", and claimed former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an icon on the right of the party, would have backed his approach. But on of Ms Truss's backers, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked his record at the Treasury, telling Sky News the ""tax-increasing chancellor"" had made decisions ""of the left rather than on the right"". And he sought to disparage Leave-voting Mr Sunak's Brexit credentials, branding him an ""ostensible Brexiteer"" whose department had resisted ending the ""supremacy of EU law"" during his tenure. The competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported former candidate Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. Read more from Chris Boris Johnson, who has declined to endorse any of the candidates, said any of them would ""wipe the floor"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he branded ""Captain Crasheroony Snoozefest"". Appearing at his first Prime Minister's Questions since the cabinet mutiny last week that forced his resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""proud"" of his record at No 10 and would leave office ""with my head held high"". But Sir Keir shot back that the Tory leadership candidates ""haven't found time to explain"" their various tax cuts, which he said would cost Â£300bn. The Labour leader accused the contenders of attempting to ""rewrite history"" over the government's record on taxation, and acting like they had ""just arrived from the moon"". His questions were aimed, in particular, at the current and previous chancellors, Mr Zahawi and Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, the government has scheduled a vote of no confidence in itself next week, amid a row over whether Mr Johnson should be able to stay in office until his successor is chosen. Labour had tabled a motion of no confidence in both the government and PM earlier this week - butministers blocked it, arguing the wording breached parliamentary convention. The government has now tabled a motion of its own, which it is likely to win, in the hope of closing off further attempts to prevent Mr Johnson staying on. In a last-ditch bid to set up a specific vote on Mr Johnson's future, the Liberal Democrats have said they will table an amendment to the motion. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether it is voted on. Tory MPs are aiming to whittle down the candidates to a final two before Parliament's summer break begins at the end of next week. About 160,000 members of the Conservative Party will then choose between these final two, with the winner due to be announced on 5 September.

Molly-Mae Hague has Instagram post banned again,"Molly-Mae Hague has had another Instagram post banned, this time after she failed to include any mention of it being an ad. It's the third time the 23-year-old influencer has been in trouble with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). She posted a picture of her wearing a Pretty Little Thing (PLT) dress, along with a link to buy it, on her story. The ASA said it was not ""immediately clear"" that she had a commercial interest in PLT. Molly-Mae is a creative director at the company, with PLT confirming their contract expressly stated the requirement for her to include the ""Â£ad"" disclosure in posts. Someone who saw the former Love Islander's post on Halloween last year complained, saying the ad didn't make its commercial intent clear. The ASA said: ""We noted that the story had appeared in Molly-Mae Hague's own account and did not contain any indication that it was a marketing communication."" A spokeswoman for Molly-Mae said the ""#ad"" disclosure had been left off by mistake and would be used in future. PLT also said it had reminded Molly-Mae of the requirement to prevent any similar mistakes in future. This is the Insta story that got Molly-Mae in trouble This is the third time Molly-Mae has beencalled out by the ASA,externalsince 2020. But she is by no means the first influencer to have been ticked off for not labelling an ad correctly on social media. Newsbeat spoke to the ASA's compliance executive Ed Senior last year and he told us that ""overall compliance was disappointing"". The rules say content has to ""be clear, obvious and identifiable as advertising"". Putting a hashtag #ad is one way, but he says they could also verbally say it's an advert at the start of a video. ""It needs to be clear and obviously up front, prior to engagement. So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules,"" Ed said. But what happens if the rules are broken? Love Island's Molly-Mae broke rules with giveaway Molly-Mae: 'Iâm not just an influencer any more' Lauren Goodger forex ad banned from Instagram As you'd expect, there are different levels of sanctions. Ed says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it. If things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities. The ASA has told Newsbeat there are measures in place specifically for influencers, including a non-compliance webpage which lists people who fail to label their content as ads - so naming and shaming basically. From January, there has also been an ""on-platform targeted ads sanction"" on a handful of influencers who have been either unwilling or unable to consistently label when their posts are ads. ""We took out ads on Instagram, specifically flagging influencers who routinely break our rules and warning consumers about their content,"" a spokesman added.

Result due in first round of Tory leadership election,"Rishi Sunak leads the first ballot in the Conservative leadership race with 88 votes Penny Mordaunt gets 67 votes and Liz Truss secures 50 votes Nadhim Zahawi and Jeremy Hunt fail to achieve the required 30 votes and exit the contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat are all also among the remaining six candidates going through to another vote tomorrow Earlier Boris Johnson told MPs that he was ""leaving with my head held high"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer attacked tax and spending pledges set out by Tory leadership candidates, but Johnson said their commitments are ""very good"" The government will table a confidence vote in itself - due next week - after blocking a Labour bid Edited by Claudia Allen We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates on what is likely to be another busy day in the leadership contest. Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race. The former equalities minister, who came fourth securing the backing of 40 MPs in today's vote, has justtweeted,externalgratitude for her colleagues' support. ""To win the next election and deliver Conservative solutions to todayâs problems, our party must stand as the party for change,"" she says. ""I have the conviction, the courage, and the clarity of thought to deliver that change."" Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer. Most other Brexiteers have attacked Sunak's record on taxes, but Villiers says the former chancellor is a tax cutter and she has ""real confidence"" he can win the next general election. Chris MasonPolitical editor Team Sunak say ""heâs landed a quarter of the party with eight candidates in the field"". The former chancellor has won 88 of the possible 358 votes in today's opening ballot of Conservative MPs. Tom Tugendhat supporter Damian Green says he is ""absolutely still in this"" and there's ""real momentum there"". ""Tom is offering a clean start,"" he states, and he suspects that Tugendhat - who came fifth in today's ballow with 37 votes - will now pick up some of Jeremy Hunt's supporters. ""Rishi has come ahead,"" he says, and he is the ""most known name in this election,"" he says others are ""scrapping for other slots on the ballot paper"". He says northern MPs are supporting Tom Tugendhat, and ""as the debate continues"" then people will start focusing on whether or not tax cuts ""will be inflationary"", he says. Green says cutting duty on fuel, as Tom Tugendhat proposes, would be anti-inflationary, he says it's ""extraordinary"" that the UK doesn't currently have a long term plan for growth. Another Tugendhat supporter, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says that the MP is putting across a ""positive"" message, and it's still ""all to play for"". Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the
phone in hushed tones outside the result venue. Itâs exactly these kinds of MPs who the remaining candidates
will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm
honouredâ in response to her strong second place. That, and the relatively narrow gap between her and Rishi Sunak are the main headlines from the first vote. One Mordaunt backer in the room said her healthy showing
in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing
suggested Sunakâs lead was hardly overwhelming. Another backing Liz Truss said
it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate. Not changing the ""underlying economic plan"" would mean that the UK can do tax cuts, he adds, ""under the government of Boris Johnson"", but there is ""more headroom to be achieved"" to allow reductions in taxation. People on the right of the party will ""have to think"" about previous statements Penny Mordaunt has made, says Clarke, adding that he himself doesn't agree with Mordaunt on the issue of trans rights and her views on women. Here's the moment that the MPs vying to become the next prime minister learned their fate. Sir Graham Brady read out the results of the ballot of Conservative MPs.

Sri Lanka prime minister tells military to 'restore order',"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to ""do whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has declared a state of emergency in the country But he has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"" President Rajapaksa fled overnight on a military jet - accompanied by his wife - days after demonstrators overran his residence He has pledged to stand down on Wednesday amid mass protests over the island's worst economic crisis in decades For months people have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines Thousands have taken to the streets in anger in recent weeks, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation Edited by Alex Therrien and Chris Giles We're pausing our live coverage of Sri Lanka's political and economic crisis. You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office.

A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory.

You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts.

Where do Tory candidates stand on indyref2?,"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are the candidates who will compete for Conservative Party membership votes in the coming weeks Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are thefinal candidates to be the next leader of the Conservative partyand prime minister of the UK. They now face a vote of Tory party members, and whoever wins when the result is announced on 5 September will immediately face demands from the SNP for an independence referendum to be held in October next year. Here is a what each has had to say about Scotland. Rishi Sunak: ""There is nothing more Conservative than our precious union."" The former Chancellor's resignation alongside Health Secretary Sajid Javid played a key role in the collapse of support for Boris Johnson within the government. Mr Sunak was an early frontrunner in the race to replace Mr Johnson, with his Ready for Rishi campaign being publicly backed by more Conservative MPs than any other candidate. However he has pitched himself as the underdog in the ballot of Tory members. His campaign has stressed the UK-wide interventions he made as Chancellor, particularly during the pandemic and in distributing levelling-up funds. The Richmond MP has also focused on future general elections, claiming that other candidates could lose to Labour and ""allow the SNP into power via the back door"". He has pledged to ""rule out holding another divisive Scottish independence referendum"", arguing that people want politicians to focus on the cost of living crisis, energy security and economic growth rather than the constitution. And he says he would aim to bring the whole of the UK closer together rather than indulging in ""political point-scoring"" if he becomes PM. Scottish Conservatives seek âdrama-freeâ new PM Mr Sunak said he wanted to lead a UK government ""willing to roll up their sleeves and get stuck into creating jobs, growth and prosperity in all corners of the UK, from Llandudno to Perth, Belfast to Birmingham"". This would involve the London administration getting more involved in making spending decisions across the UK, which he said would ""abandon the Westminster 'devolve and forget' mentality and become the most active UK-wide government in decades"". He said he would reconstitute the Downing Street ""union unit"", bringing together different departments to make sure their policies UK-wide. However, this has led to accusations from the SNP of a power grab of devolved responsibilities, with Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""dangerous proposition"". Mr Sunak said: ""There is nothing more Conservative than our precious union, and everything great that we have achieved we have done so as one family. ""For all of these reasons, my government will do anything and everything to protect, sustain and strengthen it."" In 2020, Mr Sunak denied claims published in the FT newspaper that he had once told a Conservative colleague that it would be in England's best financial interests to break away from the UK. Liz Truss, the MP for South West Norfolk, describes herself as a ""child of the union"" The foreign secretary stayed on in Boris Johnson's government while others resigned, and has secured support from Tory MPs loyal to the prime minister including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries. She is seen as representing the right of the party, and has based her leadership bid on the promise of immediate tax cuts and a longer-term drive to reduce the size of the state. The view of her as a ""continuity candidate"" is underlined by the fact her slogan has been ""delivery, delivery, delivery"", stressing achievements in government rather than the need for change that others have promoted. While Mr Sunak won more backing from MPs, Ms Truss is a heavy favourite with bookmakers to triumph in the vote of Conservative members. She also has more support from Conservative MSPs, after a group of nine penned a joint letter in the Times endorsing her candidacy. Truss: Best to ignore attention-seeking Sturgeon Ms Truss lived in Paisley as a child, where she attended West Primary School and once played the role of Margaret Thatcher in a class hustings ahead of the 1983 general election. Shetold the Scotsman,externalthat she got zero votes, adding: ""I didn't even vote for myself. Even at that age we knew it was simply unpopular to be a Tory in the West of Scotland."" But she has said that the Conservatives ""wouldn't have the ideas, the leaders or the legacy we have today"" without Scots. The South West Norfolk MP describes herself as a ""child of the union"", adding that ""I really believe we're a family and we're better together"". On independence, Ms Truss has said she would not support a fresh vote, saying ""no, no, no"" at a hustings event in Exeter, She has repeatedly said that the SNP had described the last referendum in 2014 as ""once in a generation"", adding: ""I don't think we're through that generation yet."" And she has been critical of the first minister, saying: ""I think the best thing to do with Nicola Sturgeon is ignore her. ""She's an attention seeker, that's what she is. ""What we need to do is show the people of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales what we're delivering for them and making sure that all of our government policies apply right across the United Kingdom.""

"Energy firms told to review soaring direct debitsIt comes after 500,000 households saw their direct debit payments double earlier this year.Business","UK energy suppliers have been told to review the way they charge customers by direct debit amid complaints about soaring charges and credit balances. The regulator Ofgem also urged six suppliers to take ""immediate"" action to tackle issues with their charging processes. Some 500,000 households saw direct debit payments double this year, Ofgem said, despite prices rising by 54%. It wants suppliers to check whether such a large increase was justified. The six suppliers singled out included Ecotricity, Good Energy, Green Energy UK, Utilita Energy, TruEnergy and UK Energy Incubator Hub (which has now ceased trading). Ofgem found they had ""moderate to severe"" weaknesses, ranging from inadequate charging processes to lacking a structured approach to setting direct debits. Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter Energy bills to rise more than predicted - Ofgem Energy firms ordered to explain direct debit hikes How high will my energy bill go? The watchdog has now ordered all energy suppliers to review the accounts of customers whose direct debit was doubled or more between February and the end of April. Where appropriate, Ofgem said it expected suppliers to adjust any miscalculations, including making repayments if needed, and consider whether a goodwill payment is warranted. Millions of domestic gas and electricity customers cover their bills with an identical direct debit payment every month. This is set by their supplier based on the price, and a customer's previous and predicted energy use. If someone has paid for more energy than they have actually used, a credit balance builds up. ""Suppliers must do all they can, especially during the current gas crisis, to support customers and to recognise the significant worry and concern increased direct debits can cause,"" said Jonathan Brearley, Ofgem's chief executive. ""We know there is some excellent service out there, but we want to make sure that it's consistent and standard across the board. It's clear from today's findings on direct debits that there are areas of the market where customers are simply not getting the service they need and rightly expect in these very difficult times."" British Gas, EDF, Scottish Power and SO Energy were given a clean bill of health. Bulb, E.ON, Octopus Energy, Outfox the Market, Ovo, Shell and Utility Warehouse were found to have some minor issues. Consumer groups and the public complained to the regulator about ""bad practices"" by some suppliers - including questions over increases in direct debit demands and credit balances being too high. The regulator has previously accused some firms of using customers' accumulated credit like an ""interest-free company credit card"". On 1 April, yearly bills typically increased by Â£693 for about 18 million households on standard tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, a rise of 54%. And some 4.5 million prepayment customers saw an average increase of Â£708 - from Â£1,309 to Â£2,017. Last month Ofgem announced proposals which included tightening the rules on the level of direct debits that suppliers can charge to ""ensure credit balances do not become excessive"". Ofgem also wants to protect credit balances when suppliers fail so the costs are not picked up by all bill payers. Some companies criticised by Ofgem have hit back. Doug Stewart, Green Energy UK's chief executive, said his company was making improvements in the areas highlighted by the regulator. ""I do feel that given the challenging state of the market, Ofgem needs to resist knocking suppliers, like ourselves, who have survived the market crash and are doing our very best to help customers,"" he said. A spokesman for Utilita said: ""We have been left shocked and disappointed by Ofgem's decision to name and shame suppliers at this time, given we're still working on their follow-up request for additional information and evidence."" TruEnergy said it was ""working with the regulator to demonstrate full compliance"", while Good Energy said it was taking ""rapid action"" to address Ofgem's concerns. ""Ofgem raised just one concern relating to internal documentation. Our direct debit processes are proven to be fair and consistent with no detriment to customers. Ofgem is only serving to create extra anxiety for our customers here, at the worst possible time,"" a Good Energy spokesman said. Dale Vince, founder of Ecotricity, said Ofgem ignored the fact it was installing a new billing system. Dhara Vyas from Energy UK, which represents suppliers, said: ""It is good that the regulator has found that the majority of suppliers have only minor issues with their processes and, where action is required to make further improvements, providers will work with the regulator to ensure these are in place quickly."" Households in England, Wales and Scotland have their bills governed by the energy price cap. That limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and for the standing charge, and is set every six months. From this winter, it is expected that this will change to a three-month period. Earlier this week, Mr Brearley said that prices were likely to rise by more than expected this winter. One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than Â£1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year, which follows a Â£700 a year rise in April. Starting on Thursday,direct payments will be made to low-income householdsto help with the cost of living and covering energy bills. Has your direct debit been set too high?

Uvalde families express anger at leaked video,"A Texas state senate panel had planned to first show the footage to bereaved families later this week The families of those killed in a mass shooting at a Texas school have expressed anger and outrage after new video was leaked showing the attack. The 82 minutes of CCTV footage from Uvalde, published by a local newspaper, shows the gunman's arrival and police waiting 77 minutes to confront him. But it was published days before officials said they had planned to show the families or release it publicly. The leak of the footage, as well as what it shows, reignited public anger. ""Whoever leaked that video... I pray that you never have to deal with what all the parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles are dealing with. Shame on you,"" one family member said at a press conference in Washington DC. Gloria Cazares, whose daughter was among the 19 children and two teachers killed in the shooting, urged people not to share the video. ""This is the opposite of what the families wanted,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""Our hearts are shattered all over again!"" But other relatives expressed support at the release. ""I am happy it is released. But I wish they would have waited until the family members got to see it beforehand,"" Jesse Rizo, who lost a family member in the shooting, told local CBS affiliate Kens5. The Austin American-Statesman newspaper defended its decision,externalto publish the footage in an editorial late on Tuesday. ""Transparency and unrelenting reporting is a way to bring change,"" it read. ""Our goal is to continue to bring to light what happened at Robb Elementary, which the families and friends of the Uvalde victims have long been asking for."" The teachers who died trying to save their pupils The 'sweet and lovable' children who died in Uvalde The video, which confirms many of the details already given by Texas officials, begins from the moment the gunman crashes his vehicle near the campus. He fires shots at passers-by outside before entering the school building and strolling unimpeded through the corridors. It then shows a pupil returning to class from the bathroom. After spotting the gunman walking down the hall in front of him, the student freezes, turns and flees. The screams of children are redacted throughout the video, but multiple bursts of shots fired by the killer are clearly audible. The first officers arrived in the hallway only three minutes after the assailant had entered the building, but even as several more gather in the building's corridor, none attempt to enter the classroom in which the gunman had barricaded himself with students. Armed officers are also seen approaching the classroom where the shooting took place, but then retreat when gunfire is heard. Officers who arrive later with tactical gear and other equipment also appear hesitant to confront the gunman. They eventually stormed the classroom and shot the 18-year-old dead more than an hour after he first opened fire. The Uvalde attack on 24 May was America's worst school shooting in a decade Texas' public safety chief Steven McCraw has said the on-scene commander, Uvalde schools police chief Pete Arredondo, ""waited for radio and rifles, and he waited for shields and he waited for SWAT"". Earlier in June, Mr Arredondo said he had not considered himself the commander and did not order police to hold back.He was placed on administrative leave last month and has since resigned. Mr McCraw has described the police response to the attack as an ""abject failure"" and said officers wasted vital time looking for a classroom key that was ""never needed."" Officials expressed disappointment over the leak of the footage, which a Texas state senate panel had planned to first show to the bereaved families on Sunday. Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, speaking at a town council meeting, called it ""one of the most chicken things I've seen"". ""They didn't need to see the gunman coming in and hear the gunshots. They don't need to relive that, they've been through enough,"" he said.

UK economy grows but fears remain over high prices,"The UK economy rebounded in May after shrinking in April and March, official figures show. The economy grew by 0.5% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, higher than the flat growth most economists expected. Every area of the economy expanded including construction, travel and manufacturing. However, businesses reported that higher running costs had led to them to put up prices for customers. And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, there is ""still a real risk"" that the economy could fall into a recession, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""That may mean the economy proves to be a poisoned chalice for whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister,"" he added. Conservative MPs will cast their first votes in the leadership contest on Wednesday, but whoever replaces Boris Johnson is faced with the dilemma of how to tackle the soaring cost of living. What is GDP and how does it affect me? UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Both businesses and households are being hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May, and is expected to reach 11% later this year. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%, ""no ifs or buts"". It has raised rates five times since December and is expected to put them up again next month.  He has indicted the Bank will ""act forcefully"" suggesting it could raise rates by more than 0.25%. The rise in the cost of living has led to unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, such as the railways, have seen workers strike over pay. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the UK economy had ""rebounded"" in May - with growth across the main sectors, including construction which saw a rise in housebuilding and office refurbishments. ""Health was the biggest driver with many more people seeing GPs, despite test and trace and the vaccination programmes winding down,"" he added. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the activity of companies, the state and individuals in an economy. Part of how GDP is calculated includes measuring the total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction - but also health services and the government, In the health sector, we don't pay for services through the NHS, so one gauge of how it is faring is the number of GP appointments which gives an indication of how that bit of the economy is doing. Mr Morgan added that road haulage also had a ""busy"" May, while travel agencies saw a jump in demand as people booked summer holidays. However, while the economy grew, many businesses reported that an increase in fuel and electricity costs had forced them to put up their prices for customers. The UK's statistics body also cited price increases for metals, some foods, including fish, and other staples. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon warned on Wednesday that its annual losses will be bigger than expected after ramping up wages to attract staff and spending heavily on repairs and marketing. Although sales were now matching those seen in 2019, before the pandemic struck, it said staff costs were far higher than pre-Covid, as firms across the sector had to hike wages to overcome staff shortages. The new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi - who is in the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister - said it was ""great"" to see the economy growing, but added that he knew people were concerned by rising prices. ""We're working alongside the Bank of England to bear down on inflation and I am confident we can create a stronger economy for everyone across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi said. But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said economic growth was ""still far too slow"". ""Instead of presenting the plans we need for a stronger, more secure economy, the Tories are spending every waking minute indulging in unfunded fantasy economics,"" she added. The British economy returned to solid growth in May, up by 0.5%, defying fears of a month of stagnation. The services sector drove half the growth, in particular health services, including GP appointments. Monthly figures are volatile, but thanks to some upward earlier revisions, growth over the three months to May was 0.4%. However, consumers showed signs of being squeezed by the cost of living - with wholesale and retail dragging down the economy in May. The ONS also said respondents to its surveys reported that they were passing on price increases to consumers including fuel, electricity, nickel, cobalt, aluminium, steel, paper, fish and cooking oil. The figures raise some hope of the economy avoiding a feared recession. But many expect the economy to have fallen back again in June. The figures for the full second quarter are released next month. In June, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) warned the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year, and will stagnate next year as consumers rein in their spending and commodity prices remain high. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the UK will be the slowest growing economy among the world's largest economies in 2023. David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said May's growth was ""welcome news"", but ""masks serious underlying issues of growing imbalances within the economy"". He said that ""worryingly"" its recent survey showed that longer term business confidence had begun to fall. ""The present political instability will have only exacerbated uncertainty among small firms,"" he said. ""Alongside this, the economy is still facing massive structural issues - including uncertainty about the UK's relationship with the EU, continued Covid lockdowns in China, supply chain breakdowns and rocketing energy costs.""

Sir Mo relieved Home Office won't take action,"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing. It's a form of therapy."" Sir Mo Farah reveals he was trafficked to UK as child Sir Mo praised for trafficking disclosure Sir Mo describes being reunited with his mum Legally, the government can remove a person's British nationality if their citizenship was obtained through fraud. But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know. I'm not in touch with her and I don't want to be."" You can watch The Real Mo Farah on BBC One at 21:00 BST oron BBC iPlayerat 06:00 BST on Wednesday 13 July (UK only).

Klopp to be given Freedom of Liverpool honour,"Jurgen Klopp became Liverpool manager in October 2015 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has said being nominated for the city's highest honour was ""definitely a wow moment"". Liverpool City Council will recommend conferring the freedom of the city on the German at an upcoming meeting. He said being put forward was ""very humbling"" and meant the bond he had with the city would ""stay forever"". Actress Sue Johnston, who starred in The Royle Family, Downton Abbey and Brookside, will also be nominated for the same honour at the meeting. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said Klopp would be joining Liverpool legendsSir Kenny DalglishandSteve Gerrardin receiving the honour. The honour was also posthumously awarded to 96 victims of the Hillsborough disaster in 2016 and to the 97th victim of the tragedy,Andrew Devine, five years later. Klopp said he ""knew a little bit"" about the honour from when it was conferred on Mr Devine, who he described as ""someone who we all had an enormous amount of love for, along with the other 96 victims of Hillsborough"". ""I also know that Sir Kenny has received the freedom of the city previously, so if my name is listed alongside those and all of the other recipients, that makes the honour even more special,"" he said. ""I have to be honest, when I first heard this news I had to take a minute to take it in. ""As you can imagine, I get a lot of different types of news in my job, but this was definitely a wow moment."" He added that it felt special because of what ""Liverpool, the city and its wonderful people, mean to me and my family"". ""The welcome that we have been given has been unbelievable from the word go, so to get this kind of recognition is incredible. ""It is also very humbling."" Sue Johnston, whose credits include Downton Abbey, The Royle Family and Coronation Street, has also been nominated Under Klopp's reign, Liverpool have entered into a new era of success, reaching three Champions League finals and winning the club's sixth European Cup. His crowning glory came in 2020, when he guided the Reds to a first Premier League title, 30 years after the club had last lifted top division honours. Fellow nominee Johnson, who was born in Warrington and grew up in Prescot, found fame alongside Ricky Tomlinson as Brookside's Sheila Grant and will join the show's creator Sir Philip Redmond on the roll of honour at Liverpool Town Hall. She later played Tomlinson's wife again in a much-loved role as Barbara Royle in the critically-acclaimed The Royle Family. She was made an OBE in the 2009 Queen's Birthday Honours for her services to drama and charity. Councillors will also considered a proposal to grant HMS Prince of Wales admission to the Freedom Roll of Associations and Institutions. The Royal Navy's newest aircraft carrier, which was commissioned in 2019, is affiliated to the city andvisited in 2020, welcoming 20,000 people on board for visits.

String of errors in French handling of Uefa final,"Liverpool fans were initially blamed for the authorities' failures to handle large crowds arriving at the stadium A French inquiry into the security fiasco at the Uefa Champions League final in May has found it was caused by a litany of administrative errors and failings rather than Liverpool fans. The French government initially blamed supporters and fake tickets for the crowd chaos that led to fans being tear-gassed and robbed in Paris. But a Senate report has found authorities blamed them unfairly. Dysfunctional mistakes were made at every level, it said. In their report, entitled Champions League Final: An Unavoidable Fiasco, two Senate committees investigated what went wrong on the night of the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris on 28 May, taking evidence from Liverpool fan and club representatives as well as French officials. Liverpool fans have told the BBC that the problems were caused by digital tickets not working properly on the night, leading to problems at the turnstiles at the Stade de France. A rail strike made things worse, leading to bottlenecks as supporters arrived for the match. As well as being tear-gassed outside the ground, fans were robbed and assaulted by local troublemakers. It then emerged that CCTV footage had been wiped a week later because no request had been made to save it. Laurent Lafon, one of the inquiry's two chairmen, spoke of a dysfunctional chain of events and failings in preparation: ""Everyone went their own way without there being any real co-ordination."" Paris police, Uefa and the French government are all taken to task by the inquiry: Uefa for failing to plan for potential ticketing fraud and the government for shifting the blame on to supporters. Co-chairman Jean-NoÃ«l Buffet identified the police's decision to use its anti-terror policy of pre-screening fans outside a rail station as part of the problem: ""It just required 10,000 to 15,000 people to make this pre-filtering system untenable."" When the Paris prefect decided to abandon the screening because of the risk of a crush, the inquiry said the move had ""created a space in front of the stadium for hooligans, who were then able to surge into it and attack supporters"". This video can not be played Watch: Fans shared videos showing pepper spray being deployed and children crying in Paris In evidence to the Senate committee last month, Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin admitted things could have been better organised and apologised for the ""disproportionate"" use of tear gas. But he maintained Liverpool fans were largely to blame. He had earlier complained that 30,000-40,000 Liverpool fans had arrived at the stadium either with no tickets at all or with forgeries. Uefa made clear there had actually been 2,700 fake tickets on the night. The inquiry report reserved strong condemnation for Mr Darmanin himself: ""It is unfair to have sought to blame supporters of the Liverpool team for the disturbances, as the interior minister has done, to deflect attention from the state's inability to properly manage the crowd and suppress the action of several hundred violent and organised delinquents."" It also found that the use of tear gas on fans had been ""particularly aggressive"". Liverpool fans told the inquiry that security methods used by Paris authorities were reminiscent of those deployed against hooligans in the 1980s. The inquiry accepted that local authorities had little time to prepare for the May final, after it was moved from St Petersburg in mid-March because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But it criticised Uefa for failing to legislate for fake paper tickets. The shocking scenes outside the stadium came as an embarrassment to the government ahead of June parliamentary elections and as France plans for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and 2024 Paris Olympics. The inquiry report will have made uncomfortable listening for two key figures in this saga. GÃ©rald Darmanin and Paris Police Chief Didier Lallement both cited the behaviour of Liverpool fans as a key factor in the chaos that engulfed the Champions League final. Senators concluded that blaming fans was an ""injustice"" and were asked about sanctions for those who had ""lied"" in their version of events. Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin eventually apologised for the chaos outside the Stade de France Sanctions for either appear unlikely at this point. Mr Lallement's retirement has already been delayed as a result of the scandal, reportedly to avoid any impression that he was being sanctioned. Mr Darmanin, already the third most important member of the government, has since been given an extra ministerial portfolio. This was not a formal commission of inquiry and there seems to be little appetite in the government for senior heads to roll. With two major sporting events on France's horizon, the report puts pressure on authorities to consider how they communicate, co-ordinate and make decisions. But few believe France's centralised structures will be easy to change. The interior minister eventually apologised to supporters, but inquiry co-chairman Mr Buffet said he had inflamed the situation by ""spouting rubbish"". Had he admitted he had got it wrong, there wouldn't have been an issue, he said. Responding to the Senate report, the Spirit of Shankly supporters' group called for a full apology from the French government.Liverpool Disabled Supporters Association said French police and Mr Darmanin should ""feel a deep sense of shame"",externaland called on the interior minister to resign.

Market flooded by unsafe vapes aimed at children,"This video can not be played The BBC filmed a Trading Standards undercover operation Trading standards in England and Wales say the market is being flooded by unsafe, disposable vapes aimed at children. The colourful, sweet-flavoured devices are growing in popularity among teens. Children are at risk from vaping, and more should be done to protect them from illegal and unregulated products containing high levels of nicotine, doctors are warning. Some teachers say vaping is becoming a problem in secondary schools. Selling e-cigarettes or vapes to children is illegal in the UK, and every vaping product sold containing nicotine must be registered by the medicines and healthcare products regulator, the MHRA. But the BBC has been told of a rise in complaints to Trading Standards over illicit vapes and shops selling them to children - increasing from dozens each month last year to hundreds per month in 2022, with thousands of counterfeit and unregulated products being seized. A recent survey by health charity ASH suggests nearly a third of 16 and 17-year-olds have tried vaping, and 14% are currently vapers. Among 11-17-year-olds, 7% are vaping - up from 4% in 2020. Vaping - is it a risk-free option? When Radio 5live joined trading standards officers in Newcastle carrying out spot checks on shops, they found that two out of the 10 stores visited that day sold vaping products illegally to girls aged 15 and 17. Child health experts want plain packaging introduced and rules tightened so that vapes can only be advertised as an aid to stopping smoking, rather than as a fun and colourful lifestyle product. ""Vaping is far from risk-free and may be addictive,"" said Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ""We must make efforts to stop children and young people picking up and using these products."" Vapes or e-cigarettes don't contain the harmful tobacco present in normal cigarettes, but they do contain nicotine - the substance which makes people addicted to smoking. They are growing in popularity as an aid for quitting smoking, along with other nicotine replacement products like patches or gum. The Department of Health and Social Care in England says that while they're not risk-free, UK-regulated vapes are far less harmful than smoked tobacco. But it continues to strongly discourage non-smokers and children from using them. UK laws limit how much nicotine and e-liquid is allowed, and health warnings are required on packaging. However, large numbers of vapes which are not designed for the UK market, are being smuggled into the country. ""There's no way of knowing what's in them,"" said Helen Donegan, senior trading standards officer with Leicestershire County Council, who told the BBC that 8,000 illegal vapes had been found at one premises alone. ""They are making them extremely attractive to young people - but they could be inhaling a banned substance."" Some look very similar to big-name vape brands, but are fake - others contain illegal amounts of nicotine and e-liquid. There are strict rules around vapes and e-cigarettes sold in shops in the UK Instead of containing around 600 puffs, which is what UK regulations allow, disposable vape devices containing up to 10,000 puffs are being sold in the UK. Dominic, 17, from Newcastle, has been vaping since he was 15, after switching from smoking when his friends started using vapes: ""Most of my friends vape or smoke - about 90%."" Secondary school teachers are noticing the problem too. A recent survey of 3,000 found half have caught a pupil vaping in school in the last year, and one in five teachers said they'd caught a pupil as young as 11 with a vape. The charity ASH says more should be done to prevent the products being promoted widely on platforms like TikTok. ""The flood of glamorous promotion of vaping on social media is completely inappropriate and social media platforms should take responsibility and turn off the tap,"" said chief executive Deborah Arnott. Colourful disposable vapes are driving the rise in vaping among teenagers, surveys suggest The UK Vaping Industry Association wants the government ""to greatly increase fines to Â£10,000"" every time a shop is caught selling vapes to children. It is also calling for outlets selling vape products to be licensed, and the fee used to fund further trading enforcement efforts by Trading Standards. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said vapes should only be used as a tool for smokers giving up smoking. It said it had put in place ""proportionate regulations for all vape products relating to product safety, labelling and restrictions on advertising"". This means they must not resemble a food or a cosmetic product, and must limit nicotine strength to 20mg/ml. ""We continue to strongly discourage non-smokers and children from using them,"" a spokesperson said. They added there are no current plans to increase the fine issued, but the measure would be kept under review. And the Department for Education said schools had powers under which they could ban vapes, and to confiscate any found on pupils. A government report on vaping among young people and adults in England is due to be published in the coming months. only those aged 18 and over can buy vapes or e-cigarettes certain ingredients, such a caffeine and taurine, are banned nicotine ingredient warnings must appear on packaging packaging should be child-proof all e-cigarette and e-liquids containing nicotine have to be certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before they can be sold in the UK. Search up brands on theMHRA website,external. any product that is not listed should be returned to the shop where it was bought or to your local trading standards office anyone's experience of suspected side-effects from using vapes can be sent to the MHRA via theYellow Card scheme,external nicotine-free e-cigarettes do not have to be certified by the MHRA - they are subject to product safety regulations by Trading Standards Additional reporting by Sarah Rock and Chris Clayton.

Prime minister tells military to 'restore order' in Sri Lanka,"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to ""do whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has declared a state of emergency in the country But he has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"" President Rajapaksa fled overnight on a military jet - accompanied by his wife - days after demonstrators overran his residence He has pledged to stand down on Wednesday amid mass protests over the island's worst economic crisis in decades For months people have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines Thousands have taken to the streets in anger in recent weeks, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation Edited by Alex Therrien and Chris Giles We're pausing our live coverage of Sri Lanka's political and economic crisis. You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory.

Tory MPs start voting in first round of leadership election,"Rishi Sunak leads the first ballot in the Conservative leadership race with 88 votes Penny Mordaunt gets 67 votes and Liz Truss secures 50 votes Nadhim Zahawi and Jeremy Hunt fail to achieve the required 30 votes and exit the contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat are all also among the remaining six candidates going through to another vote tomorrow Earlier Boris Johnson told MPs that he was ""leaving with my head held high"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer attacked tax and spending pledges set out by Tory leadership candidates, but Johnson said their commitments are ""very good"" The government will table a confidence vote in itself - due next week - after blocking a Labour bid Edited by Claudia Allen We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates on what is likely to be another busy day in the leadership contest. Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race. The former equalities minister, who came fourth securing the backing of 40 MPs in today's vote, has justtweeted,externalgratitude for her colleagues' support. ""To win the next election and deliver Conservative solutions to todayâs problems, our party must stand as the party for change,"" she says. ""I have the conviction, the courage, and the clarity of thought to deliver that change."" Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer. Most other Brexiteers have attacked Sunak's record on taxes, but Villiers says the former chancellor is a tax cutter and she has ""real confidence"" he can win the next general election. Chris MasonPolitical editor Team Sunak say ""heâs landed a quarter of the party with eight candidates in the field"". The former chancellor has won 88 of the possible 358 votes in today's opening ballot of Conservative MPs. Tom Tugendhat supporter Damian Green says he is ""absolutely still in this"" and there's ""real momentum there"". ""Tom is offering a clean start,"" he states, and he suspects that Tugendhat - who came fifth in today's ballow with 37 votes - will now pick up some of Jeremy Hunt's supporters. ""Rishi has come ahead,"" he says, and he is the ""most known name in this election,"" he says others are ""scrapping for other slots on the ballot paper"". He says northern MPs are supporting Tom Tugendhat, and ""as the debate continues"" then people will start focusing on whether or not tax cuts ""will be inflationary"", he says. Green says cutting duty on fuel, as Tom Tugendhat proposes, would be anti-inflationary, he says it's ""extraordinary"" that the UK doesn't currently have a long term plan for growth. Another Tugendhat supporter, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says that the MP is putting across a ""positive"" message, and it's still ""all to play for"". Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the
phone in hushed tones outside the result venue. Itâs exactly these kinds of MPs who the remaining candidates
will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm
honouredâ in response to her strong second place. That, and the relatively narrow gap between her and Rishi Sunak are the main headlines from the first vote. One Mordaunt backer in the room said her healthy showing
in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing
suggested Sunakâs lead was hardly overwhelming. Another backing Liz Truss said
it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate. Not changing the ""underlying economic plan"" would mean that the UK can do tax cuts, he adds, ""under the government of Boris Johnson"", but there is ""more headroom to be achieved"" to allow reductions in taxation. People on the right of the party will ""have to think"" about previous statements Penny Mordaunt has made, says Clarke, adding that he himself doesn't agree with Mordaunt on the issue of trans rights and her views on women.

Why is Sri Lanka in crisis?,"The International Monetary Fund is lending Sri Lanka $3bn (Â£2.4bn) to help it deal with its worst economic crisis in its history as an independent nation. Soaring prices, shortages of essential goods and crippling international debts sparked nationwide protests last year which caused the president to flee the country. In early 2022, Sri Lankans started experiencing power cuts and shortages of basics such as fuel. The rate of inflation rose to 50% a year. As a result, protests broke out in the capital Colombo in April that year and spread across the country. The country ran short of fuel for essential services such as buses, trains and medical vehicles because it did not have enough reserves of foreign currency to import any more. The fuel shortage caused petrol and diesel prices to rise dramatically. In June last year, the government banned the sale of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles for two weeks. Sales of fuelremain severely restricted. Schools had to close, and people were asked to work from home to help conserve supplies. Sri Lankan PM tells military to restore order A dramatic day and moment of danger for Sri Lanka Sri Lanka has been unable to buy goods it needs from abroad. And in May 2022 itfailed to make an interest payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. Long queues for fuel - like this one in Colombo - have made normal life impossible This damaged its reputation with lenders, making it even harder to borrow money on the international markets. In the face of massive protests, President Gotabaya Rajapaksaresignedin June last year.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe became acting presidentand declared a nationwide state of emergency across the country. Mr Wickremesinghe has been prime minister six times, without seeing out a full term in office The mass protests have subsided, but the new president is trying to deal with a huge financial crisis. Sri Lanka owes about $7bn (Â£5.7bn) to China and around $1bn to India. Last month, both these countries agreed to restructure their loans, giving Sri Lanka more time to repay them. Thanks to this, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has agreed to lend Sri Lanka $3bn. That is on top of a $600m loan that the World Bank made last year. Sri Lanka's government says it will raise funds to repay its debts by restructuring state-owned enterprises and privatising the national airline. Banging dishes together to protest at the food price hikes. In early 2023 the country introduced income taxes for higher earners, ranging from 12.5% to more than 36%. It also raised other taxes to pay for critical purchases, including fuel and food. The government blamed the Covid pandemic, which badly affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also said tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame Mr Rajapaksa's economic policies. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ends a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades At the end of its civil war in 2009, Sri Lanka chose to focus on providing goods to its domestic market, instead of trying to boost foreign trade. This meant its income from exports to other countries remained low, while the bill for imports kept growing. Sri Lanka now imports $3bn more than it exports every year, and that is why it ran out of foreign currency. At the end of 2019, Sri Lanka had $7.6bn in foreign currency reserves, which have dropped to around $250m. Mr Rajapaksa also introduced big tax cuts in 2019, which lost the government more than $1.4bn a year in revenues. How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains Sri Lanka's suffering was avoidable - bank boss The switch to organic fertilisers resulted in widespread crop failure, exacerbating foreign currency shortages When Sri Lanka's foreign currency shortages became a serious problem in early 2021, its government tried to tackle the issue by banning imports of chemical fertilisers. It told farmers to use locally sourced organic fertilisers, instead. This led to widespread crop failures. Sri Lanka had to supplement its food stocks from abroad, which made its foreign currency shortage even worse.

Daily heartbreak in a bankrupt country,"Life has become a long queue for Sri Lankans - the lack of cash means fuel, food and other basics are in short supply In Sri Lanka right now, before you've woken up, you're losing. Power cuts that run late into the sweltering nights steal hours of sleep as the fans cease; whole families waking up sapped from the months-long trial of shuffling their lives around daily blackouts after the country went bankrupt and essentially ran out of fuel. There are long days to be lived; work days, errands to be run, daily essentials to be bought at twice the price they had been last month. All this, you're starting a little more broken than you were last week. Once you've had breakfast - eating less than you used to, or perhaps nothing at all - the battle to find transport beckons. There have been long queues for fuel for months - now it's all but run out In the cities, fuel queues curl around entire suburbs like gargantuan metal pythons, growing longer and fatter by the day, choking roads and crushing livelihoods. Tuk-tuk drivers with their eight-litre tanks are forced to spend days lining up before they can run hires again, for 48 hours perhaps, before they are forced to rejoin the queue, bringing pillows, changes of clothes and water to see them through the ordeal. Drivers have taken to sleeping in their vehicles as they wait For a while, middle- and upper-class folk had brought meal packets and soft drinks for those queuing in their neighbourhoods. Lately, the cost of food, of cooking gas, of clothes, transport, and even what electricity the state will allow you to have, has sky-rocketed so egregiously as the rupee's value plummeted, that even largesse from the moneyed has been in short supply. People here are waiting in line in Colombo for kerosene to cook with In working-class neighbourhoods, families have begun to band together around wood fire stoves, to prepare the simplest of meals - rice, and coconut sambol. Even dhal, a staple of the diet all over South Asia, has become a luxury. Meat? At three times the price it used to be? Forget it. Fresh fish was once abundant and affordable. Now, boats can't go out to sea, because there is no diesel. The fishermen that can go out sell their catch at vastly inflated rates to hotels and restaurants out of reach to most. Many others have taken to using firewood as an alternative to gas Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is now president. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. A majority of Sri Lankan children have now been forced to subsist on a diet with almost no protein. This is a crisis that has hit on every level from the macroeconomic to the molecular. Are children's brains, their organs, their muscles, their bones, getting what is required? Milk powder, most of which is imported, has barely been seen on market shelves for months. The UN is now warning of malnutrition and a humanitarian crisis. For many here, the crisis has been roiling for months. Trains are more and more crowded - but getting on them is a nightmare... Those who can find rides generally commute on buses and train carriages bursting with evermore passengers. Young men cling for their lives on the footboards, while the mashed throng inside gasps for air. ... many cling on outside For decades Sri Lanka has failed to invest appropriately in its public transport, while the island's wealthier residents continued to complain about the indiscipline of bus and trishaw drivers. There is a growing view that it's this perceived disdain for regular people from both the political and financial elites that has brought the nation to its knees. And yet it's the lower-middle and working classes that must bear the worst of the economic collapse. 'Living in my car for two days to buy fuel' Sri Lanka: 'I canât afford milk for my babies' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? How war heroes became villains Private hospitals continue to function, albeit less well than they used to. In North Central Anuradhapura, a 16-year old who had suffered a snakebite died as his father rushed desperately from pharmacy to pharmacy to look for the anti-venom the public hospital had run out of. The healthcare sector can no longer afford many lifesaving medicines. In May, a jaundiced two-day-old died after her parents could not find a trishaw to take her to hospital. As economists have pointed out, it is the sweeping tax cuts of 2019 - lobbied for and cheered on by many corporate and professional groups - that contributed to emptying Sri Lanka's coffers, and helped bring the nation to this brink. On the black market, fuel can still be bought at vastly inflated prices, some of it to run the larger private vehicles, and home electricity generators. Lower down the economic ladder, people attempt to buy bicycles to make trips into work, and find the exchange rate has put even that form of transport out of reach. A man on a bicycle carries an empty cooking gas cylinder - Colombo's roads are almost deserted It had been the worst of the power cuts that set off Colombo's major protests, late in March. Back then, the 13-hour daily outages had left a nation exhausted in the hottest weeks of the year. That fatigue had sparked widespread fury, and a crowd of thousands descended on the eastern Colombo suburb of Mirihana, where the president resides. Of all the demonstrations in the country over the past year, this was perhaps the most visceral. A man in a motorcycle helmet made a speech railing at the political forces, clergy and media that had delivered the nation into the hands of what was now widely perceived as simultaneously the most self-serving and inept government here in generations. Later, that man, Sudara Nadeesh, was beaten brutally by the police and arrested, along with several dozen others who suffered the same violent fate. Sri Lanka had been strung up in a 26-year civil war, but even through that unspeakably violent stretch, the island has never had a president so close to the military's top brass as former defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The south has found out in the past few months, what northerners have known for decades: dissent is routinely met with state violence. In recent monthslargely peaceful protesters have had live rounds shot into their midst, tear gas has been indiscriminately fired at crowds in which small children were present. In queues for essentials, the mildest shows of displeasure have been met with brutal beatings. The police have been criticised for using disproportionate force against largely peaceful protests Police say some officers suffered injuries when stones were thrown, but as protesters have lost lives, or ended up in hospital, the police response has been viewed as being wildly disproportionate. On social media, politicians offer sympathy, posting photos of the public's hardship while asking for change. This has mostly only inspired more outrage. Was it not the politicians who led us here? And yet, while nationwide protests have called for the removal of the president and his cohort, they remain obstinately in place, their perceived disdain for the public's will evident in the backroom deals that many feel continue to poison the island's politics. The same leaders accused of crashing Sri Lanka into this ravine insist that only they can lift the island out again, and the policies they devise are met with sharp criticism. There is now a concerted push, for example, to send more Sri Lankans overseas to work as housemaids, drivers and mechanics in the Middle East, with those emigrants expected to send their earnings home. This may only deepen the hardship of many of its most vulnerable citizens, as poor Sri Lankans with no hope of finding local employment are forced to leave their families for nations in which they have few protections and little agency. One anthropologist online described this vision for Sri Lanka in stark terms: ""the vampire state"". What the future holds for Sri Lanka - no one can say with certainty By evening in Sri Lanka's crisis, you're drained beyond imagination. Beyond the almost impossible commute because of the lack of petrol and diesel, the everyday functioning of a workplace has itself become a relentless onslaught of crises, with supply chains having broken down, most potential customers having long since refused to spend on anything but essentials, and staff failing to show up. Then late-night power cuts come again, and you survive on lighter evening meals with each passing week, unable to buy enough food for your home, unable to cook what little you've bought, unable to give your parents their medication, or your children the education they deserve. Schools are presently shut, as there is no fuel to take them. Classes are online for the third year running. The government continually fails to deliver what little it's promised, relatives and neighbours call to ask for money you don't have to spare, the police and military bear down on what little hope remains, and through all this you're still grateful, because many around you have it so much worse. Last week, a mother threw herself and her two children into a river. Every day, a fresh heartbreak. Andrew Fidel Fernando is an award-winning author and journalist, based in Sri Lanka.

Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory.

How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory. Welcome - here is a recap of the dayâs events in Sri Lanka, where it's approaching 18:00. Â© 2025 BBC.

He said being put forward was ""very humbling"" and meant the bond he had with the city would ""stay forever"". Actress Sue Johnston, who starred in The Royle Family, Downton Abbey and Brookside, will also be nominated for the same honour at the meeting. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said Klopp would be joining Liverpool legendsSir Kenny DalglishandSteve Gerrardin receiving the honour.

""I also know that Sir Kenny has received the freedom of the city previously, so if my name is listed alongside those and all of the other recipients, that makes the honour even more special,"" he said. ""I have to be honest, when I first heard this news I had to take a minute to take it in. ""As you can imagine, I get a lot of different types of news in my job, but this was definitely a wow moment."" He added that it felt special because of what ""Liverpool, the city and its wonderful people, mean to me and my family"". ""The welcome that we have been given has been unbelievable from the word go, so to get this kind of recognition is incredible. ""It is also very humbling.""

Tory leadership rivals battle to secure MPs' votes,"Tory leadership hopefuls face a nervous wait after their colleagues finished their first round of voting in the contest for No 10. The eight candidates who have made it onto the ballot paper need to secure at least 30 votes to stay in the race to become prime minister. A result from the secret ballot is expected around 17.00 BST. Those who make it through will face further votes in the coming days to narrow the field down to a final two. It comes after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becomes the latest MP to hold an event to launch her leadership campaign. She joins Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi on the ballot, as all have secured the required 20 nominations from Tory MPs to make it into the first round. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax With campaigning stepping up a gear, Ms Mordaunt pledged to slash VAT on fuel and raise income tax thresholds. Setting out her stall at a hot, crowded launch event, she also promised parents more flexibility over subsidised childcare and said she would give MPs control over ""social capital pots"" to spend on their local areas. Pitching herself as a team player, she said if she won office she would introduce a ""tighter"" cabinet of ministers with powers across Whitehall. This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt plans to modernise a 'broken' Whitehall Adding that the Conservative Party had ""lost its sense of self"", she also vowed to return to the values of ""small state, low tax, personal responsibility"". Ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid and junior minister Rehman Chishti have dropped out of the race, after failing to pick up enough support. The 30 vote threshold - which has beenintroduced to quickly narrow the field- could see a number of further candidates knocked out. Candidates will also appear at two further hustings events on Wednesday, as the race to secure endorsements heats up. It comes as: Former chancellor Mr Sunak, who has the strongest backing among Tory MPs so far, secured support from cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Grant Shapps Foreign Secretary Ms Truss bagged endorsements from cabinet ministers and Johnson loyalists Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries Mr Hunt's campaign rejected an accusation from Ms Dorries that Mr Sunak's team lent nominations, to make sure he got onto the ballot paper Former foreign secretary Mr Hunt, who has not had a launch event, said he was ""quietly confident"" he would make it through the first round of voting The campaign so far has laid bare Tory divisions over taxation, with a number of candidates attacking the rise in taxes under Mr Sunak's chancellorship. All the contenders are pledging to bring in immediate tax cuts if they win, apart from Mr Sunak who says cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Among those promising to reduce taxes, there aredivisions over which taxes should be cut, and how quickly. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Sunak said tackling inflation is his ""number one economic priority"", and claimed former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an icon on the right of the party, would have backed his approach. But on of Ms Truss's backers, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked his record at the Treasury, telling Sky News the ""tax-increasing chancellor"" had made decisions ""of the left rather than on the right"". And he sought to disparage Leave-voting Mr Sunak's Brexit credentials, branding him an ""ostensible Brexiteer"" whose department had resisted ending the ""supremacy of EU law"" during his tenure. The competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported former candidate Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. Read more from Chris Boris Johnson, who has declined to endorse any of the candidates, said any of them would ""wipe the floor"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he branded ""Captain Crasheroony Snoozefest"". Appearing at his first Prime Minister's Questions since the cabinet mutiny last week that forced his resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""proud"" of his record at No 10 and would leave office ""with my head held high"". But Sir Keir shot back that the Tory leadership candidates ""haven't found time to explain"" their various tax cuts, which he said would cost Â£300bn. The Labour leader accused the contenders of attempting to ""rewrite history"" over the government's record on taxation, and acting like they had ""just arrived from the moon"". His questions were aimed, in particular, at the current and previous chancellors, Mr Zahawi and Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, the government has scheduled a vote of no confidence in itself next week, amid a row over whether Mr Johnson should be able to stay in office until his successor is chosen. Labour had tabled a motion of no confidence in both the government and PM earlier this week - butministers blocked it, arguing the wording breached parliamentary convention. The government has now tabled a motion of its own, which it is likely to win, in the hope of closing off further attempts to prevent Mr Johnson staying on. In a last-ditch bid to set up a specific vote on Mr Johnson's future, the Liberal Democrats have said they will table an amendment to the motion. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether it is voted on. Tory MPs are aiming to whittle down the candidates to a final two before Parliament's summer break begins at the end of next week. About 160,000 members of the Conservative Party will then choose between these final two, with the winner due to be announced on 5 September.

Where do Tory candidates stand on indyref2?Here is what each of the eight candidates still in the race say about Scottish independence.Scotland politics,"Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are the candidates who will compete for Conservative Party membership votes in the coming weeks Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are thefinal candidates to be the next leader of the Conservative partyand prime minister of the UK. They now face a vote of Tory party members, and whoever wins when the result is announced on 5 September will immediately face demands from the SNP for an independence referendum to be held in October next year. Here is a what each has had to say about Scotland. Rishi Sunak: ""There is nothing more Conservative than our precious union."" The former Chancellor's resignation alongside Health Secretary Sajid Javid played a key role in the collapse of support for Boris Johnson within the government. Mr Sunak was an early frontrunner in the race to replace Mr Johnson, with his Ready for Rishi campaign being publicly backed by more Conservative MPs than any other candidate. However he has pitched himself as the underdog in the ballot of Tory members. His campaign has stressed the UK-wide interventions he made as Chancellor, particularly during the pandemic and in distributing levelling-up funds. The Richmond MP has also focused on future general elections, claiming that other candidates could lose to Labour and ""allow the SNP into power via the back door"". He has pledged to ""rule out holding another divisive Scottish independence referendum"", arguing that people want politicians to focus on the cost of living crisis, energy security and economic growth rather than the constitution. And he says he would aim to bring the whole of the UK closer together rather than indulging in ""political point-scoring"" if he becomes PM. Scottish Conservatives seek âdrama-freeâ new PM Mr Sunak said he wanted to lead a UK government ""willing to roll up their sleeves and get stuck into creating jobs, growth and prosperity in all corners of the UK, from Llandudno to Perth, Belfast to Birmingham"". This would involve the London administration getting more involved in making spending decisions across the UK, which he said would ""abandon the Westminster 'devolve and forget' mentality and become the most active UK-wide government in decades"". He said he would reconstitute the Downing Street ""union unit"", bringing together different departments to make sure their policies UK-wide. However, this has led to accusations from the SNP of a power grab of devolved responsibilities, with Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""dangerous proposition"". Mr Sunak said: ""There is nothing more Conservative than our precious union, and everything great that we have achieved we have done so as one family. ""For all of these reasons, my government will do anything and everything to protect, sustain and strengthen it."" In 2020, Mr Sunak denied claims published in the FT newspaper that he had once told a Conservative colleague that it would be in England's best financial interests to break away from the UK. Liz Truss, the MP for South West Norfolk, describes herself as a ""child of the union"" The foreign secretary stayed on in Boris Johnson's government while others resigned, and has secured support from Tory MPs loyal to the prime minister including Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries. She is seen as representing the right of the party, and has based her leadership bid on the promise of immediate tax cuts and a longer-term drive to reduce the size of the state. The view of her as a ""continuity candidate"" is underlined by the fact her slogan has been ""delivery, delivery, delivery"", stressing achievements in government rather than the need for change that others have promoted. While Mr Sunak won more backing from MPs, Ms Truss is a heavy favourite with bookmakers to triumph in the vote of Conservative members. She also has more support from Conservative MSPs, after a group of nine penned a joint letter in the Times endorsing her candidacy. Truss: Best to ignore attention-seeking Sturgeon Ms Truss lived in Paisley as a child, where she attended West Primary School and once played the role of Margaret Thatcher in a class hustings ahead of the 1983 general election. Shetold the Scotsman,externalthat she got zero votes, adding: ""I didn't even vote for myself. Even at that age we knew it was simply unpopular to be a Tory in the West of Scotland."" But she has said that the Conservatives ""wouldn't have the ideas, the leaders or the legacy we have today"" without Scots. The South West Norfolk MP describes herself as a ""child of the union"", adding that ""I really believe we're a family and we're better together"". On independence, Ms Truss has said she would not support a fresh vote, saying ""no, no, no"" at a hustings event in Exeter, She has repeatedly said that the SNP had described the last referendum in 2014 as ""once in a generation"", adding: ""I don't think we're through that generation yet."" And she has been critical of the first minister, saying: ""I think the best thing to do with Nicola Sturgeon is ignore her. ""She's an attention seeker, that's what she is. ""What we need to do is show the people of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales what we're delivering for them and making sure that all of our government policies apply right across the United Kingdom.""

Twitter sues Elon Musk over $44bn takeover deal,"Twitter is suing billionaire Elon Musk to try to force him to buy the social media firm, setting up a legal battle with the world's richest man. It comes after Mr Musk announced he waswalking away from his proposed $44bn (Â£37bn) takeoverof Twitter on Friday. He claimed Twitter had not given information about the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. Now Twitter has asked a Delaware court to order Mr Musk to complete the merger at the agreed $54.20 per Twitter share. ""Having mounted a public spectacle to put Twitter in play, and having proposed and then signed a seller-friendly merger agreement, [Mr] Musk apparently believes that he - unlike every other party subject to Delaware contract law - is free to change his mind, trash the company, disrupt its operations, destroy stockholder value, and walk away,"" said the lawsuit. The lawsuit went on to accuse Mr Musk of ""a long list"" of violations of the merger agreement that ""have cast a pall over Twitter and its business"". Twitter chairman Bret Taylortweeted,externalthat the microblogging site wanted ""to hold Elon Musk accountable to his contractual obligations"". Mr Musktweeted,externalon Tuesday: ""Oh the irony lol [laughing out loud]."" The lawsuit said Mr Musk, who is also boss of electric car company Tesla, had backed out of the deal because it ""no longer serves his personal interests"". The lawsuit said that after Mr Musk agreed to the deal, the stock market fell, along with Tesla shares. ""The value of Mr Musk's stake in Tesla, the anchor of his personal wealth, has declined by more than $100bn from its November 2021 peak. So [Mr] Musk wants out,"" it said. ""Rather than bear the cost of the market downturn, as the merger agreement requires, [Mr] Musk wants to shift it to Twitter's stockholders,"" it added. Who is Elon Musk? Why did Musk get cold feet on Twitter? Twitter's share price has fallen more than 8% in the past month, and in May tumbled from highs of more than $50 per share, as Mr Musk questioned the number of fake and spam accounts on Twitter and said the deal was ""temporarily on hold"". On Friday, Mr Musk said he was pulling out of the deal, claiming a lack of information about spam accounts and inaccurate representations amounted to a ""material adverse event"". He also said Twitter sacking executives meant it was not living up to its obligations. In response, Twitter said it planned to pursue legal action to enforce the agreement, saying it was ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk"". The original merger agreement includes a $1bn break-up fee. Elon Musk is a man who is being dragged, reluctantly, up the aisle. The lawsuit uses the word ""consummation"" 55 times. Mr Musk says he no longer wants to buy the company. But in contract law, that's easier said than done. In reality he has already entered into a legally binding agreement with Twitter which may be difficult to unpick. And this lawsuit confirms that Twitter is hellbent on forcing the marriage to go ahead. The price Mr Musk agreed to pay for the company is considerably more than its current valuation. It's now down to Mr Musk to prove that Twitter is in breach of contract - a tough ask. The world's richest person is now faced with the bizarre prospect of having to buy a company he doesn't want to acquire. There are other possible outcomes here too. Mr Musk could of course win, which would be a devastating blow for the social media firm. But this could also be the first move in a game of chess, an analogy that Elon Musk seeminglyreferenced in a tweet last week,external. Twitter could be pushing for a settlement, a lump sum for them to agree to walk away. Mr Musk could also be looking for a revised, better price for Twitter. But whatever happens Elon Musk, by getting a little too close to Twitter, has tied himself in legal knots. Mr Musk, a self-described ""free speech absolutist"", had pledged to loosen Twitter's content moderation rules once the company was under his ownership. He has been a vocal critic of Twitter banning some accounts, such as that of former US President Donald Trump. Mr Musk has also called for more transparency over how the platform presents tweets to users - a system that currently allows some to be promoted and given wider audiences. Twitter shares rose by more than 4% in New York on Tuesday and added 1% in after-hours trade. However the shares are still around $20 lower than Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20.

Sir Mo relieved Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.,"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing. It's a form of therapy."" Sir Mo Farah reveals he was trafficked to UK as child Sir Mo praised for trafficking disclosure Sir Mo describes being reunited with his mum Legally, the government can remove a person's British nationality if their citizenship was obtained through fraud. But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know. I'm not in touch with her and I don't want to be."" You can watch The Real Mo Farah on BBC One at 21:00 BST oron BBC iPlayerat 06:00 BST on Wednesday 13 July (UK only).

Candidates fight for MPs' votes ahead of Tory ballot later,"Rishi Sunak leads the first ballot in the Conservative leadership race with 88 votes Penny Mordaunt gets 67 votes and Liz Truss secures 50 votes Nadhim Zahawi and Jeremy Hunt fail to achieve the required 30 votes and exit the contest Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat are all also among the remaining six candidates going through to another vote tomorrow Earlier Boris Johnson told MPs that he was ""leaving with my head held high"" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer attacked tax and spending pledges set out by Tory leadership candidates, but Johnson said their commitments are ""very good"" The government will table a confidence vote in itself - due next week - after blocking a Labour bid Edited by Claudia Allen We'll be back tomorrow with the latest updates on what is likely to be another busy day in the leadership contest. Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race. The former equalities minister, who came fourth securing the backing of 40 MPs in today's vote, has justtweeted,externalgratitude for her colleagues' support. ""To win the next election and deliver Conservative solutions to todayâs problems, our party must stand as the party for change,"" she says. ""I have the conviction, the courage, and the clarity of thought to deliver that change."" Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer. Most other Brexiteers have attacked Sunak's record on taxes, but Villiers says the former chancellor is a tax cutter and she has ""real confidence"" he can win the next general election. Chris MasonPolitical editor Team Sunak say ""heâs landed a quarter of the party with eight candidates in the field"". The former chancellor has won 88 of the possible 358 votes in today's opening ballot of Conservative MPs. Tom Tugendhat supporter Damian Green says he is ""absolutely still in this"" and there's ""real momentum there"". ""Tom is offering a clean start,"" he states, and he suspects that Tugendhat - who came fifth in today's ballow with 37 votes - will now pick up some of Jeremy Hunt's supporters. ""Rishi has come ahead,"" he says, and he is the ""most known name in this election,"" he says others are ""scrapping for other slots on the ballot paper"". He says northern MPs are supporting Tom Tugendhat, and ""as the debate continues"" then people will start focusing on whether or not tax cuts ""will be inflationary"", he says. Green says cutting duty on fuel, as Tom Tugendhat proposes, would be anti-inflationary, he says it's ""extraordinary"" that the UK doesn't currently have a long term plan for growth. Another Tugendhat supporter, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says that the MP is putting across a ""positive"" message, and it's still ""all to play for"". Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the
phone in hushed tones outside the result venue. Itâs exactly these kinds of MPs who the remaining candidates
will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm
honouredâ in response to her strong second place. That, and the relatively narrow gap between her and Rishi Sunak are the main headlines from the first vote. One Mordaunt backer in the room said her healthy showing
in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing
suggested Sunakâs lead was hardly overwhelming. Another backing Liz Truss said
it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate. Not changing the ""underlying economic plan"" would mean that the UK can do tax cuts, he adds, ""under the government of Boris Johnson"", but there is ""more headroom to be achieved"" to allow reductions in taxation. People on the right of the party will ""have to think"" about previous statements Penny Mordaunt has made, says Clarke, adding that he himself doesn't agree with Mordaunt on the issue of trans rights and her views on women. Here's the moment that the MPs vying to become the next prime minister learned their fate. Sir Graham Brady read out the results of the ballot of Conservative MPs.

State of emergency in Sri Lanka as protesters tear-gassed,"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to ""do whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has declared a state of emergency in the country But he has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"" President Rajapaksa fled overnight on a military jet - accompanied by his wife - days after demonstrators overran his residence He has pledged to stand down on Wednesday amid mass protests over the island's worst economic crisis in decades For months people have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines Thousands have taken to the streets in anger in recent weeks, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation Edited by Alex Therrien and Chris Giles We're pausing our live coverage of Sri Lanka's political and economic crisis. You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory. Welcome - here is a recap of the dayâs events in Sri Lanka, where it's approaching 18:00. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tory MPs to begin voting in leadership race,"Tory leadership hopefuls face a nervous wait after their colleagues finished their first round of voting in the contest for No 10. The eight candidates who have made it onto the ballot paper need to secure at least 30 votes to stay in the race to become prime minister. A result from the secret ballot is expected around 17.00 BST. Those who make it through will face further votes in the coming days to narrow the field down to a final two. It comes after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becomes the latest MP to hold an event to launch her leadership campaign. She joins Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi on the ballot, as all have secured the required 20 nominations from Tory MPs to make it into the first round. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax With campaigning stepping up a gear, Ms Mordaunt pledged to slash VAT on fuel and raise income tax thresholds. Setting out her stall at a hot, crowded launch event, she also promised parents more flexibility over subsidised childcare and said she would give MPs control over ""social capital pots"" to spend on their local areas. Pitching herself as a team player, she said if she won office she would introduce a ""tighter"" cabinet of ministers with powers across Whitehall. This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt plans to modernise a 'broken' Whitehall Adding that the Conservative Party had ""lost its sense of self"", she also vowed to return to the values of ""small state, low tax, personal responsibility"". Ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid and junior minister Rehman Chishti have dropped out of the race, after failing to pick up enough support. The 30 vote threshold - which has beenintroduced to quickly narrow the field- could see a number of further candidates knocked out. Candidates will also appear at two further hustings events on Wednesday, as the race to secure endorsements heats up. It comes as: Former chancellor Mr Sunak, who has the strongest backing among Tory MPs so far, secured support from cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Grant Shapps Foreign Secretary Ms Truss bagged endorsements from cabinet ministers and Johnson loyalists Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries Mr Hunt's campaign rejected an accusation from Ms Dorries that Mr Sunak's team lent nominations, to make sure he got onto the ballot paper Former foreign secretary Mr Hunt, who has not had a launch event, said he was ""quietly confident"" he would make it through the first round of voting The campaign so far has laid bare Tory divisions over taxation, with a number of candidates attacking the rise in taxes under Mr Sunak's chancellorship. All the contenders are pledging to bring in immediate tax cuts if they win, apart from Mr Sunak who says cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Among those promising to reduce taxes, there aredivisions over which taxes should be cut, and how quickly. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Sunak said tackling inflation is his ""number one economic priority"", and claimed former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an icon on the right of the party, would have backed his approach. But on of Ms Truss's backers, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked his record at the Treasury, telling Sky News the ""tax-increasing chancellor"" had made decisions ""of the left rather than on the right"". And he sought to disparage Leave-voting Mr Sunak's Brexit credentials, branding him an ""ostensible Brexiteer"" whose department had resisted ending the ""supremacy of EU law"" during his tenure. The competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported former candidate Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. Read more from Chris Boris Johnson, who has declined to endorse any of the candidates, said any of them would ""wipe the floor"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he branded ""Captain Crasheroony Snoozefest"". Appearing at his first Prime Minister's Questions since the cabinet mutiny last week that forced his resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""proud"" of his record at No 10 and would leave office ""with my head held high"". But Sir Keir shot back that the Tory leadership candidates ""haven't found time to explain"" their various tax cuts, which he said would cost Â£300bn. The Labour leader accused the contenders of attempting to ""rewrite history"" over the government's record on taxation, and acting like they had ""just arrived from the moon"". His questions were aimed, in particular, at the current and previous chancellors, Mr Zahawi and Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, the government has scheduled a vote of no confidence in itself next week, amid a row over whether Mr Johnson should be able to stay in office until his successor is chosen. Labour had tabled a motion of no confidence in both the government and PM earlier this week - butministers blocked it, arguing the wording breached parliamentary convention. The government has now tabled a motion of its own, which it is likely to win, in the hope of closing off further attempts to prevent Mr Johnson staying on. In a last-ditch bid to set up a specific vote on Mr Johnson's future, the Liberal Democrats have said they will table an amendment to the motion. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether it is voted on. Tory MPs are aiming to whittle down the candidates to a final two before Parliament's summer break begins at the end of next week. About 160,000 members of the Conservative Party will then choose between these final two, with the winner due to be announced on 5 September.

"Sir Mo relieved Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.UKUK economy grows more than expected in MayThe economy grew by 0.5% in May, higher than economists had predicted.Business","This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing.

But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know.

"UK economy grows more than expected in MayThe economy grew by 0.5% in May, higher than economists had predicted.Business","The UK economy rebounded in May after shrinking in April and March, official figures show. The economy grew by 0.5% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, higher than the flat growth most economists expected. Every area of the economy expanded including construction, travel and manufacturing. However, businesses reported that higher running costs had led to them to put up prices for customers. And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, there is ""still a real risk"" that the economy could fall into a recession, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""That may mean the economy proves to be a poisoned chalice for whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister,"" he added. Conservative MPs will cast their first votes in the leadership contest on Wednesday, but whoever replaces Boris Johnson is faced with the dilemma of how to tackle the soaring cost of living. What is GDP and how does it affect me? UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Both businesses and households are being hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May, and is expected to reach 11% later this year. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%, ""no ifs or buts"". It has raised rates five times since December and is expected to put them up again next month.  He has indicted the Bank will ""act forcefully"" suggesting it could raise rates by more than 0.25%. The rise in the cost of living has led to unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, such as the railways, have seen workers strike over pay. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the UK economy had ""rebounded"" in May - with growth across the main sectors, including construction which saw a rise in housebuilding and office refurbishments. ""Health was the biggest driver with many more people seeing GPs, despite test and trace and the vaccination programmes winding down,"" he added. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the activity of companies, the state and individuals in an economy. Part of how GDP is calculated includes measuring the total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction - but also health services and the government, In the health sector, we don't pay for services through the NHS, so one gauge of how it is faring is the number of GP appointments which gives an indication of how that bit of the economy is doing. Mr Morgan added that road haulage also had a ""busy"" May, while travel agencies saw a jump in demand as people booked summer holidays. However, while the economy grew, many businesses reported that an increase in fuel and electricity costs had forced them to put up their prices for customers. The UK's statistics body also cited price increases for metals, some foods, including fish, and other staples. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon warned on Wednesday that its annual losses will be bigger than expected after ramping up wages to attract staff and spending heavily on repairs and marketing. Although sales were now matching those seen in 2019, before the pandemic struck, it said staff costs were far higher than pre-Covid, as firms across the sector had to hike wages to overcome staff shortages. The new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi - who is in the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister - said it was ""great"" to see the economy growing, but added that he knew people were concerned by rising prices. ""We're working alongside the Bank of England to bear down on inflation and I am confident we can create a stronger economy for everyone across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi said. But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said economic growth was ""still far too slow"". ""Instead of presenting the plans we need for a stronger, more secure economy, the Tories are spending every waking minute indulging in unfunded fantasy economics,"" she added. The British economy returned to solid growth in May, up by 0.5%, defying fears of a month of stagnation. The services sector drove half the growth, in particular health services, including GP appointments. Monthly figures are volatile, but thanks to some upward earlier revisions, growth over the three months to May was 0.4%. However, consumers showed signs of being squeezed by the cost of living - with wholesale and retail dragging down the economy in May. The ONS also said respondents to its surveys reported that they were passing on price increases to consumers including fuel, electricity, nickel, cobalt, aluminium, steel, paper, fish and cooking oil. The figures raise some hope of the economy avoiding a feared recession. But many expect the economy to have fallen back again in June. The figures for the full second quarter are released next month. In June, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) warned the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year, and will stagnate next year as consumers rein in their spending and commodity prices remain high. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the UK will be the slowest growing economy among the world's largest economies in 2023. David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said May's growth was ""welcome news"", but ""masks serious underlying issues of growing imbalances within the economy"". He said that ""worryingly"" its recent survey showed that longer term business confidence had begun to fall. ""The present political instability will have only exacerbated uncertainty among small firms,"" he said. ""Alongside this, the economy is still facing massive structural issues - including uncertainty about the UK's relationship with the EU, continued Covid lockdowns in China, supply chain breakdowns and rocketing energy costs.""

State of emergency in Sri Lanka as protesters tear gassed,"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has told the military to ""do whatever is necessary to restore order"" after protesters stormed his office Wickremesinghe has been appointed acting president by outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa and has declared a state of emergency in the country But he has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"" President Rajapaksa fled overnight on a military jet - accompanied by his wife - days after demonstrators overran his residence He has pledged to stand down on Wednesday amid mass protests over the island's worst economic crisis in decades For months people have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines Thousands have taken to the streets in anger in recent weeks, with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation Edited by Alex Therrien and Chris Giles We're pausing our live coverage of Sri Lanka's political and economic crisis. You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory. Welcome - here is a recap of the dayâs events in Sri Lanka, where it's approaching 18:00. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tory leadership rivals battle to secure MPs' votesThe eight contenders need 30 votes from Tory MPs to stay in the race to replace Boris Johnson.UK PoliticsSir Mo relieved Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.UK,"Tory leadership hopefuls face a nervous wait after their colleagues finished their first round of voting in the contest for No 10. The eight candidates who have made it onto the ballot paper need to secure at least 30 votes to stay in the race to become prime minister. A result from the secret ballot is expected around 17.00 BST. Those who make it through will face further votes in the coming days to narrow the field down to a final two. It comes after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becomes the latest MP to hold an event to launch her leadership campaign. She joins Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi on the ballot, as all have secured the required 20 nominations from Tory MPs to make it into the first round. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax With campaigning stepping up a gear, Ms Mordaunt pledged to slash VAT on fuel and raise income tax thresholds. Setting out her stall at a hot, crowded launch event, she also promised parents more flexibility over subsidised childcare and said she would give MPs control over ""social capital pots"" to spend on their local areas. Pitching herself as a team player, she said if she won office she would introduce a ""tighter"" cabinet of ministers with powers across Whitehall. This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt plans to modernise a 'broken' Whitehall Adding that the Conservative Party had ""lost its sense of self"", she also vowed to return to the values of ""small state, low tax, personal responsibility"". Ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid and junior minister Rehman Chishti have dropped out of the race, after failing to pick up enough support. The 30 vote threshold - which has beenintroduced to quickly narrow the field- could see a number of further candidates knocked out. Candidates will also appear at two further hustings events on Wednesday, as the race to secure endorsements heats up. It comes as: Former chancellor Mr Sunak, who has the strongest backing among Tory MPs so far, secured support from cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Grant Shapps Foreign Secretary Ms Truss bagged endorsements from cabinet ministers and Johnson loyalists Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries Mr Hunt's campaign rejected an accusation from Ms Dorries that Mr Sunak's team lent nominations, to make sure he got onto the ballot paper Former foreign secretary Mr Hunt, who has not had a launch event, said he was ""quietly confident"" he would make it through the first round of voting The campaign so far has laid bare Tory divisions over taxation, with a number of candidates attacking the rise in taxes under Mr Sunak's chancellorship. All the contenders are pledging to bring in immediate tax cuts if they win, apart from Mr Sunak who says cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Among those promising to reduce taxes, there aredivisions over which taxes should be cut, and how quickly. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Sunak said tackling inflation is his ""number one economic priority"", and claimed former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an icon on the right of the party, would have backed his approach. But on of Ms Truss's backers, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked his record at the Treasury, telling Sky News the ""tax-increasing chancellor"" had made decisions ""of the left rather than on the right"". And he sought to disparage Leave-voting Mr Sunak's Brexit credentials, branding him an ""ostensible Brexiteer"" whose department had resisted ending the ""supremacy of EU law"" during his tenure. The competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported former candidate Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. Read more from Chris Boris Johnson, who has declined to endorse any of the candidates, said any of them would ""wipe the floor"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he branded ""Captain Crasheroony Snoozefest"". Appearing at his first Prime Minister's Questions since the cabinet mutiny last week that forced his resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""proud"" of his record at No 10 and would leave office ""with my head held high"". But Sir Keir shot back that the Tory leadership candidates ""haven't found time to explain"" their various tax cuts, which he said would cost Â£300bn. The Labour leader accused the contenders of attempting to ""rewrite history"" over the government's record on taxation, and acting like they had ""just arrived from the moon"". His questions were aimed, in particular, at the current and previous chancellors, Mr Zahawi and Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, the government has scheduled a vote of no confidence in itself next week, amid a row over whether Mr Johnson should be able to stay in office until his successor is chosen. Labour had tabled a motion of no confidence in both the government and PM earlier this week - butministers blocked it, arguing the wording breached parliamentary convention. The government has now tabled a motion of its own, which it is likely to win, in the hope of closing off further attempts to prevent Mr Johnson staying on. In a last-ditch bid to set up a specific vote on Mr Johnson's future, the Liberal Democrats have said they will table an amendment to the motion. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether it is voted on. Tory MPs are aiming to whittle down the candidates to a final two before Parliament's summer break begins at the end of next week. About 160,000 members of the Conservative Party will then choose between these final two, with the winner due to be announced on 5 September.

Sir Mo relieved Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing. It's a form of therapy."" Sir Mo Farah reveals he was trafficked to UK as child Sir Mo praised for trafficking disclosure Sir Mo describes being reunited with his mum Legally, the government can remove a person's British nationality if their citizenship was obtained through fraud. But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know.

UK economy grows more than expected in May,"The UK economy rebounded in May after shrinking in April and March, official figures show. The economy grew by 0.5% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, higher than the flat growth most economists expected. Every area of the economy expanded including construction, travel and manufacturing. However, businesses reported that higher running costs had led to them to put up prices for customers. And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, there is ""still a real risk"" that the economy could fall into a recession, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""That may mean the economy proves to be a poisoned chalice for whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister,"" he added. Conservative MPs will cast their first votes in the leadership contest on Wednesday, but whoever replaces Boris Johnson is faced with the dilemma of how to tackle the soaring cost of living. What is GDP and how does it affect me? UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Both businesses and households are being hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May, and is expected to reach 11% later this year. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%, ""no ifs or buts"". It has raised rates five times since December and is expected to put them up again next month.  He has indicted the Bank will ""act forcefully"" suggesting it could raise rates by more than 0.25%. The rise in the cost of living has led to unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, such as the railways, have seen workers strike over pay. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the UK economy had ""rebounded"" in May - with growth across the main sectors, including construction which saw a rise in housebuilding and office refurbishments. ""Health was the biggest driver with many more people seeing GPs, despite test and trace and the vaccination programmes winding down,"" he added. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the activity of companies, the state and individuals in an economy. Part of how GDP is calculated includes measuring the total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction - but also health services and the government, In the health sector, we don't pay for services through the NHS, so one gauge of how it is faring is the number of GP appointments which gives an indication of how that bit of the economy is doing. Mr Morgan added that road haulage also had a ""busy"" May, while travel agencies saw a jump in demand as people booked summer holidays. However, while the economy grew, many businesses reported that an increase in fuel and electricity costs had forced them to put up their prices for customers. The UK's statistics body also cited price increases for metals, some foods, including fish, and other staples. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon warned on Wednesday that its annual losses will be bigger than expected after ramping up wages to attract staff and spending heavily on repairs and marketing. Although sales were now matching those seen in 2019, before the pandemic struck, it said staff costs were far higher than pre-Covid, as firms across the sector had to hike wages to overcome staff shortages. The new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi - who is in the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister - said it was ""great"" to see the economy growing, but added that he knew people were concerned by rising prices. ""We're working alongside the Bank of England to bear down on inflation and I am confident we can create a stronger economy for everyone across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi said. But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said economic growth was ""still far too slow"". ""Instead of presenting the plans we need for a stronger, more secure economy, the Tories are spending every waking minute indulging in unfunded fantasy economics,"" she added. The British economy returned to solid growth in May, up by 0.5%, defying fears of a month of stagnation. The services sector drove half the growth, in particular health services, including GP appointments. Monthly figures are volatile, but thanks to some upward earlier revisions, growth over the three months to May was 0.4%. However, consumers showed signs of being squeezed by the cost of living - with wholesale and retail dragging down the economy in May. The ONS also said respondents to its surveys reported that they were passing on price increases to consumers including fuel, electricity, nickel, cobalt, aluminium, steel, paper, fish and cooking oil. The figures raise some hope of the economy avoiding a feared recession. But many expect the economy to have fallen back again in June. The figures for the full second quarter are released next month. In June, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) warned the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year, and will stagnate next year as consumers rein in their spending and commodity prices remain high. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the UK will be the slowest growing economy among the world's largest economies in 2023. David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said May's growth was ""welcome news"", but ""masks serious underlying issues of growing imbalances within the economy"". He said that ""worryingly"" its recent survey showed that longer term business confidence had begun to fall. ""The present political instability will have only exacerbated uncertainty among small firms,"" he said. ""Alongside this, the economy is still facing massive structural issues - including uncertainty about the UK's relationship with the EU, continued Covid lockdowns in China, supply chain breakdowns and rocketing energy costs.""

Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest.

You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory.

Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well.""

Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory. Welcome - here is a recap of the dayâs events in Sri Lanka, where it's approaching 18:00. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tory MPs to begin voting in leadership raceThe eight candidates need at least 30 votes each to stay in the contest to replace Boris Johnson.UK PoliticsSir Mo relieved Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.UK,"Tory leadership hopefuls face a nervous wait after their colleagues finished their first round of voting in the contest for No 10. The eight candidates who have made it onto the ballot paper need to secure at least 30 votes to stay in the race to become prime minister. A result from the secret ballot is expected around 17.00 BST. Those who make it through will face further votes in the coming days to narrow the field down to a final two. It comes after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becomes the latest MP to hold an event to launch her leadership campaign. She joins Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi on the ballot, as all have secured the required 20 nominations from Tory MPs to make it into the first round. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax With campaigning stepping up a gear, Ms Mordaunt pledged to slash VAT on fuel and raise income tax thresholds. Setting out her stall at a hot, crowded launch event, she also promised parents more flexibility over subsidised childcare and said she would give MPs control over ""social capital pots"" to spend on their local areas. Pitching herself as a team player, she said if she won office she would introduce a ""tighter"" cabinet of ministers with powers across Whitehall. This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt plans to modernise a 'broken' Whitehall Adding that the Conservative Party had ""lost its sense of self"", she also vowed to return to the values of ""small state, low tax, personal responsibility"". Ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid and junior minister Rehman Chishti have dropped out of the race, after failing to pick up enough support. The 30 vote threshold - which has beenintroduced to quickly narrow the field- could see a number of further candidates knocked out. Candidates will also appear at two further hustings events on Wednesday, as the race to secure endorsements heats up. It comes as: Former chancellor Mr Sunak, who has the strongest backing among Tory MPs so far, secured support from cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Grant Shapps Foreign Secretary Ms Truss bagged endorsements from cabinet ministers and Johnson loyalists Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries Mr Hunt's campaign rejected an accusation from Ms Dorries that Mr Sunak's team lent nominations, to make sure he got onto the ballot paper Former foreign secretary Mr Hunt, who has not had a launch event, said he was ""quietly confident"" he would make it through the first round of voting The campaign so far has laid bare Tory divisions over taxation, with a number of candidates attacking the rise in taxes under Mr Sunak's chancellorship. All the contenders are pledging to bring in immediate tax cuts if they win, apart from Mr Sunak who says cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Among those promising to reduce taxes, there aredivisions over which taxes should be cut, and how quickly. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Sunak said tackling inflation is his ""number one economic priority"", and claimed former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an icon on the right of the party, would have backed his approach. But on of Ms Truss's backers, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked his record at the Treasury, telling Sky News the ""tax-increasing chancellor"" had made decisions ""of the left rather than on the right"". And he sought to disparage Leave-voting Mr Sunak's Brexit credentials, branding him an ""ostensible Brexiteer"" whose department had resisted ending the ""supremacy of EU law"" during his tenure. The competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported former candidate Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. Read more from Chris Boris Johnson, who has declined to endorse any of the candidates, said any of them would ""wipe the floor"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he branded ""Captain Crasheroony Snoozefest"". Appearing at his first Prime Minister's Questions since the cabinet mutiny last week that forced his resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""proud"" of his record at No 10 and would leave office ""with my head held high"". But Sir Keir shot back that the Tory leadership candidates ""haven't found time to explain"" their various tax cuts, which he said would cost Â£300bn. The Labour leader accused the contenders of attempting to ""rewrite history"" over the government's record on taxation, and acting like they had ""just arrived from the moon"". His questions were aimed, in particular, at the current and previous chancellors, Mr Zahawi and Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, the government has scheduled a vote of no confidence in itself next week, amid a row over whether Mr Johnson should be able to stay in office until his successor is chosen. Labour had tabled a motion of no confidence in both the government and PM earlier this week - butministers blocked it, arguing the wording breached parliamentary convention. The government has now tabled a motion of its own, which it is likely to win, in the hope of closing off further attempts to prevent Mr Johnson staying on. In a last-ditch bid to set up a specific vote on Mr Johnson's future, the Liberal Democrats have said they will table an amendment to the motion. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether it is voted on. Tory MPs are aiming to whittle down the candidates to a final two before Parliament's summer break begins at the end of next week. About 160,000 members of the Conservative Party will then choose between these final two, with the winner due to be announced on 5 September.

Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race. The former equalities minister, who came fourth securing the backing of 40 MPs in today's vote, has justtweeted,externalgratitude for her colleagues' support. ""To win the next election and deliver Conservative solutions to todayâs problems, our party must stand as the party for change,"" she says. ""I have the conviction, the courage, and the clarity of thought to deliver that change."" Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer. Most other Brexiteers have attacked Sunak's record on taxes, but Villiers says the former chancellor is a tax cutter and she has ""real confidence"" he can win the next general election. Chris MasonPolitical editor Team Sunak say ""heâs landed a quarter of the party with eight candidates in the field"". The former chancellor has won 88 of the possible 358 votes in today's opening ballot of Conservative MPs. Tom Tugendhat supporter Damian Green says he is ""absolutely still in this"" and there's ""real momentum there"". ""Tom is offering a clean start,"" he states, and he suspects that Tugendhat - who came fifth in today's ballow with 37 votes - will now pick up some of Jeremy Hunt's supporters. ""Rishi has come ahead,"" he says, and he is the ""most known name in this election,"" he says others are ""scrapping for other slots on the ballot paper"". He says northern MPs are supporting Tom Tugendhat, and ""as the debate continues"" then people will start focusing on whether or not tax cuts ""will be inflationary"", he says. Green says cutting duty on fuel, as Tom Tugendhat proposes, would be anti-inflationary, he says it's ""extraordinary"" that the UK doesn't currently have a long term plan for growth. Another Tugendhat supporter, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says that the MP is putting across a ""positive"" message, and it's still ""all to play for"". Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the
phone in hushed tones outside the result venue. Itâs exactly these kinds of MPs who the remaining candidates
will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm
honouredâ in response to her strong second place. That, and the relatively narrow gap between her and Rishi Sunak are the main headlines from the first vote. One Mordaunt backer in the room said her healthy showing
in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing
suggested Sunakâs lead was hardly overwhelming. Another backing Liz Truss said
it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate. Not changing the ""underlying economic plan"" would mean that the UK can do tax cuts, he adds, ""under the government of Boris Johnson"", but there is ""more headroom to be achieved"" to allow reductions in taxation.

Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race.

Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer.

Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the

will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm

in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing

it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate.

Tory MPs to begin voting in leadership raceThe eight candidates need at least 30 votes each to stay in the contest to replace Boris Johnson.,"Tory leadership hopefuls face a nervous wait after their colleagues finished their first round of voting in the contest for No 10. The eight candidates who have made it onto the ballot paper need to secure at least 30 votes to stay in the race to become prime minister. A result from the secret ballot is expected around 17.00 BST. Those who make it through will face further votes in the coming days to narrow the field down to a final two. It comes after Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt becomes the latest MP to hold an event to launch her leadership campaign. She joins Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi on the ballot, as all have secured the required 20 nominations from Tory MPs to make it into the first round. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax With campaigning stepping up a gear, Ms Mordaunt pledged to slash VAT on fuel and raise income tax thresholds. Setting out her stall at a hot, crowded launch event, she also promised parents more flexibility over subsidised childcare and said she would give MPs control over ""social capital pots"" to spend on their local areas. Pitching herself as a team player, she said if she won office she would introduce a ""tighter"" cabinet of ministers with powers across Whitehall. This video can not be played Watch: Penny Mordaunt plans to modernise a 'broken' Whitehall Adding that the Conservative Party had ""lost its sense of self"", she also vowed to return to the values of ""small state, low tax, personal responsibility"". Ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid and junior minister Rehman Chishti have dropped out of the race, after failing to pick up enough support. The 30 vote threshold - which has beenintroduced to quickly narrow the field- could see a number of further candidates knocked out. Candidates will also appear at two further hustings events on Wednesday, as the race to secure endorsements heats up. It comes as: Former chancellor Mr Sunak, who has the strongest backing among Tory MPs so far, secured support from cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Grant Shapps Foreign Secretary Ms Truss bagged endorsements from cabinet ministers and Johnson loyalists Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nadine Dorries Mr Hunt's campaign rejected an accusation from Ms Dorries that Mr Sunak's team lent nominations, to make sure he got onto the ballot paper Former foreign secretary Mr Hunt, who has not had a launch event, said he was ""quietly confident"" he would make it through the first round of voting The campaign so far has laid bare Tory divisions over taxation, with a number of candidates attacking the rise in taxes under Mr Sunak's chancellorship. All the contenders are pledging to bring in immediate tax cuts if they win, apart from Mr Sunak who says cuts should wait until inflation goes down. Among those promising to reduce taxes, there aredivisions over which taxes should be cut, and how quickly. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalMr Sunak said tackling inflation is his ""number one economic priority"", and claimed former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an icon on the right of the party, would have backed his approach. But on of Ms Truss's backers, Mr Rees-Mogg attacked his record at the Treasury, telling Sky News the ""tax-increasing chancellor"" had made decisions ""of the left rather than on the right"". And he sought to disparage Leave-voting Mr Sunak's Brexit credentials, branding him an ""ostensible Brexiteer"" whose department had resisted ending the ""supremacy of EU law"" during his tenure. The competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported former candidate Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. Read more from Chris Boris Johnson, who has declined to endorse any of the candidates, said any of them would ""wipe the floor"" with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he branded ""Captain Crasheroony Snoozefest"". Appearing at his first Prime Minister's Questions since the cabinet mutiny last week that forced his resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""proud"" of his record at No 10 and would leave office ""with my head held high"". But Sir Keir shot back that the Tory leadership candidates ""haven't found time to explain"" their various tax cuts, which he said would cost Â£300bn. The Labour leader accused the contenders of attempting to ""rewrite history"" over the government's record on taxation, and acting like they had ""just arrived from the moon"". His questions were aimed, in particular, at the current and previous chancellors, Mr Zahawi and Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, the government has scheduled a vote of no confidence in itself next week, amid a row over whether Mr Johnson should be able to stay in office until his successor is chosen. Labour had tabled a motion of no confidence in both the government and PM earlier this week - butministers blocked it, arguing the wording breached parliamentary convention. The government has now tabled a motion of its own, which it is likely to win, in the hope of closing off further attempts to prevent Mr Johnson staying on. In a last-ditch bid to set up a specific vote on Mr Johnson's future, the Liberal Democrats have said they will table an amendment to the motion. It will be up to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle to decide whether it is voted on. Tory MPs are aiming to whittle down the candidates to a final two before Parliament's summer break begins at the end of next week. About 160,000 members of the Conservative Party will then choose between these final two, with the winner due to be announced on 5 September.

"Protect children from illegal vapes, doctors say","This video can not be played The BBC filmed a Trading Standards undercover operation Trading standards in England and Wales say the market is being flooded by unsafe, disposable vapes aimed at children. The colourful, sweet-flavoured devices are growing in popularity among teens. Children are at risk from vaping, and more should be done to protect them from illegal and unregulated products containing high levels of nicotine, doctors are warning. Some teachers say vaping is becoming a problem in secondary schools. Selling e-cigarettes or vapes to children is illegal in the UK, and every vaping product sold containing nicotine must be registered by the medicines and healthcare products regulator, the MHRA. But the BBC has been told of a rise in complaints to Trading Standards over illicit vapes and shops selling them to children - increasing from dozens each month last year to hundreds per month in 2022, with thousands of counterfeit and unregulated products being seized. A recent survey by health charity ASH suggests nearly a third of 16 and 17-year-olds have tried vaping, and 14% are currently vapers. Among 11-17-year-olds, 7% are vaping - up from 4% in 2020. Vaping - is it a risk-free option? When Radio 5live joined trading standards officers in Newcastle carrying out spot checks on shops, they found that two out of the 10 stores visited that day sold vaping products illegally to girls aged 15 and 17. Child health experts want plain packaging introduced and rules tightened so that vapes can only be advertised as an aid to stopping smoking, rather than as a fun and colourful lifestyle product. ""Vaping is far from risk-free and may be addictive,"" said Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ""We must make efforts to stop children and young people picking up and using these products."" Vapes or e-cigarettes don't contain the harmful tobacco present in normal cigarettes, but they do contain nicotine - the substance which makes people addicted to smoking. They are growing in popularity as an aid for quitting smoking, along with other nicotine replacement products like patches or gum. The Department of Health and Social Care in England says that while they're not risk-free, UK-regulated vapes are far less harmful than smoked tobacco. But it continues to strongly discourage non-smokers and children from using them. UK laws limit how much nicotine and e-liquid is allowed, and health warnings are required on packaging. However, large numbers of vapes which are not designed for the UK market, are being smuggled into the country. ""There's no way of knowing what's in them,"" said Helen Donegan, senior trading standards officer with Leicestershire County Council, who told the BBC that 8,000 illegal vapes had been found at one premises alone. ""They are making them extremely attractive to young people - but they could be inhaling a banned substance."" Some look very similar to big-name vape brands, but are fake - others contain illegal amounts of nicotine and e-liquid. There are strict rules around vapes and e-cigarettes sold in shops in the UK Instead of containing around 600 puffs, which is what UK regulations allow, disposable vape devices containing up to 10,000 puffs are being sold in the UK. Dominic, 17, from Newcastle, has been vaping since he was 15, after switching from smoking when his friends started using vapes: ""Most of my friends vape or smoke - about 90%."" Secondary school teachers are noticing the problem too. A recent survey of 3,000 found half have caught a pupil vaping in school in the last year, and one in five teachers said they'd caught a pupil as young as 11 with a vape. The charity ASH says more should be done to prevent the products being promoted widely on platforms like TikTok. ""The flood of glamorous promotion of vaping on social media is completely inappropriate and social media platforms should take responsibility and turn off the tap,"" said chief executive Deborah Arnott. Colourful disposable vapes are driving the rise in vaping among teenagers, surveys suggest The UK Vaping Industry Association wants the government ""to greatly increase fines to Â£10,000"" every time a shop is caught selling vapes to children. It is also calling for outlets selling vape products to be licensed, and the fee used to fund further trading enforcement efforts by Trading Standards. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said vapes should only be used as a tool for smokers giving up smoking. It said it had put in place ""proportionate regulations for all vape products relating to product safety, labelling and restrictions on advertising"". This means they must not resemble a food or a cosmetic product, and must limit nicotine strength to 20mg/ml. ""We continue to strongly discourage non-smokers and children from using them,"" a spokesperson said. They added there are no current plans to increase the fine issued, but the measure would be kept under review. And the Department for Education said schools had powers under which they could ban vapes, and to confiscate any found on pupils. A government report on vaping among young people and adults in England is due to be published in the coming months. only those aged 18 and over can buy vapes or e-cigarettes certain ingredients, such a caffeine and taurine, are banned nicotine ingredient warnings must appear on packaging packaging should be child-proof all e-cigarette and e-liquids containing nicotine have to be certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before they can be sold in the UK. Search up brands on theMHRA website,external. any product that is not listed should be returned to the shop where it was bought or to your local trading standards office anyone's experience of suspected side-effects from using vapes can be sent to the MHRA via theYellow Card scheme,external nicotine-free e-cigarettes do not have to be certified by the MHRA - they are subject to product safety regulations by Trading Standards Additional reporting by Sarah Rock and Chris Clayton.

Today's page was written by George Bowden, Adam Durbin, Doug Faulkner, Chas Geiger, Marie Jackson, Marita Moloney, Richard Morris and Aoife Walsh. It was edited by Claudia Allen and Emma Owen. We'll be pausing our live coverage of the Conservative Party leadership race soon. Before we go, here's a recap of today's main developments: There are six people left vying to take over from Boris Johnson as Tory leader. So who are they and what do they stand for? Kemi Badenoch (bottom right in pictureabove)  Suella Braverman (top left)  Penny Mordaunt (top right)  Rishi Sunak (bottom left)  Liz Truss (bottom middle)  Tom Tugendhat (top middle)  Read morehere. Boris Johnson loyalist Nadine Dorries is claiming the prime minister's downfall is the result of a ""coup"" staged by Tory MPs. In a pre-released clip from tonight's BBC Panorama, the culture secretary says she was ""stunned"" that some of her colleagues wanted Johnson out of No 10 less than three years after a landslide victory. The ""anti-democratic nature of what they're doing alone was enough to alarm me"", she tells presenter Laura Kuenssberg. The full programme airs at 20:00 BST on BBC One, and you can also catch up after on the iPlayerhere. Leadership contenders have been out in force looking to shore up their support ahead of the first round vote - and now six will proceed to Thursday's second ballot. Here are some of the key quotes of the day: We will cut taxes and we will do it responsibly. That's my economic approach. I would describe it as common-sense Thatcherism. I believe that's what she would have done."" Rishi Sunak A gentle word of advice to the remaining candidates: smears & attacks may bring short term tactical gain but always backfire long term. The nation is watching & they've had enough of our drama; be the broad church & unbeatable, election winning machine that our country deserves."" Jeremy Hunt This is not about petty politics, this is not some sort of a game. This isn't just some sort of knife fight in a phone box. This is a battle of ideas that is actually going to determine the future of our country."" Tom Tugendhat Now is the time for colleagues to unite behind the candidate who will cut taxes, deliver the real economic change we need from day one and ensure Putin loses in Ukraine."" Spokeswoman for Liz Truss I don't intend to make any further intervention, but I wish all the candidates in the leadership contest the very best of luck."" Nadhim Zawahi Six candidates have qualified for the second round of voting tomorrow. Rishi Sunak,Penny Mordaunt,Liz Truss,Kemi Badenoch,Tom TugendhatandSuella Bravermanwill all be in Thursday's ballot. Tory MPs will vote again between 13:30 and 15:30 BST. The result of the second round will be announced at 17:00 and the candidate who finishes sixth will be eliminated. From now on though, there will be no minimum threshold of votes for contenders to reach to progress further. In theory, the process will then continue with further votes of Conservative MP daily from next Monday - and a single candidate eliminated each time - until just two are left. A decision on which of them will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister will then go to the party's membership - thought to number about 200,000 - with the winner announced on 5 September. But the number of MPs' votes could be shortened if candidates drop out or merge campaigns. Hemel Hempstead MP Sir Mike Penning has resigned as Conservative Party vice-chairman to campaign for Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest. He has told Sky News: ""As vice-chair I was unable to declare who I would want to vote for so I stepped down this afternoon. ""Penny has all the attributes we're looking for now, she's very down to earth, she's served her country as defence secretary and in the Royal Navy, and particularly in my constituency she will go down very well."" Chris MasonPolitical editor Six candidates remain and one big question - what happens to those 43 votes allocated to the two candidates eliminated? Expect as soon as this evening a shift of allegiances and a remoulding of this campaign, yet again. The working assumption here at Westminster is that Rishi Sunak will get one of the two tickets to go into the final two to be decided by Conservative party members. There is now a battle for that second ticket - between Liz Truss and Penny Mordaunt. And this evening at least, Penny Mordaunt has the upper hand. Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman came sixth in the first round of the contest with 32 votes. The
minimum threshold to proceed to the next round was 30 votes, and Braverman is the lowest placed candidate to remain in the contest. But in atweet,external, Braverman is showing no sign of being about to drop out of the race. MP Miriam Cates is backing her. She tells the BBC we've ""got a lot of work to do"" but ""it's all to play for"" in tonight's hustings. She says Braverman will impress with her ""passion, authority, professionalism and detail"". Cates says Brexit is not finished and Braverman is well placed to deal with problems that remain like the Northern Ireland Protocol (which sets out trading arrangements for Northern Ireland after Brexit). Kemi Badenoch has also been sharing her reaction to making it into the second ballot in the Tory Party leadership race. The former equalities minister, who came fourth securing the backing of 40 MPs in today's vote, has justtweeted,externalgratitude for her colleagues' support. ""To win the next election and deliver Conservative solutions to todayâs problems, our party must stand as the party for change,"" she says. ""I have the conviction, the courage, and the clarity of thought to deliver that change."" Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt's prospective deputy prime minister, has acknowledged the combination of the pair was ""clearly not considered the right one"" after Hunt was knocked out of the contest. In a statement, the backbench MP says she is ""extremely grateful"" to Hunt for ""putting so much faith in me"" McVey adds she hopes colleagues ""adopt the spirit"" of what their campaign tried to achieve, which she says was ""putting together a programme the party can unite behind to win the next election"". The remaining candidates all have immense talent and strengths. I will take some time speaking with them all before deciding who to vote for in the remainder of this election process.""  Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi has said he does not ""intend to make any further intervention"" in the leadership contest, following his failure to make the second round. In a letter posted on Twitter, Zahawi writes he will continue to work leading the Treasury with ""total focus"" and thanked the supporters of his campaign. ""I am very grateful for the support of colleagues in this leadership election and to Conservatives up and down the country who have got behind me and sent me best wishes. Clearly my part in the contest has now ended.  Former Cabinet minister Theresa Villiers announces she is backing Rishi Sunak, saying he's ""the best person to take the country through difficult economic circumstances"". She describes the first round result as ""a really good start"" in a ""closely fought election"". Villiers is a committed Brexiteer. Most other Brexiteers have attacked Sunak's record on taxes, but Villiers says the former chancellor is a tax cutter and she has ""real confidence"" he can win the next general election. Chris MasonPolitical editor Team Sunak say ""heâs landed a quarter of the party with eight candidates in the field"". The former chancellor has won 88 of the possible 358 votes in today's opening ballot of Conservative MPs. Tom Tugendhat supporter Damian Green says he is ""absolutely still in this"" and there's ""real momentum there"". ""Tom is offering a clean start,"" he states, and he suspects that Tugendhat - who came fifth in today's ballow with 37 votes - will now pick up some of Jeremy Hunt's supporters. ""Rishi has come ahead,"" he says, and he is the ""most known name in this election,"" he says others are ""scrapping for other slots on the ballot paper"". He says northern MPs are supporting Tom Tugendhat, and ""as the debate continues"" then people will start focusing on whether or not tax cuts ""will be inflationary"", he says. Green says cutting duty on fuel, as Tom Tugendhat proposes, would be anti-inflationary, he says it's ""extraordinary"" that the UK doesn't currently have a long term plan for growth. Another Tugendhat supporter, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, says that the MP is putting across a ""positive"" message, and it's still ""all to play for"". Ione WellsPolitical Correspondent, BBC News I've just spotted some of those who supported Nadhim Zahawi on the
phone in hushed tones outside the result venue. Itâs exactly these kinds of MPs who the remaining candidates
will want to be tapping up to try and convince them to join their side. These negotiations will play a crucial role over the next few
days. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Penny Mordaunt was modest as she left the room, saying âIâm
honouredâ in response to her strong second place. That, and the relatively narrow gap between her and Rishi Sunak are the main headlines from the first vote. One Mordaunt backer in the room said her healthy showing
in the first round indicated the need for the membership to be allowed the chance to have their say on her. One backbencher not revealing who theyâre backing
suggested Sunakâs lead was hardly overwhelming. Another backing Liz Truss said
it shouldn't be taken for granted that the former chancellor would make the
final two. All eyes are on Jeremy Hunt and Nadhim Zahawiâs backers
now to see who they support. And thereâs a feeling that the pressure's building
on Suella Braverman to endorse another candidate, possibly Liz Truss. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak - seen by many as the frontrunner - has topped the first ballot of Conservative MPs with 88 votes. He tells the BBC he feels âgreatâ about the result. Sunak resigned as chancellor last week. Liz Truss supporter Simon Clarke says ""Liz is part of a pack of three candidates... who have serious momentum going into the days ahead"". He says ""Liz is the sensible option"" and the right of the party need to get behind a single candidate. Not changing the ""underlying economic plan"" would mean that the UK can do tax cuts, he adds, ""under the government of Boris Johnson"", but there is ""more headroom to be achieved"" to allow reductions in taxation. People on the right of the party will ""have to think"" about previous statements Penny Mordaunt has made, says Clarke, adding that he himself doesn't agree with Mordaunt on the issue of trans rights and her views on women. Here's the moment that the MPs vying to become the next prime minister learned their fate. Sir Graham Brady read out the results of the ballot of Conservative MPs.

Chris Mason: Our next PM is still far from obviousThe only electorate that matters in choosing the two candidates are the 358 people who are Tory MPs.,"""Still afloat, ready to return fire!"" The Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt joked with journalists in the corridor outside Committee Room 11 in the Houses of Parliament. Just hours aftershe and others made the ballot paper for round oneof the election to be our next prime minister, I'm outside the second hustings of Tuesday evening. I'm loitering near the room, trying to get a feel for how those going in are going down. ""Who doesn't like banging?"" asks Tom Tugendhat, another candidate, as he emerges - a reference, to be clear, to the Conservative tradition of expressing appreciation by thumping the desks. Other candidates pass each other without a word and barely a glance. One asks nervously if there's a waiting room. The company of a collection of reporters while waiting for their interrogation clearly didn't hold vast appeal. Who could be the next prime minister? I should point out, by the way, that I can't tell you exactly what happened inside the hustings, because I wasn't allowed in. It was for Conservative MPs only. And if all this seems a little insular, well, it is. Because the only electorate that matters right now inchoosing the final two candidates to replace Boris Johnsonare the 358 people who are Tory MPs. Penny Mordaunt will launch her campaign on Wednesday After another round of hustings this morning, and Penny Mordaunt's campaign launch event, voting will begin. Incidentally, amid all the spin and briefing, gossip and intrigue, I detect a consistent talking-up of Ms Mordaunt when it comes to the prospect of her making the duo who'll then face an election among Conservative Party members. Tory MPs will have two hours, between 13:30 and 15:30, to vote and we'll find out the result at 17:00 BST. Given candidates need at least 30 votes - nine more than they needed to make the ballot paper, because they can vote for themselves - to make round two, and another round will follow on Thursday, therunners and riderswill shrink rapidly. Sir Graham Brady announces the names of the eight leadership hopefuls on Tuesday Then the key will be what happens to the rejected and their supporters' votes - where do they head next? We've already seen the first example of what will happen again and again in the coming days - a candidate throwing their lot in with someone else. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps didn't even get out of the garage with his campaign before clambering aboard Rishi Sunak's. And the competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. And as for the final two? Let's see. It is far from obvious who our next prime minister will be and pretty much whoever it is, right now at least, is barely known to the wider electorate. And one of them will be in 10 Downing Street in eight weeks' time. Boris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questions With Boris Johnson on his way out as Prime Minister - what exactly happens next?

What Tory candidates think about Northern IrelandWhat do the would-be prime ministers want to do with the NI-part of the Brexit deal?Northern Ireland,"Many Conservatives want to see changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol Boris Johnson promised to ""Get Brexit Done"" but his successor will inherit a bogged-down dispute about special arrangements that were agreed for Northern Ireland. His government recently introduced a bill in the House of Commons which could override parts of the post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU - known as the Northern Ireland Protocol - and make it easier for some goods to flow from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. If passed, the bill would not only affect the UK's relationship with the EU, but also rules for businesses in Northern Ireland and the future of Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont. It collapsed in February after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) walked out in protest against the protocol, pledging not to return unless its concerns were addressed. And there are some other Northern Ireland-related issues which contenders have taken positions on. So where do the candidates stand? TheNorthern Ireland Protocol keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, preventing a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. But it means new checks and controls on commercial goods which come into Northern Ireland from other parts of the UK, creating a trade border in the Irish Sea. It is opposed by Northern Ireland's unionist parties, who say it undermines their place in the UK. Other parties - including Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) - say the protocol is a necessary compromise to mitigate the effects of Brexit in Northern Ireland. The treaty was signed by Boris Johnson in January 2020, as part the Withdrawal Agreement. The EU has put forward its own proposals to ease checks, but negotiations between Brussels and London on how to fix problems with the treaty have stalled. Brussels views the protocol bill as a clear breach of international law and has urged the UK to ""step back"" from its approach. Senior EU figures have warned that Britain risks damaging trust as well as its reputation abroad. The European Commission has launched legal action over Britain's alleged failure to implement parts of the treaty and the BBC understands further so-called infringement proceedings could follow. If the bill becomes law and ministers do start changing parts of the treaty, the EU's suggested it could also impose trade sanctions. This is why you might have heard warnings of a possible trade war. UK access to the EU's Horizon research programme has also been described as collateral damage in the dispute. There is currently a block on the UK re-joining the Â£81.2bn funding scheme. In May, Mr Sunak told Bloomberg that the way the protocol was operating was posing enormous challenges to ""the stability of the situation"" in Northern Ireland. He said it had become a barrier to re-establishing power sharing at Stormont. Mr Sunak said the government's preference was a negotiated settlement and added that he wanted to ensure Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom was secure. At the end of 2021, the Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Sunak urged Boris Johnson and his former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost not to ""blow up "" talks with the EU about the protocol. The paper said Mr Sunak raised concerns over the potential impact this would have had on the economy and that he did not have the same sense of ""urgency"" as others in cabinet about dealing with the protocol. At the time the Treasury declined to comment. He did not vote on the protocol bill at second reading. Mr Sunak's bid to become leader has been supported by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Shailesh Vara. How will the new Tory leader and PM be chosen? In Brussels, many view Boris Johnson as the blustering Brexit poster boy who tried to backtrack on a deal for Northern Ireland that he himself had signed. So while they aren't shedding a tear about his downfall, they're also wary of who might come next. No candidate has disowned the bill that could allow the UK to override parts of the protocol. Indeed one of the contenders, Liz Truss, was responsible for drafting it while another, Suella Braverman (who has since been eliminated) wants to toughen it up. With Jeremy Hunt and Tom Tugendhat also out of the race, diplomats here may hope that someone Penny Mordaunt or Rishi Sunak would take, as they'd see it, a more pragmatic approach. But even though there are candidates who likely wouldn't have chosen the current prime minister's approach, now the bill's in motion, no one appears prepared to stop it. The difference between contenders, in the end, may be between those who really are prepared to risk a so-called trade war with the EU versus those who aren't. But that's a test that won't come for months at least, if at all. For now, the contenders are broadly holding the line set by Mr Johnson. A key watch will be whether anyone in the race signals a desire to give negotiations another push. However don't expect anyone to volunteer the idea that they're open to making concessions to Brussels. A wider question is whether a new prime minister can reset strained relations with the EU. But again, in this contest, that doesn't appear to be a fashionable cause. Ms Truss is the only candidate so far to have mentioned the protocol in the public speech for her leadership bid. As foreign secretary, she was responsible for introducing the bill to scrap parts of the protocol. In her leadership pitch she said: ""In the face of EU intransigence I developed the Northern Ireland Protocol bill. ""It breaks the deadlock in a legal way, upholding the Belfast Good Friday Agreement and preventing the tearing apart of our precious union."" Speaking in the House of Commons when the bill was first debated, she told MPs that due to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". Ina letter to the Financial Times in June,external, Ms Truss said the protocol was undermining the Good Friday Agreement, had created practical problems and ""a growing sense that the rights and aspirations of some parts of the community are being undermined"". She said new legislation was necessary because ""all other options within the current EU mandate are currently exhausted"". What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK economy grows more than expected in MayThe economy grew by 0.5% in May, higher than many analysts had predicted.Business","The UK economy rebounded in May after shrinking in April and March, official figures show. The economy grew by 0.5% during the month, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, higher than the flat growth most economists expected. Every area of the economy expanded including construction, travel and manufacturing. However, businesses reported that higher running costs had led to them to put up prices for customers. And with household disposable incomes set to fall further in the autumn when energy prices are set to rise again, there is ""still a real risk"" that the economy could fall into a recession, said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. ""That may mean the economy proves to be a poisoned chalice for whoever wins the race to be the next prime minister,"" he added. Conservative MPs will cast their first votes in the leadership contest on Wednesday, but whoever replaces Boris Johnson is faced with the dilemma of how to tackle the soaring cost of living. What is GDP and how does it affect me? UK inflation hits 40-year high as food prices jump Both businesses and households are being hit by rising prices, which are surging at theirfastest rate for 40 yearsdue to record-high fuel and energy costs. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, hit 9.1% in May, and is expected to reach 11% later this year. Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, has vowed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%, ""no ifs or buts"". It has raised rates five times since December and is expected to put them up again next month.  He has indicted the Bank will ""act forcefully"" suggesting it could raise rates by more than 0.25%. The rise in the cost of living has led to unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, such as the railways, have seen workers strike over pay. But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said the UK economy had ""rebounded"" in May - with growth across the main sectors, including construction which saw a rise in housebuilding and office refurbishments. ""Health was the biggest driver with many more people seeing GPs, despite test and trace and the vaccination programmes winding down,"" he added. GDP, or gross domestic product, measures the activity of companies, the state and individuals in an economy. Part of how GDP is calculated includes measuring the total value of the goods and services produced by all sectors of the economy - agriculture, manufacturing, energy, construction - but also health services and the government, In the health sector, we don't pay for services through the NHS, so one gauge of how it is faring is the number of GP appointments which gives an indication of how that bit of the economy is doing. Mr Morgan added that road haulage also had a ""busy"" May, while travel agencies saw a jump in demand as people booked summer holidays. However, while the economy grew, many businesses reported that an increase in fuel and electricity costs had forced them to put up their prices for customers. The UK's statistics body also cited price increases for metals, some foods, including fish, and other staples. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon warned on Wednesday that its annual losses will be bigger than expected after ramping up wages to attract staff and spending heavily on repairs and marketing. Although sales were now matching those seen in 2019, before the pandemic struck, it said staff costs were far higher than pre-Covid, as firms across the sector had to hike wages to overcome staff shortages. The new chancellor, Nadhim Zahawi - who is in the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister - said it was ""great"" to see the economy growing, but added that he knew people were concerned by rising prices. ""We're working alongside the Bank of England to bear down on inflation and I am confident we can create a stronger economy for everyone across the UK,"" Mr Zahawi said. But Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said economic growth was ""still far too slow"". ""Instead of presenting the plans we need for a stronger, more secure economy, the Tories are spending every waking minute indulging in unfunded fantasy economics,"" she added. The British economy returned to solid growth in May, up by 0.5%, defying fears of a month of stagnation. The services sector drove half the growth, in particular health services, including GP appointments. Monthly figures are volatile, but thanks to some upward earlier revisions, growth over the three months to May was 0.4%. However, consumers showed signs of being squeezed by the cost of living - with wholesale and retail dragging down the economy in May. The ONS also said respondents to its surveys reported that they were passing on price increases to consumers including fuel, electricity, nickel, cobalt, aluminium, steel, paper, fish and cooking oil. The figures raise some hope of the economy avoiding a feared recession. But many expect the economy to have fallen back again in June. The figures for the full second quarter are released next month. In June, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) warned the UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year, and will stagnate next year as consumers rein in their spending and commodity prices remain high. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the UK will be the slowest growing economy among the world's largest economies in 2023. David Bharier, head of research at the British Chambers of Commerce, said May's growth was ""welcome news"", but ""masks serious underlying issues of growing imbalances within the economy"". He said that ""worryingly"" its recent survey showed that longer term business confidence had begun to fall. ""The present political instability will have only exacerbated uncertainty among small firms,"" he said. ""Alongside this, the economy is still facing massive structural issues - including uncertainty about the UK's relationship with the EU, continued Covid lockdowns in China, supply chain breakdowns and rocketing energy costs.""

Chris Mason: Our next PM is still far from obviousThe only electorate that matters in choosing the two candidates are the 358 people who are Tory MPs.UK Politics,"""Still afloat, ready to return fire!"" The Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt joked with journalists in the corridor outside Committee Room 11 in the Houses of Parliament. Just hours aftershe and others made the ballot paper for round oneof the election to be our next prime minister, I'm outside the second hustings of Tuesday evening. I'm loitering near the room, trying to get a feel for how those going in are going down. ""Who doesn't like banging?"" asks Tom Tugendhat, another candidate, as he emerges - a reference, to be clear, to the Conservative tradition of expressing appreciation by thumping the desks. Other candidates pass each other without a word and barely a glance. One asks nervously if there's a waiting room. The company of a collection of reporters while waiting for their interrogation clearly didn't hold vast appeal. Who could be the next prime minister? I should point out, by the way, that I can't tell you exactly what happened inside the hustings, because I wasn't allowed in. It was for Conservative MPs only. And if all this seems a little insular, well, it is. Because the only electorate that matters right now inchoosing the final two candidates to replace Boris Johnsonare the 358 people who are Tory MPs. Penny Mordaunt will launch her campaign on Wednesday After another round of hustings this morning, and Penny Mordaunt's campaign launch event, voting will begin. Incidentally, amid all the spin and briefing, gossip and intrigue, I detect a consistent talking-up of Ms Mordaunt when it comes to the prospect of her making the duo who'll then face an election among Conservative Party members. Tory MPs will have two hours, between 13:30 and 15:30, to vote and we'll find out the result at 17:00 BST. Given candidates need at least 30 votes - nine more than they needed to make the ballot paper, because they can vote for themselves - to make round two, and another round will follow on Thursday, therunners and riderswill shrink rapidly. Sir Graham Brady announces the names of the eight leadership hopefuls on Tuesday Then the key will be what happens to the rejected and their supporters' votes - where do they head next? We've already seen the first example of what will happen again and again in the coming days - a candidate throwing their lot in with someone else. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps didn't even get out of the garage with his campaign before clambering aboard Rishi Sunak's. And the competition for votes is feverish. One MP, who had supported Mr Shapps, showed me their phone - and the instant electronic attention they were paid by loads of other candidates and their teams. Missed calls, WhatsApps, you name it, instantaneous wooing. And it's only just beginning. Plenty ponder that the former Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, and Penny Mordaunt are perhaps the most likely to make the final three. But no-one can know yet. And as for the final two? Let's see. It is far from obvious who our next prime minister will be and pretty much whoever it is, right now at least, is barely known to the wider electorate. And one of them will be in 10 Downing Street in eight weeks' time. Boris Johnson Quits: What Next & More Questions With Boris Johnson on his way out as Prime Minister - what exactly happens next?

"Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and taxCBI business lobby group calls for ""credible and bold plans for growth"" in a letter to candidates.Business","Candidates to be the UK's next prime minister should focus on growth and an overhaul of the tax system over quick cuts, a business group has said. Promises of tax reductions feature heavily in the leadership campaigns but the CBI business group said the wrong cuts could fuel inflation further. In an open letter, CBI director general Tony Danker called for ""serious, credible and bold plans for growth"". Labour's Rachel Reeves said candidates should ""seriously heed these warnings"". The race to elect a new Conservative leader and prime minister comes at a time when the UK is grappling with  inflation driven by rising costs of food, energy and fuel. The OECD think tank forecast in June that UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year and will stagnate next year. And in April the International Monetary Fund said that the UK will be the slowest growing G7 economy in 2023. Last week, the government's independent forecaster warned that the UK debt was on an ""unsustainable path"" unless spending is tightened and taxes are raised. Current government plans to increase corporation tax from 19% to 25% in April are not proving popular with businesses, and some candidates have promised to cancel it. But the CBI said a permanent extension to extra tax reliefs on investment - due to expire in April - and an overhaul of business rates are more important to create investment and growth. PM rivals battle over tax cutting pledges Tax cut beauty contest could turn ugly Mr Danker wrote in an open letter to the leadership candidates: ""Growth that relies on only government or household consumption is doomed to fail, especially at a time of rising inflation and high debt."" He added: ""Sustainable economic growth must be at the heart of your manifestos. ""Without it, leadership ambitions cannot be met nor those of the British people and businesses."" Mr Danker wrote that while the corporation tax hike should be ""revisited"" given the wider weakening economy, leadership candidates should look at the UK's entire business tax regime as a whole. The plea comes as the Conservative leadership contenders outline their campaign policies, with tax front and centre for each. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi pledged on Monday to cut income tax in 2023 and 2024 and abolish green levies on energy bills for two years, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss vowed to cut taxes ""from day one"". Jeremy Hunt, who has been both health and foreign secretary, told BBC Breakfast he wants to ""cut all taxes"". But former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is launching his bid to become prime minister with a promise to only cut taxes once inflation has been brought back under control. Setting out its own plan to boost the economy, the CBI told the would-be prime ministers that long-term growth ambitions are vital. Mr Danker wrote that the country faces ""serious challenges"" such as ""eye-watering inflation putting households and enterprises under real pressure"". But he added it is also caught in a longer-term trap of low growth and higher productivity was the only sustainable way forward. This would ""achieve higher standards of living and tackle the fiscal challenges of an ageing population and decarbonisation while lowering the UK's high tax burden,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""The level of unfunded tax cuts currently being bandied about by [leadership hopefuls] would blow a massive hole in the public finances. ""Instead of setting out serious plans to help people with the cost of living crisis or grow our economy, we are presented with the extraordinary spectacle of a Tory tombola of tax cuts - with no explanation of what public services will be cut, or how else they'd be paid for.""

Sri Lanka's president flees country on military jetGotabaya Rajapaksa has arrived in the Maldives amid mass protests over Sri Lanka's economic crisis.Asia,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka ahead of his expected resignation as president President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled Sri Lanka on a military jet, amid mass protests over the island's economic crisis. The country's air force confirmed the 73-year-old flew to the Maldives with his wife and two security officials. The president has pledged to resign by Wednesday, but an official resignation letter is yet to be received. In the president's absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as acting president. Mr Wickremesinghe declared a state of emergency and told the military to restore order as protesters stormed his office and demanded that he also resign. Mr Rajapaksa's departure ends a family dynasty that has dominated Sri Lanka's politics for the past two decades. The president had been in hiding after crowds stormed his residence on Saturday, andhad pledged to resign on Wednesday. His arrival in the Maldives, an island chain south-west of Sri Lanka, led to protests there too, with some urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing president. A source told the BBC that Mr Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also left Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Can Sri Lanka's acting president restore order? How Sri Lanka's dramatic day unfolded Why is Sri Lanka in crisis? As Sri Lankans awoke to the news of Mr Rajapaksa's departure, thousands of people took to the streets of the capital, Colombo. Many gathered at Galle Face Green, the city's main protest site. Some listened to fiery speeches at a makeshift stage set up for ordinary people to take the mic. Punctuated by cries of ""Victory to the struggle"", the rallying cry of the protest movement, speakers railed against a government and the leaders they feel have failed them. Police fired tear gas to disperse a group of protesters near the prime minister's office, but they managed to storm the office and other state buildings. In an earlier televised address, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he had ordered the military to do ""whatever is necessary to restore order"". ""We can't tear up our constitution. We can't allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,"" he said. But many protesters say they will continue their demonstrations until both leaders have resigned from government. Some demonstrators were furious about Mr Rajapaksa's departure, seeing a lack of accountability. ""We don't like it. We want to keep him. We want our money back! And we want to put all the Rajapaksas in an open prison where they can do farm work,"" said protester GP Nimal. But 23-year-old university student Reshani Samarakoon told the BBC that the former president's exile offered ""hope that in the future we can eventually become a developed country, economically and socially"". One of the demonstrators in Colombo delivers a speech to the crowd Sri Lankans blame President Rajapaksa's administration for their worst economic crisis in decades. For months they have been struggling with daily power cuts and shortages of basics like fuel, food and medicines. The leader, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, is believed to have wanted to flee abroad before stepping down to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new administration. Sri Lanka is an island nation off southern India: It won independence from British rule in 1948. Three ethnic groups - Sinhalese, Tamil and Muslim - make up 99% of the country's 22 million population. One family of brothers has dominated for years: Mahinda Rajapaksa became a hero among the majority Sinhalese in 2009 when his government defeated Tamil separatist rebels after years of bitter and bloody civil war. His brother Gotabaya, who was defence secretary at the time, is the current president but says he is standing down. Presidential powers:The president is the head of state, government and the military in Sri Lanka but does share a lot of executive responsibilities with the prime minister, who heads up the ruling party in parliament. Now an economic crisis has led to fury on the streets: Soaring inflation has meant some foods, medication and fuel are in short supply, there are rolling blackouts and ordinary people have taken to the streets in anger with many blaming the Rajapaksa family and their government for the situation. This video can not be played Watch: Protesters storm Sri Lankan president's palace in Colombo, swam in the pool and set the PM's house on fire Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo What a fall from grace for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa - for so long such a major figure in Sri Lanka. Few expected that matters would ultimately go this way. As the former defence chief he oversaw the military operations in the controversial war against the Tamil Tiger rebels that ended in 2009. He is accused of human rights abuses during the war and also targeting those who dissented, but he has always denied those accusations. The Rajapaksa family has dominated Sri Lankan politics for two decades, and with strong backing from the Sinhala Buddhist majority, Gotabaya became president in 2019. His departure is a remarkable victory for the protesters who came to the streets to express their anger against the mismanagement of the economy and the escalating cost of living. The president's departure threatens a potential power vacuum in Sri Lanka, which needs a functioning government to help start digging it out of financial ruin. Politicians from other parties have been talking about forming a new unity government but there is no sign they are near agreement yet. It's also not clear if the public would accept what they come up with. Under the constitution, it's Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who should act in the president's stead if the latter resigns. The prime minister is considered the president's deputy in parliament. However, Mr Wickremesinghe is also deeply unpopular. Protesters set fire to his private residence on Saturday - he and his family were not inside - and he said he would resign to make way for a unity government, but gave no date. That leaves the parliament's speaker as the next most likely to step in as caretaker president, constitutional experts say. But Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena is an ally of the Rajapaksas, and it is unclear whether the public would accept his authority. Whoever does become acting president has 30 days to hold an election for a new president from among members of parliament. The winner of that vote could then see out the remainder of Mr Rajapaksa's term until late 2024. Inside the presidential palace now full of Sri Lankans The daily heartbreak of life in a country gone bankrupt 'Protests have changed thinking for the better' On Monday, the main opposition leader SajithPremadasa told the BBC he would be tilting for the presidency. But he also lacks public support and there is deep public suspicion of politicians in general. The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership.

The protest movement which has brought Sri Lanka to the brink of change also does not have an obvious contender for the country's leadership.

"Protect children from illegal vapes, doctors sayDisposable vapes containing high levels of nicotine are flooding the market, the BBC has been told.Health","This video can not be played The BBC filmed a Trading Standards undercover operation Trading standards in England and Wales say the market is being flooded by unsafe, disposable vapes aimed at children. The colourful, sweet-flavoured devices are growing in popularity among teens. Children are at risk from vaping, and more should be done to protect them from illegal and unregulated products containing high levels of nicotine, doctors are warning. Some teachers say vaping is becoming a problem in secondary schools. Selling e-cigarettes or vapes to children is illegal in the UK, and every vaping product sold containing nicotine must be registered by the medicines and healthcare products regulator, the MHRA. But the BBC has been told of a rise in complaints to Trading Standards over illicit vapes and shops selling them to children - increasing from dozens each month last year to hundreds per month in 2022, with thousands of counterfeit and unregulated products being seized. A recent survey by health charity ASH suggests nearly a third of 16 and 17-year-olds have tried vaping, and 14% are currently vapers. Among 11-17-year-olds, 7% are vaping - up from 4% in 2020. Vaping - is it a risk-free option? When Radio 5live joined trading standards officers in Newcastle carrying out spot checks on shops, they found that two out of the 10 stores visited that day sold vaping products illegally to girls aged 15 and 17. Child health experts want plain packaging introduced and rules tightened so that vapes can only be advertised as an aid to stopping smoking, rather than as a fun and colourful lifestyle product. ""Vaping is far from risk-free and may be addictive,"" said Dr Max Davie, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ""We must make efforts to stop children and young people picking up and using these products."" Vapes or e-cigarettes don't contain the harmful tobacco present in normal cigarettes, but they do contain nicotine - the substance which makes people addicted to smoking. They are growing in popularity as an aid for quitting smoking, along with other nicotine replacement products like patches or gum. The Department of Health and Social Care in England says that while they're not risk-free, UK-regulated vapes are far less harmful than smoked tobacco. But it continues to strongly discourage non-smokers and children from using them. UK laws limit how much nicotine and e-liquid is allowed, and health warnings are required on packaging. However, large numbers of vapes which are not designed for the UK market, are being smuggled into the country. ""There's no way of knowing what's in them,"" said Helen Donegan, senior trading standards officer with Leicestershire County Council, who told the BBC that 8,000 illegal vapes had been found at one premises alone. ""They are making them extremely attractive to young people - but they could be inhaling a banned substance."" Some look very similar to big-name vape brands, but are fake - others contain illegal amounts of nicotine and e-liquid. There are strict rules around vapes and e-cigarettes sold in shops in the UK Instead of containing around 600 puffs, which is what UK regulations allow, disposable vape devices containing up to 10,000 puffs are being sold in the UK. Dominic, 17, from Newcastle, has been vaping since he was 15, after switching from smoking when his friends started using vapes: ""Most of my friends vape or smoke - about 90%."" Secondary school teachers are noticing the problem too. A recent survey of 3,000 found half have caught a pupil vaping in school in the last year, and one in five teachers said they'd caught a pupil as young as 11 with a vape. The charity ASH says more should be done to prevent the products being promoted widely on platforms like TikTok. ""The flood of glamorous promotion of vaping on social media is completely inappropriate and social media platforms should take responsibility and turn off the tap,"" said chief executive Deborah Arnott. Colourful disposable vapes are driving the rise in vaping among teenagers, surveys suggest The UK Vaping Industry Association wants the government ""to greatly increase fines to Â£10,000"" every time a shop is caught selling vapes to children. It is also calling for outlets selling vape products to be licensed, and the fee used to fund further trading enforcement efforts by Trading Standards. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said vapes should only be used as a tool for smokers giving up smoking. It said it had put in place ""proportionate regulations for all vape products relating to product safety, labelling and restrictions on advertising"". This means they must not resemble a food or a cosmetic product, and must limit nicotine strength to 20mg/ml. ""We continue to strongly discourage non-smokers and children from using them,"" a spokesperson said. They added there are no current plans to increase the fine issued, but the measure would be kept under review. And the Department for Education said schools had powers under which they could ban vapes, and to confiscate any found on pupils. A government report on vaping among young people and adults in England is due to be published in the coming months. only those aged 18 and over can buy vapes or e-cigarettes certain ingredients, such a caffeine and taurine, are banned nicotine ingredient warnings must appear on packaging packaging should be child-proof all e-cigarette and e-liquids containing nicotine have to be certified by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) before they can be sold in the UK. Search up brands on theMHRA website,external. any product that is not listed should be returned to the shop where it was bought or to your local trading standards office anyone's experience of suspected side-effects from using vapes can be sent to the MHRA via theYellow Card scheme,external nicotine-free e-cigarettes do not have to be certified by the MHRA - they are subject to product safety regulations by Trading Standards Additional reporting by Sarah Rock and Chris Clayton.

'I couldn't remember names or what I did yesterday',"This video can not be played Swimming in the sea is helping some women cope with menopause symptoms Women receive contradictory medical advice on the menopause and a specialist is needed in every health board, campaigners claim. ""It got to the stage where I was so desperate I paid for a private consultation,"" said Lisa Nicholls. She was later referred to a specialist as she lives in one of three Welsh health board areas which offer one. The Welsh government said every health board should provide a full range of menopause services and support. Ms Nicholls, 52, from Newport, said her own menopausal symptoms left her feeling she was losing her mind. House of Commons vows to be 'menopause friendly' ,external' HRT crisis left me unable to work' 'HRT crisis left me unable to work' ""I couldn't remember people's names, or what I did yesterday,"" she said. ""I'd have conversations with people and I'd be like. ""Did we really have that discussion?"" ""It really affected my work life to the point where I gave up my job because I just didn't feel that I could perform. ""At the time I was in a senior position and I just felt like I'd lost my confidence."" She now sits on the Welsh government's menopause task and finish group, representing the charity, Fair Treatment for the Women of Wales, and wants menopause and hormone discussions to be as common as breast or cervical screening. Lisa Nicholls said running helped her cope with symptoms of the menopause ""I would like to see a woman getting to a certain age - say 45 - and a healthcare professional says, 'OK, you're 45 now, your hormones are going to be declining, let's have a chat about how that might be affecting you, and if you can tick any of these boxes.'"" ""It is really as simple as a checklist in terms of what you're experiencing. ""Because it will help with their bone health, heart health - we might see improvements where women are perhaps not getting dementia, Alzheimer's. ""And it's a lot cheaper than treating a woman who's 65 with a broken hip, replacement knees, heart issues and everything else that goes with it. ""Every woman in Wales, in every health board needs access to either really good GP services who specialise in the menopause, or a menopause specialist clinic."" Lisa Nicholls said she's had to fight for the right menopause treatment Last week, the Welsh government published aquality statement on women's health,external, stating it was of ""paramount importance"" for health board services to reflect women's needs, adding that menopause was one of those which required ""significant attention"". It also stated the need to provide care ""as close as possible to home without significant waits"". Likewise,National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance,externalsays women should be referred to menopause specialists if treatments don't improve symptoms or troublesome side effects continue. Referrals can also be considered for those with a higher risk of breast cancer, or where the most suitable treatment isn't clear. Dr Rowena Christmas, a GP in the Wye Valley and chair of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said that menopause was covered in medical school training, as well as the additional three year GP-training, then again during their ongoing professional development. ""The training resources are excellent and we are talking about it a lot as a profession,"" she said. ""The media programmes have been really good to heighten awareness for patients and they're bringing that into our surgery."" Dr Christmas agreed doctors need to be thinking of menopause as a possible diagnosis for women of any age experiencing relevant symptoms. ""But on the flip side you also need to be considering whether they could have a thyroid problem or whether there's something sinister causing the night sweats,"" she added. ""So we need to think big, broad picture and not miss anything else - but absolutely menopause needs to be up there as a possible diagnosis."" She said that larger GP practices will have scope for some to specialise in certain areas. Her own practice has a menopause specialist who has studied for a Masters in the subject. ""Menopause can be devastating for some women - other women will go through it with advice and support and not need any treatment at all. ""And so for those women who are having a difficult time it really is essential that you find a GP that you feel comfortable talking through the issues and you get treatment because it is extremely effective."" Members of the choir Only Menopause Aloud, (l-r) Sue Watt, Sandy Alton and Clare Adams have worked with a team to create a vest that mimics hot flushes. Members of the Cardiff-based choir, Only Menopause Aloud, agreed that access to greater support is needed, as symptoms differ from woman to woman. Clare Adams felt very anxious, with a foggy brain and unable to get her words out. ""My GP said I was either depressed and could be put on anti-depressants, or else try HRT - HRT did the trick,"" said the 58 year old. Whereas 68-year-old Sandy Alton's hot flushes would leave her feeling totally drained. ""I would feel ill at first, almost as though I was going to faint and then suddenly this boiler would go off inside me and the heat would rise up from my stomach."" Sue Watt said she felt ""a fraud"" because the stereotypical hot flushes weren't as big a problem for her. ""It took me a while to work out that I was menopausal simply because of all the other factors,"" she said, listing the ""forgetfulness, tiredness and distraction"". ""But it's something you just brazen through,"" she added, explaining she was able to work her way through it, one day at a time. The choir has worked with menopause support provider, Over The Bloody Moon (OTBM) and Cardiff firm Thread Design to create a ""meno-vest"" to mimic the effects of a hot flush so that others can better appreciate the impact. Sandy Alton said the ""menovest"" was an accurate, nasty reminder of her hot flushes. ""It's very accurate,"" said Sandy after trying it on. ""It was a nasty reminder really."" Kath Turner from Talwrn on Anglesey runs menopause yoga classes, where women can discuss symptoms and tailor sessions to focus on specific issues. ""It provides an opportunity where women can talk to each other - they don't feel so alone and go away with some tools to help themselves. ""Women are beginning to become much more educated and informed around the menopause now, which is great because until fairly recently, women have had to struggle alone, not knowing what is happening to them. ""There's not always been a great deal of help available to them either."" This video can not be played Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith and Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting were among those to try on the 'hot flush' vests The Welsh government said it took women's health very seriously and expected the NHS to provide a full range of services and support for women experiencing the menopause. ""The menopause is covered in GP training and in continuous professional development provided by Health Education and Improvement Wales,"" said a spokesperson. ""Our newly-established menopause expert group, which includes representatives from primary care, secondary care , as well as patient representation, will share best practice and establish a new menopause care pathway across Wales.

You can read more about what's happeninghere. Today's writers were Frances Mao, Zubaidah AbdulJalil, Aoife Walsh, Malu Cursino, Laura Gozzi and Marie Jackson. Our editors were Yvette Tan, Simon Fraser, Andrew Humphrey, Alex Therrien and Chris Giles. Thousands stormed the prime minister's offices in protest It's been an eventful day in Sri Lanka â here's a summary of the key developments:    Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Colombo Gotabaya Rajapaksa (left) and his brother Mahinda Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country in the early hours of Wednesday - a humiliating exit for a man whose family had been in power for nearly two decades. Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office. Read more about Wickremesinghehere. Acting President and PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced an islandwide curfew, to last until 05:00 local time (12:30 BST). A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory.

Days before, hundreds of protesters had stormed his official residence, demanding that he resign over Sri Lanka's economic crisis, which has seen no respite in months. Sharply rising prices had set off mass protests in April, and the growing anger forced Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa - the departing president's elder brother - out of power in May. How did the Rajapaksas, once hailed by many Sri Lankans as heroes, come to be reviled as leaders? Mahinda Rajapaksa was once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a hero for bringing an end to nearly three decades of civil war when the Tamil Tiger rebels were crushed in 2009 during his first term as president. He was compared to Sinhala Buddhist kings at victory parades and mass public events. ""He was the most popular Sinhala Buddhist leader in post-independence Sri Lanka. Some even hailed him as Emperor Mahinda,"" says veteran political analyst Kusal Perera. Read the full storyhere. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had said he would resign today following mass protests over the country's economic crisis that led to his official residence being stormed. There's now just a short time left for him to meet his pledge to step down on Wednesday. Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives on a military jet with his wife and two security officials overnight. The man he appointed to take over as Sri Lanka's president on an acting basis, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, has been facing a chaotic situation after thousands of protesters stormed his offices demanding the immediate resignations of him and Rajapaksa. Wickremesinghe has ordered the police and the military to do whatever is necessary to restore order. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled to the Maldives, bringing to an apparent end his family's near two-decade dominance of the country after mass demonstrations over the island's economic crisis. Protests came to a head last weekend when hundreds of thousands of people took over key government buildings in Colombo, including the president's official residence. But Rajapaksaâs decision to leave his ally Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in charge as acting president triggered more demonstrations, with protesters storming the PM's office demanding that he go too. Wickremesinghe, whose private residence in Colombo was set ablaze on Saturday, has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister ""who is acceptable to both the government and opposition"". Many protesters had said they would continue their demonstrations until both Rajapaksa and Wickremesinghe have resigned from government. Police tried to stop the break-in with tear gas Our colleague Tessa Wong has been closely following the developments of a day that saw protesters break in to  the prime minister's office after their president fled the country. Thousands began streaming towards the prime minister's compound. Above their heads, a military helicopter flew low passes, prompting howls of anger and middle fingers from the crowd. Angry protesters were attempting to break into the grounds of the compound, as rows of poker-faced soldiers and riot police lining the walls looked on. Occasionally a canister of tear gas would be fired at the crowd, but it did little to deter them. Protesters climbed up on the black gates to the compound and started rocking them back and forth to tear them off their hinges. The metallic thumps echoed down the avenue to cheers, which only intensified when protesters succeeded in ripping the gates down. They were met by a wall of soldiers. This appeared to unnerve the military. Suddenly the crowd was pelted with a volley of tear gas canisters shot from inside the compound. The avenue was wreathed in smoke. Protesters screamed in defiance, and began picking up the canisters with their bare hands or traffic cones and hurling them back into the compound. Read more from Tessahere.  Ranil Wickremesinghe has suddenly been thrust from prime minister to the country's acting president, but who is he? A lawyer by profession, Wickremesinghe comes from an affluent family of politicians and businessmen. He was elected to parliament in 1977 and quickly moved up the party ladder, first serving as prime minister from 1993 to 1994. In 1994, he became leader of the United National Party (UNP)when Gamini Dissanayake was killed by suspected rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. He himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. Wickremesinghe improved his party's image by appointing a disciplinary commission to get rid of corrupt party members - and tried to improve his own image with new haircuts. Around the turn of the century, he was considered a contender to be president, but his star waned. He was prime minister in 2019 when at least 250 people were killed in the  deadly Easter Sunday bombings. He blamed being ""out of the loop"" on intelligence warnings. In the last election, his once ruling UNP scraped just one parliamentary seat, meaning he was its sole representative in parliament - and fuelling  opponents' claims that he lacked legitimacy for office.

A statementpublished by the government,externalsaid that the PM considers the measure ""necessary to maintain public order"". Sri Lankaâs acting president and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has asked parliamentâs Speaker to nominate a new prime minister, his media team has said. Mr Wickremesinghe asked for the new PM to be someone who is ""acceptable to both the government and opposition"", according to a statement. Protesters, angered by the country's severe economic crisis, have sought the ousting of both President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Mr Wickremesinghe. The former fled abroad overnight before naming the latter to act in his stead, but he has yet to formally resign.  Anbarasan EthirajanReporting from Colombo Sri Lanka is in danger of sliding into more chaos - and even anarchy. For the second time in less than a week protesters broke into a highly-secure government building - this time the office of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He is now the countryâs acting leader after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives. But protesters want Wickremesinghe to step down as well and see him as someone close to the Rajapaksa family. It is not clear yet whether President Rajapaksa has sent his resignation letter - it's been promised today. The Speaker of parliament says MPs will vote to choose a new president on 20 July. But Rajapaksaâs party, the Sri Lanka Peopleâs Front, has a sizeable majority in parliament. If Wickremesinghe is once again elected with the support of MPs from the governing party, then protests are likely to continue. Protesters are now getting used to storming government buildings to put pressure on political leaders and security forces have not fully been resisting them so far. If Wickremesinghe uses force to disperse protesters, itâs going to ignite more tensions. That will also pit the security forces against the protesters. Senior military leaders maintain that they will abide by the constitution. But things could get ugly if no compromise is reached soon. We're hearing from opposition politicians that the official letter of resignation from outgoing President Gotabaya Rajapaksa may not be a long way off now. Harsha de Silva, a representative of the SJB party, has told BBC's Newshour that fellow opposition party leaders met the Sri Lankan Speaker of parliament earlier today. The Speaker told them the letter had still not been received but he ""would receive it before midnight"", Sri Lankan time. That's 19:30 BST. De Silva described the unanimous demand of opposition
party leaders for the prime minister to step down, and said if that were not to happen, then the
president ""should dismiss him before he resigns"". In the meeting, De Silva called for the Speaker to take on the office of
president to allow for a peaceful transition of power. Sri Lankan nationals living in the Maldives have held protests urging the Maldivian government to stop providing a haven to the fleeing Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Protesters carrying flags and placards criticised the country for allowing the outgoing leader to stay there. A Maldivian newspaper said the foreign ministry had not commented on Rajapaksa's arrival, and that the issue was polarising the local population. A source told the BBC that Rajapaksa will not remain in the Maldives and intends to travel on to a third country. The Bar Association of Sri Lanka has urged political leaders and protesters to calm tensions in the crisis-hit country. The body, which represents the legal profession in Sri Lanka, said it was ""deeply disturbed"" at protesters' occupation of the prime minister's offices and asked for them to be returned to the authorities. In a statement to the media, its president Saliya Pieris called on the Speaker, the PM and all political leaders and citizens to ""understand the fragile situation of the nation"" and act with ""a sense of sacrifice in the best interests of the country"". He also urged protesters to remain calm and leave room for the ""peaceful transition of power"" which leaders have promised. Sri Lanka's outgoing leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country to the Maldives overnight with his wife and two security officials. Sri Lanka has always had close relations with its island chain neighbour in
the Indian Ocean â the Maldives is just a 90-minute flight away. And both nations have maintained positive diplomatic and
economic relations since their independence from the British Empire. For example, Maldivesâ
army is trained by Sri Lanka's military. But the Rajapaksa family in particular have strong
ties to the Maldives, and are friendly with the islandâs former
president and current parliamentary speaker, Mohamed Nasheed. Some local media reported that Nasheed was waiting on
the tarmac at Male airport overnight to receive President Rajapaksa. There have also been reports that the Rajapaksas have family
homes in the Maldives and other assets based there. Our World Service colleagues have been hearing from Harini Amarasuriya, an opposition MP for the National People's Power party. Speaking from Sri Lanka's capital Colombo, she says her party are standing with the people, the protesters, because their demands for resignations of the prime minister and the president are fair. Without their resignations, she tells BBC's Newshour, people will not get off the streets, adding that a meeting of party leaders is currently taking place. Leaders have to start understanding the seriousness of the people's movement, she says. ""This is not some potty little protest movement. People have been protesting for months and been really committed to this whole movement. ""Leaders have to heed the voices of the people and step down,"" she says. This video can not be played Watch the moment protesters surged into the prime minister's office Earlier this morning protesters breached a security cordon protecting the the prime minister's office in Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. For hours the demonstrators were in a tense standoff with police, who fired tear gas in an attempt to disperse the crowd and keep them out of the building. But after several attempts the crowd managed to tear down parts of the gate and climb into the grounds. As we've been reporting, Sri Lanka's president Gotabaya Rajapaksa has fled the country and said he will step down after months of protests over soaring prices and a lack of food and fuel. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, meaning it doesn't have enough funds available to buy goods from other countries. In May, Sri Lankafailed to make a payment on its foreign debtfor the first time in its history. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. It also says tourists were frightened off by a series of deadly bomb attacks in 2019. However, many experts blame economic mismanagement. Read more here. Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled to the Maldives overnight following mass protests over the island's economic crisis. He arrived in Male at around 03:00 local time (22:00 GMT), the BBC understands. Rajapaksa, his wife and two bodyguards took a military aircraft with him, sources told AFP. It is thought Rajapaksa, who enjoys immunity from prosecution while he is president, fled to the Maldives to avoid the possibility of arrest by the new government. He is now believed to be travelling to a third country. It is not yet clear where exactly he is going to, but there are rumours it could be Singapore or Dubai. In his absence, he has appointed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, an ally of his, as acting president. Rajapaksa had been in hiding after protesters captured his office and home on Saturday. He has pledged to resign today. While it hasn't happened yet, the parliamentary Speaker, Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, said earlier that Rajapaksa plans to hand over his resignation letter today. It will bring an end to the rule of the Rajapaksa family that has dominated politics in Sri Lanka for the last two decades. His brother, former Finance Minister Basil Rajapaksa, has also fled Sri Lanka and is said to be heading to the US. Sri Lanka's defence chief has called for calm and urged the public to co-operate to maintain law and order amid the continuing unrest in the country. In a video address, General Shavendra Silva said he had asked the Speaker of parliament to call for party leaders to meet to ""decide the way
forward till a new president is sworn in and notify us and the
public by this evening"". He also said that the armed forces and the police would abide by the constitution. But the situation in the country is volatile. Armed police earlier fired tear gas at the crowd storming the PM's office, the latest key public building to be occupied by protesters. Many people wonder if the security forces would keep on the sidelines if things really get out of control. At this time, Sri Lanka is in uncharted territory. Welcome - here is a recap of the dayâs events in Sri Lanka, where it's approaching 18:00. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sir Mo 'relieved' Home Office won't take actionIt comes after Sir Mo Farah revealed he was trafficked to the UK as a child.,"This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo responds to the Home Office's response not to take action Sir Mo Farah has said he is relieved that the Home Office will not take action against him after he revealed he was trafficked into the UK. The Olympic star disclosed on Monday that his real name is Hussein Abdi Kahin, but he got British citizenship under the name Mohamed Farah. Mohamed Farah was the name given to him by the people who brought him into the UK illegally. The Home Office told BBC News it would not investigate Sir Mo. ""It makes me relieved,"" he said in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is my country. If it wasn't for [my PE teacher] Alan and the people who supported me throughout my childhood then maybe I wouldn't even have the courage to do this. ""There's a lot of people that I owe my life to - particularly my wife, who has been very supportive throughout my career, and who gave me the strength to come and talk about it, telling me it's okay to do this."" Sir Mo has received supportive messages from people across the world and he said the reaction to the revelations has been ""incredible"". ""It was always my story,"" he told Today. ""I wasn't even comfortable enough to talk about it with my family. I couldn't talk about it publicly. It has taken me a long time to come to this, but I'm glad I've made this documentary to show people the reality of what really happened to me as a child."" The Real Mo Farah Mo Farah reveals the truth about his childhood, the journey he made to the UK as a young boy, and the subsequent years that led to him winning two gold medals at the 2012 Olympics. Watch now on BBC iPlayer The Metropolitan Police said specialist officers were assessing the available information about what had happened to Sir Mo. In a statement, the force said ""at this time"" it had received no specific reports. The Met added that it believed there were victims of modern slavery, including children, ""in every borough across London"". This video can not be played Watch: Sir Mo Farah describes calling his mother after years of separation Sir Mo's wife Tania said she experienced a ""whole range of emotions"" after hearing about his true background. ""My first reaction was heartbreak and sadness for him. I just immediately pictured nine-year-old Mo, and being so helpless and vulnerable. And then equally I felt angry at the people that did that to him, that put him through that,"" she said. She said Sir Mo is ""now finally giving himself permission to feel those feelings of hurt and painâ¦. this documentary has helped him to deal with that... It's got to be a good thing. It's a form of therapy."" Sir Mo Farah reveals he was trafficked to UK as child Sir Mo praised for trafficking disclosure Sir Mo describes being reunited with his mum Legally, the government can remove a person's British nationality if their citizenship was obtained through fraud. But a Home Office official told BBC News it would not take action over Sir Mo's nationality, as it is assumed children are not complicit when their citizenship is gained by deception. Speaking about other victims of child trafficking, Sir Mo - a four-time Olympic champion for Team GB - told BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Amol Rajan: ""No child wants to be in that situation. I had the choice made for me, and so young. I'm just grateful for every chance I've got in Britain to embrace my country, and I'm proud to represent my country the way I did. ""That's all I could do within my control - I had no control when I was younger over where I went. That decision was made for me and taken away from me."" Sir Mo told the story of being trafficked in a documentary from BBC and Red Bull Studios, which airs on Wednesday but has been seen by BBC News. Confiding in teacher Alan Watkinson about his plight was a key moment in Sir Mo's life As a teenager Sir Mo said he confided in his PE teacher, who helped him to be fostered by another family. The teacher also helped him to obtain British citizenship and a passport so that Sir Mo could compete in international athletics competitions. After receiving widespread praise for speaking out, Sir Mo told the Today programme: ""I'm just happy to share what I've gone through and [has] made me the man I am today."" Sir Mo told the documentary that he wanted to tell his story to challenge public perceptions of trafficking and slavery. ""I had no idea there was so many people who are going through exactly the same thing that I did. It just shows how lucky I was,"" he says. ""What really saved me, what made me different, was that I could run."" The woman who brought Sir Mo to London has been approached by the BBC for comment, but has not responded. Asked by Today if he was in touch with the woman or had heard from her, Sir Mo said: ""The [documentary's] production team contacted the lady and she didn't want to say anything, and that's all I know. I'm not in touch with her and I don't want to be."" You can watch The Real Mo Farah on BBC One at 21:00 BST oron BBC iPlayerat 06:00 BST on Wednesday 13 July (UK only).

Firms urge PM hopefuls to focus on growth and tax,"Candidates to be the UK's next prime minister should focus on growth and an overhaul of the tax system over quick cuts, a business group has said. Promises of tax reductions feature heavily in the leadership campaigns but the CBI business group said the wrong cuts could fuel inflation further. In an open letter, CBI director general Tony Danker called for ""serious, credible and bold plans for growth"". Labour's Rachel Reeves said candidates should ""seriously heed these warnings"". The race to elect a new Conservative leader and prime minister comes at a time when the UK is grappling with  inflation driven by rising costs of food, energy and fuel. The OECD think tank forecast in June that UK economy will grow more slowly than expected this year and will stagnate next year. And in April the International Monetary Fund said that the UK will be the slowest growing G7 economy in 2023. Last week, the government's independent forecaster warned that the UK debt was on an ""unsustainable path"" unless spending is tightened and taxes are raised. Current government plans to increase corporation tax from 19% to 25% in April are not proving popular with businesses, and some candidates have promised to cancel it. But the CBI said a permanent extension to extra tax reliefs on investment - due to expire in April - and an overhaul of business rates are more important to create investment and growth. PM rivals battle over tax cutting pledges Tax cut beauty contest could turn ugly Mr Danker wrote in an open letter to the leadership candidates: ""Growth that relies on only government or household consumption is doomed to fail, especially at a time of rising inflation and high debt."" He added: ""Sustainable economic growth must be at the heart of your manifestos. ""Without it, leadership ambitions cannot be met nor those of the British people and businesses."" Mr Danker wrote that while the corporation tax hike should be ""revisited"" given the wider weakening economy, leadership candidates should look at the UK's entire business tax regime as a whole. The plea comes as the Conservative leadership contenders outline their campaign policies, with tax front and centre for each. Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi pledged on Monday to cut income tax in 2023 and 2024 and abolish green levies on energy bills for two years, while Foreign Secretary Liz Truss vowed to cut taxes ""from day one"". Jeremy Hunt, who has been both health and foreign secretary, told BBC Breakfast he wants to ""cut all taxes"". But former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is launching his bid to become prime minister with a promise to only cut taxes once inflation has been brought back under control. Setting out its own plan to boost the economy, the CBI told the would-be prime ministers that long-term growth ambitions are vital. Mr Danker wrote that the country faces ""serious challenges"" such as ""eye-watering inflation putting households and enterprises under real pressure"". But he added it is also caught in a longer-term trap of low growth and higher productivity was the only sustainable way forward. This would ""achieve higher standards of living and tackle the fiscal challenges of an ageing population and decarbonisation while lowering the UK's high tax burden,"" he said. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: ""The level of unfunded tax cuts currently being bandied about by [leadership hopefuls] would blow a massive hole in the public finances. ""Instead of setting out serious plans to help people with the cost of living crisis or grow our economy, we are presented with the extraordinary spectacle of a Tory tombola of tax cuts - with no explanation of what public services will be cut, or how else they'd be paid for.""

Eight left in race to be the next prime minister,"This video can not be played WATCH: Top eight Tory leadership candidates announced Eight candidates are left in the race to lead the Conservative Party - and become the next prime minister - after former health secretary Sajid Javid pulled out of the contest. To stay in the race, leadership hopefuls had to get support of at least 20 Tory MPs by Tuesday evening. Minutes before the deadline, Mr Javid withdrew, saying he ""looked forward to seeing the debate unfold"". Junior minister Rehman Chishti also pulled out of the contest. The remaining candidates are Kemi Badenoch, Suella Braverman, Jeremy Hunt, Penny Mordaunt, Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss, Tom Tugendhat and Nadhim Zahawi. Trade Minister Ms Mordaunt is expected to launch her campaign on Wednesday morning. Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? Don't demonise Johnson, Sunak warns Tories The first round of voting will take place on Wednesday from 13:30 to 15:30 BST and any candidate who gets less than 30 votes from their fellow MPs will have to drop out. Over the next few days, further votes will take place to whittle the number of candidates down to a final two. These two will then go to a full ballot of around 160,000 Conservative Party members over the summer. The result is expected on 5 September. Dropping out of the contest, Mr Javid - who helped trigger Boris Johnson's downfall when he quit the cabinet last week - said he had ""set out the values and policies I think are right for the future of our great country"". ""I believe the party must now look outwards, not inwards, if we are to win again. ""I look forward to seeing the debate unfold and to see colleagues working together as a united Conservative Party once the leadership election is concluded."" At the Tory leadership hustings - that began at 19:00 in Parliament - roughly half of the audience will not be persuadable because they've already said who they're backing. Others, like Priti Patel and Sajid Javid, have said they are yet to make up their minds. But only part of their decision will be based on the performance this evening. Some already have in mind who they might be potentially backing, but if someone was to come in with a better job offer dependent on their support, that might persuade them. It's not entirely going to be a merit-based process. The hustings may be crucial for a few MPs choosing how to vote - but there will be other considerations, including personal ones, at play. Earlier in the day, Mr Chishti, the other candidate to drop out,confirmed,externalhe had not been able to secure the required number of nominations, adding that his campaign had ""very few resources"". He said he had ""given everything I possibly can in this period to step up and serve our great country"". On Tuesday morning, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also ditched his own campaign in order to support Mr Sunak. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Priti Patel said she would not join the race, despite having already garnered some support from MPs. Those left in the race took part in the first hustings taking place in Parliament on Tuesday evening. They had 12 minutes each to speak, but no cameras are allowed in to cover it. After the initial list of contenders was announced, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and loyal supporter of Mr Johnson accused Mr Sunak's team of using what Ms Dorries called ""dirty tricks/ a stitch up/dark arts"" by trying to make sure Jeremy Hunt made it over the first hurdle. Responding to suggestions that supporters of the former chancellor had lent their nominations to Mr Hunt, Ms Dorries said: ""Team Rishi want the candidate they know they can definitely beat in the final two and that is Jeremy Hunt."" A source close to Mr Sunak's supporters told PA News the claim was ""complete nonsense"" adding: ""That sort of behaviour just isn't happening"". Mr Hunt also denied the claim telling LBC Radio: ""We are running completely independent campaigns.""

Do rivals tax pledges add up?,"One of the key areas of disagreement between the two candidates in the race to be prime minister - Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss - is tax. The contest comes amid warnings from the Bank of England of a long recession later this year, and big expected increases in energy bills this winter. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) economic think tank, said he was surprised not to be hearing more from the candidates about help for families. ""They're going to have to find many more billions to support households,"" he told BBC News. ""This is a much bigger increase in energy bills than was expected even a few months ago when the support packages were announced and that's not going to be helped by the sorts of tax cuts that are being talked about."" So, what are the tax cuts being promised? What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak row over recession warning in latest TV clash Who could be the next prime minister? When will we know who the new PM is? What has she pledged and how much would it cost? scrap April's National Insurance rise:Â£13bn a year cancel planned corporation tax rise:Â£17bn a year temporarily suspend green levies on energy bills (she claims this would knock ""around Â£150"" off energy bills):Â£8.5bn a year Total estimated cost:Â£38.5bn a year National Insurance(NI) is a tax on earnings and self-employed profits - paid by all workers, until they reach the state pension age. It is also paid by employers. Since April, they have been paying more in NI - an extra 1.25p in the pound. The rise - announced by Mr Sunak when he was chancellor - was initially to help the NHS clear its backlog and then to help fund social care. To try to ease its impact, Mr Sunak then raised the threshold at which employees people start paying NI from Â£9,880 to Â£12,570 a year. National Insurance: Will tax changes save me money? Reversing the NI rise would cost about Â£13bn a year,according to,externalthe IFS. Corporation taxis a tax on the profits of businesses. The tax rate is currently 19% but it is due to increase to 25% in April 2023. The government estimates that cancelling this rise would cost Â£17bn a year. However, the IFS points out that doesn't take into account whether lowering tax could lead to increased investment by companies. ""We would therefore expect the long-run cost to be considerably lower than Â£17bn a year,"" the IFS said, ""though the effect would certainly not be big enough for the tax cut to pay for itself"". Ms Truss hopes that extra investment would stimulate growth, although that would be difficult because the Bank of England says there is not currently much spare capacity in the economy, which means there is not a lot of scope for the production of more goods and services. Green levies The government makes energy companies add an environmental and social element on to energy bills. This pays for things like schemes to help fund renewable energy and provide grants for insulation. They make up about Â£153 of an average dual fuel bill, according to Ofgem. In 2020-21, the levies raised Â£12.2bn, of which about 70% (Â£8.5bn) went on environmental programmes. Ms Truss has said she is still committed to the net zero target, so is likely to have to fund the projects another way. There is little detail of how Ms Truss would fund all this, although she has said that she wants to pay off the government's Covid debt more slowly. Her team said that up to Â£8.8bn a year could be saved by paying public sector workers different amounts depending on where they were based, but she quickly abandoned the policy after widespread criticism. Why did Liz Truss U-turn over public sector pay? BBC debate: Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak fact-checked In the BBC debate, she said that her tax cuts could be paid for because: ""There is already headroom of approximately Â£30bn in the budget."" The headroom is the amount of money the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimated in March that the government could spend without breaking its own borrowing rules. But the IFS said that changes since March, with the economy now expected to go into recession, meant this Â£30bn figure was now ""massively out of date"". On the prospect of a recession later this year, Ms Truss said: ""What the Bank of England have said... is of course extremely worrying, but it is not inevitable. We can change the outcome and we can make it more likely that the economy grows."" Paul Johnson said: ""I think we're going to struggle to avoid a recession and certainly you're not going to avoid a recession by doing what she seems to be suggesting, which is big tax cuts. That's more likely to stimulate inflation and create a bigger recession later on."" What has he pledged and how much would it cost? Reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero:Â£4.3bn a year Cut 3p off income tax by late 2029: aboutÂ£19bn a year Mr Sunak was chancellor until 5 July (when he resigned), so announcing wholesale changes to his own policies could be seen as politically problematic. He launched his leadership bid saying: ""Once we have gripped inflation, I will get the tax burden down. It is a question of 'when', not 'if'."" The OBR said in March that on current plans, by 2026-27 the UK's overall tax burden would be at its highest level since the late 1940s. Mr Sunak has promised to cut the rate of VAT on domestic fuel bills from 5% to zero for one year from October, if average bills rise above Â£3,000 a year. At the moment, VAT costs Â£94 of an average bill. Mr Sunak claim his measure will save an average household Â£160 - although clearly it depends on how much the energy price cap rises by. The cost of the policy would be about Â£4.3bn for the year, depending again on how much prices rise. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? Could VAT on gas and electricity be cut to zero? In May, Mr Sunak rejected the idea of a VAT cut, saying in Parliament: ""A flat rate payment has the benefit of being more progressive than VAT, which obviously gives very high, or higher, tax discounts to those who are particularly wealthy or have large houses and energy bills."" As Chancellor, he announced that all households in England, Scotland and Wales would receive Â£400 towards their fuel bills between October and March. Details of Â£400 energy payment to households revealed When he was chancellor, Mr Sunak announced that income tax would come down from 20p in the pound to 19p - in April 2024. He has now said he will cut another 3p in the pound by the end of the next Parliament, expected to be by the end of 2029. That's likely to cost in the region of Â£19bn a year. ""This is a very substantial tax cut,"" the IFS said. ""But it is still considerably smaller than the net tax rise announced by Mr Sunak as Chancellor, which was comfortably more than twice as large."" Mr Sunak said that it would be funded by a combination of growth in the economy and lower spending, promising not to increase debt to fund the tax cut. He has not specified where the cuts in spending would be. He plans to go ahead with increases to corporation tax, but says he is planning to bring in ways to make it cheaper for companies to invest at the same time.
