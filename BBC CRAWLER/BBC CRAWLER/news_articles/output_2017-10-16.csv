North Korean hackers hit UK TV company,"Kim Jong-un's officials described Opposite Number as being ""slanderous"" North Korean hackers targeted a British television company making a drama about the country, it has emerged. The series - due to be written by an Oscar-nominated screenwriter - has been shelved. In August 2014, Channel 4 announced what it said would be a new ""bold and provocative"" drama series. Titled Opposite Number, the programme's plot involved a British nuclear scientist taken prisoner in North Korea. The production firm involved - Mammoth Screen - subsequently had its computers attacked. The project has not moved forward because of a failure to secure funding, the company says. North Korean officials had responded in anger when details of the TV series were first revealed. Pyongyang described the plot as a ""slanderous farce"" as it called on the British government to pull the series in order to avoid damaging relations. The North Koreans did more than protest though - they hacked into the computer networks of the company behind the show. The incidentwas first reported by the New York Times,external, which cited Channel 4 as the main target.  However, the BBC understands that it was actually Mammoth Screen that was hit by hackers. Opposite Number's screenwriter Matt Charman was nominated for an Oscar for the 2015 Spielberg movie Bridge of Spies The attack did not inflict any damage but the presence of North Korean hackers on the system caused widespread alarm over what they might do. ""They were running around with their hair on fire,"" a TV executive from another company told the BBC, describing the level of concern. British intelligence was also aware of the attack. The concern was compounded because Sony Pictures experienced a significant cyber-attack in November 2014. A group called the Guardians of Peace claimed it was behind it but US officials said they believed North Korea was responsible. That attack was also in retaliation for a drama - in this case the planned release of the film The Interview, a comedy in which the North Korean leader was assassinated. The studio had its emails stolen and publicly released but also had a significant portion of its computer network destroyed by the attackers. The film was eventually released online amid concerns that cinemas would not show it because of threats. Sony pulled The Interview from US cinemas after it was hacked It also led to a strong reaction from the Obama White House, including the imposition of sanctions. There was no commensurate complaint from the British government, despite officials knowing that a UK company had also been targeted - although not affected in the same way as Sony Pictures. In the UK, Opposite Number has been shelved. The drama was due to be the second commission to come out of Channel 4's newly formed international drama division. At the time, Mammoth Screen and its distribution partner, ITV Studios Global Entertainment, said they were seeking an international partner. But a spokeswoman for ITV Studios - which purchased Mammoth Screen in 2015 - told the BBC in February that ""the co-production hasn't progressed because third-party funding has not been secured"". Those involved will not comment on whether the failure to attract funding and move forward with the production was in any way linked to the cyber-attack. Mammoth Screen went on to make the ITV/PBS series Victoria The cyber-threats from North Korea have not stopped. Its hackers have proved increasingly aggressive and adept, targeting banks to steal money and media in South Korea. British officials also believe North Korea was behind the Wannacry ransomware that struck around the world in May, with significant parts of the NHS affected, although there has been no official response from the UK government to this incident. But the revelations about an attack on a TV production company may raise further concerns about what North Korea is capable of and how companies in the UK - and the British government - react when it happens.

Three killed as storm sweeps into Ireland,"This video can not be played High winds caused damage across Ireland Two men and a woman have been killed as the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia hit the British Isles. As hurricane-force gusts battered the Republic of Ireland, one woman and a man died in separate incidents when trees fell on their cars. A second man died in a chainsaw accident while attempting to remove a tree felled by the storm. Thousands of homes and businesses lost power in Northern Ireland and Wales, along with 360,000 in the Republic. The power company Northern Ireland Electricity said 15,000 households in the province should prepare to spend Monday night without power. Police in Scotland say the storm has hit Dumfries and Galloway and it is forecast to continue over the region into the evening. And in Cumbria, police in Barrow closed roads around Barrow AFC's stadium after wind damaged its roof. Damage caused by Storm Ophelia in Cork Cumbria Police said it was dealing with ""numerous incidents"" related to the high winds, which reached up to 70mph in the area. The force had received reports of roofs and debris on the roads and overhead cables which had come down and it was urging people to only make essential travel. In Wales, roads and railway lines have been closed and a gust of 90mph was recorded in Aberdaron, Gwynedd. The Welsh Ambulance service said a woman has been injured after being hit by a falling branch in Wrexham. In Ireland, the woman, in her 50s, died near Aglish, County Waterford, and a female passenger, in her 70s, was injured. Her injuries were not believed to be life-threatening, the Gardai, Ireland's police force, said. One of the men died near Dundalk, Co Louth, after his car was struck by a tree at about 14:45 BST, the Gardai said. The other man, in his 30s, was killed in Cahir, Co Tipperary. All road users were urged to stay indoors and not travel unless their journey was absolutely necessary. Flights were also disrupted as several UK planes were forced to land or divert after reports of a ""smoke smell"" linked to weather conditions. Great Storm of 1987: The day 18 people were killed Red sun phenomenon 'caused by Hurricane Ophelia' 'Smoke smell' forces flights to land This video can not be played A reporter at the scene is caught in Ophelia's wind BBC Weather said the strongest winds recorded so far were at Roches Point, near Cork in the Republic of Ireland, where they reached 97mph. Ireland's meteorological service said its highest gust was 109mph at Fastnet Rock. The Met Office's amber warning for Northern Ireland, western Wales and western parts of Scotland is still in force for wind. Forecasters are predicting that the far south-west of Scotland will see winds of 80mph  on Monday evening, followed by 60mph gusts over Glasgow and the central belt in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The main danger facing Scottish commuters in the morning would be debris on roads, they said. Other parts of the UK have seen unseasonably warm temperatures. Andskies have turned red and yellowas Ophelia drags dust from the Sahara through the atmosphere. An amber warning is in force in Northern Ireland Waves crashed onto Penzance seafront in Cornwall It could be several days before power is restored to some homes in the Republic of Ireland,ESB Networks,externalhas warned. The roof of Cork's football stadium has also been blown off by the winds. Are you affected by Ophelia?

BBC Ireland correspondent Chris Page said it would be the most severe storm to hit Ireland in half a century. Amber warning for Scotland Storm closes schools and cuts power in Wales The Irish Republic's Met Eireann said the storm was forecast to continue travelling north over western parts of  Ireland, with ""violent and destructive gusts"" of 75mph to 93mph expected countrywide. It also warned of possible flooding due to heavy rain and storm surges. ""There is a danger to life and property,"" it said. It has issued a red alert for the country. In England,three flood warnings,external- meaning flooding is expected - have been issued in the South West, and there are several flood alerts - meaning flooding is possible - across other parts of the country. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency,externalhas put a series of flood alerts and warnings in place for south-west Scotland. A trampoline was blown away by strong winds in Cork, Republic of Ireland In other developments: Hundreds of flights in and out of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were cancelled on Monday, including from Manchester and Edinburgh airports. On the Isle of Man, the mail plane was grounded As the storm headed into England, flights were diverted from Leeds to Manchester. Five flights due to take off from Leeds were cancelled All schools and further education colleges in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are closed. The respective education authorities said they will remain closed on Tuesday All schools in Anglesey and Pembrokeshire have closed early along with some in Gwynedd. Bangor University and Aberystwyth University have closed for Monday afternoon The storm hit Land's End leaving these two dogs windswept And at Trearddur Bay, Wales strong winds whipped up sea foam on to the road Allow Twitter content?

Comedian Sean Hughes dies aged 51,"This video can not be played Sean Hughes: A career in comedy Irish stand-up star and BBC quiz show panellist Sean Hughes has died aged 51. Richard Bucknall, his former agent and promoter, said the ""formidable"" comic died in hospital on Monday and would be remembered for his ""superb wit"". Hughes was a team captain on Never Mind the Buzzcocks on BBC Two and had his own Channel 4 sitcom, Sean's Show. Fellow comedians, including Al Murray, Katy Brand and Jason Manford, have been paying tribute to the performer, who was also a writer and actor. Hughes (right) with fellow Never Mind the Buzzcocks regulars Phill Jupitus (left) and Mark Lamarr In 1990, Hughes - then 24 - became the youngest person to win the coveted Perrier Award - now known as the Edinburgh Comedy Award - at the Edinburgh Festival. ""I was told that I had won the Perrier award as I walked off stage after another sweaty performance,"" Hughes later wrotein The Guardian,external. ""The judging panel rushed on to the stage to congratulate me. ""'Will it go to his head?'. I doubt it. If the panel had made it 10 minutes earlier, they would have seen two people walking out of my award-winning show."" Nica Burns, director of the awards, remembered him as ""a huge talent"" and ""a very good writer"" who had ""instinctive timing from day one"". Comedian Al Murray recalled being inspired by the star's off-beat humour. ""Sean Hughes won the Perrier the summer I decided to try being a comic,"" he said. ""He was being daft, meta, ironic and Byronic all at once, after a decade when stand-up had reinvented itself. ""He made stand-up look fun, glamorous and above all a creative place where you could play. It's terribly sad news to hear of his passing."" Katy Brand described him as ""a brilliant comedian"".

Jack Dee said he had ""started on the circuit with him back in the day,external"", while Jim Moir - aka Vic Reeves - said his death was a ""sad loss,external"". And TV and radio presenter Dermot O'Leary said Hughes was ""a genuinely lovely, clever man,external"". His stand-up work earned him the Perrier Award Hughes had a varied career, including a role in the hit film The Commitments, in which he played Dave, a talent scout for Eejit Records. The London-born Irish star also played station master Mr Perks in the award-winning London play, The Railway Children. To many, though, he will be best known for the six years he spent on Never Mind the Buzzcocks matching wits with Phill Jupitus and Mark Lamarr. Kate Phillips, the BBC's controller of entertainment commissioning, said his ""unique wit, dry delivery and ability to engage"" had helped make it ""one of the most memorable panel shows of all time."" The Commitments:Hughes played Dave, an A&R man for Eejit Records, in Alan Parker's classic 1991 film The Commitments. He also had roles in Snakes and Ladders, Puckoon and The Butcher Boy Sean's Show:He was the loveable loser in his own surreal sitcom, in which he received messages from God on his answering machine, spoke to a spider who was actually Elvis Presley and made catchphrases out of saying ""hiya!"" and ""buh bye"" Never Mind the Buzzcocks:Between 1996 and 2002, he was one of the team captains on the madcap BBC music quiz, poking fun at the boy band members and minor celebrities who appeared alongside him BBC 6 Music:When BBC 6 Music launched in 2002, Hughes hosted its Sunday morning show, The Sunday Lie In, which promised ""informed cynicism, easy listening and dysfunctional pop"" Coronation Street:In 2007, he spent a couple of months on Coronation Street playing womanising travelling salesman Pat, who started an affair with Eileen Grimshaw Novelist:Off-screen, he wrote books including It's What He Would've Wanted, following an alienated thirty-something searching for answers after his father's suicide, and The Detainees, about a man who decides to take revenge on an old school bully. On TV, he also starred in ITV series The Last Detective, where he played Mod Lewis, friend to Peter Davison's title character, DC ""Dangerous"" Davies. As well as his role as Pat on Coronation Street, he also appeared in BBC One's Casualty in 2015. Hugheslast tweeted,externalon 8 October to say he was in hospital. He is survived by two brothers, Alan and Martin. A cause of death has not been confirmed. I went to the hospital with my psoriasis. They gave me a DVD of The Singing Detective and said ""Good luck with your life"". I went into one of those cheesy bars the other day. Or a delicatessen as you'd call it. I thought when I was 41, I would be married with kids. Well, to be honest I thought I would be married with weekend access. I know that the English always say that Irish pubs are so friendly.

Facebook buys weeks-old compliments app,"The tbh app had been downloaded five million times in nine weeks An app that encourages teens to be nice to each other has been acquired by Facebook for an undisclosed fee. The app - called tbh, meaning ""to be honest"" - is just nine weeks old, but had already been downloaded five million times. The app's creators said,externalit will remain a standalone program but will now have more resources thanks to Facebook. ""We were compelled by the ways they could help us realise tbhâs vision and bring it to more people,"" tbh said. According to start-up news site TechCrunch,external, the deal was for ""less than $100m"", and tbh's four person team would become Facebook employees. One expert commented that Facebook keeps a close eye over new companies and is willing to pay a premium to buy them rather than risk them developing into a threat. ""This is the latest example of Facebook snapping up a start-up that could potentially game-change the way people consume social media and erode its own user base,"" commented Prof Mark Skilton from Warwick Business School. ""Tbh appeals to the teen market - which we know is a very fickle age group - and Facebook knows that it and other apps like it can go viral and explode in popularity very quickly. ""So, this can be seen as a protective measure, and $100m is the equivalent of an account sheet rounding error - it's no money to them."" In a statement, Facebook said: ""tbh and Facebook share a common goal of building community and enabling people to share in ways that bring us closer together. ""Weâre impressed by the way tbh is doing this by using polling and messaging, and with Facebookâs resources tbh can continue to expand and build positive experiences."" Tbh said the app's success was a sign of teenagers craving more positive interactions online. ""While the last decade of the internet has been focused on open communication, the next milestone will be around meeting peopleâs emotional needs,"" it said. The acquisition has been welcomed by a leading anti-bullying charity - but it added that other efforts were still required. ""We are encouraged to see Facebook taking further steps to create a more positive atmosphere online,"" said a spokeswoman from the NSPCC. ""However social media companies, including Facebook, need to do more to provide safe environments across all of their platforms - and be more transparent about what they do. ""The NSPCC wants to see a clear set of minimum standards that all social media companies will be held to account to, including clear community guidelines and bespoke accounts for under 18s."" Tbh's achievement has been to create an anonymous app that hasn't descended into a cesspit of trolling and harassment - something many apps before it have dramatically failed to do. After a user uploads their contacts, the app will ask pre-determined, positive questions such as ""best to bring to a party?"", and the option of selecting one of four friends. Users are notified when they are selected, but the details of who chose them is kept anonymous. Facebook now has over 2 billion users worldwide Mimicking Facebook's early growth - where it was only available in a handful of colleges for a short time, the makers of tbh only made the app available to users in certain states. Word of mouth would spread at schools as the app was enabled. ""We shipped it to one school in Georgia,"" explained co-founder Nikita Bier, speaking to TechCrunch. ""Forty percent of the school downloaded it the first day. The next day it was in three more schools, and then the next day it was in 300 schools."" Facebook would not provide any more details about the deal, but the firm is clearly eager to snap up the next big thing in its infancy, save it become another competitor like Snapchat. An investment bank's recent survey of 6,100 US teens suggested that Snapchat was the preferred social media platform for teenagers - the average age of participants was 16. Facebook reportedly tried to buy Snapchat in 2013 for $3bn. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is today worth $19bn. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Facebook funds anti-bullying training Facebook adds Snapchat-style filters Report: Snapchat rejected $3bn bid Disruption is over - and Facebook won Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Einsteinâs waves detected in star smash,"This video can not be played Hear the 'sound' of two dead stars colliding Scientists have detected the warping of space generated by the collision of two dead stars, or neutron stars. They have confirmed that such mergers lead to the production of the gold and platinum that exists in the Universe. The measurement of the gravitational waves given off by this cataclysmic event was made on 17 August by the LIGO-VIRGO Collaboration. The discovery enabled telescopes all over the world to capture details of the merger as it unfolded. David Reitze, executive director of the LIGO Laboratory at Caltech in Pasadena, California, said: ""This is the one we've all been waiting for."" Einstein's waves win physics Nobel Gravitational waves quest to go into space Getting your head around Einstein's waves Gravitational waves: A triumph for big science The outburst took place in a galaxy called NGC 4993, located roughly a thousand billion, billion km away in the Constellation Hydra. It happened 130 million years ago - when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. It was so far away that the light and gravitational waves have only just reached us. The stars themselves had masses 10-20% greater than our Sun - but they were no larger than 30km across. They were the crushed leftover cores of massive stars that long ago exploded as supernovas. They are called neutron stars because the process of crushing the star makes the charged protons and electrons in the atoms of the star combine - to form an object made entirely of neutrons. Such remnants are incredibly dense - a teaspoonful would weigh a billion tonnes. In the landscaped campus of one of the laboratories that made the detection, a fountain sprays jets of water skyward  which are then pulled back down by gravity, sending ripples across the crystal clear pond. The LIGO detector, sitting incongruously in the vast woodland of Livingston in Louisiana, was designed to detect the gravitational ripples across the Universe created by cataclysmic cosmic events. Since it was upgraded two years ago, it has four times sensed the collisions of black holes. Gravitational waves caused by violent events send ripples through space-time that stretch and squeeze everything they pass through by a tiny amount - less than the width of an atom. Artwork: Merging neutron stars rippling across space-time The LIGO lab at Livingston consists of a small building with two, two-and-a-half-mile pipelines stretching out at right angles. Inside each pipe is a powerful laser accurately measuring any change in its length. I walk along one of the pipes with Prof Norna Robertson, a Scot who used to work at Glasgow University - and more recently helped to design the instrument's detection system. Prof Robertson's work has helped the LIGO-VIRGO Scientific Collaboration to make the first ever detection of the gravitational waves given off by the collision of two neutron stars. ""I'm really thrilled about what we have done. I started off as a student in Glasgow 40 years ago working on gravitational waves. It's been a long long road; there have been some ups and downs but now it's all come together,"" she told BBC News. ""These last couple of years, first of all with the detection of black holes mergers and now a neutron star merger, I really feel we are opening up a new field, and that's what I wanted to do  and now we've done it."" The detection enabled 70 telescopes to obtain the first ever detailed pictures of such an event. These show an explosion 1,000 times more powerful than a nova - a burst called a kilonova. Gravitational waves - Ripples in the fabric of space-time This video can not be played A visualisation shows the coalescence of two orbiting neutron stars Gravitational waves are a prediction of the Theory of General Relativity It took decades to develop the technology to directly detect them They are ripples in the fabric of space-time generated by violent events Accelerating masses will produce waves that propagate at the speed of light Detectable sources ought to include merging black holes and neutron stars Ligo/Virgo fire lasers into long, L-shaped tunnels; the waves disturb the light Detecting the waves opens up the Universe to completely new investigations Researchers had suspected that this huge release of energy leads to the creation of rare elements, such as gold and platinum. Dr Kate Maguire, from Queen's University Belfast, who analysed the collision's burst of light, said that the theory was now proven. ""Using some of the world's best telescopes, we have discovered that this neutron star merger scattered heavy chemical elements, such as gold and platinum, out into space at high speeds. ""These new results have significantly contributed to solving the long-debated mystery of the origin of elements heavier than iron in the periodic table."" Dr Joe Lyman, of the University of Warwick said described the observations as ""exquisite"". ""They tell us that the heavy elements, like the gold or platinum in jewellery are the cinders, forged in the billion degree remnants of a merging neutron star."" It was also direct confirmation that short bursts of gamma-ray radiation are linked to colliding neutron stars. By combining information from gravitational waves and the light collected by telescopes, researchers also used a new technique to measure the expansion rate of the Universe. This technique was first proposed in 1986 by the University of Cardiff's Prof Bernard Schutz. Prof Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University told BBC News that this was ""the first rung of a ladder"" for a new method of measuring distances in the Universe. ""A new observational window on the Universe typically leads to surprises that cannot yet be foreseen. We are still rubbing our eyes, or rather ears, as we have just woken up to the sound of gravitational waves,"" he said. The LIGO Louisiana lab has 4km-long pipes running out from its control centre Prof Nial Tanvir, from Leicester University, uses the VISTA telescope in Chile. He and his colleagues started searching for the neutron star collision as soon as they heard of the gravitational wave detection. ""We were really excited when we first got notification that a neutron star merger had been detected by LIGO,"" he said. ""We stayed up all night analysing the images as they came in, and it was remarkable how well the observations matched the theoretical predictions that had been made."" LIGO is now being upgraded. In a year's time it will be twice as sensitive - and so will be able to scan eight times the volume of the space. The researchers believe that detections of black holes and neutron stars will become common place. And they hope that they will begin to detect objects that they currently cannot even imagine and so usher in a new era of astronomy.

Red sun 'caused by Hurricane Ophelia',"Central London was one of many parts to witness the phenomenon An ""unusual"" reddish sky and red-looking sun have been reported across many parts of England. The phenomenon was initially seen in the west of England and Wales before spreading to other areas. BBC weather presenter Simon King said it was due to the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara. He added that debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain was also playing a part. The dust has caused shorter wavelength blue light to be scattered, making it appear red. BBC Weather Watchers: Why has the sky turned red? This video can not be played BBC Weather presenter Charlie Slater explains why the sun looks red The red-looking sun was seen in Bristol city centre He said: ""Ophelia originated in the Azores where it was a hurricane and as it tracked its way northwards it dragged in tropical air from the Sahara."" This meant dust from the Sahara was brought with it, he said. ""The dust gets picked up into the air and goes high up into the atmosphere, and that dust has been dragged high up in the atmosphere above the UK,"" Mr King explained. The particles in the air cause blue light to scatter, leaving longer-wavelength red light to shine through. The Met Office said the ""vast majority"" of the dust was as a result of forest fires in Iberia, which have sent debris into the air and that has been dragged north by Ophelia. An orange sky was visible in Bransford in Worcestershire A red sun was spotted in the sky over Bromsgrove in Worcestershire This was the scene in Ludlow, Shropshire Meanwhile, hundreds took to Twitter to share their theories and snaps of the unusual red sun and yellow skies. Using the hashtags #redsun and #ophelia, pictures were posted with earnest tags insisting that: ""There is NO colour correction on this image"". As the skies turned beige over London, Hugh Bennettâ wondered if: ""This is what it must have been like living in the olden days when everything was sepia"", while James McNicholasâ blamed ""the hipsters"" for putting ""an Instagram filter"" on the city. But trending alongside #redsun, #yellowsky and #orangesky was the hashtag #apocalypse. Like many Ben Shephard posted that: ""Not messing around this light is really freaking us out!"", while Henry Tudor, said: ""This weird light is very disturbing. I keep expecting four blokes on horses to home galloping out of the sky."" Elliot Wagland said: ""I just looked out of the window and it appears the world is about to end"", and Archer Hampsonâ said: ""Somebody said we should head outside because the world was ending. We thought we'd take our cameras."" Louise Lucas, meanwhile, wanted to know if she had missed the memo ""about going home early due to #apocalypse?!"" and Anthony Court posted thatâ: ""If the world does end -please could it be before 10pm tonight when I start my nightshift."" This was the view from Gloucester Docks The ""strange-coloured sun"" was photographed over Elkesley in Nottinghamshire The sky above Cardiff Castle turned orange But not everyone was spooked, some were inspired to write poetry like @Scott_W88, who wrote: ""Ophelia, you're breaking the sun, You're shaking my garden fence daily"". While Helen Glew, said simply: ""The most amazing thing is just how much of the UK is actually seeing the sun on a single October morning.""

Malta blogger killed in car bomb attack,"This video can not be played Debris was strewn over the road and a nearby field A prominent blogger in Malta, who had accused the island's government of corruption, has died in a car bomb attack, according to police. Daphne Caruana Galizia, 53, was reportedly killed when the car she was driving exploded shortly after she left her home in Bidnija, near Mosta. Local media say one of her sons heard the blast and rushed outside. PM Joseph Muscat, whom Caruana Galizia accused of wrongdoing earlier this year, denounced the killing. ""I condemn without reservations this barbaric attack on a person and on the freedom of expression in our country,"" he said in a televised statement. ""Everyone knows Ms Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of mine, both politically and personally, as she was for others too."" Daphne Caruana Galizia was reportedly killed just after leaving her home on Monday afternoon But he stressed there could be ""no justification... in any way"" for such action. ""I will not rest before justice is done."" On Monday evening, thousands of people attended a candlelit vigil in the resort town of Sliema. Allow Twitter content?

Malta Television reported that Caruana Galizia had filed a complaint to the police two weeks ago to say she had received threats but gave no further information. Police have opened a murder inquiry. Newspaper reports said the explosion had left debris from the rental car she was driving strewn across the road and in a nearby field. Police and forensics experts went to the scene of the blast Caruana Galizia's death comes four months afterMr Muscat's Labour Party wonan election he called early because of the blogger's allegations linking him and his wife to the Panama Papers scandal. The couple denied claims that they had used secret offshore bank accounts to hide payments from Azerbaijan's ruling family. Caruana Galizia's popular blog had also targeted opposition politicians, calling the country's political situation ""desperate"" in her final post. A spokeswoman for the prime minister's office told the BBC that although there were rumours the attack could be politically motivated, this would be jumping to conclusions. But no lines of inquiry would be ruled out. Malta has asked for international help - including the FBI in the US - to find the perpetrator, the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, Caruana Galizia's family has requested that the magistrate in charge of the investigation be replaced, the Malta Independent reports. It said the current magistrate had on a number of occasions been the subject of criticism by Caruana Galizia. By Herman Grech, Times of Malta online editor Daphne Caruana Galizia was loved and resented in equal measure in politically divided Malta - but she will go down in the Mediterranean island's history as one of the most influential writers. Her uncompromising blog and scathing pen spared no punches, hitting out mainly at exponents of the ruling Labour Party and their supporters, but also sometimes criticising officials of the centre-right Nationalist Party, including its newly-elected leader. Starting off as a columnist for The Sunday Times of Malta, her colourful reportage saw her embroiled in several legal battles along the years, including Malta's prime minister. But beyond all, even her fiercest critics acknowledge she was an impeccable writer and investigative journalist. Her digital cross-investigation into the Panama Papers, which saw the Maltese government's top officials embroiled, effectively triggered off a premature general election last June.

Catalan separatists in Spanish custody,"Jordi Cuixart (left) and Jordi SÃ¡nchez (right) faced a judge in Madrid on Monday A Spanish judge has jailed two key members of the Catalan independence movement. Jordi SÃ¡nchez and Jordi Cuixart, who lead prominent separatist groups, are being held without bail while they are under investigation for sedition. The men were leading figures in the 1 October independence vote, which the Madrid government regards as illegal. A protest over the detentions has begun in Barcelona and other demonstrations across Catalonia are expected later. Mr SÃ¡nchez, who heads the Catalan National Assembly (ANC), a pro-independence organisation, and Mr Cuixart, leader of Omnium Cultural, appeared before the High Court in Madrid on Monday. They are being investigated over a protest on 20 September in which a crowd blocked Civil Guard officers inside a building in Barcelona, Catalonia's regional capital. Catalan crisis in 300 words The man who wants to break up Spain El PeriÃ³dico (Barcelona, unionist),external:""The 'process' had been having an incredibly quiet few days. That was until the news of the detention without bail for the presidents of the two main pro-independence civil society organisation, Jordi SÃ nchez and Jordi Cuixart, which has shaken up the landscape in a way that should have been registered by seismographs."" Ara (Barcelona, pro-independence),external:""With separatists and the Spanish government looking to see who moves the next piece, the National Court turned over the table yesterday"". La Vanguardia (Barcelona, moderate pro-independence),external:""The decision of the magistrate adds a new, inopportune and worrying element of tension to the conflict that opposes the Catalan government and the Spanish government. Now it will be more difficult to reach agreement through dialogue."" El Mundo (Madrid, unionist),external:""The rule of law continues its struggle against secessionist claims, which suffered important blows yesterday."" Following the referendum, Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence, but halted its implementation to allow negotiations. He has called for talks to take place over the next two months. However, the Spanish government has warned that Catalonia must revoke the declaration or face direct rule from Madrid. Mr Puigdemont has also angered Madrid by refusing to clarify whether or not he declared independence last week. This video can not be played Europe correspondent Gavin Lee looks to the past for the origins of the Catalan crisis Mr Puigdemont, who has been given until Thursday to clarify his position, hit out at the government on Twitter following news of Mr SÃ¡nchez and Mr Cuixart's detention. ""Spain jails Catalonia's civil society leaders for organising peaceful demonstrations. Sadly, we have political prisoners again,"" he wrote. In a video recorded before his court appearance and released on his Twitter account after his detention, Mr Cuixart instructs separatists to ""never lose hope because the people of Catalonia have earned their future"". A pro-independence crowd gathered in Barcelona to hear an address by Carles Puigdemont Pro-independence supporters have called for further protests, demanding the men's release. Just hours before the ruling, the High Court freed the head of Catalonia's police force, Josep Lluis Trapero. His force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, is accused of failing to help Spain's Guardia Civil police tackle thousands of pro-independence protesters in Barcelona during the run-up to the referendum.

Wi-fi security flaw 'puts devices at risk',"This video can not be played WATCH: Wi-fi security flaw explained The wi-fi connections of businesses and homes around the world are at risk, according to researchers who have revealed a major flaw dubbed Krack. It concerns an authentication system which is widely used to secure wireless connections. Experts said it could leave ""the majority"" of connections at risk until they are patched. The researchers added the attack method  was ""exceptionally devastating"" for Android 6.0 or above and Linux. A Google spokesperson said: ""We're aware of the issue, and we will be patching any affected devices in the coming weeks."" The US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (Cert) has issued a warning on the flaw. ""US-Cert has become aware of several key management vulnerabilities in the four-way handshake of wi-fi protected access II (WPA2) security protocol,"" it said. ""Most or all correct implementations of the standard will be affected."" Most wi-fi devices could be at risk Computer security expert from the University of Surrey Prof Alan Woodward said: ""This is a flaw in the standard, so potentially there is a high risk to every single wi-fi connection out there, corporate and domestic. ""The risk will depend on a number of factors including the time it takes to launch an attack and whether you need to be connected to the network to launch one, but the paper suggests that an attack is relatively easy to launch. ""It will leave the majority of wi-fi connections at risk until vendors of routers can issue patches."" Industry body the Wi-Fi Alliance said that it was working with providers to issue software updates to patch the flaw. ""This issue can be resolved through straightforward software updates and the wi-fi industry, including major platform providers, has already started deploying patches to wi-fi users. ""Users can expect all their wi-fi devices, whether patched or unpatched, to continue working well together."" It added that there was ""no evidence"" that the vulnerability had been exploited maliciously. Tech giant Microsoft said that it had already released a security update. The vulnerability was discovered by researchers led by Mathy Vanhoef, from Belgian university, KU Leuven. According to his paper, the issue centres around a system of random number generation known as nonce (a number that can only be used once), which can in fact be reused to allow an attacker to enter a network and snoop on the data being sent in it. ""All protected wi-fi networks use the four-way handshake to generate a fresh session key and so far this 14-year-old handshake has remained free from attacks,he writes in the paper,externaldescribing Krack (key reinstallation attacks). ""Every wi-fi device is vulnerable to some variants of our attacks. Our attack is exceptionally devastating against Android 6.0: it forces the client into using a predictable all-zero encryption key."" Dr Steven Murdoch from University College, London said there were two mitigating factors to what he agreed was a ""huge vulnerability"". ""The attacker has to be physically nearby and if there is encryption on the web browser, it is harder to exploit."" More details can be found atthis website,external. Prof Alan Woodward explained the issue to the BBC. When any device uses wi-fi to connect to, say, a router it does what is known as a ""handshake"": it goes through a four-step dialogue, whereby the two devices agree a key to use to secure the data being passed (a ""session key""). This attack begins by tricking a victim into reinstalling the live key by replaying a modified version of the original handshake. In doing this a number of important set-up values can be reset which can, for example, render certain elements of the encryption much weaker. This attacks appears to work on all wi-fis tested - prior to the patches currently being issued. In some it is possible to decrypt and inject data, enabling an attacker to hijack a connection. In others it is even worse as it is possible to forge a connection, which, as the researchers note, is ""catastrophic"". Not all routers will be affected but the people this could be most problematic for are the internet service providers who have millions of routers in customers' homes. How will they make sure all of them are secure? Wi-fi security flaw Krack explained.

Facebook buys app for teens to be nice,"The tbh app had been downloaded five million times in nine weeks An app that encourages teens to be nice to each other has been acquired by Facebook for an undisclosed fee. The app - called tbh, meaning ""to be honest"" - is just nine weeks old, but had already been downloaded five million times. The app's creators said,externalit will remain a standalone program but will now have more resources thanks to Facebook. ""We were compelled by the ways they could help us realise tbhâs vision and bring it to more people,"" tbh said. According to start-up news site TechCrunch,external, the deal was for ""less than $100m"", and tbh's four person team would become Facebook employees. One expert commented that Facebook keeps a close eye over new companies and is willing to pay a premium to buy them rather than risk them developing into a threat. ""This is the latest example of Facebook snapping up a start-up that could potentially game-change the way people consume social media and erode its own user base,"" commented Prof Mark Skilton from Warwick Business School. ""Tbh appeals to the teen market - which we know is a very fickle age group - and Facebook knows that it and other apps like it can go viral and explode in popularity very quickly. ""So, this can be seen as a protective measure, and $100m is the equivalent of an account sheet rounding error - it's no money to them."" In a statement, Facebook said: ""tbh and Facebook share a common goal of building community and enabling people to share in ways that bring us closer together. ""Weâre impressed by the way tbh is doing this by using polling and messaging, and with Facebookâs resources tbh can continue to expand and build positive experiences."" Tbh said the app's success was a sign of teenagers craving more positive interactions online. ""While the last decade of the internet has been focused on open communication, the next milestone will be around meeting peopleâs emotional needs,"" it said. The acquisition has been welcomed by a leading anti-bullying charity - but it added that other efforts were still required. ""We are encouraged to see Facebook taking further steps to create a more positive atmosphere online,"" said a spokeswoman from the NSPCC. ""However social media companies, including Facebook, need to do more to provide safe environments across all of their platforms - and be more transparent about what they do. ""The NSPCC wants to see a clear set of minimum standards that all social media companies will be held to account to, including clear community guidelines and bespoke accounts for under 18s."" Tbh's achievement has been to create an anonymous app that hasn't descended into a cesspit of trolling and harassment - something many apps before it have dramatically failed to do. After a user uploads their contacts, the app will ask pre-determined, positive questions such as ""best to bring to a party?"", and the option of selecting one of four friends. Users are notified when they are selected, but the details of who chose them is kept anonymous. Facebook now has over 2 billion users worldwide Mimicking Facebook's early growth - where it was only available in a handful of colleges for a short time, the makers of tbh only made the app available to users in certain states. Word of mouth would spread at schools as the app was enabled. ""We shipped it to one school in Georgia,"" explained co-founder Nikita Bier, speaking to TechCrunch. ""Forty percent of the school downloaded it the first day. The next day it was in three more schools, and then the next day it was in 300 schools."" Facebook would not provide any more details about the deal, but the firm is clearly eager to snap up the next big thing in its infancy, save it become another competitor like Snapchat. An investment bank's recent survey of 6,100 US teens suggested that Snapchat was the preferred social media platform for teenagers - the average age of participants was 16. Facebook reportedly tried to buy Snapchat in 2013 for $3bn. Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, is today worth $19bn. _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Facebook funds anti-bullying training Facebook adds Snapchat-style filters Report: Snapchat rejected $3bn bid Disruption is over - and Facebook won Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Brexit deal efforts 'should accelerate',"Mrs May and Mr Juncker embraced after their working dinner in Brussels Theresa May and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have agreed to ""accelerate"" Brexit negotiations - but there was no sign of a breakthrough after their working dinner. A joint statement said the Brussels talks - which came before EU member states meet to assess progress - were ""constructive and friendly"". The UK's financial settlement with the EU continues to be a sticking point. The EU will not discuss trade until this has been settled. Reality Check: Does the UK owe the EU money? Reality Check: What would 'no Brexit deal' look like? Mrs May has also spoken to the French and German leaders ahead of the European Council summit. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK opposite number, Brexit Secretary David Davis, also joined the working dinner. ""The prime minister and the president of the European Commission reviewed the progress made in the Article 50 negotiations so far and agreed that these efforts should accelerate over the months to come,"" the statement read. ""The working dinner took place in a constructive and friendly atmosphere."" By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May went to Brussels for the 90-minute working dinner Accelerate, accelerate, accelerate, accelerate. OK, in theory, if I am driving a car at four miles per hour and I speed up to eight miles per hour, technically I am accelerating. I may still be basically crawling along. I still may be late - very, very late - for my eventual destination. But, by the very action of pressing the pedal and going faster, I am actually speeding up. If anyone accuses me of going nowhere, or slowing down - well, look at my speedometer. I am going faster and I have evidence that you are wrong! That is why, in the next few days, don't be surprised if every Tory politician you see, hear, or read about is using that word (at least those loyal to the government) to claim that there is progress in the Brexit talks, just days after the chief negotiator on the EU side declared a deadlock. Read more of Laura Kuenssberg's blog here. BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said the joint statement released after the dinner was ""a masterpiece of uncommunicative communication"". He said: ""It recorded formally that Brexit negotiations are taking place between the EU 27 and the UK - a statement of the obvious that may hint at Brussels' displeasure with British attempts to talk directly to individual member states as well."" He added: ""The gnomic communique was perhaps an attempt to avoid a repeat of the fallout fromthe last bilateral dinnerin Downing Street in April after which the EU side was reported to have described the British as 'delusional' and even disparaged the food."" Along with the UK's ""divorce bill"", the EU is insisting agreement be reached on citizens' rights and what happens on the Northern Irish border before agreeing to open talks on the free trade deal Mrs May's government wants to strike. Last week an internal draft document suggested the EU was going to begin preparing for the possibility of trade talks beginning in December - provided the UK does more to bridge the gap on these key negotiating points. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Michael Fuchs, the vice chairman of Angela Merkels's Christian Democratic Union party, agreed it was ""absolutely necessary"" to accelerate the talks, given the two-year timeframe for departure set out by the EU treaties. This video can not be played Dr Michael Fuchs: The UK can't cherry pick But he suggested Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was thwarting Mrs May's attempts to reach a deal on the financial issue. ""I know there are internal problems, whatever she is offering, Boris Johnson is saying it's too much,"" he said. ""I don't know what his influence (is), it seems to be pretty strong because otherwise she would come up with other proposals I guess and the problem is she has internal trouble in the Tories."" Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said he thought a reported bill of Â£100bn was too high, accusing Labour of being willing to ""cough up"" such a sum. He said the government was united on its Brexit strategy and urged the EU to ""get serious"" and agree to settle the citizens' rights question. Meanwhile, a new report suggests that leaving the EU without a trade deal would lead to a significant rise in living costs for millions of people. Research by the Resolution Foundation and trade experts at Sussex University calculates that the average household would pay an extra Â£260 a year for imported goods. For three million households - those who consume the most imported goods - that figure would nearly double to Â£500 a year. The report says that without a Brexit deal, European goods would incur the same tariffs as those imposed on other World Trade Organisation countries, increasing levies on dairy products by 45% and meat products by 37%.

"Mercedes-Benz recalls 400,000 cars in UK","About 400,000 Mercedes-Benz cars are being recalled by Daimler in the UK over a potential airbag safety issue. The firm's safety recall covers more than a million vehicles worldwide, including 495,000 in the US. The recall is not related to theexploding Takata airbag scandal, and there have been no fatalities. The problem affects certain A, B, C, and E-Class models, together with CLA, GLA and GLC vehicles, built between November 2011 and July 2017. The fix for the airbag issue takes only an hour to perform. A Mercedes-Benz spokesperson told the BBC that the airbag issue only affected certain vehicles in ""rare circumstances"". ""If the steering column module clock spring is broken and the wiring components are not sufficiently earthed, this could lead to an electrostatic discharge which could inadvertently deploy the driver's airbag,"" the spokesperson said. The cars are safe to drive under normal operating conditions, but if the driver airbag warning light comes on, customers should call roadside assistance or contact their nearest retailer. Mercedes-Benz will contact all customers whose cars may be affected by the airbag problem, and ask them to bring their vehicle in. The work is performed free of charge and only takes an hour, after which the car is safe to drive as normal. 75,000 Mercedes-Benz cars recalled in UK Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

'My #MeToo experience is sadly typical',"The social media conversation around hashtag #MeToo highlights how widespread sexual harassment is. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan shares her personal story. I must have been about 25 years old. We were in an Italian restaurant in New York, just after we'd finished working on a story. I was an ambitious producer who'd just been in Manhattan for the Republican convention. Most of the team had gone but a colleague and I were the last two left and we were having dinner. We'd gone to the East Village and in a dimly lit Italian restaurant, I made small talk about George W Bush and John Kerry. Then he said it. ""I'm unbelievably sexually attracted to you. I can't stop thinking about you."" I dropped my fork and it bounced on the plate, the spaghetti still woven around it. 'MeToo' and the scale of sexual abuse This was a colleague twice my age, well-respected and with a girlfriend. I had experienced sexism in the workplace before, but not in such an overt way. I can't even remember what I said - but it was something all too polite, as I tried to change the conversation. He continued talking about how beautiful I was, as I ate the pasta as fast I could. I wasn't sure at the time if he'd said anything that I could reasonably complain about, but I remember feeling disgusted and uncomfortable about it. I now know it was utterly unacceptable, and is just another reminder of how some men in the workplace use their power to manipulate, harass and even abuse women. This video can not be played 100 Women: What exactly do we mean when we talk about street harassment? Why do men shout at women in the street? Are you being sexually harassed at work? The US scheme helping drive out campus harassment The recent conversation about Harvey Weinstein has prompted countless conversations among my female friends about where the line stops in these situations, and when you should say something. Do you have to be touched for it to count? What if you are friends with them? When does harassment start, and when does it end? The Weinstein case has shone the light on the appalling practices in Hollywood, but it is of course a very depressing reflection of what women from all walks of life, from all corners of the globe, have to experience on a daily basis. A few years ago a married former colleague of mine began sending me messages containing explicit details of his sexual desires. ""I have become obsessed with pleasuring myself,"" he wrote. ""I just can't control myself."" I was horrified but at first I thought I needed to be polite, as there was a chance we'd work together again (why do women always feel they need to be polite in these situations?). I didn't really know what to say, so I responded telling him that it sounded pretty normal for some men to think like that, hoping he'd go away. But his messages continued and became more creepy. He said he'd fantasised about sex with powerful women, and how he wanted to cheat on his wife. This video can not be played Women are speaking out about sexual harassment through one photographer's powerful project I told him to talk to someone else - not me - and to get help. I didn't tell anyone at first. I felt disgusted but kept it to myself. Months later I was chatting to another female colleague who told me that for years she had received dirty messages from the same man. I let out a sigh of relief, as I realised I could finally share my story. Soon after I heard he'd been fired. Another colleague had filed a complaint against him. No matter what the degree of abuse is, knowing someone else has gone through it too makes it easier to speak out. Just look at the Bill Cosby case. I have interviewed a number of survivors of sexual assault on college campuses in the US, who didn't come forward because they didn't think they'd be believed. A lot of the time, men don't understand how to deal with it, because - to put it simply - they don't have to deal with it. They don't get the same comments or asides, the same blame or judgement as women face on a regular basis. This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject What it was like to work for Weinstein Exploring the casting couch culture of LA How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded The two examples I shared are just a few I've experienced over the years - I forgot to mention the knock on my hotel door from a married colleague on a trip, which followed a suggestive text. In that case I ran into the bathroom and called a friendly male colleague - who told me to phone him again if I felt threatened. And that's a reminder there are many decent men out there who are allies in this fight. As my friends share stories of being groped while working on boats, being objectified during board meetings, passed over for a job because they didn't flirt back, it is patently clear that a lot more that needs to change. But one positive that comes out of hearing such horrific stories from Hollywood and beyond is that the more people talk, the less it's becoming acceptable.

'Accelerate' - the word the Tories need,"Accelerate, accelerate, accelerate, accelerate. OK, in theory, if I am driving a car at four miles per hour and I speed up to eight miles per hour, technically I am accelerating. I may still be basically crawling along. I still may be late - very, very late - for my eventual destination. But, by the very action of pressing the pedal and going faster, I am actually speeding up. If anyone accuses me of going nowhere, or slowing down - well, look at my speedometer. I am going faster and I have evidence that you are wrong! That is why, in the next few days, don't be surprised if every Tory politician you see, hear, or read about is using that word (at least those loyal to the government) to claim that there is progress in the Brexit talks, just days after the chief negotiator on the EU side declared a deadlock. As we've talked about before, Michel Barnier's choice of language last week didn't mean that nothing had happened or that there's been no movement at all. But it made headlines, and all political negotiations of this ilk are in a sense a fight over words, too. So tonight, the government, beset by its own rows about preparing for a deal, preparing for no deal, preparing to look like they know what they are doing, have a word - one word - that they can use as evidence that they are getting somewhere. Look, even the arch Eurocrat Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to ""accelerate"" the talks, you can almost hear them say. Give the news cycle another 12 hours and I'd bet a fiver that will have happened. But what Number 10 is really hoping for is an agreement on Friday at the summit that points to the way ahead - not just a speeding up, but a commitment to the next junction - to allow the talks to start moving onto the transition. Despite the promise of acceleration, there is no sign yet tonight that either side is willing to budge far enough to inject some real vigour into the process. There's no sign the UK is willing to put more cash on the table, yet. There's no sign that a majority of the other side are willing to expand the talks without that promise of more cash, yet. The talks can accelerate all they like, but without one of the two sides being willing to budge to reach an accommodation, they could be going nowhere fast. PS: There is precious little detail so far of what actually was discussed at the dinner, and no sign yet of the huge leak of info from the last dinner between this group.

Bairstow on his dad and Christmas with Boycott,"This video can not be played Jonny Bairstow talks to the BBC's Joe Wilson Even for an international sportsman, Jonny Bairstow's story is extraordinary. That the Yorkshireman has had his share of setbacks on the way to becoming one of the leading wicketkeeper-batsmen in the world, or that the young Bairstow was an extremely talented footballer and rugby player are noteworthy, but only a small part of his tale. Jonny's father David, also a wicketkeeper, had a 20-year career with Yorkshire and played four Tests for England. In 1998, he took his own life. To mark the release of his autobiography, A Clear Blue Sky, Bairstow spoke to former England captain Michael Vaughan for aBBC Radio 5 live special. He talks openly about his father, his family, his emotional maiden Test century in Cape Town, thoughts of quitting cricket to play rugby and what it is like to spend Christmas at Geoffrey Boycott's house. Jonny Bairstow played in Michael Vaughan's final first-class match in 2009 Suffering from depression, worried about money and facing a drink-driving charge, David Bairstow ended his own life at the age of 46. He was discovered by eight-year-old Jonny, his younger sister Becky and their mother Janet, who at the time was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. ""Me and my sister were both very young. In some ways, yes, you do remember everything that went on because it is only us who will remember that. At the same time there are bits of it you choose not to remember, that you choose to park. ""We went to school the next day. For me, that was really powerful. It was mum's way of dealing with it, her way of saying 'yes, that's happened now, but we have to deal with it in a certain way'. ""It makes you grow up very quickly. There's a huge sense of realisation around everything. At the same time, when you're eight years old, you don't really know everything that's happened. You understand it a bit, but you don't understand all of it. ""There are questions that are unanswered, but there's no point in revisiting those questions on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. If you're constantly striving for questions that are never going to be answered, then you're only being detrimental to your own mental health. ""There are so many bits that I didn't know right away, but I've learned, even when I've been doing the book. Having a setback like that can make you mature very quickly."" David Bairstow (left) on tour with Geoffrey Boycott in 1981 By taking his own life, David nullified his life insurance policy. In his autobiography, Jonny explains that he knew money was sometimes tight when he was growing up. ""That's why it's been so good to keep pushing forward and represent England, to make Mum proud for the days she took to me to train with Leeds United, three times a week from the age of seven to 15, as well as bringing me to Headingley, looking after my sister, taking us to school and feeding us. ""If you stack everything that Mum did with the help of Grandma and Grandpa and all of our friends, it was ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous. ""Mum never made an excuse, even when she had cancer and had a lot on her plate. You have to have huge admiration for the way she brought us up. Hopefully she has brought two role models into the world. ""You think of what might have been different if dad had been around, or how I might have turned out as a person. You just don't know. I might not even be playing cricket. ""There will have been questions along the way, but there's not just one, because there's 20 years of learning off dad that I haven't had. ""If he was here now, I think he'd just tell me to keep going."" Bairstow made his Test debut in 2012 and, despite making 95 in his fourth match against South Africa, needed more than three years to earn a regular spot in the England side. When Bairstow faced South Africa again, he once more found himself on 95, this time at lunch on the second day of the second Test in Cape Town. ""I was dripping wet. I didn't take my pads off, I didn't eat, I just sat there saying 'it's not happening again'. ""I knew they would start with Morne Morkel after lunch, but when they then used the medium-pace of Stiaan van Zyl, I just wanted him to bowl a short, wide one. ""Getting to that first hundred was just a relief. I was five short four years earlier, so it was four years of questions. Will I get the opportunity again? What could have I achieved if I had made that ton?"" Bairstow reached his maiden Test century in his 22nd match The roar that Bairstow let out when he reached three figures could be heard all around Newlands and was followed with a look to the sky. On Test Match Special, an emotional Jonathan Agnew said: ""You won't find a more popular individual. You can't resist the thought of his father looking down and how proud he would be."" ""The years of waiting really came through. I don't know how I celebrated, I just ran and shouted. I welled up and got a jittery bottom lip. There was a huge heap of emotion. It's a very, very proud moment. ""There were more tears when I saw my mum and Becky at the end of the day. There's never anything wrong with shedding a tear. ""There's all the time which you spend thinking about it. Are you good enough? Will you get an opportunity? Where and when will it be? I have let myself and my family down by not getting a hundred already and there are people that have spent money coming to watch you. ""That makes you prouder. It reminds you that you're not only representing yourself, but your family and the people who have kept an eye on you throughout your career."" David Bairstow was a close friend of Yorkshire and England batsman Boycott, whose relationship with the Bairstow family continued after David's death and to this day. Boycott, who scored 8,114 runs in 108 Tests for England, remains a forthright pundit on Test Match Special and in his newspaper column. ""Geoffrey presented me with my cap on the day I made my England Test debut. He'd already presented a special cap to Ian Bell to mark his 75th Test. He said to him 'you're one of the best batsmen in the world, but please stop playing the sweep shot'. That got us all laughing. ""When it came for me to get my cap, I could feel myself going in the back of my throat and in my chest. I had to hold back a little bit. After the hundred in Cape Town, I did an interview with Geoffrey and got emotional then. ""I've perhaps not spoken about cricket enough with him. I've wanted to find it out for myself. Looking back, maybe I should have done it more, but that's my inner stubbornness. I knew that he was there if I needed to speak to him. If I picked up the phone right now, he would be there and would help me if he can. ""The opinions that he has do not cause a massive issue in the dressing room, especially with the group of players we have now. Something could be said that is too close to the bone, but players are close to pundits now - we see them every day and can speak to them for ourselves if we have an issue. ""He once nailed me in front of 400 people at a game at Abbeydale Park in Sheffield. Everyone knows the nature of what pundits do - they are paid to write columns and have opinions. I perhaps didn't realise that at the start and took too much criticism to heart. ""We've had Christmas at his house in South Africa. It's entertaining around the Boycott Christmas table - it's not just him talking about himself."" Bairstow has followed his father and Boycott by playing for Yorkshire and England In the autobiography, Bairstow reveals his admiration for rugby player Jonny Wilkinson. In the aftermath of England's 5-0 whitewash on the 2013-14 Ashes tour of Australia, Bairstow, a fly-half in his youth, even thought of attempting to start a rugby career of his own. ""Wilkinson changed the game of rugby. He captivated so many kids. I used to watch his DVD when I went to bed on the night before rugby games and I got a real sense of inspiration. ""I looked at the way he trained, the way he prepared and how he never left the training ground until he was content. ""Before he retired, he took a team talk for Toulon in French and English. To be able to be an inspiration to your team-mates in two languages sums the bloke up. ""He got a lot of injuries. The mentality that he had to keep doing the rehab, to answer the questions that people posed of him when he kept coming back resonates with me very firmly. ""He put his body in places that he shouldn't have put his body. He did things that he knew he shouldn't be doing. He wanted to keep pushing. ""When you're going through difficult times, like I was after the 2013-14 Ashes, you start thinking about different bits. Rugby is a huge passion of mine, a lot of my friends play. ""When all the lads are throwing a ball around, you go and play some touch and have an amazing time doing something you stopped when you were 17. You have thoughts of 'shall I, could I, what would happen if?'. ""I don't know who I would have played for. It wasn't a thought that lasted for a long time."" Additional reporting by Joe Wilson.

How Chinese authorities censor your thoughts,"This video can not be played What can and can't you say in China? If you control public communication you can control the way people think and how they behave. That's what Xi Jinping's government is counting on. And it is never more true than at the time of major political gatherings. The Communist Party Congress, held every five years, is set to begin next week: an event which will culminate in the revelation of the new leadership team behind General Secretary Xi. So the censors here are poised to restrict with one hand and disseminate with the other. What they're looking out for are key words and expressions popping up in social media. Anything signalling an intention to protest or ridiculing the country's senior political figures will be blocked and potentially see a user reported to the authorities. For example, a message featuring the name of this country's ever-more powerful leader and his sometimes-used nickname ""Winnie the Pooh"" (å°çç»´å°¼) will simply not go through to group discussions on the messaging app WeChat. Funny stickers featuring Mr Xi or previous Chinese leaders also can't be sent to chat groups. This meme comparing Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama to Winnie the Pooh and Tigger has been censored in China Why China censors banned Winnie the Pooh The military parade posts China censored China has all the appearances of an increasingly open society: flashy new cities with Hollywood movies advertised on bus stops; digital currency taken up like nowhere else; cool kids getting around on hire bikes zooming through a gleaming modern existence. And yet, since Mr Xi came to power five years ago, public discourse has been increasingly censored to try and control everything from political thought to sexual activity. In the lead up to the Olympic Games in 2008, it felt as if freedom of expression was ever on the rise here. New laws allowed foreign reporters to travel around the country without specific permission from local governments. It's hard to believe it, but Google searches were not blocked then. Investigative journalism from local Chinese publications - like the Southern Weekend newspaper and Caijing magazine - was becoming as good as anywhere in the world. I remember being at a function where a group of journalists were speaking to one of the foreign affairs ministry spokespeople. We had some concern or other, and he was reassuring us that everything would be all right. ""Don't worry,"" he said, smiling as he pushed an imaginary truck gear into position. ""In China we only have one gear, and it's forward."" It sometimes doesn't feel like that now. Just as China has its Great Wall, so does it also have a powerful internet firewall to block ""undesirable"" sites ""You can't control the internet,"" is something people would say in those years - part mantra, part celebration of a new global reality. But Chinese officials have worked out that actually, you can. Rather than connecting to the internet, this country has something more like an intranet within the boundaries of the Great Firewall of China. Sites like Amnesty International, Facebook, and Twitter are unreachable for most Chinese, unless they have use of a virtual private network (VPN), which effectively punts their computer over the Great Firewall. So, with the congress approaching, there's been an assault on VPN use. The government has ordered Apple to remove all VPNs from its Chinese app store. The company has decided in favour of not being kicked out of this enormous market and is doing what Beijing wants. Years ago Google was given a similar ultimatum: allow Chinese officials to censor search results or you're gone. Google didn't cave in, and was blocked. WeChat is widely used in China China's most effective censorship tool is also the country's most widespread method of communication. Pretty much everybody here uses the phone app WeChat. It has text messaging, group chats, photo sharing, location searching and electronic payments. How social media is different in China During periods of political sensitivity - like now - key words will trigger the blocking or monitoring of a post. If sensitive enough, they could even lead to state security knocking on your door. New regulations also make a person who sets up a group chat responsible for what's said amongst the group. As you can imagine, the administrators of football team chats might be feeling a little nervous about the content of late night posts from drunken players. Some will wonder how this is all possible as the app is not owned by the government but run by the hugely-powerful Chinese company Tencent. Well, under new regulations from the Cyber Administration of China, private entities which run these platforms are required to not only enforce content restrictions but also report those who violate them to the ""relevant authorities"". For many Chinese people - even those overseas - WeChat has also become their main news feed. If you restrict this content you can close out certain news coverage. Potential challengers to WeChat's virtual monopoly are also being reined in. WhatsApp is not 100% within the domain of the Chinese state. So, at times in recent weeks, its use has been impossible to reach without a VPN. Is WhatsApp being censored in China? China disrupts WhatsApp messaging service It is not clear whether the disruption of WhatsApp is a temporary measure to coincide with the congress or yet another restriction that's here to stay. Mr Xi visited state broadcaster CCTV's imposing headquarters in Beijing last year It is no secret that every Chinese newspaper and television station is under the complete control of the Communist Party. And yet last year, when Mr Xi visited the People's Daily newspaper, Xinhua wire service and state broadcaster CCTV, he still demanded the absolute loyalty of reporters who should follow the Party's leadership in ""politics, thought and action"". A misty-eyed ode to China's leader from a deputy editor But, just in case some journalists didn't get the memo, a set of rules have been sent around governing coverage of this year's congress, requiring all interviews with experts or scholars to be approved by the outlet's ""work unit leadership"" and the central propaganda department. However, China's censorship and propaganda model is also going beyond sensitive political matters. Online bookstores must now work under a rating system from the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television which includes the promotion of ""moral values"". Popular blogs focusing on celebrity scandals and the intrigues of the rich and famous have been forced to close. To talk about such matters has been deemed to be not in keeping with ""core socialist values"". For a time, cheap online video dramas were pushing out the boundaries of what could be viewed here. There was a gay sitcom, for example. But digital platforms have been ordered to stop showing hundreds of foreign shows, and their locally produced material is expected to follow the same restrictions as television. As it is, on Chinese TV you rarely see anything approaching a passionate kiss. Two years ago a TV drama was forced to reframe and zoom in on its shots so as to crop out the generous cleavage of its 7th Century maidens, in order to remain on air. This video can not be played Many in China feel the authorities have gone too far in censoring The Empress of China, as John Sudworth reports Thus goes the creeping imposition of a state-sanctioned morality under Mr Xi's administration. Last month, TV dramas were given notice of a new set of rules governing their content. They should ""enhance people's cultural taste"" and ""strengthen spiritual civilisation"". Directors are supposed to come up with engaging characters beyond the realms of lewd behaviour, extra-marital affairs, gambling, drugs, homosexuality and other forms of ""immoral"" behaviour. The notice suggested eulogising the Communist Party of China, the country, the people and also national heroes. And one figure is emerging via the propaganda machine to stand head and shoulders above all others. As the censors shut down dissent, the party is urging a way of thinking about all that's good in China and tracing it back to a single source - Xi Jinping. An exhibition focusing on the recent achievements of the Chinese government has opened in Beijing. Vast rooms are dedicated to science, transport, the military, the economy, sport, ethnic minorities, and they are all dominated by massive photos of Xi Jinping. There must be hundreds of them. This video can not be played Songs have been written celebrating Chinese President Xi Jinping, one even has an accompanying dance routine The English language newspaper China Daily has been rolling out a series of front page stories - one every day - about the ""impact of"" a visit from Mr Xi on various villages, towns and cities after the General Secretary passed on his advice. ""He asked people to protect the lake"", ""President Xi proposed moving people in the villages to the new settlement"", ""Xi emphasised the importance of afforestation"", et cetera. Some here are joking that this type of reporting is not all that far from what you might expect in the North Korean press describing its own god-like leaders. When Chinese officials make speeches now, they refer to this or that aspect of what they're up to ""with Xi Jinping at the core"". Xi Jinping's growing power in China China's Xi named commander in chief How China guards the Xi creation myth It goes without saying that you cannot question ""the core"" without this nation's considerable censorship apparatus crashing down upon you. But, short of such an obvious breach, the rules regarding what can and can't be said, broadcast, forwarded, analysed are thought to be kept deliberately vague. In this way, everyone is on their toes and the authorities can shut down what they like at any time without having to give a reason. Editors, cartoonists, reporters, directors, bloggers, comedians, administrators running social media platforms and ordinary Chinese citizens posting to their friends are all staying well clear of certain subjects just in case it lands them in hot water. In short: Chinese censorship works, and plenty of other governments around the world are looking on with admiration.

How the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible,"""Gentility of speech is at an end,"" thundered an editorial in London's City Press, in 1858. ""It stinks!"" The stink in question was partly metaphorical: politicians were failing to tackle an obvious problem. As its population grew, London's system for disposing of human waste became woefully inadequate. To relieve pressure on cess pits - which were prone to leaking, overflowing, and belching explosive methane - the authorities had instead started encouraging sewage into gullies. However, this created a different issue: the gullies were originally intended for only rainwater, and emptied directly into the River Thames. That was the literal stink - the Thames became an open sewer. Cholera was rife. One outbreak killed 14,000 Londoners - nearly one in every 100. Civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette drew up plans for new, closed sewers to pump the waste far from the city.  It was this project that politicians came under pressure to approve. The sweltering-hot summer of 1858 had made London's malodorous river impossible to politely ignore, or to discuss obliquely with ""gentility of speech"". The heatwave became popularly known as the ""Great Stink"". If you live in a city with modern sanitation, it's hard to imagine daily life being permeated with the suffocating stench of human excrement. For that, we have a number of people to thank - but perhaps none more so than the unlikely figure of Alexander Cumming. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. A watchmaker in London a century before the Great Stink, Cumming won renown for his mastery of intricate mechanics. King George III commissioned him to make an elaborate instrument for recording atmospheric pressure, and he pioneered the microtome, a device for cutting ultra-fine slivers of wood for microscopic analysis. Alexander Cumming's S-bend was crucial in the development of the flushing toilet But Cumming's world-changing invention owed nothing to precision engineering. It was a bit of pipe with a curve in it. In 1775, Cumming patented the S-bend. This became the missing ingredient to create the flushing toilet - and, with it, public sanitation as we know it. Flushing toilets had previously foundered on the problem of smell: the pipe that connects the toilet to the sewer, allowing urine and faeces to be flushed away, will also also let sewer odours waft back up - unless you can create some kind of airtight seal. Cumming's solution was simplicity itself: bend the pipe. Water settles in the dip, stopping smells coming up; flushing the toilet replenishes the water. While we've moved on alphabetically from the S-bend to the U-bend, flushing toilets still deploy the same insight. Rollout, however, came slowly: by 1851, flushing toilets remained novel enough in London to cause mass excitement when introduced at the Great Exhibition in Crystal Palace. Use of the facilities cost one penny, giving the English language one of its enduring euphemisms for emptying one's bladder, ""to spend a penny"". Hundreds of thousands of Londoners queued for the opportunity to relieve themselves while marvelling at the miracles of modern plumbing. If the Great Exhibition gave Londoners a vision of how public sanitation could be - clean, and smell-free - no doubt that added to the weight of popular discontent as politicians dragged their heels over finding the funds for Joseph Bazalgette's planned sewers. More than 170 years later, about two-thirds of the world's people have access to what's called ""improved sanitation"", according to the World Health Organization, up from about a quarter in 1980. That's a big step forward. But that still means two and a half billion people don't have access to it, and ""improved sanitation"" itself is a relatively low bar. It ""hygienically separates human excreta from human contact"", but it doesn't necessarily treat the sewage itself. Fewer than half the world's people have access to sanitation systems that do that. What the dynamo reveals about technological revolution Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars How the lift transformed the shape of our cities How air conditioning changed the world The economic costs of this ongoing failure to roll out proper sanitation are many and varied, from health care for diarrhoeal diseases to foregone revenue from hygiene-conscious tourists. The World Bank'sEconomics of Sanitation Initiative,externalhas tried to tot up the price tag. Across various African countries, for example, it reckons inadequate sanitation lops one or two percentage points off gross domestic product (GDP), in India and Bangladesh over 6%, and in Cambodia 7%. That soon adds up. Open sewers are a common sight in Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya The challenge is that public sanitation isn't something the market necessarily provides. Toilets cost money, but defecating in the street is free. If I install a toilet, I bear all the costs, while the benefits of the cleaner street are felt by everyone. In economic parlance, that's a ""positive externality"" - and goods that have positive externalities tend to be bought at a slower pace than society, as a whole, would prefer. The most striking example is the ""flying toilet"" system of Kibera, in Nairobi, Kenya. The flying toilet works like this: you defecate into a plastic bag, and then in the middle of the night, whirl the bag around your head and hurl it as far away as possible. Replacing a flying toilet with a flushing toilet provides benefits to the toilet owner - but you can bet that the neighbours would appreciate it, too. Contrast, say, the mobile phone. That also costs money, but its benefits accrue largely to me. That's one reason why, although the S-bend has been around for 10 times as long as the mobile phone, many more people already own a mobile phone than a flushing toilet. If you want to buy a flushing toilet, it also helps if there's a system of sewers to plumb it into, and creating one is a major undertaking - financially and logistically. Joseph Bazalgette, standing top right, views the Northern Outfall sewer being built below the Abbey Mills pumping station in 1862 When Joseph Bazalgette finally got the cash to build London's sewers, they took 10 years to complete and necessitated digging up 2.5 million cubic metres (88 million cubic ft) of earth. Because of the externality problem, such a project might not appeal to private investors: it tends to require determined politicians, willing taxpayers and well-functioning municipal governments. And those, it seems, are in short supply. According to a study published in 2011, just 6% of India's towns and cities have succeeded in building even a partial network of sewers. The capacity for delay seems almost unlimited. London's lawmakers likewise procrastinated- but when they finally acted, they didn't hang about. As Stephen Halliday recounts in his book The Great Stink of London, it took just 18 days to rush through the necessary legislation for Bazalgette's plans. What explains this sudden, impressive alacrity? The Houses of Parliament, photographed in 1858, the year of the Great Stink A quirk of geography: London's Parliament building is located right next to the River Thames. Officials tried to shield lawmakers from the Great Stink, soaking the curtains in chloride of lime in a bid to mask the stench. But it was no use. Try as they might, the politicians couldn't ignore it. The Times described, with a note of grim satisfaction, how MPs had been seen abandoning the building's library, ""each gentleman with a handkerchief to his nose"". If only concentrating politicians' minds was always that easy.

Photos show Moss Side life in 1970s,"Children play on the street in Moss Side in 1972 Moss Side has long been associated with drugs, gangs and violence. But a collection of rarely seen images paint a very different picture of one of Manchester's most notorious neighbourhoods. When Daniel Meadows moved to the city in 1970, he had a less than complimentary view of it. ""It was a big dark city, it was very dirty, it was damp, it rained all the time. ""But it was full of the most wonderful mix of people."" A family poses for a portrait in the street It was a sharp awakening for the aspiring photographer, who recalls having a ""protected, sheltered childhood"" in Gloucestershire. ""By the time I was 18, I was exploding with curiosity about the world and I found myself in Manchester - I might as well have landed on the moon really."" Two brothers outside a boarded-up corner shop He based himself in Moss Side ""because it was cheap"" and close to his art school at the former Manchester Polytechnic. ""I found myself living in the middle of this place where something epic was happening - they were completely bulldozing the place."" A couple in cowboy hats are captured while watching a local parade Demolition in Moss Side was part of a nationwide slum clearance of Victorian terraces, where the houses were described by the area's former Conservative MP, James Watts, as ""unfit for human habitation,external"". It made way for new accommodation and while some residents remained, many were relocated to other parts of the city or chose to move. Mr Meadows took free portraits for Moss Side residents Prof Gus John joined other local figures in campaigning against the destruction while working at the University of Manchester. ""The houses were very sturdily built and could have been renovated with some help from governmentâ¦ the area could have been spruced up. ""What they were doing was not just demolishing old houses, they were demolishing communities - there never was that sense of integrated community identity [again]."" Two young friends smile shyly for their photograph The make-up of the neighbourhood included families of Irish, Polish, Asian and African-Caribbean origin - a ""good spread"" with a ""high level of integration"", Prof John said. ""The sense of mutual collaboration on all kind of issues... was absolutely fantastic. ""There were, and still are, people of all dispositions living in Moss Side, people who propped up the health service, people who propped up the industries in Trafford Park."" The portraits were taken in a studio in a disused shop Keen to document life in Moss Side, Mr Meadows rented a disused barber's shop in 1972 and set up a studio where residents could get their picture taken for free. He also took snaps on the streets, with curious children edging into shot and people, both young and old, neatly turned out despite the deprivation. Many women were seamstresses and tailored stylish outfits for their daughters. Children look at the images in the studio's front window Three girls edge into a shot in the street Many of the girls had stylish, tailored outfits ""Most of the parents had high aspirations for the young people,"" said Prof John, adding that there were several youth clubs and active churches. ""They had a thriving community... and a much greater level of economic activity among that population than you would find now."" Mr Meadows' subjects included local characters and a woman with her foster children Former resident Christine Henry said: ""It was more friendlyâ¦ if you were going out you would ask a neighbour to take a child in, or they would come to your house. ""I've still got friends [from then] - their kids call me auntie, my children call them auntie, we look at each other as familyâ¦ we look at each other as sisters."" An elderly gentleman joins two girls to peer at the pictures in the studio's window Local families struggled financially but affordable housing in Moss Side provided a rare opportunity to own a home. Former resident Freddie Crooks recalled the demolition as a ""heartbreaking"" experience. ""The thing is [our home] was a beautiful houseâ¦ with enough space for a couple and six children."" Freddie Crooks, front, remembers living in a spacious home before demolition A grown-up Mr Crooks poses with the snapshot Prof John believes the destruction of the houses and by extension, the communities, contributed to the headline-grabbing crime of the 1980s onwards. ""There was something quite toxic about the way in which people were expected to live on those [new] estates - it was like herding people. ""You had to walk miles to a shop, there were no facilities for integrating people - no community centres, for example. ""The decision-makers thought that by simply renewing the physical infrastructure, they would actually be improving communities, but quite the opposite happened."" Daniel Meadows, pictured at the back, poses with locals outside his studio Mr Meadow's first exhibition was at the Manchester Caribbean Carnival Mr Meadows held his first exhibition of photos showing life in Moss Side at the inaugural Manchester Caribbean Festival in 1972, nailing his pictures to a tree at Alexandra Park. He continued to document everyday life, taking pictures as he toured England in a bus, which were later exhibited at Tate Britain. Over the summer, he returned to the festival to meet some of the subjects he photographed 45 years ago. ""Sometimes it got too much negative press,"" he said, reflecting on the escalation of crime in Moss Side after he left. ""Things happen elsewhere as well but they just concentrated too much on this part of it,"" he said. ""But I'd like to think that's the past.""

Why I secretly taped my disability assessment,"Nev Cartwright has been left with complications including chronic infections and emphysema. Every month 60,000 ill and disabled people have their needs assessed for benefits. Some are so worried about the process that they are using mobile phones to secretly record those interviews, critics say. But using that evidence to overturn a decision is not straightforward. In 2015, Nev Cartwright sat down with his specialist at a hospital in Leeds. He was told his hacking cough and breathing difficulties were caused by a tumour in his left lung. He was 45. Since then he has had three operations and a lung removed. Nev was awarded the highest rate of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) - a benefit meant to pay for the extra costs of his condition. But a year later he received a letter saying the DLA was being replaced by a new benefit, the Personal Independence Payment, and his needs would have to be reassessed by a private company. The night before his assessment he watched a documentary which questioned how they were being conducted. ""I was really nervous about it and made the decision to audio record the interview covertly. It was a safeguard, an accurate record of what had taken place,"" he says. The face-to-face assessment is typically an interview with a health professional, such as a nurse or paramedic, lasting between 30 and 90 minutes. It can also include basic medical tests and a physical examination. The claimant is assessed depending on their ability to complete day-to-day tasks. That report is sent to an official at the DWP who will then decide the final level of disability benefit that person is awarded. But things did not go as planned. Nev says he had misgivings from the start but it was only later, when he saw the assessor's final report, that he realised something was seriously wrong. ""Some details discussed in the interview were not in the report and others were completely altered,"" he says. ""She said she'd done a physical examination of my mobility. It was very evident on the audio recording, that she never did that at all."" On his phone recording you can clearly hear the assessor carrying out a peak test to measure his lung function, and reading out the data. But in the final report, his last reading appears to have doubled from 150 L/min to 300 L/min, making him seem better than he actually was. ""I totally agree that anyone entitled to benefits should have their needs assessed,"" he says. ""But everyone deserves just and fair treatment."" After his interview Nev had his disability payments cut and had to return the car paid for by the mobility element of his benefits. He wrote to the DWP and told them about his recording, sending them a written transcript put together by an independent firm. Claimants can record their assessments but only if they provide tamper-proof equipment like this, which can cost Â£1,500. Under government rules, secret or covert recording like this is banned. If it is spotted, the claimant is told to stop. If they refuse it is likely that their benefit application will be rejected. The government tried to get his recording thrown out before his appeal at tribunal. But exceptionally, in his case the judge agreed a transcript could be entered into evidence. He went on to win his case and his car was eventually returned. ""I've wasted 12 months of my life in an unfair fight with a government department and the people who work for it,"" he said. The private company which carried out his assessment says its ""high standards were not met on this occasion"" and it has now changed the way it gathers evidence in cases like this. Critics of the assessment process say formal audio recording of all PIP interviews should be mandatory and available to both sides. ""It would remove the distrust and give so much transparency to everyone,"" said Tony Lea, lead welfare rights officer at Benefit Resolutions, a disability advocacy service which has been campaigning for a rule change. As things stand the official rules are complex. A claimant does have the right to ask for a PIP interview to be formally taped and used as evidence, but unlike other disability benefits like ESA, they have to provide their own equipment. This must be a secure, tamper-proof double recorder which can cost as much as Â£1,500. A mobile phone, digital recorder or dictaphone does not meet the requirements. In March, a major independent review of the PIP system commissioned by the government recommended switching to compulsory audio recordings with an opt-out for people who do not want it. The government says it is ""considering the results"" of a pilot of recording in the West Midlands. A spokesman for the DWP said: ""Anyone is free to record their face-to-face consultation, but it must be done in a way that best protects both claimants and assessors."" Nev says his experience shows that some vulnerable people need more protection. ""I should probably be more diplomatic but I think the whole system is a mess,"" he adds. ""The importance for me of getting that audio recording into evidence was the potential to help other people in the future.""

'Smoke smell' forces flights to land,"A flight to Hamburg was in the air for 20 minutes before it returned to Manchester Airport A number of flights to UK airports have been forced to land or divert following reports of ""smoke smells"". Precautionary landings were reported from flights travelling to and from Dublin, Manchester, Liverpool and Jersey. Liverpool John Lennon Airport said the smells appeared to be connected with ""atmospheric conditions"". British Airways, Easyjet and Aurigny confirmed reports of smells on flights were linked to weather conditions. A spokesman for John Lennon Airport said there were three ""precautionary landings"" following reports of smells in the cockpit of the planes. Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said crews were called to the airport at about 07:39 BST and supported airport fire personnel, who boarded a passenger jet. Easyjet confirmed a service between Liverpool and Zakynthos had to return to Liverpool, a flight from Malaga to Liverpool made a precautionary landing at the airport, and a service from Manchester Airport flying to Hamburg also had to return Flybe said crews aboard a service from Cardiff to Dublin took ""precautionary action"" when they detected the smell of fumes, but the aircraft was able to land as normal. It also confirmed another service - travelling from Manchester to Paris - was returned due to a ""fume-like smell"", but landed safely An Aurigny service travelling from Guernsey to Bristol had to head back to the Channel Island due to the smell, but was returned to service after checks by engineers Emergency services were called to a British Airways aircraft landing in Jersey ""as a precaution"" due to the conditions Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service deployed fire crews to Liverpool's John Lennon Airport Steph Whitehead, from Liverpool, was on Easyjet flight EZY1841 which was due to travel from Manchester Airport to Hamburg at 12:25 BST. She said the flight was airborne for about 20 minutes when the captain said there was ""smoke in the cockpit"", and returned the plane to Manchester. Ms Whitehead said passengers in the cabin also caught a whiff of the smoke, which ""smelled like a firework"", adding people were ""a bit worried at first"" about it. Passengers were escorted away from the plane by fire crews, before being put back on the same plane for departure. NATS, a company that provides air traffic control services in the UK, said it had facilitated ""a number"" of diversions from aircraft reporting fumes being detected in the cockpit. All of these flights had landed safely, a spokesman added. It comes following reports ofan ""unusual"" reddish sky across parts of England, which experts are attributing to the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia dragging in tropical air and dust from the Sahara, as well as debris from forest fires in Portugal and Spain. The Met Office said: ""The same southerly winds that have brought us the current warmth have also drawn dust from the Sahara and smoke from wildfires occurring over northern Iberia (Spain/Portugal) to our latitudes.""

Lloyd Webber to retire from Lords,"Lord Lloyd Webber was made a Conservative peer by John Major in 1997 Andrew Lloyd Webber is to retire from the Lords as of midnight on Monday, the House has confirmed. The 69-year-old composer became a life peer in the 1997 New Year's Honours list and sat as a Conservative member. In a statement from his team, Lord Lloyd Webber said he resigned ""with a heavy heart"", but added: ""What is expected from a member today is very different from what it was."" He also said his work schedule was ""the busiest of [his] career to date"". ""This means it would be impossible for me to regularly vote or properly consider the vitally important issues that the House of Lords will face as a consequence of Brexit,"" he said. ""I feel my place should be taken by someone who can devote the time to the House of Lords that the current situation dictates.""

London's role in the Russian Revolution,"The Islington pub where Bolsheviks and Mensheviks argued fiercely during the 1903 party congress In August 1903, a small band of dedicated but argumentative political activists held a fractious conference in London. It consisted of Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky and about 50 other committed agitators who wanted to overthrow the autocratic rule of the Russian Tsar. Their quarrels might have seemed minor at the time, but they have rippled out across history. This was when the Russian revolutionary movement divided into the two rival factions of Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. And a key vote happened in a pub in Islington. The Bolsheviks, described as the 'hards' and led by Lenin, wanted a tightly centralised and disciplined political party; the Mensheviks or 'softs' favoured a looser, broader-based alliance with sympathetic forces. Over the following years, as issues and affiliations shifted, their differences fluctuated but were to become deeper. Fourteen years later, in the second (October) revolution of 1917, the Bolsheviks took power, sidelining and defeating the Mensheviks, and went on to form the Soviet Union. At the 1903 congress in London, where the split emerged, Lenin's faction narrowly lost the vote on the nature of party membership. But then seven anti-Lenin delegates walked out over other disagreements, and with his opponents depleted, his side then won a crucial vote on the editorial board for the party's journal. This outcome enabled Lenin to call his group the Bolsheviks, meaning 'majority' in Russian, while his rivals became the Mensheviks or 'minority'. The bitter dispute prompted uproar in the meeting. According to Richard Mullin, a researcher into early Russian Marxism, Lenin's notes indicate that the tumultuous session took place in the Three Johns pub in Islington. The Whitechapel building where Lenin, Stalin, Trotsky and others arrived for the 1907 congress ""The 1903 London congress is regarded as decisive in the development of Bolshevism - it's hugely significant"", says Neil Faulkner, author of A People's History of the Russian Revolution. But of course its significance is seen differently according to different political viewpoints. ""Most people on the revolutionary left would say this is the decisive break between revolution and reform,"" explains Dr Faulkner. ""A lot of liberal commentators would see it as the tiny seed from which ultimately grows the gulags and the labour camps of the 1930s."" To avoid being monitored during their conference, the Russians moved from venue to venue over a fortnight, often using meeting rooms in pubs recommended by friendly British trade unionists. Leon Trotsky met Lenin for the first time in London The first session in London occurred in a club in Charlotte Street in central London. Otherwise most of these locations are unknown today. The 1903 congress had actually started in Brussels, but after harassment from the Belgian police it moved to London. The British authorities showed more acceptance of exiled Russian revolutionary activities than did many other European countries. This comparative tolerance meant that some other key events in the history of the Russian revolutionary movement also happened in Britain. The 1907 party congress moved to London after being banned in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. This was a much bigger affair of more than 300 delegates, following an outbreak of major social unrest against the Tsar in Russia in 1905. The congress took place in the Brotherhood Church in Hackney, which has since been knocked down and replaced by a housing development. Those present included almost all the future leaders of the Bolshevik revolution, including Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin (a minor figure at the time), Zinoviev, Kamenev and Litvinov, as well as the prominent Russian writer Maxim Gorky. This was the last full congress of the party until after the revolution. Lenin briefly lived in Tavistock Place in Bloomsbury, central London in 1908 The participants first registered for the conference at a building in Fulbourne Street, Whitechapel, which still stands today. At the time it was a Jewish socialist club. Stalin and Maxim Litvinov (who later became Soviet foreign minister) stayed in a doss house nearby in Fieldgate Street, which has since been converted into a somewhat more salubrious block of flats. The conference saw further disputes between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. One issue for discussion was whether to approve the use of bank robberies to help fund revolutionary activities. Most delegates could only afford the trip back to Russia when the impoverished party secured a loan from an eccentric soap manufacturing London businessman who was inspired by watching conference proceedings. A few years earlier Lenin had spent 12 months in London, in 1902-3. He mainly divided his time between researching and writing at the British Museum reading room, and editing a revolutionary journal, Iskra (""The Spark""). In the reading room he studied works on economics and on the Russian peasantry. Lenin was able to obtain books which would have been confiscated in Russia, and was rather impressed by the British state's commitment to the library, telling a friend: ""The British bourgeoisie do not spare any money as far as this institution is concerned, and that is as it should be."" On his various visits to London, Lenin generally stayed around the Bloomsbury area, so that he had easy access to the museum. In 1902 Iskra was produced in London and smuggled across Europe into Russia. Lenin was provided with an office and printing facilities by a supportive left-wing publishing company. The 'Lenin room' in the Marx Memorial Library This building is now the Marx Memorial Library in Clerkenwell. They have preserved what they call 'the Lenin room' with busts of him, old editions of the journal, and copies of Lenin's voluminous collected works. A map on the wall outside shows the smuggling routes used. For Lenin, the journal was crucial both for building up a network of revolutionary activists and also for spreading the political analysis he favoured. It was in London, in October 1902, that Lenin and Trotsky met for the first time. The pair discussed the political circumstances of Russia, but Lenin also showed Trotsky the sights of London. When they went past the Houses of Parliament, Lenin said to his companion ""that is their famous Westminster"". Trotsky later wrote it was obvious that by ""their"", Lenin didn't mean it was the British parliament, he meant it was the ruling class's parliament. Yet it was that parliament, and the system it represented, which gave Lenin, Trotsky and their comrades the political freedom to pursue their goals.

YMCA guilty after girl 'nearly hanged',"This image of a rope bridge was shown in court, but does not feature the girl involved A YMCA activity centre has been found guilty of failing to ensure the safety of a girl who was left hanging by her neck from a rope bridge during a school trip. The then 11-year-old slipped on the bridge at the YMCA Fairthorne Manor activity centre near Botley in 2012. Portsmouth Crown Court heard she was left hanging for several minutes by a safety lanyard looped around her neck. The unconscious girl was cut free by instructors and later recovered. More on this and other stories from across the South of England The girl, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was taken to hospital by air ambulance and made a full recovery. The YMCA Fairthorne Group had denied two charges brought by Winchester City Council over the incident on the so-called Burma Bridge rope bridge activity. She was among a group of 40 pupils from a school in Chandler's Ford who were on a trip to celebrate the end of the school year in July 2012. During the trial, prosecutors  said the rescue was ""pretty shambolic"" and it was ""a matter of luck more than judgement she wasn't seriously hurt"". In the end a cable was severed and the girl dropped into the water under the bridge, along with one of two instructors trying to support her. The company was found guilty of ""failing to discharge a duty in the conduct of an undertaking, to ensure the safety of persons not in their employment"". The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a second charge against the YMCA Fairthorne Group of failing to ensure that employees were adequately trained. The group said it was ""disappointed"" with the verdict and described the incident as an ""unfortunate isolated event"". ""The YMCA Fairthorne Group has a first-class safety record and takes the issue extremely seriously,"" it added. Sentencing is due to take place on 3 November.

'Prolific' paedophile's 100-plus offences,"Falder used online names including ""666devil"" and ""evilmind"" A man said to be among the UK's worst paedophiles blackmailed people online into carrying out ""degrading"" sexual acts, a court heard. Cambridge graduate Matthew Falder, 28, admitted more than 100 offences, including encouraging a teenager to rape a four-year-old boy. Falder contacted 50 victims online over seven years, posing as a female artist, and sharing images on the dark web. It took about 30 minutes to list the offences at Birmingham Crown Court. Falder, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, a former geophysicist researcher at Birmingham University, admitted 137 charges, and denied another 51 which will remain on file after his not guilty pleas were accepted by the prosecution. The number of offences makes him one of the country's most prolific paedophiles, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw said. Falder's case is said to be the National Crime Agency's first successful so-called ""hurtcore"" prosecution. Hurtcore relates to hidden forums on the dark web dedicated to sharing images and videos of rape, murder, sadism, torture, paedophilia, blackmail, humiliation and degradation. Midlands Live: Cyclist killed in bus crash; boxing brawl stab victim named His victims were offered money in return for sending him naked photos, the court heard. Falder used the online names ""666devil"" and ""evilmind"" on websites such as Gumtree. He then blackmailed his victims into sending increasingly obscene images. He also admitted charges of causing the sexual exploitation of a child, encouraging the rape of a four-year-old, making and distributing indecent images of children and voyeurism. It took 30 minutes to read out all the charges against Matthew Falder Images that Falder shared included photographs showing children and babies being tortured, the court was told. Ruona Iguyovwe, of the Crown Prosecution Service described Falder as ""highly manipulative"". ""He clearly enjoyed humiliating his victims and the impact of his offending, which carried on over several years, has been significant,"" he said. Matthew Long, head of operations at the NCA, thanked the victims for their bravery in coming forward. Falder is expected to be sentenced on 7 and 8 December. A spokesman for the University of Birmingham said: ""The university is shocked to hear of the abhorrent crimes committed by a former post-doctoral researcher. ""We have no reason to believe that the offences are in any way connected with the university."" A University of Cambridge spokesperson said Falder was a student there between 2007 and 2016. ""We continue to offer support to anyone who has concerns about the case,"" they added. ""The university is deeply shocked and saddened by this case."" Gumtree, which was named in the court case, said it was pleased that Falder had been brought to justice. ""Gumtree simply does not tolerate the exploitation of users or the illegal misuse of our platform,"" a spokeswoman said. ""â¦ Our dedicated safety team has lent its full support and co-operation to the NCA in their investigation of this case, which has been active for several years. Gumtree takes the safety of its users extremely seriously and we are committed to making the site as safe as possible.""

"It was change sex or die, says transgender girl","This video can not be played Ellen says she knew she was different from an early age One week she went to school dressed as a boy, the next she returned in a dress. Ellen was one of the first primary school children to transition in the UK. But her story runs far deeper than simply wearing the right clothes. For her, transitioning was a matter of life or death. ""For a young boy, I was always flamboyant, I don't want to use the word camp, but... camp. I think people around me just thought I was going to grow up a very sensitive and interesting gay young man. And that's what I thought too, for a really long time. School was the main point where I really found it hard to deal with life because at home I could be my complete self. If I wanted to dress up, I just dressed up, and my family didn't have any qualms about it."" ""I was branded as the weird, queer, gay boy in my school. Internally, I think I did know that I wasn't just gay, but at the age of five you don't really know how to express those feelings. It was constant bullying every day, and it was people telling me I was different from them, and that I should be isolated. A balance of that, mixed with my own thoughts telling me, 'well if I am not this... 'I definitely don't feel right in my body right now, and there's something in my brain that's not correlating... what do I need to do to find out who I am?' I realised that dressing up and living a different life was when I was happiest. It would get to a point when I would come home from school and I would have my whole mini-wardrobe of girl clothes. I would come back from school and hang out in a dress."" ""Inside the house I just got to be me. I could be Ellen. Outside the house, I was the angry and sad boy who showed almost no positive traits. I would still have to wake up every day and be tormented walking to school. I remember saying to my mum, like: 'what can I be when I am older?' And my mum said, 'you can be anything that you want to be.' My face lit up, apparently, and I said; 'Oh can I be a girl? Full time?' And my mum said;  'Oh no, no, no don't be silly,' just brushing it off, because that was the unknown at the time, trans wasn't a big thing in the media at the time. But living my sad version of me definitely took its toll. I became very depressed, I was refusing to leave the house, I was having scary panic attacks at the tiniest of things, that I couldn't really explain. I attempted to take my own life at the age of seven, and I came very close to really harming myself. I was confused, I just wanted everything to end, I wanted everything to be peaceful. I felt it was easier for me not to be a burden for everyone and have all my problems become everyone else's."" ""They sat me down and they told me what they had read online, and I was like; 'That's everything that I've been feeling inside, but haven't been able to articulate'. The fact that I wasn't showering or bathing because I didn't ever want to be fully exposed. My self-esteem issues, and the fact that playing a girl wasn't playing a girl in my head - it was me being my true self. They started to look into it and they found a charity called Mermaids. This was 10 years ago and they were the biggest lifeline. I honestly believe that if I had continued going the way I was going, then I wouldn't necessarily be here, because I wouldn't have been able to keep on living the lie I was living. After a lot of thought and research, my parents decided to have a conversation with me about letting me socially transition. This is where I would go to school one day as a boy and the next as a girl, and I could change my name, and I could be the child I was inside the house and bring her outside. This was an incredibly scary decision for me to make, and for my entire family - they were concerned for my safety and my happiness."" ""My parents spoke a lot with my school, I was in primary school and I was about 11, and my school was actually quite accepting. But it was a very new thing - they didn't have any resources or training. They allowed me to take a week off to get prepared and mentally ready, and then I went in as a girl. It was the scariest day of my life, my mum said I didn't have to do it, that there was absolutely no pressure. I was like: 'No I have to do this,' there was no question that I had to do this. So the last months of primary school I got to go to school as a girl. I was almost branded the youngest transsexual in Britain because at the time I was the youngest to socially transition - to go to school as a boy and then go to school as a girl. It sparked media interest because it was more of a novelty. We'd kind of heard about trans people - what the media thought of trans people you know... grisly men dressed up in dresses and it was a freakish thing - a lot of people thought it was a fetish, you know about sexuality, and people got very confused about the two. It was very weird to suddenly have a child do this."" ""At secondary school, I had a few friends. I had legally changed my name and I was living as a female. It was an OK transition from primary school. The only downfall was the new pupils, because almost every one from my old primary school went to my secondary school, so they knew that I was trans. As soon as I went to secondary school I dismissed any rumours. It was like: 'No I am not trans, I am a girl.' So it sparked loads of rumours and it started me being isolated again. School became a place where I felt like I had to avoid it again, because people were constantly taunting me again. It got to a point when I couldn't be in school any more. I was admitted as an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital, I'd had many suicide attempts."" ""I had an operation that was incredibly life-changing for me at the age of 18. It was the beginning of me saying: 'I am an adult now.' I think I am trying to let go of the paranoia. I had always had that fear that someone would find out my secret. Looking behind my back in case someone's going to out me. It kind of got to the point where: 'This is who I am, This is what I've been through. But it doesn't define me.' I am still a human being with interests and creativity. I am more than my story.""

Bowe Bergdahl pleads guilty to desertion,"Bergdahl arrives at the courthouse on Monday Bowe Bergdahl, the US soldier held as a Taliban captive in Afghanistan for five years, has pleaded guilty to desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. The 31-year-old Army sergeant entered his plea on Monday before a military judge at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The Idaho native's lawyers have argued he cannot get a fair trial following criticism from Donald Trump during last year's presidential campaign. Mr Trump had called him ""a no-good traitor who should have been executed"". When asked during a news conference on Monday whether his comments had any impact on Sgt Bergdahl's case, the president said he could not comment, but ""I think people have heard my comments in the past"". ""We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs,"" Sgt Bergdahl said in a 2016 interview that was obtained by the BBC and broadcast on Monday. In the remarks to British filmmaker Sean Langan, who was himself held captive by the same Taliban group in 2008, Sgt Bergdahl denied he had left his post in order to meet Taliban militants. What happened to captured US soldier Bowe Bergdahl? Bergdahl appeals to Obama for pardon An undated, unverified photo of Sgt Bowe Bergdahl with what appears to be Badruddin Haqqani was released by the Taliban after his return to the US ""You know, it's just insulting frankly,"" he said. ""It's very insulting, the idea that they would think I did that."" Sgt Bergdahl, who remains on active duty desk work in San Antonio, Texas, was first charged in 2015, a year after his release. During Monday's hearing, he told the court: ""I was captured by the enemy against my will."" ""At the time I had no intention of causing search and recovery operations... It's very inexcusable,"" he added. He is scheduled to face a pre-sentencing hearing starting on 23 October. The maximum penalty for misbehaviour before the enemy is life in prison, and the maximum sentence for desertion is five years. Army General Kenneth Dahl, who led the investigation into Sgt Bergdahl's disappearance, has testified that a jail sentence would be""inappropriate"",external. In a podcast interview last year, Sgt Bergdahl said he walked off his combat post to prove to senior officers his commanders were ""unfit"" for service. Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl This video can not be played A video shows Sgt Bowe Bergdahl being handed over to US forces Upon his return to the US, an Army Sanity Board evaluation determined that he had schizotypal personality disorder ""at the time of the alleged criminal conduct"" and now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The decision to exchange five Taliban captives from Guantanamo Bay in order to secure Sgt Bergdahl's release was heavily criticised by Republican lawmakers as contrary to US policy of not negotiating with terrorists. Several former platoon mates have alleged US soldiers were killed or wounded during the frantic 45-day search for the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment trooper. The judge has allowed wounded servicemen to testify that they were hurt because of the search for Sgt Bergdahl. Much of Sgt Bergdahl's captivity was spent in a ""cage"", he said, and he was extensively tortured by his captors, a military expert has previously testified. During Mr Trump's presidential campaign, he called Sgt Bergdahl ""garbage"" and suggested he should be summarily executed. ""You know in the old days - bing, bong,"" Mr Trump said at a campaign rally as he imitated firing a gun. ""When we were strong."" Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl What happened to Bowe Bergdahl?

Dozens die in Portugal and Spain fires,"This video can not be played Firefighters battle flames in Portugal and Spain A wave of wildfires in central and north Portugal which started at the weekend has killed at least 31 people, civil defence authorities say. Dozens of the 145 fires still raging are considered serious, a spokeswoman said. To the north, fires which broke out across the border in Spain's Galicia region claimed at least three lives. Thousands of firefighters are battling the flames, which erupted after a hot dry summer. Conditions were worsened by Hurricane Ophelia, as it approached Europe's western coast, bringing strong winds to fan and spread the flames. Raging wildfires - in pictures More than 50 people have also been injured in Portugal; 15 are reported to be in a serious condition. Local media say several people are still missing there, including a month-old baby. In Spain, two of the victims were found in a burned-out car by the side of the road. Rain is forecast for the affected regions late on Monday. The latest fires in Portugal come just four months after the deadliest wildfire in its history Some 30 ""major"" fires were reported to still be raging in Portugal on Monday In addition to the human casualties, huge damage has been done by the fires A state of emergency has been declared in Portugal north of the Tagus river - about half of the country's land area. More than 6,000 firefighters in 1,800 vehicles were deployed by early Monday morning. As a result of the fires, at least a dozen roads were closed, as well as schools in some places. The Portuguese deaths were in the Coimbra, Guarda, Castelo Branca and Viseu areas. ""We went through absolute hell. It was horrible. There was fire everywhere,"" a resident of Penacova, near Coimbra, was quoted as telling Portuguese RTP radio and TV. Fabio Ventura, who lives in Marinha Grande, in Leria district, told the BBC that some of his friends in villages in the nearby forest had lost their homes. ""Currently, we don't have water in our homes because the pipes were damaged by the fire. We are avoiding taking showers to save water. The mobile network is going down several times and there is a huge cloud of smoke and ashes above my city. ""Schools were closed, public services are closed, some roads are also closed. I have friends that lost their homes, but everyone is OK in my area."" Why are Portugal's wildfires so deadly? Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy travelled to the Pontevedra area of Galicia and met emergency workers on Monday afternoon. ""What we are dealing with here is something that is not caused by accident. It has been provoked,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""We are here in Pazos de Borden where there has been a big fire which began at 01:30 (22:00 GMT) in the morning at five different points. So as you can see it's impossible for this to be triggered under natural circumstances."" Conditions are making it difficult to contain the fires, the Galicia regional government head says Over the border in Spain, authorities are also dealing with multiple fires The Spanish prime minister, who is from Galicia, visited the region on Monday Galician leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo has claimed the fires were deliberately set by arsonists, in what he called ""terrorist acts"". Earlier, Spain's Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said several people had already been identified in connection with the fires, and appealed for anyone with further information to share it with the national protection service. The wildfires followa massive forest blaze in Portugal in Junewhich killed 64 people and injured more than 130. Firefighters tackling that blazealso alleged it had been started by a ""criminal hand"". But in the aftermath, questions were raised about the speed of the response and the readiness to tackle such a fire. It also emerged that the country's rescue network, a public-private partnership,failed to connect several emergency calls to firefighters.

Drone collides with commercial aeroplane,"As drones become more popular, countries will need to consider regulations to restrict usage A drone has collided with a commercial aircraft in Canada, the first such incident in the country, according to the Transport Ministry. The drone struck one of the plane's wings, while six passengers and two crew members were aboard. The aircraft sustained only minor damage and was able to land safely, the Canadian transport minister said. Earlier this year, Canada announced that it was making it illegal to fly recreational drones near airports. The law prohibited airborne drones within 5.5km (3.5 miles) of an airport and restricted the height of a drone's flight to 90 metres (300ft). Those breaking the restrictions could face fines of up to 25,000 Canadian dollars ($20,000, Â£15,000). The Skyjet flight was heading to Quebec City's Jean Lesage International Airport when the drone hit it on 12 October. In a statement,,externaltransport minister Marc Garneau said: ""Although the vast majority of drone operators fly responsibly, it was our concern for incidents like this that prompted me to take action and issue interim safety measures restricting where recreational drones could be flown. ""I would like to remind drone operators that endangering the safety of an aircraft is extremely dangerous and a serious offence."" According to aUK Airprox Board report,,externala drone passed directly over the wing of an aircraft approaching Gatwick Airport this summer. The drone was ""flown into conflict"" with the Airbus 319, with a high risk of collision, read the report.

High-speed train delayed on first journey,"This video can not be played The first of the new GWR trains was more than 20 minutes late with leaking air-con Broken air conditioning and a 41-minute delay have overshadowed the launch of the UK's new fleet of high-speed trains. The Hitachi 800 engine will be faster and carry more passengers and will run on GWR for the next 27 years. But passengers on the first Bristol to London service arrived late and some had to dodge drips as water leaked from an air conditioning unit. Hitachi said the delay was due to a ""minor technical issue"". Things you wanted to know about the Hitachi 800 Karen Boswell, the managing director of Hitachi Rail Europe, said ""an air conditioning issue"" had resulted in water entering the carriage rather than being discharged outside. ""I want to say to passengers that we are really sorry that the first service from Bristol didn't go as planned today,"" she said. ""I was actually on the train and the delay and water leak meant that it was not the standard of service we expect and are known for. We can and will do better."" The fleet of intercity trains was designed to be electric, but due to delays in electrification of the line engines will also be fitted with diesel power. The service was supposed to leave Bristol Temple Meads at 06:00 BST but got under way at 06:25 and finally arrived at Paddington 41 minutes late. The air conditioning had to be turned off after the leak was spotted. A Hitachi Rail Europe spokesman said: ""There was a minor technical issue just before the train left the depot which engineers were able to fix, but meant the train was late leaving Bristol."" He said the air conditioning was a separate issue and the train had been taken to the London depot to be fixed. Great Western Railway and Network Rail have installed overhead cables for the electric trains, that will eventually replace Intercity 125s completely. Due to budget cuts and delays, electrification has fallen short of the Bristol rail section so far. It means the trains will run on diesel from Maidenhead to Bristol. The problems prompted complaints on social media by passengers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Department for Transport says the new trains will cut journey times, increase the number of seats and services, and be more comfortable. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who was on the first service, says the new trains will be ""transformational"" for people from Bristol. He said: ""These are the smartest trains in the country, probably the best we have ever had in the country. ""This going to be a fantastic service, really regular trains and far more capacity.""

Dozens dead in Portugal and Spain fires,"This video can not be played Firefighters battle flames in Portugal and Spain A wave of wildfires in central and north Portugal which started at the weekend has killed at least 31 people, civil defence authorities say. Dozens of the 145 fires still raging are considered serious, a spokeswoman said. To the north, fires which broke out across the border in Spain's Galicia region claimed at least three lives. Thousands of firefighters are battling the flames, which erupted after a hot dry summer. Conditions were worsened by Hurricane Ophelia, as it approached Europe's western coast, bringing strong winds to fan and spread the flames. Raging wildfires - in pictures More than 50 people have also been injured in Portugal; 15 are reported to be in a serious condition. Local media say several people are still missing there, including a month-old baby. In Spain, two of the victims were found in a burned-out car by the side of the road. Rain is forecast for the affected regions late on Monday. The latest fires in Portugal come just four months after the deadliest wildfire in its history Some 30 ""major"" fires were reported to still be raging in Portugal on Monday In addition to the human casualties, huge damage has been done by the fires A state of emergency has been declared in Portugal north of the Tagus river - about half of the country's land area. More than 6,000 firefighters in 1,800 vehicles were deployed by early Monday morning. As a result of the fires, at least a dozen roads were closed, as well as schools in some places. The Portuguese deaths were in the Coimbra, Guarda, Castelo Branca and Viseu areas. ""We went through absolute hell. It was horrible. There was fire everywhere,"" a resident of Penacova, near Coimbra, was quoted as telling Portuguese RTP radio and TV. Fabio Ventura, who lives in Marinha Grande, in Leria district, told the BBC that some of his friends in villages in the nearby forest had lost their homes. ""Currently, we don't have water in our homes because the pipes were damaged by the fire. We are avoiding taking showers to save water. The mobile network is going down several times and there is a huge cloud of smoke and ashes above my city. ""Schools were closed, public services are closed, some roads are also closed. I have friends that lost their homes, but everyone is OK in my area."" Why are Portugal's wildfires so deadly? Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy travelled to the Pontevedra area of Galicia and met emergency workers on Monday afternoon. ""What we are dealing with here is something that is not caused by accident. It has been provoked,"" Mr Rajoy said. ""We are here in Pazos de Borden where there has been a big fire which began at 01:30 (22:00 GMT) in the morning at five different points. So as you can see it's impossible for this to be triggered under natural circumstances."" Conditions are making it difficult to contain the fires, the Galicia regional government head says Over the border in Spain, authorities are also dealing with multiple fires The Spanish prime minister, who is from Galicia, visited the region on Monday Galician leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo has claimed the fires were deliberately set by arsonists, in what he called ""terrorist acts"". Earlier, Spain's Interior Minister Juan Ignacio Zoido said several people had already been identified in connection with the fires, and appealed for anyone with further information to share it with the national protection service. The wildfires followa massive forest blaze in Portugal in Junewhich killed 64 people and injured more than 130. Firefighters tackling that blazealso alleged it had been started by a ""criminal hand"". But in the aftermath, questions were raised about the speed of the response and the readiness to tackle such a fire. It also emerged that the country's rescue network, a public-private partnership,failed to connect several emergency calls to firefighters.

Iraqi forces move into centre of Kirkuk,"This video can not be played Iraqi federal police advance towards disputed city of Kirkuk Iraqi government forces have entered central Kirkuk after taking key installations outside the disputed city from Kurdish fighters. Thousands of people fled the city ahead of the Iraqi advance. The Iraqi military moved into Kirkuk three weeks after the Kurdistan Region held a controversial independence referendum. They are aiming to retake areas under Kurdish control since Islamic State militants swept through the region. Residents of Kurdish-controlled areas, including Kirkuk, overwhelmingly backed secession from Iraq in a 25 September vote. While Kirkuk is outside Iraqi Kurdistan, people in the city were allowed to take part. Kirkuk residents stuck in the middle Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Independence: What is at stake? Iraq's prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, had denounced the vote as unconstitutional. But the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) insisted it was legitimate. US officials said they were ""engaged with all parties in Iraq to de-escalate tension"", while President Donald Trump said they were ""not taking sides"". ""We don't like the fact that they're clashing,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Abadi said in astatement,externalon Monday that the operation in Kirkuk was necessary to ""protect the unity of the country, which was in danger of partition"" because of the referendum. ""We call upon all citizens to co-operate with our heroic armed forces, which are committed to our strict directives to protect civilians in the first place, and to impose security and order, and to protect state installations and institutions,"" he added. On Monday, the Iraqi military said its units had taken control of the K1 military base, the Baba Gurgur oil and gas field, and a state-owned oil company's offices. The government in Baghdad said the Peshmerga had withdrawn ""without fighting"". However, clashes were reported to the south, and the sound of gunfire was caught by a BBC cameraman as a team filmed near a checkpoint. By the afternoon, as thousands of people fled the city fearing impending clashes between the two sides, Iraqi military vehicles were rolling into the heart of Kirkuk. A picture shared on social media appeared to show Iraqi forces sitting in the governor's office. Forces pulled down the Kurdish flag which had been flying alongside the national flag, according to Reuters. Mr Abadi had ordered the flag to fly over all disputed territories. The speed with which Iraqi forces reached the centre of the city has led the two main armed Kurdish parties to accuse each other of ""betrayal"". This video can not be played Shooting breaks out at a checkpoint in Kirkuk The Peshmerga General Command, which is led by President Massoud Barzani of the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), accused officials from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) of aiding ""the plot against the people of Kurdistan"". The PUK denied being part of ordering any withdrawal, saying dozens of their fighters had been killed and hurt, but noted ""not even one KDP Peshmerga has been martyred as of yet in the fighting in Kirkuk"". Meanwhile Turkey, which fears Kurdish independence in Iraq could lead to similar calls from its own Kurdish minority, praised Baghdad, saying it was ""ready for any form of co-operation with the Iraqi government in order to end the PKK presence in Iraqi territory"". The PKK - or Kurdistan Workers' Party - is a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group which has been fighting for autonomy since the 1980s. It is considered a terrorist group by Turkey as well as by the EU and US. Kirkuk is an oil-rich province claimed by both the Kurds and the central government. It is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but its provincial capital has large Arab and Turkmen populations. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Why don't Kurds have a state? Iraqi Kurdistan profile The Iraqi military said it had taken control of oil facilities after Peshmerga withdrew Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when Islamic State (IS) militants swept across northern Iraq and the Iraq army collapsed. The Iraqi parliament asked Mr Abadi to deploy troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the referendum result was announced, but he said last week that he would accept them being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Sunday, his cabinet accused the KRG of deploying non-Peshmerga fighters in Kirkuk, including members of the PKK, which it said was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"".

Weinstein firm in talks over possible sale,"The film production company co-founded by Harvey Weinstein, who is facing a number of sexual assault allegations, is in talks over a possible sale. The Weinstein Company said it had entered a preliminary deal with US private equity firm Colony Capital. Mr Weinstein, 65, was fired by the board of his company earlier this month, and was later expelled by the organisation behind the Oscars. The Hollywood producer insists sexual relations he had were consensual. Police inLondonand New York are investigating various allegations against Weinstein. How the scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein's accusers What was it like to work for Weinstein? The Weinstein Company, which was behind Oscar-winning films including The King's Speech and The Artist, has come under intense pressure over the scandal. The firm said it was in talks with Colony Capital about the sale of some or all of the company. Colony has also agreed to inject funds immediately into embattled firm. Tarak Ben Ammar, a board member of The Weinstein Company, said the extra funds would ""help stabilise the company's current operations"". Colony Capital founder Thomas J Barrack Jr with Harvey Weinstein and Julia Roberts at a film premiere in 2013 Colony Capital, founded by Thomas J Barrack Jr - a friend of President Donald Trump - is already a major player in the film industry. In 2010, it bought Miramax, another film production company set up by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein, from Disney. It also worked with The Weinstein Company in developing the film libraries of the two firms for platforms including Netflix, Amazon and Apple, before selling Miramax last year for an undisclosed price. Mr Barrack Jr said: ""We are pleased to invest in The Weinstein Company and to help it move forward. ""We will help return the company to its rightful iconic position in the independent film and television industry."" The real estate tycoon is a former business partner of President Trump and chaired his inauguration committee. His private equity firm Colony says it has funds of $56bn (Â£42bn) under management. Did everyone really know about Weinstein? The casting couch culture of LA The Weinstein brothers set up The Weinstein Company in 2005, twelve years after selling Miramax to Disney. Last year, Harvey Weinstein said the The Weinstein Company, including its film library, was worth up to $800m and had no debt. However, a number of the firm's partners have cut ties in recent days amid the allegations against Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment. Goldman Sachs said on Friday it was exploring options for the small stake it holds in the company, a day after US publisher Hachette Book Group terminated its tie-up with Weinstein Books.

The 'working class boy' who built a Â£1bn business,"Mr Davdra's wife recently treated him to a new Harley Davidson Paresh Davdra is thrilled about the brand new Harley Davidson waiting for him in a friend's garage. It's not a sign of a mid-life crisis, he insists, but a wedding present from his wife who he married in August. He just has one more test to pass to get his motorcycle licence, then he can hop on the bike and whizz around London for meetings. The boss and co-founder of money exchange firm Rational FX, which reported revenues of more than Â£1bn ($1.3bn) last year, has a life that's worlds apart from his parents and grandparents. They were forced to flee Uganda in 1972 when dictator Idi Amin gave the Asian population just 90 days to leave the country. ""They came to the UK with just Â£50 between them,"" says the softly-spoken Mr Davdra. ""My grandfather had his own tailoring shop, but they had to leave everything behind."" His family pulled together and bought a house in Harrow, north London, with his dad securing a job as clerk, and later as a financial controller, at a foreign exchange broker. Paresh Davdra co-founded RationalFX in 2005 Their fighting spirit rubbed off on the younger Davdra. ""We were never really given anything - if I wanted something, I had to earn it."" From the age of 16, he spent the school holidays holding jobs in a mobile phone shop and in telesales, while out of term at Middlesex University, he worked at his dad's firm, taking up roles from filing to working in compliance. He studied marketing and computer science at university, but tells me that technology does not come naturally to him. ""If you told my team I had this degree, they wouldn't believe you. I'm always the one calling IT to connect the laptop to the printer,"" he laughs. As soon as Mr Davdra graduated, in 2003, he joined his dad's company as a foreign exchange dealer, helping clients to buy and sell large quantities of foreign currencies. He was in the role for just over a year, working with Indian-born Rajesh Agrawal, a friend of his father's who had arrived in the UK in 2001. But two factors would spur him to quit. ""I'd tried to buy a property with my dad but the bank rejected the mortgage application,"" Mr Davdra says. ""It deflated me."" RationalFX is based in Canary Wharf, London At the same time, Mr Agrawal resigned from his IT manager role. ""When he decided to quit, I badgered him. I asked him to tell me what he was doing,"" Mr Davdra says. The two met for coffee and quickly agreed they wanted to set up a company together. The idea was to support customers buying property abroad with their currency needs. ""Everything we were doing at the old firm was manual, but we thought we could offer the same service online,"" Mr Davdra says. However, the duo faced a serious challenge: money. Mr Davdra was only a year out of university and had already taken out a personal loan to buy a BMW. When Mr Agrawal took their business plan to the bank and asked to borrow Â£10,000, he was swiftly rejected. But he returned a few days later and asked for Â£20,000 to buy a car. The bank said yes. ""I then sold my BMW and we were set,"" says 37-year-old Mr Davdra, who also moved into Mr Agrawal's home to save on rent. Mr Davdra's grandfather had to flee Uganda in 1972 With just Â£32,000 between them, the pair launched their foreign exchange brokerage, RationalFX, in 2005. Like many start-ups, the next difficult task was signing up customers. ""We got on the phones and started pitching to estate agents and attended every property industry event there was,"" recalls Mr Davdra. ""We'd be in the office all day from 8am, then we'd just be at it in the evenings."" Their big breakthrough came when they signed a number of estate agents who were selling properties in Dubai. However, just two years after launching, the financial crisis hit. Mr Davdra reflects candidly on how it changed his young mindset. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: 'I quit Google and launched a business with my mum' The man who built a drinks empire... twice How jeans giant Levi Strauss got its mojo back From successful musician to mortgage pioneer ""I was 27 at the time and the business was doing great guns, and I was well on my way to being rich. That's all I thought about it. ""It wasn't really about building a business - that comes with time and maturity. But the crash brought that along. It was a good learning curve."" Rational FX also felt the fall-out from the crash, with its growth slowing. But it weathered the storm and went on to diversify. Today, its clients range from high-net worth individuals, either buying property or making investments, to medium-sized businesses, such as firms exporting cars or importing textiles. RationalFX employs 110 people It reported revenues of Â£1.3bn in 2016, up from Â£1.1bn the year before, and pre-tax profits of Â£2.3m - largely because the firm reinvested heavily in its business, Mr Davdra says. After enjoying success with Rational FX, the founders had an idea for an offshoot company - an online money transfer platform aimed at individuals sending lower sums to family overseas. ""We felt that Rational FX was driving revenues, but Xendpay [the new company] was more of a social initiative, to try and bring the costs of remittance down for people working hard to bring their families out of poverty."" Xendpay has a ""pay what you want"" model, although it does suggest a minimum commission of 0.3-0.4% of the transaction. Mr Davdra says that more than 70% of users pay the suggested fee, 10% hand over more, and the rest pay nothing. The platform isn't profitable yet, although Mr Davdra expects it to break even next year. ""It was a bit of gamble but a risk we were willing to take."" Last year Mr Agrawal stepped down from the firm after he was appointed Deputy Mayor of London for Business. He still owns 70% of the business, and is a non-executive director, while Mr Davdra holds the remaining shares. Mr Davdra says he ""misses him"". ""Apart from business, over the last 12 years we have developed a good relationship. He's a very very close friend."" For now, there are no plans to sell RationalFX, although private equity firms approach the firm ""an average of twice a day"". ""Our brands are still growing and are quite young. It's all about the right opportunity,"" Mr Davdra says. Headquartered at Canary Wharf, RationalFX and Xendpay together employ 110 members of staff. Despite his penchant for expensive bikes and cars, Mr Davdra - who still lives in Harrow - has his feet firmly on the ground. ""I think we're pretty humble. We're working class, and we just do normal stuff. It's the way we've been brought up.""

Best and worst motorway services named,"Neither synonymous with glamour nor a byword for luxury, England's best motorway service stations have been unveiled after a comprehensive survey... but the services from hell are named and shamed too. Transport Focus conducted the study of 112 pit-stops. In compiling the list, the travel watchdog questioned 8,700 customers on key factors including staffing, food and the all-important lavatories. Perhaps surprisingly, the same company. Moto, operates service stations at both extremes of the ranking. The M4's Reading Services Westbound takes the crown for the country's best stop-off - with a customer satisfaction score of 100%. But bottom of the pile came Heston Services Eastbound, with a rating of 62%. The west London respite - which turns 50 next year - is the subject of scathing Google reviews. One described it as ""dirty, old and tired"", while another said it was the ""worst motorway services I've ever been to"". Toilets are condemned as ""pretty rank"", while another reviewer advised: ""Keep going, you are nearly in London."" The best of the best 1. Reading Services Westbound - M4 in Berkshire 2. Rivington Services Northbound - M61 in Bolton, Lancashire 3. Corley Services Northbound - M6 in Warwickshire 4. Gloucester Services Southbound - M5 in Gloucestershire 5.

Heston Services Eastbound - M4 in Hounslow, Middlesex Gloucester Services Southbound were rated highly A spokesman for Moto, which operates Heston and Reading services, said: ""We're disappointed that the visit to Heston East was done in the middle of building works, although we recognise that in this instance we haven't done as well as we should have done. ""It's only fair to point out that Heston East is one of the smallest service areas on the motorway network and so is unable to provide many of the facilities we have at our larger sites."" AA president Edmund King said: ""British drivers have a love/hate relationship with service areas. ""For some people, being able to get a decent, discounted coffee is all they ask for - and that might just enhance their safety."" Heston Services Eastbound were rated the worst service station in England Transport Focus chief executive Anthony Smith said: ""Our research shows that up and down the country motorway services are providing customers with a good experience and are playing a positive role. ""They tell us they feel less stressed and are more awake after a good break. ""Motorway service operators must not rest on their laurels, however."" Transport Minister John Hayes said: ""Motorways services can and should be lovely places for drivers to enjoy - not just places they have to stop. ""Congratulations to those scoring the most highly.

Sex exploitation 'rife in music industry',"This video can not be played Sarah Bowden says one major promoter exposed himself to her The treatment and sexual exploitation of women in the music industry is ""as bad, if not worse"" than in Hollywood, an experienced artist manager has said. Sarah Bowden told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme she had once been sacked after refusing to sleep with a colleague in return for a promotion. She said one major promoter exposed himself, expecting a sex act from her. He was still working in the industry, she added, and believed he was behaving the same way. It comes after a number ofsexual assault allegations against Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein. Ms Bowden said exploitation happens ""all the way down through the industry"" and was ""as common as being wolf-whistled at in the street"". She said earlier in her career she had been told the job she wanted was not usually open to women but that an exception could be made if she slept with a more senior colleague. She had refused and had been fired, she added. Years later, after she had progressed in the industry, she claimed a well-known band promoter exposed himself to her at a music festival. ""He took me back to a caravan and basically exposed himself to me"" she said, adding that he expected her to perform a sex act. ""I know that he did the same thing to other women, that same day, and he's still working in the industry."" Ms Bowden has waived her right to anonymity. Ms Bowden, who has worked in the industry for 20 years, said women did not speak out because they felt nothing would be done. She said she had witnessed one senior figure in the industry regularly promise young women jobs or roles on high profile band tours in return for sexual favours. The agent would ""parade"" the women around, she added, mentioning names of famous artists with whom he had worked. She said the man, who still works in the industry, was ""brazen"" about the acts.

Personal debt in five charts,"Borrowing on loans, overdrafts, credit cards and car finance has accelerated since 2011. Although it peaked in November last year, the annual rate of growth of so-called consumer credit remains close to double-digit levels. 'Credit card debt made me want to die' FCA boss warns about debt and young people When should you worry about debt? One reason for this trend is the fashion for Personal Contract Purchase, or PCP, agreements when buying a car. This product, imported from the US, effectively means borrowers rent the car and the monthly payments cover the depreciation of its value over time. Obviously, this still counts as a loan. Another signal of the greater availability of credit over time is the competition between credit card companies over 0% balance transfer deals. A balance transfer effectively allows a borrower to use a new credit card to pay off debt on another credit card. The length of time that the amount borrowed is interest-free has been increasing. Failing to meet a repayment deadline can leave people in a serious spiral of debt, charities warn. The Bank of England has also expressed concern. All this has left some young people with serious concerns that they will struggle to pay off debts. Some campaigners say that the availability of credit, alongside a squeeze in wages, has led these young adults to turn more readily than the older generation to credit to buy day-to-day essentials. One in five 25-to-34-year-olds admitted doing this in the past six months, according to research by PWC, compared with 6% of the over-55s. Those carrying the heaviest financial burden may eventually find their debts are unmanageable and choose to go insolvent. There are various options, the most well-known of which is bankruptcy. All can have long-term implications for borrowing, ranging from buying a house to getting a mobile-phone contract. The prevalence of young people going insolvent is higher in some areas of the country, with a couple of seaside towns topping the list. Reality Check: Has personal debt been growing?

'Credit card debt made me want to die',"Seaside towns in England and Wales - and the young families living in them - are suffering the worst levels of debt in the country, new figures reveal. The Isle of Wight has the highest level of insolvencies amongst young adults, according to the Insolvency Service, followed by Torbay and Scarborough. Overall the number of 18 to 34 year-olds becoming insolvent rose by 31.3% between 2015 and 2016. It comes ahead of a possible rise in interest rates as soon as next month. Any increase would be the first in the UK for over ten years - and would inevitably make borrowing more expensive. Young face big debt burden - City chief When should you start to worry about your debts? Top tips for avoiding debt Coastal communities tend to be the worst affected because much of the work is low-paid and seasonal. Daniel and his wife Laura - who live on the Isle of Wight - have joint debts of around Â£30,000. He works full time in construction, while she looks after their two-year old son. They're both 28 years old. Unable to pay for food, they built up debts of Â£7,000 on a credit card. They also owed Â£3,000 in council tax. ""At one point, to survive, we had chickens. We were living off eggs. Just eggs, bread and milk, because that's all we could afford,"" says Daniel. But things got even more serious than that. ""I couldn't have been in a worse place,"" says Laura. "" I had depression and anxiety, and I was pregnant. At times I even felt suicidal. ""And that's the worst thing, because I look back and think If I'd ever gone through with that then my son wouldn't be here. I didn't want to exist."" Daniel is in the process of declaring himself bankrupt, while Laura has applied for a Debt Relief Order (DRO), a separate form of insolvency. Torbay in Devon has the highest overall rate of insolvencies in England and Wales, with 43 per 10,000 residents in 2016.  Stoke on Trent has the second highest rate, with the Isle of Wight and Scarborough in joint third. Great Yarmouth and Ipswich also have high insolvency rates. Sandra Snell, who works as a debt counsellor for Christians Against Poverty on the Isle of Wight, believes there are particular pressures on seaside communities. Unemployment is high, and much of the work is seasonal. 'People are expected to live on nothing', says Sandra Snell ""In the season there'll be more work because of the tourist trade,"" she says. ""Some people will slot into jobs, whether it's cleaning the chalets or waiting on tables; then when the season comes to an end, they're back to square one, and they've got no work."" When people transfer onto benefits in the winter months, there can be delays before their money comes through. ""People are waiting at least 12 weeks. There's no money coming in and they're expected to live on nothing."" The cost of living can also be much higher than elsewhere. Petrol is on sale on the Isle of Wight for up to 130 pence a litre - around 10% higher than the national average. A survey for the accountancy firm PwC suggests that 28% of those in the 25 to 34 year-old age group are worried about making repayments on their debt. And 20% of young adults have used credit cards to pay for essential items like food. Official figures show that insolvency rates are now rising for the first time since 2009. However they are a long way from the peak of insolvencies, seen in 2009. Similarly, the total amount of consumer credit - the measure of borrowing used by the Bank of England - may have reached Â£203bn in August, but that is lower than in 2008. Consumer credit is currently growing at 9.8% a year - down from a 10.9% peak last November, and way below the 15.8% growth seen in September 2002. Meanwhile Daniel and Laura say the debt help they received from CAP has transformed their outlook. ""They possibly saved my life,"" says Laura. ""My wife wouldn't be here without them,"" adds Daniel.

Manson recalls 'excruciating' accident,"Marilyn Manson: 'The pain was excruciating' Marilyn Manson has discussed for the first time the ""excruciating"" stage accident that resulted in a leg injury and nine postponed tour dates.

Hospitals in chocolate crackdown,"""Super-sized"" chocolate bars are to be banished from hospital shops, canteens and vending machines, NHS England says. Sweets and chocolate sold in hospitals should be 250 calories or under, the head of the body says. Under the plans, most ""grab bags"" will be banned - with hospitals given a cash boost for facilitating the change. The proposals would also see 75% of pre-packed sandwiches coming in at under 400 calories. Pre-packed savoury meals and sandwiches must also contain no more than 5g of saturated fat per 100g. And 80% of the drinks stocked must have less than 5g of added sugar per 100ml. In April, NHS England said it would ban sugary drinksif hospital outlets did not cut down on the number they sell. Simon Stevens said the NHS was ""stepping up"" to combat an issue that was causing ""an epidemic of obesity, preventable diabetes, tooth decay, heart disease and cancer"". ""In place of calorie-laden, sugary snacks we want to make healthier food an easy option for hospital staff, patients and visitors."" NHS staff are also being targeted as part of the move to tackle unhealthy eating, including those on overnight shifts. It is estimated that nearly 700,000 of the NHS's 1.3million staff are overweight or obese. NHS premises have huge footfall from the communities they serve, with one million patients every 24 hours. The Royal Voluntary Service, the biggest hospital retailer across the UK, said it had already begun introducing healthier choices and had seen fruit sales go up by a quarter. Public Health England says hospitals have an ""important role"" in addressing obesity and not just dealing with the consequences. Campaigners says more action is till needed. Helen Dickens from Diabetes UK said: ""We look forward to seeing more information on how it will work in practice. ""However this is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to tackling obesity. We need to go much further, which is why we are also calling for the Government to toughen restrictions on junk food marketing to children, end price promotions on unhealthy foods and introduce mandatory front of pack food labelling."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We restricted the sale of chocolate bars and other sugary products from vending machines in Welsh hospitals nine years ago. We're pleased NHS England is now looking to follow our lead.""

Iraqi forces move on Kurdish-held sites,"This video can not be played Iraqi federal police advance towards disputed city of Kirkuk Iraqi government forces have captured key installations outside the disputed city of Kirkuk from Kurdish fighters. A military statement said units had taken control of the K1 military base, the Baba Gurgur oil and gas field, and a state-owned oil company's offices. Baghdad said the Peshmerga had withdrawn ""without fighting"", but clashes were reported south of Kirkuk. The operation was launched a month after the Kurdistan Region held a controversial independence referendum. Iraq's prime minister has said the vote - in which residents of Kurdish-controlled areas, including Kirkuk, overwhelmingly backed secession - was unconstitutional. Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Independence: What is at stake? The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) insisted it was legitimate. US officials said they were ""engaged with all parties in Iraq to de-escalate tension"". Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in astatement,externalthat the operation in Kirkuk was necessary to ""protect the unity of the country, which was in danger of partition"" because of the referendum. ""We call upon all citizens to co-operate with our heroic armed forces, which are committed to our strict directives to protect civilians in the first place, and to impose security and order, and to protect state installations and institutions,"" he added. Earlier, the Iraqi military announced that elite units had been ""re-deployed"" at the K1 base, about 5km (3 miles) north-west of the city of Kirkuk, and that other troops had taken control of the nearby Leylan area, the Baba Gurgur oilfield, and the headquarters of the North Oil Company. The military also said troops had taken control of a military airport, police station, power plant and several industrial areas, as well as key bridges, roads, junctions. The Kurdistan Region Security Council accused Baghdad of launching an ""unprovoked attack"" and said the Peshmerga would ""continue to defend Kurdistan, its peoples and interests"". Peshmerga had destroyed five US-made Humvees used by the Popular Mobilisation, a paramilitary force dominated by Iran-backed Shia militias, it added. Allow Twitter content?

Peshmerga spokesman Brig Gen Bahzad Ahmedtold,externalthe Associated Press that the fighting south of Kirkuk had caused ""lots of casualties"". He alleged that pro-government forces had also ""burnt lots of houses and killed many people"" in Tuz Khurmatu, 75km south of Kirkuk, and Daquq. There was no way of verifying the reports, but a doctor at a hospital in Tuz Khurmatu told AFP news agency that two people had been killed by artillery fire. The US-led coalition against IS, which supports both Iraqi government and Peshmerga forces,said,externalit had so far only seen ""co-ordinated movements"" by military vehicles around Kirkuk and ""not attacks"". A limited exchange of fire before dawn was the result of a ""misunderstanding and not deliberate as two elements attempted to link up under limited visibility conditions"", a statement added. By Orla Guerin, BBC News On the streets of Kirkuk we have seen armed Kurdish civilians - old and young, but almost no Kurdish security forces.

As we filmed at the main checkpoint at the southern edge of Kirkuk there was a sudden burst of automatic gunfire. It seemed to come from a location where Shia militia units are in position. Kirkuk is an oil-rich province claimed by both the Kurds and the central government. It is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but its provincial capital has large Arab and Turkmen populations. The Iraqi military said it had taken control of oil facilities after Peshmerga withdrew Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when Islamic State (IS) militants swept across northern Iraq and the Iraq army collapsed. The Iraqi parliament asked Mr Abadi to deploy troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the referendum result was announced, but he said last week that he would accept them being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Sunday, his cabinet accused the KRG of deploying non-Peshmerga fighters in Kirkuk, including members of the Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it said was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"". But KRG officials denied this. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Why don't Kurds have a state? Iraqi Kurdistan profile By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent These are the opening moves in what threatens to be a new conflict in Iraq; a battle for the control of territory captured from IS. Kurdish fighters are emboldened by the recent referendum which saw a huge vote for Kurdish independence. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have played a crucial role in the battle against IS in Iraq The Baghdad government will take the view that it is simply seeking to restore the status quo prior to the emergence of IS. To say things are complicated is an understatement. The Kurds themselves are divided. Other ethnic militias have their own interests to defend. And the US seems unable to halt the fighting as it watches US trained and armed Iraqi units confront Kurdish groups who are also Washington's allies. Kurdish leaders refuse government demands Peshmerga Kirkuk 'deadline' passes Iraqi Kurds send reinforcements to Kirkuk Iraq orders arrest of Kurdistan officials Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Iraqi Kurdish referendum: What is at stake?

Young 'having to borrow to live',"This video can not be played Jessica Malolepszy tells the BBC how her debt problems began with a holiday loan The chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority has warned of a ""pronounced"" build up of debt among young people. In an interview with the BBC, Andrew Bailey said the young were having to borrow for basic living costs. The regulator also said he ""did not like"" some high-cost lending schemes. He said consumers, and institutions that lend to them, should be aware that interest rates may rise in the future and that credit should be ""affordable"". 'Credit card debt made me want to die' Young and in the red: Personal debt in five charts What is debt and when should you worry? Top tips for staying out of debt The head of the FCA was talking to the BBC as part of its 'Money Matters' coverage, looking at the issues of credit and debt in the UK. Mr Bailey said action was being taken to curb long-term credit card debt and high-cost pay-day loans. The regulator is also looking at charges in the rent-to-own sector which can leave people paying high levels of interest for buying white goods such as washing machines, he added. ""There is a pronounced build up of indebtedness amongst the younger age group,"" Mr Bailey said. ""We should not think this is reckless borrowing, this is directed at essential living costs. It is not credit in the classic sense, it is [about] the affordability of basic living in many cases."" Although Mr Bailey said that high levels of consumer debt was not a crisis ""in the macro-economic sense"", it did matter to struggling individuals whose stories he had listened to during visits to debt management charities. ""There are particular concentrations [of debt] in society, and those concentrations are particularly exposed to some of the forms and practices of high cost debt which we are currently looking at very closely because there are things in there that we don't like,"" Mr Bailey said. ""There has been a clear shift in the generational pattern of wealth and income, and that translates into a greater indebtedness at a younger age. ""That reflects lower levels of real income, lower levels of asset ownership. There are quite different generational experiences,"" he said. Mr Bailey says more people have ""erratic"" money flows because of the changing workplace Mr Bailey was speaking as research shows young people in particular are concerned about the amount of debt they are carrying and their ability to repay that debt He said the high price of renting and lack of income growth meant that more people had to use credit to make ends meet. Recent Bank of England figures show that consumer debt, excluding mortgages, now totals over Â£200bn and is approaching levels not seen since the financial crisis. The increase in what is known as ""unsecured lending"" on credit cards, car loan schemes, personal loans and overdrafts is running at 10% a year. People are also saving less as ultra low interest rates eat into returns. ""Obviously we all question how long this can that go on for,"" Mr Bailey said. ""But in aggregate it isn't on its own something that we should be describing as a crisis."" He added: ""I am not of the school of thought that credit should not be available to this section of society because credit should be there to smooth income in the classic sense, and we know there are more people with erratic income flows, that is one of the features of the so-called gig-economy."" Mr Bailey said that ""sustainable credit is a necessary part of society"". How a holiday loan spiralled out of control.

Mesh surgeon investigated by NHS trust,"The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs A surgeon who carried out mesh surgery that left women in severe pain is being investigated by his NHS trust. Tony Dixon, who is based in Bristol, uses a technique known as mesh rectopexy to fix bowel problems, often caused by childbirth. Several women are considering legal action after being treated by him. Mr Dixon said he was unable to comment because of the investigation, but the BBC understands he denies doing anything wrong. He works at Southmead Hospital and at the Spire private hospital in Bristol. One of Mr Dixon's patients, Sam van der Heijden from Hastings in East Sussex, said she was left with major pain and complications after Mr Dixon inserted the mesh in 2011. She had had previous surgery with someone else and was facing a difficult future. ""I researched on the internet and Mr Dixon came up as the pioneer of mesh rectopexy,"" she said. ""So I thought, right, if I'm having problems I need to go to the best. ""He said [it] will solve all your problems. Because I believed he was the expert I didn't question it."" Another surgeon told the BBC in their opinion her mesh was not attached where they would expect it to be. Concerns have also been raised by patients who said they were not fully warned of possible complications. Sam van der Heijden says surgery left her with major pain and complications Gynaecologist Dr Sohier Elneil has taken on the care of several patients from all over the UK who were operated on by Mr Dixon in Bristol. ""There might be patients in whom it has been absolutely fine, but we now know there are many patients who are suffering as a consequence of this type of surgery,"" she said. ""This year alone we've operated on seven such cases. ""It worries me when you start to hear the same name or same technique or the same problem in women from different parts of the country."" Mr Dixon is being investigated by Southmead Hospital, where he currently cannot perform mesh operations. The General Medical Council (GMC) is also investigating, and has stopped him from performing another form of corrective surgery, known as a Starr procedure (stapled transanal resection of the rectum), for a year from August 2017. What's the issue with mesh implants? The mesh is made of a polypropylene, a type of plastic Mesh implants are medical devices used by surgeons to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence in women, conditions that can commonly occur after childbirth. The mesh, usually made from synthetic polypropylene, is intended to repair damaged or weakened tissue. Mr Dixon has his supporters, and the BBC has been told he is pioneering, experienced and conscientious. The Pelvic Floor Society (PFS) says up to 2.5% of women who have mesh surgery will suffer complications, but it can bring life-changing benefits. The society's Andrew Williams said it was ""up to the woman herself"" to discuss with her surgeon the ""risks and benefits"". One surgeon told the BBC that complications arising from mesh surgery, a procedure which became common in about 2004, could not have been foreseen. The PFS said it began to recognise complications in 2014, but its chair could not say whether surgeons should have mentioned complications before then. Two Bristol law firms are considering legal action, after taking on 16 women who were operated on by Mr Dixon. Madeleine Pinschof from Thompsons Solicitors said the majority had suffered ""debilitating complications... far worse than before they had these procedures"". ""Certainly we don't believe that all of the possible complications had been explained,"" she said. Luke Trevorrow from solicitors Irwin Mitchell said he suspected there may be ""more patients out there who have received treatment from Mr Dixon who are equally concerned"". North Bristol NHS Trust, which runs Southmead Hospital, said it was investigating concerns raised over ""certain pelvic floor repair procedures"" and said Mr Dixon was ""not currently providing these procedures"" at the trust. Spire Bristol Hospital's director, Dan Rees Jones, said Mr Dixon was currently not permitted to perform procedures and was ""restricted to outpatient follow-up appointments"" while the NHS trust completes its investigation. He added that complications relating to Mr Dixon's practice at the hospital ""fall within normal parameters"".

Iraqi forces move on disputed Kirkuk,"This video can not be played Iraqi federal police advance towards disputed city of Kirkuk Iraqi government forces have captured key installations outside the disputed city of Kirkuk from Kurdish fighters. A military statement said units had taken control of the K1 military base, the Baba Gurgur oil and gas field, and a state-owned oil company's offices. Baghdad said the Peshmerga had withdrawn ""without fighting"", but clashes were reported south of Kirkuk. The operation was launched a month after the Kurdistan Region held a controversial independence referendum. Iraq's prime minister has said the vote - in which residents of Kurdish-controlled areas, including Kirkuk, overwhelmingly backed secession - was unconstitutional. Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Independence: What is at stake? The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) insisted it was legitimate. US officials said they were ""engaged with all parties in Iraq to de-escalate tension"". Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in astatement,externalthat the operation in Kirkuk was necessary to ""protect the unity of the country, which was in danger of partition"" because of the referendum. ""We call upon all citizens to co-operate with our heroic armed forces, which are committed to our strict directives to protect civilians in the first place, and to impose security and order, and to protect state installations and institutions,"" he added. Earlier, the Iraqi military announced that elite units had been ""re-deployed"" at the K1 base, about 5km (3 miles) north-west of the city of Kirkuk, and that other troops had taken control of the nearby Leylan area, the Baba Gurgur oilfield, and the headquarters of the North Oil Company. The military also said troops had taken control of a military airport, police station, power plant and several industrial areas, as well as key bridges, roads, junctions. The Kurdistan Region Security Council accused Baghdad of launching an ""unprovoked attack"" and said the Peshmerga would ""continue to defend Kurdistan, its peoples and interests"". Peshmerga had destroyed five US-made Humvees used by the Popular Mobilisation, a paramilitary force dominated by Iran-backed Shia militias, it added. Allow Twitter content?

Peshmerga spokesman Brig Gen Bahzad Ahmedtold,externalthe Associated Press that the fighting south of Kirkuk had caused ""lots of casualties"". He alleged that pro-government forces had also ""burnt lots of houses and killed many people"" in Tuz Khurmatu, 75km south of Kirkuk, and Daquq. There was no way of verifying the reports, but a doctor at a hospital in Tuz Khurmatu told AFP news agency that two people had been killed by artillery fire. The US-led coalition against IS, which supports both Iraqi government and Peshmerga forces,said,externalit had so far only seen ""co-ordinated movements"" by military vehicles around Kirkuk and ""not attacks"". A limited exchange of fire before dawn was the result of a ""misunderstanding and not deliberate as two elements attempted to link up under limited visibility conditions"", a statement added. By Orla Guerin, BBC News On the streets of Kirkuk we have seen armed Kurdish civilians - old and young, but almost no Kurdish security forces. One man told us he was ashamed the Peshmerga had abandoned some positions outside the city overnight. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As we filmed at the main checkpoint at the southern edge of Kirkuk there was a sudden burst of automatic gunfire. It seemed to come from a location where Shia militia units are in position. Kirkuk is an oil-rich province claimed by both the Kurds and the central government. It is thought to have a Kurdish majority, but its provincial capital has large Arab and Turkmen populations. The Iraqi military said it had taken control of oil facilities after Peshmerga withdrew Kurdish Peshmerga forces took control of much of the province in 2014, when Islamic State (IS) militants swept across northern Iraq and the Iraq army collapsed. The Iraqi parliament asked Mr Abadi to deploy troops to Kirkuk and other disputed areas after the referendum result was announced, but he said last week that he would accept them being governed by a ""joint administration"" and that he did not want an armed confrontation. On Sunday, his cabinet accused the KRG of deploying non-Peshmerga fighters in Kirkuk, including members of the Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which it said was tantamount to a ""declaration of war"". But KRG officials denied this. Sykes-Picot: The map that spawned a century of resentment Why don't Kurds have a state? Iraqi Kurdistan profile By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent These are the opening moves in what threatens to be a new conflict in Iraq; a battle for the control of territory captured from IS. Kurdish fighters are emboldened by the recent referendum which saw a huge vote for Kurdish independence. Kurdish Peshmerga fighters have played a crucial role in the battle against IS in Iraq The Baghdad government will take the view that it is simply seeking to restore the status quo prior to the emergence of IS. To say things are complicated is an understatement. The Kurds themselves are divided. Other ethnic militias have their own interests to defend. And the US seems unable to halt the fighting as it watches US trained and armed Iraqi units confront Kurdish groups who are also Washington's allies. Kurdish leaders refuse government demands Peshmerga Kirkuk 'deadline' passes Iraqi Kurds send reinforcements to Kirkuk Iraq orders arrest of Kurdistan officials Iraqi Kurds decisively back independence Iraqi Kurdish referendum: What is at stake?

Here's your morning briefing: Thirty years to the day since the Great Storm of 1987,the UK is facing another major battle with the weather, as ex-Hurricane Ophelia brings winds of up to 80mph along the coast of Ireland. Schools in Northern Ireland have been shut as a precaution while the Irish Republic is sending members of its defence forces to its southern and western coasts. The UK's Met Office said there was a ""good chance"" Northern Ireland could be hit by power cuts, flying debris, large waves in coastal areas and disruption to all travel services. For the rest of the UK, Monday is set to be a ""day of huge contrasts"", said BBC Weather, with the strong gusts of wind travelling over the Irish Sea and heading north to central and southern Scotland. Eastern England though is instead expected to enjoy unusually warm weather, with predicted temperatures of 22C or 23C on Monday. The average mid-October temperature is more usually 15C.

Hundreds more were wounded when a lorry packed with explosives detonated near the entrance of a hotel. No group has said it was behind Saturday's attack, but the country's president has blamed Islamist extremist group al-Shabab group, which has been fighting an insurgency in Somalia since 2007. Police official Ibrahim Mohamed told the AFP news agency the death toll was likely to rise. ""There are more than 300 wounded, some of them seriously,"" he said. A new rule limiting sweets and chocolates sold in hospital shops and vending machines to 250 calories or fewer could see ""super-size"" bars banned, according toNHS England.

AirAsia jet turns back after mid-air scare,"The plane (not pictured) experienced problems about 25 minutes after take-off An AirAsia Indonesia flight has been forced to turn back to Australia after pilots were alerted to a possible loss of cabin pressure, airport officials say. Flight QZ535, bound for the Indonesian island of Bali, changed course about 25 minutes after take-off on Sunday. The Airbus A320, carrying 151 people, landed safely at Perth Airport. AirAsia said the flight experienced a ""technical issue"". Australian media said it had appeared to lose altitude. ""We were all pretty much saying goodbye to each other. It was really upsetting,"" one passenger told the localNine network,external. A video taken on the plane, broadcast by local media, shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling and one person shouting ""passengers get down, passengers get down"". Another passenger, Claire Askew, told theSeven network,externalthat ""panic was escalated"" by airline staff who were screaming and appeared to be in tears. In a statement, AirAsia said it was ""fully committed"" to the safety of passengers. It did not elaborate on the problem. ""AirAsia apologises to passengers for any inconvenience caused,"" the statement said. In June, an AirAsia X flight on its way to Bali was alsoforced to turn back to Perthafter an engine problem left it ""shaking like a washing machine"".

May heads to Brussels for Brexit talks,"Theresa May is in Brussels for a dinner later with EU leaders in a bid to end a stalemate over Brexit. The meeting, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, comes days after the pair said talks were in ""deadlock"". Brexit Secretary David Davis is joining Mrs May for the meeting, ahead of this week's summit of EU leaders. Mr Juncker said details of the dinner would be revealed in an ""autopsy"" afterwards. What would 'no deal' look like? EU 'to prepare for trade talks' Although Mrs May's trip to Brussels was not made public during last week's negotiations, Downing Street sources insisted it had ""been in the diary for weeks"". Over a dinner expected to last 90 minutes, the PM hopes to end a stalemate over the three initial topics for negotiation - the amount the UK owes the EU when it leaves, the future rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens living in the EU, and what happens on the Northern Ireland border. The EU side says that until ""sufficient progress"" is made on these three items they will not begin discussing the UK's post-Brexit relations - things like trade arrangements and defence. Labour says MPs can stop Brexit 'no deal' outcome What's happening with the Brexit repeal bill? BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the negotiations were entering a ""critical phase"", with the possibility of the UK leaving without a deal in place becoming the ""new front line"" in the debate about Brexit. The UK is doing contingency planning for such an outcome, which both sides say they want to avoid. Arriving at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was time to ""get on"" with the negotiations. ""It's ready for the great ship to go down the slipway and onto the open sea and for us to start some serious conversations about the future and the deep and special relationship we hope to construct,"" he added. This video can not be played Johnson: Time to get on with negotiations Conservative John Redwood predicted that ""at the 11th hour"" the EU would want to reach a free trade deal with the UK. ""But if we look as if we are weak, it's going to delay getting any sensible offer out of them,"" the former minister, who campaigned for Brexit, added. Mr Redwood said the UK would ""do just fine"" if no deal was reached and that he was ""fairly relaxed"" about the prospect of the EU imposing tariffs on UK goods, because the UK could trade ""perfectly successfully"" on World Trade Organisation terms. But pro-EU former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke said talks failing to reach an agreement would have a ""catastrophic"" effect on the UK economy. This video can not be played Michel Barnier: 'We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing' Together with Labour's Chris Leslie, Mr Clarke is trying to amend the government's key Brexit bill to put the two-year transition period proposed by Mrs May into law. He said this could ""bind in"" the ""ultra-right"" members of the cabinet and the ""ultra left"" members of the shadow cabinet and convince Brussels the PM had the UK Parliament's backing. Mrs May hopes when the 27 EU leaders meet on Thursday and Friday, they will give Mr Barnier a mandate to start talks on future trade. Ahead of the European Council meeting, the PM has discussed Brexit in phone calls with French President Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mr Barnier has said there is still no agreement on how much the UK should pay the EU when it leaves. Last week an internal draft document suggested the EU was going to begin preparing for the possibility of trade talks beginning in December - provided the UK does more to bridge the gap on the key negotiating points. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said there had been ""failures on both sides"" of the negotiating table so far, criticising the EU's ""rigid"" refusal to move the agenda forward. But he said Mrs May had more to lose than EU leaders who ""do not know whether to take her seriously"" given Tory divisions over Brexit strategy. He told BBC News: ""Her own authority is very much at stake, and what she's got to do at this dinner is impress on the Europeans A) She's there to stay and B) What she is promising can be delivered - I think she's talking to a sceptical audience.""
