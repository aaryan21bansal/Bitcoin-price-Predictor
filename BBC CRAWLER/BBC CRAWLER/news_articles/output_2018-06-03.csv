Video widely shared on Twitter shows the agent strutting his stuff and then performing a backflip. The gun falls to the floor and, as the agent goes to grab it, fires a shot. The fellow customer hit by the bullet was taken to hospital with a non-life-threatening injury. It is unclear if the agent, who has not been named, will face charges or disciplinary action.

When the agent retrieved his handgun an unintended discharge occurred"". The statement, which did not name the agent, added: ""The victim was transported to the hospital with a good prognosis."" Police are asking witnesses to come forward to help investigators,who are waiting on lab test results to determine ""if alcohol was a factor"",external.

Lost Voice Guy wins Britain's Got Talent,"The comedian wears a range of T-shirts highlighting his disability Lost Voice Guy has been crowned the winner of Britain's Got Talent, the first comedian ever to win the show. The 37-year-old, whose cerebral palsy affects his ability to speak, uses a voice synthesiser for his act. The comedian, whose real name is Lee Ridley, will receive Â£250,000 in prize money and the opportunity to perform at the Royal Variety Performance. Musical comedian Robert White - the bookies' favourite - came second, while singer Donchez Dacres came third. The final was watched by an average of 8.7 million viewers, according to overnight ratings - the highest figure for the show since 2015. After the result was announced, Ridley said via his synthesiser: ""I have been blown away by the support of the judges and the general public. ""I'm very excited to perform in front of the Queen. ""I've loved her since she sang Bohemian Rhapsody."" This video can not be played Britain's Got Talent final The comedian, who is from Consett, County Durham, was bruised and wearing a plaster on his nose following a fall after his semi-final performance. He quipped that he had been told to ""smash it"" in the final but his injury showed he had taken this advice too literally. Interviewed for the final, he said: ""When I am performing, it's as if I have finally found my voice - and it's a great feeling making people laugh."" His biggest laugh of the night came with the joke: ""I started off in a disabled Steps tribute band. We were called Ramps."" In his prize-winning performance he also joked that he had had a facelift - and it was ""almost as bad as Simon's [show founder Simon Cowell]."" But Cowell took the jibe in good humour, saying after the results that he was thrilled to see the comedian win. The D-Day Darlings sang a World War Two era song (picture from previous round) ""You so deserved this,"" he said. Fellow judge Alesha Dixon agreed, saying that Ridley would ""inspire so many people"". The 40 semi-finalists, initially chosen from auditions in front of the four judges, had been whittled down to the final 10 in a week of live shows leading up to the final. The 11 previous series had seen singers, dancers, acrobats, pianists and even talented dogs among their eventual winners, but a comedian has never before taken the top prize. Robert White, a comedian who has Asperger's syndrome, came second in the final with a routine which drew laughs from the crowd for its mocking of the judges. Allow YouTube content?

How proud is your area of being English?,"This video can not be played Being English 'is about fish and chips' Young people are far less likely to feel proud to be English than older generations, a major survey for the BBC reveals. Eight out of 10 people in England identify strongly as English but pride varies by age. YouGov surveyed 20,081 people and found 72% of over-65s are proud to be English, compared with 45% of 18-24s. Half of those surveyed think England was better in the past, with one in six believing its best days lie ahead. Humour, tradition and good manners are thecharacteristics most associated with being English. The poll was conducted for the BBC's The English Question project and is the largest and most comprehensive of its kind. Respondents were asked to complete a detailed online questionnaire on identity and belonging. The English question: What is the nation's identity? You need a modern browser to view the interactive content in this page. If the postcode search does not launchclick here,external. The results of the survey highlighted that: Parts ofLincolnshireand the Midlands identity particularly strongly as English, with more than nine out of 10 respondents saying they felt very strongly or fairly strongly English London, Oxford and Cambridge are at the opposite end, with between 32% and 45% of respondents saying they did not identify strongly as English English pride is felt by about two thirds of people in coastal and former industrial towns but less than half of people in major cities like Liverpool and Manchester In London boroughs such as Hackney and Lambeth, pride in being English is felt only 37% and 38% of people respectively The further from London someone lives, the more they identify with a particular part of England About half of the 20,081 people surveyed (49%) believe England's best years are over while one in six (17%) thought they were still to come. The survey does not reveal at which point England apparently passed its best, but the results suggest: Despite their pride in being English, the majority of over 65s (60%) believe England was better in the past Two thirds of over 65s (67%) said England is better than most other countries in the world Slightly more Remain voters (20%) than Leavers (15%) believe England's best years lie ahead Young people are the most optimistic, with 28% of 18 to 24-year-olds believing England's best years are still in the future 55% of people aged 50-64 and 60% of people aged 65 and over say England was better in the past John Denham, director of the Centre for English Identity and Politics at the University of Winchester, said ""pessimism"" was not unique to one group or area of England. The former Labour cabinet minister said he believed giving people a greater say over how they are governed would reduce the pessimism. The English question: What is the nation's identity? Revisiting London's iconic album cover images ""Older people do tend to think things were better in the past but what's striking is that there isn't a demographic where the optimists outweigh the pessimists,"" said Mr Denham. ""This pessimism is not as universal in Wales and Scotland, where more people think the future will be better than the past, and where devolution has asked people what sort of nation they wanted to be in the 21st Century. ""England outside London has never had that. People have a sense that no-one is talking about the people outside the capital. In the EU referendum, the Leave campaign's slogan 'take back control' cut through for that reason."" Nearly three quarters of over-65s  are proud to be English compared with fewer than half of those aged 18 to 24. Mr Denham said: ""Young people will tend to be less patriotic than older people wherever they are, whether that's England, Scotland or Wales. ""They will have a more cosmopolitan view of the world. And in the younger generation there are more people from black and minority ethnic groups who are more likely to identify as British than as English. ""It doesn't mean that Englishness and English pride is disappearing, but we are looking at a future where both Britishness and Englishness will mean a lot to a lot of people."" Being born in England makes someone English according to eight out of 10 people surveyed. Living in England for less than five years qualifies someone as English in the minds of just 14% of those who responded. For just over a third of people (38%) considering yourself English is enough and trumps even living in England for 10 or more years or even being able to speak English. A sense of humour, tradition, manners and fair play are characteristics most people surveyed associate with being English. Although more than half of respondents consider strongly that generosity and plain-speaking were part of the English identity, less than half think the English are a liberal, outward-looking people. And less than four in 10 consider Englishness to be defined by ""yob culture"". Only one in four consider the English to be a ""loud"" people. ""So-called yob culture is not such a dominant image of Englishness as some people think,"" said Mr Denham. ""If you see footage of English football fans smashing up a town square, you're going to think about yob culture at the time, but most people associate Englishness with much more positive values most of the time. ""The stiff upper lip comes from stories of heroism but it's also about a cultural respect for qualities that people aspire to - of getting on with things and not making a fuss.""

Cookham from Englefield wastaken from the Stanley Spencer Galleryin Cookham, Berkshire, in 2012. Police found it next to 3kg of cocaine and 15,000 ecstasy tablets at a flat in Kingston-upon-Thames, London, in 2017. The painting's owners had been ""devastated"" by its loss, officers previously said. Arts Minister Michael Ellis said: ""Spencer is one our most renowned painters and a true great of the 20th Century. ""It is wonderful that this story has had a happy ending and the painting has been returned to its rightful owners."" Sir Stanley Spencer pictured in his Cookham studio in 1932 Det Con Sophie Hayes, of the Metropolitan Police's art and antiques unit, said: ""The circumstances of its recovery underline the links between cultural heritage crime and wider criminality."" Sir Stanley, who died in 1959 - the same year he was knighted, often used Cookham, where he was born, as inspiration for his work during his 45-year career.

Sea rescue for seagull-chasing puppy,"Ferry staff formed a ""human chain"" to pull Bertie to safety A puppy has been rescued from the sea after getting into difficulty while chasing seagulls. Wightlink Ferries staff saved golden labrador, Bertie, after he was spotted half-a-mile out to sea near the end of Ryde Pier, off the Isle of Wight, at about 07:00 BST. Owner Rob Gale, from Ryde, had been out cockling when his nine-month-old dog fled. He said ferry staff formed a ""human chain"" to pull Bertie back to the pier. Wightlink Ferries staff members Scott Harvey, Mike Parsons (pictured) and Dave Prangnell helped save the golden labrador Mr Gale, who Wightlink staff tracked down via social media, added: ""He was chasing seagulls and ran into the water. ""I was whistling for him but under the pier sounds echo around. He couldn't work out where I was and just kept on swimming.""

NI police station sales halted over Brexit,"Castlederg PSNI station identified for disposal since 2016 The PSNI has confirmed it has halted the sale of three border police stations as a ""precautionary step"" over Brexit. The stations are Castlederg and Aughnacloy in County Tyrone and Warrenpoint in County Down. All three had been""previously identified for disposal"". Brexit has returned the Irish border to the centre of Anglo-Irish politics and it is still unclear what it will look like when the UK leaves the EU. Brexit: UK 'has two weeks' to submit border plans Police ask for up to 400 more officers ahead of Brexit BBC News NI previously reported thatthe sale of Warrenpoint station had been halted, and that it was believed Aughnacloy and Castlederg stations were also to be taken off the market. This has now been confirmed by the PSNI. ""In light of the UK referendum vote to leave the EU, we are reviewing decisions we previously made about some of our stations identified for disposal,"" Assistant Chief Constable Stephen Martin said. Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to buy the former Warrenpoint station ""Accordingly, it is our intention to pause the disposal of three stations in border areas, namely Warrenpoint, Castlederg and Aughnacloy. ""As the PSNI has not yet received details regarding potential border arrangements, this is a precautionary step to ensure that, whatever Brexit looks like in the future, we will be able to continue to keep our communities safe."" Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to buythe former station in Warrenpoint, which went on the market in 2016. The plan was to convert it into a community centre. The UK and EU have both said they do not wish to see a hard border after Brexit, but they have not been able to agree on how to avoid checks on goods once the UK has left the customs union and single market. If there is no Brexit deal it is likely customs officials will have to carry out the checks and it will be the job of the police to protect them. The Chief Constable of the PSNI is to ask the government to fund the recruitment of up to 400 additional officers for operations along the border after Brexit.

Climbers injured after 50m fall,"The two men fell while taking part in a climbing meet-up at Fair Head in County Antrim Two climbers have been seriously injured after falling at Fair Head, near Ballycastle, in County Antrim on Sunday. The two men were winched from Hell's Kitchen by an Irish coastguard helicopter and flown to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. On Monday morning, the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said the two men remained in a stable condition. According to the Coastguard, both climbers fell up to 50m. Irish Coastguard helicopter R118 hovering while rescuing two climbers at Fair Head Coastguard teams used rope rescue techniques to stretcher the casualties off the cliff face. It is understood they were both on the same rope when the accident happened but that the rope stopped them hitting the ground. This video can not be played The Coastguard helicopter filmed winching the men to safety They are believed to have suffered broken bones, friction burns and chest injuries. Ryan Gray, from Belfast Coastguard, said the two men were among more than 100 climbers taking part in an event at Fair Head. He said they received multiple 999 calls about the climbers after they fell. Coastguard rescue teams from Coleraine and Ballycastle were tasked to the scene while the Irish Coastguard rescue helicopter was also sent from Sligo. ""It was a routine response for that type of terrain,"" Mr Gray told BBC's Good Morning Ulster. The two men are believed to have suffered broken bones, friction burns and chest injuries ""It takes a lot people and skills just to get down to where the climbers actually were. It's a sheer cliff face that goes into quite a large boulder field. So it was tricky enough."" He said the weather conditions and lack of wind were challenging for the pilot of the rescue helicopter, who had to keep it hovering close to the cliff face, but that it was a successful operation.

Crayfish removes claw to escape hotpot,"China is one of the world's largest sources of crayfish (stock image) A crayfish desperate to remove itself from the menu sacrificed one of its own claws to escape a boiling pot of spicy soup at a restaurant in China. In footage viewed more than a million times online, the crustacean is seen gripping one of its claws before successfully detaching it and fleeing. The dramatic film was captured by social media user Jiuke, who posted it on the popular Chinese platform Weibo. Jiuke later told users of the site that he had adopted the crayfish as a pet.

China has found itself in the grip - or should that be the claws - of a crayfish food craze in recent years that has seen a boom in crayfish restaurants and farms.

Foster: Nationalists will vote for DUP,"Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has said some nationalists will now vote for her party followingIreland's overwhelming vote in favour of abortion law reform. The DUP opposes changes to abortion law in Northern Ireland, while nationalist Sinn FÃ©in is in favour of reform. Mrs Foster said some Sinn FÃ©in voters backed her party's stance. But Sinn FÃ©in's former finance minister said he doubted nationalists would vote for the DUP. Following the Republic of Ireland's referendum to liberalise abortion law, Northern Ireland will soon be the only part of either the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Seismic shift for Ireland Timeline: Ireland and abortion What's next for Northern Ireland? Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O'Neill are in favour of change to abortion laws in Northern Ireland, and attended the official abortion referendum result announcement at Dublin Castle last Saturday. They held up a sign on stage, saying: ""The north is next."" Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald are campaigning for change South Belfast MLA MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir told the BBC he did not see a scenario where nationalists or republicans would switch to voting DUP based on the issue of abortion. ""It is highly unlikely that any republican is going to vote for a party which is so vehemently against civil rights and human rights as the DUP and I think that is true for nationalism as well. ""Everybody is entitled to vote as they wish, but after that it's not really about the constitutional issue. ""There are many nationalists, republicans, unionists and loyalists here and in my view they will have their own opinions around termination, around abortion, around trusting women and at the end of the day on the constitutional issue they will remain true to their beliefs."" Earlier his party colleague Linda Dillon told the BBC's Sunday News show: ""Not everybody agrees with the position, and I understand that, but most of the people I've spoken to agree with most of Sinn Fein's policies and will continue to vote."" The party supports abortion in the cases of rape, incest, sexual abuse and fatal foetal abnormality. In an interview with Sky News, Mrs Foster said many anti-abortion voters in the Republic of Ireland were in shock. ""I have had emails from nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland, not quite believing what is going on and saying they will be voting for the DUP because they believe we're the only party that supports the unborn,"" she said. This video can not be played Mairtin O Muilleoir says it is 'highly unlikely' that republicans will vote DUP ""There are many people who are shocked in the Republic of Ireland. Whilst I completely acknowledge the result that happened last Saturday, that doesn't take away from the fact that there's a substantial minority of people in the Republic of Ireland who feel very disenfranchised, who feel very alone, who don't feel that anyone speaks for them any more."" Labour MP Stella Creasy also said that the result of the referendum reflects the importance of listening to communities. The politician, who has called for MPs to repeal the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which makes abortion illegal, said Mrs Foster is ""the only woman with any choice over abortion in Northern Ireland"". She is hoping to use amendments tabled to a forthcoming domestic violence bill to force a vote on the issue at Westminster. Following Mrs Foster's comments, the DUP's North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said that he had received a letter from a priest in his constituency. Allow Twitter content?

Javid pledges 'fresh look' at migration,"This video can not be played Sajid Javid discussing the net migration target earlier this month Key parts of the UK's immigration policy - including on foreign students and doctors coming to the UK - will be reviewed, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid told the BBC there was a ""perception problem"" over the decision to include students in net migration figures. And he said he would ""think more carefully"" about the cap on the number of skilled workers given visas. Mr Javid became home secretary in April after Amber Rudd quit. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, he also said he would be lobbying Chancellor Philip Hammond for more cash for policing, andconfirmed an increase in security officersto boost counter-terrorism efforts. 1,600 skilled workers denied UK visas Davidson 'angry' at Windrush scandal Who is Sajid Javid? 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system However, Mr Javid said that addressing the issue of the Windrush scandal, which led to Ms Rudd's resignation, would be his top priority. He told the Marr show that changes had already been made to the ""hostile environment"" approach to illegal immigration, which critics say was responsible for the problems. These changes included rethinking restrictions on illegal migrants' rights to open bank accounts, he said. Mr Javid also said seven members of the Windrush generation who were wrongly deported had been contacted so far, with efforts under way to reach a further 24. On the wider approach to immigration, Prime Minister Theresa May has faced repeated calls to exclude foreign students from the government's drive to reduce net migration into the UK, including from Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson. Mr Javid said he understood criticism of the policy, and that he did ""empathise"" with the view that it did not sound very welcoming. He said that although if students eventually left the country it should have no long-term impact, ""there is a perception problem around this,"" adding: ""It's something I've long considered."" It is ""something I would like to look at again"", he said. The home secretary was also asked about the cap on so-called Tier 2 visas,introduced by Mrs Maywhen she was home secretary as a means of limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the European Union who had a job offer. The annual 20,700 cap has led to thousands of IT specialists and engineers as well as NHS staff being denied visas. ""I see the problem with that,"" Mr Javid said. ""It is something that I'm taking a fresh look at. I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this, and that's exactly what I'm doing. ""And I hope to think about this more carefully and see what can be done."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: ""The home secretary will have the support of almost everyone in Parliament to exclude students and medical staff from the immigration cap, but it's far from clear that the prime minister is willing to admit her long-cherished policy is wrong."" Mr Javid also refused to explicitly endorse another immigration policy, the promise to reduce net migration below 100,000, saying he was committed to the Conservative manifesto which contained the pledge. And he reiterated calls for more funding for frontline police officers. The government had not yet started its spending review for the police, he said, adding: ""But when we do, I'm sure the chancellor will learn of my views."" Labour responded by saying Mr Javid had ""let slip that there is still no new money for our over-stretched police forces"".

Police shoot man in Berlin Cathedral,"A German police officer has shot a knife-wielding Austrian man who went on the rampage in Berlin Cathedral on Sunday afternoon. The 53-year-old man was shot in the leg, Berlin police said. A police officer was also injured in the incident and taken to hospital. Police said there was no indication of any terrorist motive. About 100 people were in the building at the time of the incident, around 16:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Police said they had been alerted by an emergency call from an employee at the cathedral. A police statement urged people to ""avoid speculation"" and said more details of the incident would follow. Witnesses quoted in German media said the man appeared to be in a ""confused"" state. Video from eyewitnesses showed police crews with submachine guns being set up outside the cathedral, with police tape placed around the building. Psychological counselling was offered to those who witnessed the events. The elaborate 19th Century church is located in the centre of Berlin on the historic Museum Island and is one of the city's top tourist attractions. Allow Twitter content?

Trump 'could pardon himself but won't',"Rudy Giuliani said if Mr Trump pardoned himself it would be ""politically tough"" Donald Trump probably has the power to pardon himself in the Russia collusion affair but does not intend to do so, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani says. A special counsel is investigating Russia's role in the 2016 election, and whether Mr Trump obstructed justice. The question of self-pardon arose after the New York Times published a letter to the counsel from Mr Trump's lawyers. In it they say he has absolute power as US legal chief to end investigations, or ""even exercise his power to pardon"". Such absolute powers, they argue, mean that he could not have obstructed justice in any case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

How easy is it for Donald Trump to be impeached? He appeared on ABC's This Week programme and was asked whether Mr Trump had the power to pardon himself. Mr Giuliani, the head of Mr Trump's legal team, said he ""probably does"", but added: ""He has no intention of pardoning himself."" He went on: ""I think the political ramifications of that would be tough. Pardoning other people is one thing. Pardoning yourself is another."" Speaking on CNN on Sunday, House Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that no president should pardon himself. It all stems from the investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump team and Russian officials in the election campaign that brought the president to power. Donald Trump has constantly railed against the investigation in Twitter outbursts Mr Trump has always maintained there was no collusion and that the investigation is a ""witch hunt"". Part of Mr Mueller's investigation is looking at whether Mr Trump sought to criminally obstruct it, in particular with the sacking of ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, and with his reaction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the investigation. Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? No-one really knows. There is no precedent for a president trying. In the case of former President Richard Nixon, the Justice Department said he could not pardon himself, but others argue it is not precluded in the US Constitution. This latter theory was something touched on in the newly leaked letter. It is dated 29 January and was sent to Mr Mueller by John Dowd, one of Mr Trump's lawyers who has since left the team. The New York Times obtained the letter and published it in full.,external It appears to be an attempt to show the president as untouchable. Its main points are that, because the president is the nation's chief legal officer, he: Cannot be subpoenaed Cannot be indicted Cannot be guilty of obstruction of justice because, given his absolute powers, that would effectively mean obstructing himself Citing the powers given to him by the Constitution, it says the president can ""terminate the inquiry, or even exercise his power to pardon"". Mr Giuliani said himself last week that the special counsel's investigation may be ""entirely illegitimate"". The leaking of the letter certainly displeased Mr Trump: Allow Twitter content?

He has requested an interview with the president over obstruction of justice. Mr Trump has previously said he might be willing to attend but his lawyers appear opposed, fearing it could lead to charges of perjury. Mr Giuliani told ABC: ""It's beginning to get resolved in favour of not doing it."" If the president does not attend, Mr Mueller could try a grand jury subpoena but, as the letter above shows, the Trump team would try to block it. The whole thing could end in a court battle over what can and what cannot be applied to a president. In any case, any attempt to impeach the president over the Russia affair would not be affected. That's a political process and pardons would not prevent it. Mr Mueller has indicted 19 people as part of his investigation so far, including four members of the Trump campaign team or administration. Thirteen Russians have also been charged over their links to the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian ""troll factory"" accused of spreading fake news stories through US social media. In April,Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan became the first person to be jailedas part of the FBI investigation. He was sentenced to 30 days in prison and fined $20,000 under a plea deal, after being convicted of lying to investigators about his contacts with ex-campaign aide Rick Gates, who was one of the people charged. According to an analysis of public records by CNN, at least 12 Trump associates had contacts with Russians during the campaign or transition, including the president's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and his son Donald Trump Jr. Mr Trump's supporters maintain that contacts with foreign nationals are a normal part of a presidential race, but two Trump aides have previously admitted to lying about the encounters.

"Javid pledges 'fresh look' at migrationRules on skilled workers and foreign students will be looked at again, the home secretary says.22m23 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Sajid Javid discussing the net migration target earlier this month Key parts of the UK's immigration policy - including on foreign students and doctors coming to the UK - will be reviewed, the home secretary has said. Sajid Javid told the BBC there was a ""perception problem"" over the decision to include students in net migration figures. And he said he would ""think more carefully"" about the cap on the number of skilled workers given visas. Mr Javid became home secretary in April after Amber Rudd quit. Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, he also said he would be lobbying Chancellor Philip Hammond for more cash for policing, andconfirmed an increase in security officersto boost counter-terrorism efforts. 1,600 skilled workers denied UK visas Davidson 'angry' at Windrush scandal Who is Sajid Javid? 10 charts explaining the UK's immigration system However, Mr Javid said that addressing the issue of the Windrush scandal, which led to Ms Rudd's resignation, would be his top priority. He told the Marr show that changes had already been made to the ""hostile environment"" approach to illegal immigration, which critics say was responsible for the problems. These changes included rethinking restrictions on illegal migrants' rights to open bank accounts, he said. Mr Javid also said seven members of the Windrush generation who were wrongly deported had been contacted so far, with efforts under way to reach a further 24. On the wider approach to immigration, Prime Minister Theresa May has faced repeated calls to exclude foreign students from the government's drive to reduce net migration into the UK, including from Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson. Mr Javid said he understood criticism of the policy, and that he did ""empathise"" with the view that it did not sound very welcoming. He said that although if students eventually left the country it should have no long-term impact, ""there is a perception problem around this,"" adding: ""It's something I've long considered."" It is ""something I would like to look at again"", he said. The home secretary was also asked about the cap on so-called Tier 2 visas,introduced by Mrs Maywhen she was home secretary as a means of limiting the number of skilled workers from outside the European Union who had a job offer. The annual 20,700 cap has led to thousands of IT specialists and engineers as well as NHS staff being denied visas. ""I see the problem with that,"" Mr Javid said. ""It is something that I'm taking a fresh look at. I know a number of my colleagues certainly want me to take a look at this, and that's exactly what I'm doing. ""And I hope to think about this more carefully and see what can be done."" Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Sir Ed Davey said: ""The home secretary will have the support of almost everyone in Parliament to exclude students and medical staff from the immigration cap, but it's far from clear that the prime minister is willing to admit her long-cherished policy is wrong."" Mr Javid also refused to explicitly endorse another immigration policy, the promise to reduce net migration below 100,000, saying he was committed to the Conservative manifesto which contained the pledge. And he reiterated calls for more funding for frontline police officers. The government had not yet started its spending review for the police, he said, adding: ""But when we do, I'm sure the chancellor will learn of my views."" Labour responded by saying Mr Javid had ""let slip that there is still no new money for our over-stretched police forces"".

Pope gives indulgence to Irish pilgrimsPope Francis' visit to Ireland in August will be the first papal visit to the country for 40 years.,"Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to visit Ireland since 1979 Participants attending the World Meeting of Families in August can be forgiven their sins or help a relative speed through purgatory. Pope Francis has granted a ""plenary indulgence"" for those taking part. In Catholic doctrine an indulgence frees you from being punished for your previously committed sins or it can be passed on to dead relatives to shorten their time in purgatory. Even those following events on TV and radio can achieve a partial indulgence as long as they recite the Our Father, the Creed and other devout prayers. Martin Luther's opposition to the sale of indulgences was one of the main causes of theProtestant Reformation in the 16th Century. The Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, the Vatican body dealing with forgiveness of sins, said pilgrims would have to attend confession and Mass, pray for the Pope's intentions and participate in some function during the five-day event. The use of indulgences in Catholicism is a tradition that goes back to the Crusades in the 11th Century. Millions of people came to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Ireland in 1979 Michael Kelly, Editor of the Irish Catholic says that very few Catholics today would take indulgences seriously. ""It's something that was over emphasised in the past and is now under emphasised. Most people would file it in the same theological drawer as things like exorcism. ""Popes tend to grant indulgences as a way of publicising an event - saying to the faithful that this an important gathering to come along to."" World Youth Day is a series of events celebrating the Catholic faith He admits that a small number of the very pious would take it to heart and do their best to collect indulgences. And while the theology is clear it has little impact on the lives of most parishioners. ""Most people don't realise that even though they confess their sins and receive forgiveness, it does not absolve the temporal punishment for those sins!"" he said. And if you can't make it to the World Meeting of Families don't worry there are other ways to collect an indulgence. All require the faithful to have had Confession, Communion and to have prayed for the intentions of the Pope. Climb Croagh Patrick: Valid once in June, July and August if you climb Ireland's holy mountain and pray in the chapel at the top Lough Derg pilgrimage: Pope Pius IX granted a perpetual indulgence in 1870 for pilgrims completing the fasting and vigil November and the dead: Various indulgences available for those who pray for the dead on set dates in November Special Papal Events: In recent years this has included World Youth Day and the 2012-13 Year of Faith First Communion: Both those receiving and those assisting can collect an indulgence Listening to the Pope's Urbi et Orbi address at Easter or Christmas Robert Mickens, editor at La Croix International says indulgences are often issued for papal visits to countries; holy years and jubilees. ""They can also be granted for visits to certain churches, shrines, basilicas and cathedrals and are granted, with the pope's approval, through the Apostolic Penitentiary, one of the Vatican's three tribunals."" But like anything that sounds too good to be true, remember to read the small print. You may have ticked all the boxes above, prayed with the Pope, gone to confession etc but there is one more step. According to the Enchiridion (handbook) of Indulgences none of the other steps matter unless you are ""free from all attachment to sin"" - a tall order even for saints.

London Bridge victims honoured at service,"The Bishop of Southwark joined members of the public at London Bridge A minute's silence has been honoured and a church service held in memory of those murdered in the London Bridge terror attack, exactly a year ago. Eight died and 48 were injured by three men who drove into pedestrians, then stabbed people in Borough Market. Their loved ones lit candles at the Southwark Cathedral service, which was attended by the prime minister and members of the emergency services. An olive tree was planted using compost from floral tributes. At the cathedral, Dean of Southwark, the Very Reverend Andrew Nunn, read the names of those killed in the attack. He praised the ""dedication"" of the emergency services and prayed for their ""continued safety and protection"". Bustling Borough Market remembers attack Victims of the London Bridge attack London attack: What happened London Bridge: How people fought back ""Love is stronger than hate, light is stronger than darkness, and life is stronger than death,"" he said. The dean said the olive tree, which was planted in the cathedral grounds, would be a reminder of the importance of communities coming together to stand against violence. Theo Ancient, an actor and local resident who survived the attack, told the congregation: ""At ten in the evening, darkness falls in the worst possible way. ""In a few minutes, everything changes, though it will be hours before we'll know the true cost."" It was a day of high emotion at London Bridge Adele Morris, a local councillor, said: ""The terrorists wished nothing but death on this place. Instead, they made us think and talk in ways that are very much alive."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan gave a reading from Psalm 77 at the service, which was also attended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. A procession then made its way to Southwark Needle, at the southern end of London Bridge, where relatives laid flowers and the minute's silence was held. Peter John OBE, leader of Southwark Council, told the assembled: ""Last June we experienced one of the darkest days in our borough's history. ""Today we come together to demonstrate that we are strong and united in the face of evil."" People of different religious and ethnic backgrounds gathered on London Bridge and urged the public not to be divided Later, the words #LondonUnited will be projected onto the bridge and a digital book of hope will be available at Southwark Cathedral throughout the weekend for the public to sign. Mustafa Field, director of the Faiths Forum For London, said: ""We were all shocked by the horrific attack. ""It is important we come together as a community and combat hatred and bigotry through love."" Before the commemoration, Prime Minister Theresa May decried the attack as a ""cowardly attempt to strike at the heart of our freedoms"". She added: ""Our resolve to stand firm and overcome this threat together has never been stronger."" Alex Regan, BBC News Holding a bouquet of lilies, Lucy Fisher watches as hundreds of people enter Southwark Cathedral, metres away from where her cousin's life was taken. James McMullan, 32, was one of the eight people who died on 3 June. ""It was a terrible time,"" she says. Nearby, Borough Market - usually heaving with tourists - is quiet. ""It's my favourite market and I'm used to the hustle and bustle of it,"" says Robyn Hayes, while watching people going into the service. ""It's very eerie hearing the quiet, with the church bells on top of that."" As the 700 guests walk from Southwark Cathedral to the other side of London Bridge, the crowds fall still. When the minute's silence is observed, the only noise is the sound of trains arriving and departing from the station. After families of the victims lay flowers at Southwark Needle, the crowd dissipates and observers return to their everyday lives. Earlier on Sunday, Home Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed the security services were to get 2,000 extra officers as part of a strategy to boost the UK's counter-terrorism efforts. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid vowed to make sure the UK had all the resources needed ""to fight the terror threat"". He said the threat was ""top of my mind"" and ""something I think of every day"". Prime Minister Theresa May was greeted by the Dean of Southwark Andrew Nunn at the service In addition to boosting security services officers, which was first proposed in 2015, Mr Javid said there would be changes to how intelligence was used. ""MI5 will be sharing much more of its information with other organisations,"" he said. ""Not just counter terrorism, but neighbourhood policing and local government. ""This would make sure there is a much higher chance of finding extremists and disrupting plots a lot earlier on.""

Disposable coffee cup bans 'unnecessary',"Plastic-lined paper cups can only be recycled at five facilities across the UK Governments need to make it easier to recycle disposable coffee cups, a manufacturer has said. The Scottish governmenthas banned single-use cupsin its main buildings and the Welsh Government said it would follow suit by 2021. But Caerphilly-based manufacturer Paul Synott said bans were ""unnecessary"" and all UK-produced paper cups could be recycled with better infrastructure. Environmentalists want the focus to be on reusing cups instead of recycling. Mr Synott, managing director of Seda in Blackwood and spokesman for the Paper Cup Alliance (PCA), said despite public perception, ""all paper cups produced in the UK can be recycled"". ""It's a question of infrastructure - collecting cups and taking them to where they can be recycled."" More than 99.75% of disposable used cups in the UKdo not get recycled. Paper cups, which have a plastic lining to prevent liquid from soaking through, can only be recycled at five recycling facilities in the UK, based in Cumbria, Halifax, Leeds, Cornwall and Kent. The PCA, which represents manufacturers, wants governments and councils to increase the number of bins to recycle paper cups and mechanisms to transport them to the processing facilities. Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Boston Tea Party 'first' to ban disposable cups Costa vows 'cup recycling revolution' Mr Synott said Seda and Wales' other disposable cup manufacturer - Benders in Wrexham - employed more than 500 people directly and 250-300 people indirectly. ""Taxing paper cups or putting in incentives to reduce their consumption could cost jobs,"" he added. He added paper cups were the best product in terms of food hygiene and convenience. Grenville Ham, leader of the Wales Green Party, said: ""The fundamental problem is that they are difficult to recycle. ""What we need to do is move away from from disposability into reusability."" The Welsh Government was unable to confirm if plastic-lined coffee cups were used in its offices but said plastic straws, stirrers and cutlery were not used in canteens. It said charging staff 25p per disposable bio-degradable coffee cup led to 75% of hot drinks in its canteens being sold in reusable cups. A spokesman for the Welsh assembly said it scrapped plastic-lined paper coffee cups five years ago and staff and visitors were served hot drinks in ceramic cups. The assembly is working to replace plastic drinking straws and single-use plastic water cups with compostable or recyclable alternatives by September, he added. The Hay Festival is trialling a reusable coffee cup system The National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, said it had moved to compostable cups while public bodies, including Natural Resources Wales, the Equality and Human Rights Commission, National Museums Wales, Estyn, Public Services Ombudsman for Wales and Children's Commissioner for Wales said staff and visitors used china mugs. Sport Wales said it planned to offer a loyalty reward scheme to encourage staff and customers to bring reusable mugs. Single-use plastic cups, straws and stirrers are banned on site at Hay Festival and it is trialling a system where reusable coffee cups are provided and can be dropped off in allocated bins to be washed and re-used.

Foster: Nationalists will vote for DUPBut Sinn Fein says its policy on abortion will not lead to supporters switching parties.6m7 minutes agoNorthern Ireland,"Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has said some nationalists will now vote for her party followingIreland's overwhelming vote in favour of abortion law reform. The DUP opposes changes to abortion law in Northern Ireland, while nationalist Sinn FÃ©in is in favour of reform. Mrs Foster said some Sinn FÃ©in voters backed her party's stance. But Sinn FÃ©in's former finance minister said he doubted nationalists would vote for the DUP. Following the Republic of Ireland's referendum to liberalise abortion law, Northern Ireland will soon be the only part of either the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Seismic shift for Ireland Timeline: Ireland and abortion What's next for Northern Ireland? Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald and deputy leader Michelle O'Neill are in favour of change to abortion laws in Northern Ireland, and attended the official abortion referendum result announcement at Dublin Castle last Saturday. They held up a sign on stage, saying: ""The north is next."" Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill and Mary Lou McDonald are campaigning for change South Belfast MLA MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir told the BBC he did not see a scenario where nationalists or republicans would switch to voting DUP based on the issue of abortion. ""It is highly unlikely that any republican is going to vote for a party which is so vehemently against civil rights and human rights as the DUP and I think that is true for nationalism as well. ""Everybody is entitled to vote as they wish, but after that it's not really about the constitutional issue. ""There are many nationalists, republicans, unionists and loyalists here and in my view they will have their own opinions around termination, around abortion, around trusting women and at the end of the day on the constitutional issue they will remain true to their beliefs."" Earlier his party colleague Linda Dillon told the BBC's Sunday News show: ""Not everybody agrees with the position, and I understand that, but most of the people I've spoken to agree with most of Sinn Fein's policies and will continue to vote."" The party supports abortion in the cases of rape, incest, sexual abuse and fatal foetal abnormality. In an interview with Sky News, Mrs Foster said many anti-abortion voters in the Republic of Ireland were in shock. ""I have had emails from nationalists and republicans in Northern Ireland, not quite believing what is going on and saying they will be voting for the DUP because they believe we're the only party that supports the unborn,"" she said. This video can not be played Mairtin O Muilleoir says it is 'highly unlikely' that republicans will vote DUP ""There are many people who are shocked in the Republic of Ireland. Whilst I completely acknowledge the result that happened last Saturday, that doesn't take away from the fact that there's a substantial minority of people in the Republic of Ireland who feel very disenfranchised, who feel very alone, who don't feel that anyone speaks for them any more."" Labour MP Stella Creasy also said that the result of the referendum reflects the importance of listening to communities. The politician, who has called for MPs to repeal the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, which makes abortion illegal, said Mrs Foster is ""the only woman with any choice over abortion in Northern Ireland"". She is hoping to use amendments tabled to a forthcoming domestic violence bill to force a vote on the issue at Westminster. Following Mrs Foster's comments, the DUP's North Antrim MP Ian Paisley said that he had received a letter from a priest in his constituency. Allow Twitter content?

What is chemotherapy?,"Chemotherapy is drug treatment which is used to try and kill cancer cells or stop them from spreading. It isnot the same treatment for every cancer,external- different cancer cells respond to different drugs. Sometimes as many as eight different drugs are used in combination to get the best effect, and doctors are constantly trying out new combinations to improve treatment. Chemotherapy is often associated with debilitating side effects, but many types of modern chemotherapy cause only mild problems. Fewer women will need chemotherapy Breast cancer screening 'more harm than good' Warning over late effects of chemo on young Because chemotherapy drugs are usually injected into the blood, they travel around the body and can attack cancer cells regardless of where they find them. For this reason, doctors will use them when they think there might be cancer cells in more than one part of the body. If some cancers have been growing for a while undetected, bits of them can break away from the main tumour and travel to either nearby tissue or to more distant organs such as the liver and lungs and start growing there. A surgeon can only cut out a main cancer tumour and nearby tissues which may be involved. Radiotherapy, which uses radiation to destroy cancer cells, can only be given to small areas of the body or it will cause damage to too many healthy cells. Often, after an operation to remove cancer, chemotherapy will be given to ""mop up"" any remaining cells. Some cancers, such as leukaemia, need chemotherapy because they involve cells which are found throughout the body. Chemotherapy can be given to shrink a tumour to make it easier for the surgeon to remove. It can also ease the symptoms of patients whose cancer is not curable. Chemotherapy, in its traditional sense, is a chemical which is poisonous to cancer cells and kills them. This is called a cytotoxic chemical - one very early chemotherapy was produced from mustard gas, which was used as chemical weaponry during World War One. However anything which is poisonous to cancer cells may also be poisonous to the body's healthy cells, which it needs to survive. The trick with chemotherapy is to find a chemical which kills as many cancer cells as possible, and as few healthy cells. Doctors have been getting increasingly successful at developing such chemicals by spotting and exploiting the differences between the cancer cells and neighbouring normal cells. The principle difference between many cancer cells and normal cells is the speed at which they reproduce, or divide. Cancers tend to be dividing and growing faster than other cells in the body - which is why lumps or tumours sometimes appear. Other cancer cells may become more or less active in response to natural chemicals called hormones produced by the body. Some chemotherapy harnesses this reaction to control the growth of the cancer cells. Cancer cells are not attacked by the body's own immune defence system because the immune system does not recognise them as foreign. Some chemotherapies try to programme the immune system to see the cancer cells as foreign so they can be attacked and destroyed. Normally chemotherapy is delivered by injection into a blood vein. In many cases, a saline drip will be set up to dilute the drug as it enters the body. This stops it harming the vein because it is so concentrated. If the patient needs frequent doses of different drugs, to avoid the discomfort of having to have separate injections every time, a tube is kept in the vein which attaches to the syringe. This is called a Hickman line when placed into a vein in the chest. Sometimes, a concentrated dose of chemotherapy is needed in a particular part of the body, and side effects can be lessened by injecting it directly into the cancerous area. For example, for some bladder cancers, the drug can be pumped into the bladder so it works directly on the tissue involved. How long chemotherapy courses last varies between different cancer types, with some being given intensively over a fortnight, normally in hospital, and some over a period of months. Because some chemotherapy targets fast-growing or fast-dividing cells, it is more likely to harm similar cells in the body. These include the cells in the hair follicles, which is why cancer treatment is often associated with hair loss, although hair does re-grow once treatment has ended. Other fast-dividing cells can be found in the stomach and bowel lining, which leads to nausea and diarrhoea. There are, however, drugs which help to control this, and timing meals to avoid having a full stomach when the drugs take effect can also help in some cases. Other types of normal cell that can suffer are the blood cells. Red cells are important to carry oxygen to keep other cells alive. Other blood cells help to stave off infection. As a result, chemotherapy patients may be more prone to infections and find them harder to fight off. Hospitals will take regular blood tests to monitor the levels of different cells. This is called a full blood count. Generally, patients on chemotherapy can expected to have less energy than usual, or even feel extreme fatigue. Chemotherapy can also affect the fertility of both men and women, and both can now freeze their sperm and eggs with the hope of using them to produce a test-tube baby.

Warning over late effects of chemo on young,"Cancer doctors are calling on GPs to look out for the long-term side effects of chemotherapy in teenagers and young adults. In an article in the British Medical Journal,external, they warn that young cancer survivors can experience side effects for many decades after treatment. These can include infertility problems, heart failure and depression. There are more than 2,000 new cases of cancer a year in the UK in 15- to 24-year-olds. In the UK, cancer cases among 15- to 24-year-olds have risen by 19% since the mid-1990s. The authors of the article, all linked to Cambridge University, looked at previous studies and trials to describe the wide range of effects of chemotherapy drugs which may only come to light in later life. These effects were different from those seen in younger children and adults who had undergone chemotherapy treatment, they said, although they did not know why. The late effects of chemotherapy can include: memory loss fatigue stress, anxiety and depression deafness coronary artery disease hypertension infertility osteoporosis Dr Saif Ahmad, academic special registrar in clinical oncology at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, said it was important for GPs to give young people advice to stop the late effects from occurring. He said they should try to talk about potential side-effects at an early stage and tackle some head on, such as the possibility of loss of fertility for example. This could mean discussing ways of preserving fertility, referring the young person to a clinic and - for female patients - talking about new ways of freezing ovarian tissue before treatment. ""If you're a teenager or young adult who has had cancer treatment, you have 20% less chance of becoming pregnant compared to others who haven't had chemotherapy - and some patients will become infertile,"" Dr Ahmad said. And it was essential to pick up on signs of heart problems. ""If heart failure can be picked up early and the right drugs used, then side-effects can be reversed,"" he said. The article said GPs should actively ask about psychosocial issues such as coping with work and the fear of the disease returning. GPs should also find support groups to help young people talk about issues  worrying them. Communicating about the after-effects of cancer was a two-way process, Dr Ahmad said. ""If you don't talk about these issues, then they won't talk to you about them,"" he said.

Thousands 'can avoid breast cancer chemo',"The findings only apply to women specific early stage breast cancers About 70% of women with the most common form of early stage breast cancer can be spared the ""agony of chemotherapy"", researchers say. It follows trials of a genetic test that analyses the danger of a tumour. Cancer doctors said the findings would change practice in UK clinics on Monday, and meant women in this group could be treated safely with just surgery and hormone therapy. Charities said the news, affecting 3,000 UK women a year, was ""wonderful"". Chemotherapy is often used after surgery to reduce the chance of breast cancer spreading or coming back. What is chemotherapy? Warning over late effects of chemo on young Breast screening 'more harmful than good' BBC presenter's first chemo cycle It saves lives, but side-effects of the toxic drugs range from vomiting, fatigue and infertility to permanent nerve pain. In rare cases it can lead to heart failure and leukaemia. This trial of 10,273 women analysed cancers using a genetic test that is already widely available, including on the NHS. Currently, women who get a low score on the test are told they do not need chemo, those with a high score are told they definitely do. But most women get an intermediate result meaning they are unclear as to what to do. Data presented at the world's biggest meeting of cancer doctors and scientists in Chicago shows these women have the same survival rates with or without chemo. The nine-year-survival-rate was 93.9% without chemotherapy and 93.8% with chemotherapy. The study, led by the Albert Einstein Cancer Center in New York, is a rare cancer breakthrough as it can save money and instantly change practice. Dr Alistair Ring, a consultant at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, told the BBC: ""Oncologists have been waiting for these results, it will affect practice on Monday morning. ""It's a fundamental change in the way we look after women with early breast cancer. ""It's a great news story."" He estimates 3,000 women a year in the UK will no longer need chemotherapy because of this trial. The study is strictly about early stage breast cancers - specifically those that can still be treated with hormone therapy, have not spread to the lymph nodes and do not have the HER2 mutation, which makes them grow more quickly. Dr Alistair Ring said his practice at the Royal Marsden Hospital will change on Monday as a result of the study The test is performed on a sample of the tumour when it is removed during surgery. It works by looking at the activity levels of 21 genes, which are markers of how aggressive the cancer is. Rachel Rawson, from the charity Breast Cancer Care, said: ""Every day, women with certain types of breast cancer face the terrible dilemma of whether or not to have the treatment, without hard facts about the benefit for them. ""This life-changing breakthrough is absolutely wonderful news as it could liberate thousands of women from the agony of chemotherapy."" The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr Harold Burnstein, from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said: ""This study will transform care immediately, and for the better.""

Is the US-China trade war back on?,"The Trump administration now appears to be escalating trade tensions with Beijing On again, off again. The Trump administration seems to have a knack for keeping everyone guessing - not just on the North Korean summit - but also on trade. So, is the US-China trade war back on? Just a week after it looked like the US and China had agreed to put their trade war on hold, Washington now appears to be escalating trade tensions with Beijing. Analysts say this move could cast a shadow over the potential success of talks between the US and China in Beijing over the next couple of days. The talks, to be led by US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, are aimed at reducing the bilateral trade deficit. Currently,the US buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells,external. Beijing has indicated that it will buy some US agricultural exports to balance the deficit, but that may not be enough to appease US trade hawks. The US also wants to address the intellectual property theft that it alleges Chinese firms have benefited from, and the country's Made in China 2025 programme, which is a multi-billion dollar plan to help transform its high-tech industries into world leaders by 2025. But the strength ofthis White House statement, which confronts years of unfair trade practices, among other issues,external, indicates that the Trump administration isn't getting what it wants from Beijing, and so is willing to up the ante. US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will lead trade talks in Beijing this week Deborah Elms of the Asian Trade Centre says that particular White House announcement, and the timing of it, may just be another bargaining tactic. In her latest note,external, she says the move seems designed to increase the pressure on China to co-operate ahead of trade talks between the two sides later this week, especially given the accusations that US President Trump has faced from the US press and domestic political circles (they've accused him of going soft on China). China has already expressed its discontent with the action. The Ministry of Commerce says the White House's action is""both unexpected and within expectation,"",externaland that China has the""confidence, capability and experience to defend the interests of Chinese people, and the core interests of the country"",external. A nuanced, diplomatic response. But take a look at the nationalistic publication, the Global Times, and you get a better idea of what the Chinese may be thinking. ""Washington suffers from a delusion whereby it feels the US is strong enough to force other countries to accept their unreasonable demands,""said Wednesday's editorial.,external ""Let them prepare for an 'epic trade war'."" The editorial goes on to say if China did actually go ahead with a full blown trade war, that America's farmers, automobile manufacturers, and energy workforce would be at risk. Trump's China tariffs could come in June Trump faces backlash over ZTE deal China agrees to import more from US So what do these latest moves by the White House mean for US-China trade relations? Well, for one thing, Vinesh Motwani of Silk Road Research tells me that we're unlikely to see very much come from Mr Ross' upcoming visit to China. Which means that a trade war between the two sides is far closer than it was late last week. And as I've said before,that's not good for any of us.

US tariffs: The unusual ways nations have retaliated,"The EU, Canada and Mexico have announced retaliatory measures against the US tariffs The US has slapped tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from its allies the EU, Canada and Mexico - but don't think they'll take it without a fight. All three have already announced retaliatory measures as the US follows its new policy, which has been attacked as ""protectionism, pure and simple"" by the EU. Ranging from serious to strange, these counter-tariffs could play a part in a growing trade battle. It's too early to say how consumers will be hit in all the affected countries, but prices could rise throughout the world in light of these tariffs. Read on to see which American products each US ally plans to target. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Trade tariffs: Real war or phoney war Prime Minister Justin Trudeau objected strongly to the announced tariffs, calling them an ""affront"" to their nations' military alliance. He said Canada buys half of US steel exports. This video can not be played Trudeau: Canada not US national security threat Canada plans ""trade-restrictive countermeasures"" on C$16.6bn ($12.8bn) of US goods, to come into effect on 1 July. The country will impose a 25% tariff on assorted US steel products, including railway tracks, piping and steel sheets. But Canada also plans a 10% tariff on more varied items: Yoghurt, soya sauce, strawberry jam, ""mixed condiments"", pizza and quiche Orange juice, whiskies, coffee, soups and waters Manicure and pedicure products, hair lacquers, shaving foam, toilet paper and dishwasher detergents Playing cards, felt-tipped pens, inflatable boats, lawnmowers and sleeping bags The list,published by the Department of Finance,external, also includes a 10% tariff on candles - although, relax Canadians, ""not including those for birthdays, Christmas or other festive occasions"". Senior Canadian officials say the list is designed to exert political pressure on the US and make it take notice of how this will affect trade. Asked by reporters if he was ready to start a trade war with its southern neighbour, Mr Trudeau said Canada was ""ready for anything"". Canada is targeting a variety of US foods - including pizza European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he planned to take the US to the World Trade Organization over the American tariffs, a policy he called ""totally unacceptable"". Meanwhile, EU Trade CommissionerCecilia Malmstrom called the US measures a ""dangerous game""and said the EU would not ""stay silent"". The bloc releaseda list of tariffs,externalin March - 10 pages of US goods it plans to target: Bourbon whiskey, orange juice and cranberries Jeans, T-shirts and tobacco Corn and other agricultural products Steel and industrial products Cosmetics, consumer goods, motorbikes and pleasure boats Snuff and chewing tobacco The EU plans to target iconic US goods, like Levi's jeans The aim is to have the maximum political effect. Kentucky, home to bourbon whiskey, is Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell's state. Orange juice, meanwhile, is a major export of Florida - a key US swing state. France's junior trade minister Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne said he expects EU counter-measures to be completed by mid-June. America's southern neighbour also swiftly released a list of products on which it would impose tariffs, ""up to an amount comparable to the level of damage"" of US tariffs. Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in a radio interview that the measures would target US products from districts that would cause political difficulties for Mr Trump. He said levies would be placed on the following:,external Flat steel, hot and cold foil products, and piping Cold cuts, pork chops and sausages Berries, grapes, apples and ""various cheeses"" Lamps Mexico Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo attacked the US tariffs Mr Guajardo said Mexico was the top buyer of US aluminium and the second-biggest buyer of US steel, and that ""this kind of thing does not benefit anybody"". US tariffs could hit $4bn worth of trade between the two countries. In 2009, Mexico imposed higher tariffs on dozens of US products such as apples, frozen potatoes and Christmas trees in a dispute over the access of Mexican trucks to US highways. The two nations agreed a deal in 2011 allowing their trucks to use each other's roads.

Stark China warning to US over tradeChina says trade talks with the US will be void if Washington introduces sanctions.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"The US currently buys four times as much from the Chinese as it sells to them China has warned that all trade talks between Beijing and Washington will be void if the US sets up trade sanctions. After talks between Vice Premier Liu He and US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, China said it was ready to boost imports from many countries. Mr Ross's China visit comes days afterWashington threatened to impose extra tariffs on $50bn of Chinese goods. Meanwhile, G7 nations have hit out at the US over its new steel and aluminium import tariffs. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire warned a trade war could begin in ""a few days"". On SaturdayPresident Trump insisted on Twitter that the US had been ""ripped off by other countries for years on trade,external"". He says steel tariffs will protect US steelmakers, which he says are vital to national security. Mr Trump has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere. ""Time to get smart!"" he added. Is the US-China trade war back on? US tariffs: The unusual ways nations have retaliated Why history drives China's tough stance on global trade What is a trade war?It's when countries attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas. One will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation. This can hurt economies and lead to rising political tensions. What are tariffs?Taxes on products made abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into the country (imports) makes people less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. They're likely to buy cheaper local products instead, boosting your country's economy. What's a trade deficit?The difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country. The US has a massive trade deficit with China. Last year, it stood at about $375bn. A statement released by the Chinese side at the talks with the US in Beijing said nothing specific about the outcome, and referred back toan agreement reached in Washington last month to increase the purchase of US goods and services. ""To implement the consensus reached in Washington, the two sides have had good communication in various areas such as agriculture and energy, and have made positive and concrete progress while relevant details are yet to be confirmed by both sides,"" the statement said. Mr Ross and Mr Liu met as part of efforts to reduce the bilateral trade deficit But state news agency Xinhua carried a statement which warned against a trade war and said the two sides should meet each other half way. ""Reform and opening up and expanding domestic demand are China's national strategies. Our established rhythm will not change,"" it said. ""If the United States introduces trade sanctions including tariffs, all the economic and trade achievements negotiated by the two parties will be void."" The Beijing talks were aimed at reducing the bilateral trade deficit.The US currently buys nearly four times as much from China as it sells to them.,external This video can not be played What are the contentious issues around US-China trade? A White House statement last week, which took aim at years of ""unfair"" trade practices,external, warned the US would pursue 25% tariffs on $50bn (Â£37bn) worth of Chinese imports. The tone of the statement suggested that China's concessions at last month's talks in Washington were not enough for the Trump administration, says BBC Asia Business correspondent Karishma Vaswani. Analysts say that the statement could have been designed as a bargaining tactic aimed at increasing pressure on China ahead of Sunday's meeting, amid criticism at home that Mr Trump is going soft on China. No joint statement was issued at the end of Sunday's meeting in Beijing, and there has been no response to the Chinese comments by the US side. At a heated meeting in the Canadian ski resort of Whistler, the EU and Canada threatened to retaliate against tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium, whose implementation Mr Ross announced on Thursday. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin denied that the US had abandoned leadership in the global economy and said he had passed on the other countries' strong feelings to Mr Trump. Allies retaliate with levies on jam, lamps and sleeping bags Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade There was no joint statement at the end of this meeting either, which the BBC's North America correspondent Chris Buckler says is a clear sign of discord. Our correspondent says acrimonious debate is likely to continue next weekend when the leaders of the G7 countries - including Mr Trump - meet for a summit in Quebec. The EU is to hit back with tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles Canada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year. The EU has responded to the US announcement with a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. Canada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee. G7 ministers criticise US tariffs Is the US-China trade war back on?

Third night of Jordan tax protests,"This video can not be played Demonstrators have scuffled with police Protests in Jordan against tax rises and austerity measures - the biggest demonstrations in years - continued for a third consecutive night. Police fired tear gas and blocked roads in the capital Amman to stop protesters getting close to the cabinet office. The protesters say a new tax bill backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will hurt the poor and middle class. King Abdullah has called for compromise from all sides. Several thousand protesters chanting anti-government slogans and calling for King Abdullah to dismiss Prime Minister Hani Mulki have been holding vigils near the cabinet office. Police prevented protesters from getting near the cabinet office There have also been some protests in provincial towns, where police have reportedly used tear gas. In the southern town of Maan protesters burned tyres on highways and there were scuffles with police, Reuters reported. Jordanians have seen prices rise with salaries failing to keep up. On Friday King Abdullah intervened to freeze an increase in fuel prices. But the protesters are angriest about the proposed tax bill, which they fear will further worsen living standards.

Boost for security services promised,"The Bishop of Southwark joined members of the public at London Bridge A minute's silence has been honoured and a church service held in memory of those murdered in the London Bridge terror attack, exactly a year ago. Eight died and 48 were injured by three men who drove into pedestrians, then stabbed people in Borough Market. Their loved ones lit candles at the Southwark Cathedral service, which was attended by the prime minister and members of the emergency services. An olive tree was planted using compost from floral tributes. At the cathedral, Dean of Southwark, the Very Reverend Andrew Nunn, read the names of those killed in the attack. He praised the ""dedication"" of the emergency services and prayed for their ""continued safety and protection"". Bustling Borough Market remembers attack Victims of the London Bridge attack London attack: What happened London Bridge: How people fought back ""Love is stronger than hate, light is stronger than darkness, and life is stronger than death,"" he said. The dean said the olive tree, which was planted in the cathedral grounds, would be a reminder of the importance of communities coming together to stand against violence. Theo Ancient, an actor and local resident who survived the attack, told the congregation: ""At ten in the evening, darkness falls in the worst possible way. ""In a few minutes, everything changes, though it will be hours before we'll know the true cost."" It was a day of high emotion at London Bridge Adele Morris, a local councillor, said: ""The terrorists wished nothing but death on this place. Instead, they made us think and talk in ways that are very much alive."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan gave a reading from Psalm 77 at the service, which was also attended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. A procession then made its way to Southwark Needle, at the southern end of London Bridge, where relatives laid flowers and the minute's silence was held. Peter John OBE, leader of Southwark Council, told the assembled: ""Last June we experienced one of the darkest days in our borough's history. ""Today we come together to demonstrate that we are strong and united in the face of evil."" People of different religious and ethnic backgrounds gathered on London Bridge and urged the public not to be divided Later, the words #LondonUnited will be projected onto the bridge and a digital book of hope will be available at Southwark Cathedral throughout the weekend for the public to sign. Mustafa Field, director of the Faiths Forum For London, said: ""We were all shocked by the horrific attack. ""It is important we come together as a community and combat hatred and bigotry through love."" Before the commemoration, Prime Minister Theresa May decried the attack as a ""cowardly attempt to strike at the heart of our freedoms"". She added: ""Our resolve to stand firm and overcome this threat together has never been stronger."" Alex Regan, BBC News Holding a bouquet of lilies, Lucy Fisher watches as hundreds of people enter Southwark Cathedral, metres away from where her cousin's life was taken. James McMullan, 32, was one of the eight people who died on 3 June. ""It was a terrible time,"" she says. Nearby, Borough Market - usually heaving with tourists - is quiet. ""It's my favourite market and I'm used to the hustle and bustle of it,"" says Robyn Hayes, while watching people going into the service. ""It's very eerie hearing the quiet, with the church bells on top of that."" As the 700 guests walk from Southwark Cathedral to the other side of London Bridge, the crowds fall still. When the minute's silence is observed, the only noise is the sound of trains arriving and departing from the station. After families of the victims lay flowers at Southwark Needle, the crowd dissipates and observers return to their everyday lives. Earlier on Sunday, Home Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed the security services were to get 2,000 extra officers as part of a strategy to boost the UK's counter-terrorism efforts. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid vowed to make sure the UK had all the resources needed ""to fight the terror threat"". He said the threat was ""top of my mind"" and ""something I think of every day"". Prime Minister Theresa May was greeted by the Dean of Southwark Andrew Nunn at the service In addition to boosting security services officers, which was first proposed in 2015, Mr Javid said there would be changes to how intelligence was used. ""MI5 will be sharing much more of its information with other organisations,"" he said. ""Not just counter terrorism, but neighbourhood policing and local government. ""This would make sure there is a much higher chance of finding extremists and disrupting plots a lot earlier on.""

US teacher 'who fed puppy to turtle' charged,"A file image of a snapping turtle. The reptile in Idaho was ""humanely euthanized"" An American schoolteacher has been charged after allegedly feeding a sick puppy to a snapping turtle in front of his students. Robert Crosland, who teaches in Preston, Idaho, was charged with misdemeanour animal cruelty. After the incident in March the turtle was ""humanely euthanized"" as it is considered an invasive species. Mr Crosland could be jailed for up to six months and fined up to $5,000 (Â£3,700) if convicted. Several US media outlets said attempts to contact Mr Crosland had proven unsuccessful. The incident sparked rival petitions for and against Mr Crosland, who has taught at Preston Junior High School for a number of years. One calling for him to be fired and asking ""Do we really want teachers killing living animals in front of impressionable junior high students?"" has attracted nearly 190,000 signatures. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) said Mr Crosland was ""a bully who should not be allowed near impressionable young people"". A counter ""We Support Crosland"" petition urging people ""to show our support for the man that taught us science in a new way and truly loves his job"" so far has attracted more than 3,700 signatures, many from colleagues, ex-students and members of the local community. Some of his supporters say the puppy was dying and it was the right thing to do. The incident reportedly happened after school in front of a small number of students, with authorities saying it was not part of school activities. The turtle was seized by the Idaho State Department of Agriculture when it learned there was no permit for it. Alligator snapping turtle's great escape.

Pope gives indulgence to Irish pilgrims,"Pope Francis will be the first pontiff to visit Ireland since 1979 Participants attending the World Meeting of Families in August can be forgiven their sins or help a relative speed through purgatory. Pope Francis has granted a ""plenary indulgence"" for those taking part. In Catholic doctrine an indulgence frees you from being punished for your previously committed sins or it can be passed on to dead relatives to shorten their time in purgatory. Even those following events on TV and radio can achieve a partial indulgence as long as they recite the Our Father, the Creed and other devout prayers. Martin Luther's opposition to the sale of indulgences was one of the main causes of theProtestant Reformation in the 16th Century. The Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, the Vatican body dealing with forgiveness of sins, said pilgrims would have to attend confession and Mass, pray for the Pope's intentions and participate in some function during the five-day event. The use of indulgences in Catholicism is a tradition that goes back to the Crusades in the 11th Century. Millions of people came to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Ireland in 1979 Michael Kelly, Editor of the Irish Catholic says that very few Catholics today would take indulgences seriously. ""It's something that was over emphasised in the past and is now under emphasised. Most people would file it in the same theological drawer as things like exorcism. ""Popes tend to grant indulgences as a way of publicising an event - saying to the faithful that this an important gathering to come along to."" World Youth Day is a series of events celebrating the Catholic faith He admits that a small number of the very pious would take it to heart and do their best to collect indulgences. And while the theology is clear it has little impact on the lives of most parishioners. ""Most people don't realise that even though they confess their sins and receive forgiveness, it does not absolve the temporal punishment for those sins!"" he said. And if you can't make it to the World Meeting of Families don't worry there are other ways to collect an indulgence. All require the faithful to have had Confession, Communion and to have prayed for the intentions of the Pope. Climb Croagh Patrick: Valid once in June, July and August if you climb Ireland's holy mountain and pray in the chapel at the top Lough Derg pilgrimage: Pope Pius IX granted a perpetual indulgence in 1870 for pilgrims completing the fasting and vigil November and the dead: Various indulgences available for those who pray for the dead on set dates in November Special Papal Events: In recent years this has included World Youth Day and the 2012-13 Year of Faith First Communion: Both those receiving and those assisting can collect an indulgence Listening to the Pope's Urbi et Orbi address at Easter or Christmas Robert Mickens, editor at La Croix International says indulgences are often issued for papal visits to countries; holy years and jubilees. ""They can also be granted for visits to certain churches, shrines, basilicas and cathedrals and are granted, with the pope's approval, through the Apostolic Penitentiary, one of the Vatican's three tribunals."" But like anything that sounds too good to be true, remember to read the small print. You may have ticked all the boxes above, prayed with the Pope, gone to confession etc but there is one more step. According to the Enchiridion (handbook) of Indulgences none of the other steps matter unless you are ""free from all attachment to sin"" - a tall order even for saints.

History drives China's tough stance,"President Trump has insisted that he and President Xi will always be friends The world's two largest economies, the US and China, are in the midst of a trade spat that threatens to erupt into a full-scale trade war. US President Donald Trump launched the trade dispute by threatening to impose tens of billions of dollars of new tariffs on Chinese imports unless China cuts its tariffs, imports more American products, and gives US companies easier access to the Chinese market. Beijing has fired back with threats to impose billions of dollars of tariffs on US products. Our Taipei correspondent Cindy Sui, who grew up in both China and the US, explores the Chinese psyche when it comes to trade, and how history has influenced this mindset. She offers clues as to how Washington and Beijing can learn to be better trade partners with each other: Since 1783 when the American Revolutionary War ended, freeing American trade from British control, Americans have been trying to make their fortune in the Chinese market. Even back then, China hesitated to open its doors to outside trade, preferring to be self-sufficient instead. China initially limited foreign activity in the country to the Thirteen Factories area of the southern city of Guangzhou It put up restrictions, such as insisting on accepting only silver as payment, and confining China's trade with the West to an area of Guangzhou city, near Hong Kong, called The Thirteen Factories. And even back then, US traders struggled to find products that China wanted to buy. They sold mostly ginseng and fur to the Chinese, and instead made more money selling China's products to American consumers. China has come a long way since then - it is now the world's biggest trading nation. It exports more than any country, and its imports are second only to the US. But the desire to be self-reliant remains very strong, which partly explains why it imposes high tariffs on foreign products, restricts foreign companies' market access, tries to learn to make the products they sell by forcing them to transfer technology, and turns a blind eye on intellectual property rights violations by its companies. History helps explain this mentality. Still on Chinese people's minds is the period when China was forced to open up to trading with Western countries. In the 19th Century, European nations used military power to pry open China's market. To earn hard currency from China, the British and Americans even smuggled opium into China and basically drugged its people. The British and French invaded China in the 19th Century to force it to open up to foreign trade Japan meanwhile forced China to sign unequal treaties that allowed foreigners to establish autonomous economic bases in the country. Previous centuries of being taken advantage of, and recent decades of being mired in communist economic standstill, have instilled in the Chinese the sense - even to this day - that China is vulnerable, in need of protecting itself and catching up with stronger nations. Given its history and its mindset, it is no wonder that to China and many Chinese people, trade was never about fair play. To them, it is practically their right to have a huge trade surplus with the US. Also fuelling this is the traditional Chinese belief that the shrewdest business person deserves the best deal or outcome. People who have visited China would have experienced a microcosm of this mentality while shopping. At many street-side markets, including the famous Silk Market in Beijing, prices are not posted. Instead, shoppers and vendors play a game of each trying to get the best deal for himself or herself. The vendors pre-empt the shoppers by asking for a much higher price than their bottom line. Shopping in China can involve a lot of haggling over price The shoppers, at least those who are experienced, ask for a much lower price than what they're willing to pay. A lot of back and forth haggling then takes place, which may include the vendor pretending to be upset at the shopper's low asking price, and the shopper pretending to walk away to another stall. But the vendor almost always calls back the shopper, albeit with feigned disapproval. It's just an act, the vendor would never sell the product at a loss, and is simply making the customer think he or she is getting a good deal. If all goes well, and it usually does, both sides laugh and behave like the best of friends because they've met each other halfway and both have gotten what they wanted. I used to dislike shopping this way, considering it too laborious, and thinking I was being cheated. I even made the mistake of getting upset at the vendors asking for an unreasonable price. But I later learned that I got better deals by smiling and playing along. That's something that has been missing in China-US trade over the years. In their eagerness to make money from each other, the Chinese and Americans have forgotten to make each other feel that they are getting a good deal. China should remind the US that its companies have profited immensely by manufacturing their products cheaply in China, not to mention polluting its environment, and that when the US has what China wants - such as Boeing airliners, China buys a lot of them. The US has put tariffs on a number of Chinese products, including steel Beijing could do well by also reminding America that heavy spending American consumers have benefitted from the cheaper goods imported from China. The US, at the same time, needs to remind China that it's benefited tremendously from relatively low US tariffs, and a level playing field in the US. And that despite historical wrongs done by Western powers to the Middle Kingdom, China is no longer a victim, and it needs to practice fair play as a major trading nation. But it will be an uphill battle. That's because while the Americans may feel cheated, the Chinese feel much worse. Many truly think, be it true or not, that America is out to contain China or even destroy it. As the trade spat brewed, I received an opinion piece circulated on Wechat, the social media portal widely used in China. It accused Trump and the US of acting out of fear of China's rise, and trying to impose tariffs on China's technology exports such as aircraft parts, to kill its high-tech development. ""This is really strange,"" it said. ""So China should only build houses, make clothes, and lend money to the United States? It cannot develop computers, aircraft, and weapons technology? What **** logic is that!"" The article then accused the US of wanting to ""repeat the plundering of the Opium War."" China buys sizeable numbers of Boeing aircraft To Westerners, this might seem odd, but one must not forget history is still fresh on Chinese people's minds, and such deep family- and country-destroying wounds do not heal easily. The editorial even expressed the fear in the back of Chinese minds that the US wants to split up China into many small countries (like the former Soviet Union) to weaken it. ""Facts have once again educated the Chinese people that the US imperialists' wishes of killing China still exist,"" it said. ""We must not be in an illusion about this world-class evil empire."" Needless to say, it will take a lot of time, effort and wisdom to bring the two sides closer to understanding and trusting each other. But President Trump seems to understand how to negotiate with the Chinese. Just when the trade spat looked like it could turn ugly, after Trump called for imposing $100bn (Â£74bn) in new tariffs on Chinese products, he tweeted that he and President Xi will always be friends, no matter what happens with their dispute on trade. Ahead of this week's US-China trade talks in Beijing that was a wise move. It assures China that things won't get ugly, and that it's not personal. One good that may come out of this trade dispute is that the world's second-largest economy may finally realize it has risen up - it is no longer powerless and taken advantage of. It has benefited immensely from other countries' openness towards trade and as its companies expand globally, China needs to play fair in order for its companies to get fair treatment abroad. That's perhaps what has led Chinese President Xi, at the recent Boao Forum on economic development and on the 40th anniversary of the opening up of China's economy, to pledge that China will increase imports, lower import tariffs, increase market access and further protect intellectual property rights. In his speech, President Xi said: ""China will enter a new phase of opening up."" It remains to be seen whether President Xi will carry out his promises. But there's no need for the US to be too anxious. Unlike during the Qing and earlier dynasties, when the Chinese found little need to trade with the outside world, it is now trading widely around the globe. And with its emerging middle class and their growing income, it will have a growing appetite for Western products, especially those that are considered the best in their league. So if the US continues to innovate great products and if the Trump administration bargains well with the Chinese, trade between the two sides will eventually become more balanced, and the two trading partners could even behave like the best of friends.

London Bridge victims remembered one year on,"The Bishop of Southwark joined members of the public at London Bridge A minute's silence has been honoured and a church service held in memory of those murdered in the London Bridge terror attack, exactly a year ago. Eight died and 48 were injured by three men who drove into pedestrians, then stabbed people in Borough Market. Their loved ones lit candles at the Southwark Cathedral service, which was attended by the prime minister and members of the emergency services. An olive tree was planted using compost from floral tributes. At the cathedral, Dean of Southwark, the Very Reverend Andrew Nunn, read the names of those killed in the attack. He praised the ""dedication"" of the emergency services and prayed for their ""continued safety and protection"". Bustling Borough Market remembers attack Victims of the London Bridge attack London attack: What happened London Bridge: How people fought back ""Love is stronger than hate, light is stronger than darkness, and life is stronger than death,"" he said. The dean said the olive tree, which was planted in the cathedral grounds, would be a reminder of the importance of communities coming together to stand against violence. Theo Ancient, an actor and local resident who survived the attack, told the congregation: ""At ten in the evening, darkness falls in the worst possible way. ""In a few minutes, everything changes, though it will be hours before we'll know the true cost."" It was a day of high emotion at London Bridge Adele Morris, a local councillor, said: ""The terrorists wished nothing but death on this place. Instead, they made us think and talk in ways that are very much alive."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan gave a reading from Psalm 77 at the service, which was also attended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. A procession then made its way to Southwark Needle, at the southern end of London Bridge, where relatives laid flowers and the minute's silence was held. Peter John OBE, leader of Southwark Council, told the assembled: ""Last June we experienced one of the darkest days in our borough's history. ""Today we come together to demonstrate that we are strong and united in the face of evil."" People of different religious and ethnic backgrounds gathered on London Bridge and urged the public not to be divided Later, the words #LondonUnited will be projected onto the bridge and a digital book of hope will be available at Southwark Cathedral throughout the weekend for the public to sign. Mustafa Field, director of the Faiths Forum For London, said: ""We were all shocked by the horrific attack. ""It is important we come together as a community and combat hatred and bigotry through love."" Before the commemoration, Prime Minister Theresa May decried the attack as a ""cowardly attempt to strike at the heart of our freedoms"". She added: ""Our resolve to stand firm and overcome this threat together has never been stronger."" Alex Regan, BBC News Holding a bouquet of lilies, Lucy Fisher watches as hundreds of people enter Southwark Cathedral, metres away from where her cousin's life was taken. James McMullan, 32, was one of the eight people who died on 3 June. ""It was a terrible time,"" she says. Nearby, Borough Market - usually heaving with tourists - is quiet. ""It's my favourite market and I'm used to the hustle and bustle of it,"" says Robyn Hayes, while watching people going into the service. ""It's very eerie hearing the quiet, with the church bells on top of that."" As the 700 guests walk from Southwark Cathedral to the other side of London Bridge, the crowds fall still. When the minute's silence is observed, the only noise is the sound of trains arriving and departing from the station. After families of the victims lay flowers at Southwark Needle, the crowd dissipates and observers return to their everyday lives. Earlier on Sunday, Home Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed the security services were to get 2,000 extra officers as part of a strategy to boost the UK's counter-terrorism efforts. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid vowed to make sure the UK had all the resources needed ""to fight the terror threat"". He said the threat was ""top of my mind"" and ""something I think of every day"". Prime Minister Theresa May was greeted by the Dean of Southwark Andrew Nunn at the service In addition to boosting security services officers, which was first proposed in 2015, Mr Javid said there would be changes to how intelligence was used. ""MI5 will be sharing much more of its information with other organisations,"" he said. ""Not just counter terrorism, but neighbourhood policing and local government. ""This would make sure there is a much higher chance of finding extremists and disrupting plots a lot earlier on.""

London attack: What happened,"Eight people were killed and many more injured when three attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market. The men were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. Here is what we know about what happened on Saturday 3 June 2017. At 21:58 BST,a van with the three attackers inside drove onto London Bridge from the north side of the river. The vehicle crossed over, before returning in the opposite direction six minutes later. When it reached the northern end of the bridge, police said it made a U-turn and mounted the pavement. It then crossed the bridge again, ploughing into pedestrians, including three of those killed. Xavier Thomas, walking with his girlfriend, was hit by the van, the force apparently knocking him into the river. His body was later found downstream. BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, said the van was ""probably travelling at about 50mph"". ""He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people,"" she said. This video can not be played ""He looked demented"": The BBC's Holly Jones was in the path of the van driver on London Bridge 'I was convinced I was going to die' Victims of the attack Who were the attackers? After crossing the bridge, the van crashed near the Barrowboy and Banker pub. Three men got out, armed with 12in (30cm) pink ceramic knives tied to their wrists, and ran towards Borough Market, slashing and stabbing people in their path. The men attached blades to their wrists before the attack As the attackers moved through Borough Market, people tried to fight them off by throwing crates, chairs and glasses. This video can not be played ""Run, run, run, they're stabbing everyone"": The eyewitness accounts One witness to the attack, Gerard Vowls,told the BBC: ""They were running up shouting, 'This is for Allah'. They stabbed this girl maybe 10 times, 15 times."" Ambulances were called to the scene at 22:07, with police alerted at 22:08. Police arriving on the scene evacuated the area and ensured nearby pubs were locked down to stop the men entering. Four police officers were hurt. Two unarmed police officers were severely injured while trying to fight off the men. This video can not be played ""Get down"" - police enter bar at London Bridge Armed police arrived at 22:16 as the three men were seen attacking a man outside The Wheatsheaf pub on Stoney Street .

The eight victims of the attack,"Eight people were killed during the London Bridge terror attack on 3 June 2017. Three men drove into pedestrians on the bridge and then stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. Here are the victims' stories. Canadian Chrissy Archibald died in the arms of her fiance after being struck by the attackers' van on London Bridge. Tyler Ferguson had proposed to Ms Archibald, 30, four months earlier after she moved to be with him in the Netherlands. The couple were busy learning Dutch, making wedding plans and talking about starting a family. Ms Archibald was a social worker, who had worked in a shelter for people with drug and drink addictions. Her family had worried she was too gentle for such difficult and heart-wrenching work, but she proved them all wrong.  She had found her calling, said her father, Greg Archibald. On the weekend of the attacks, Ms Archibald decided to join Mr Ferguson, who was in London on a work trip. The couple went out for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate a successful day for Mr Ferguson, but as they crossed London Bridge, Ms Archibald was hit by the van.  She died from multiple injuries. Chrissy Archibald and Tyler Ferguson were making wedding plans At the inquest, Mr Archibald said: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. They make life bright and cheerful. ""But Chrissy was not the sunshine. Chrissy was the moon. ""You might not notice the moon on a sunny day, but you need the moon when life is dark and it's hard to find your way. ""That was our Chrissy: quiet and silvery but lighting a path for you to follow and reaching out a hand to help."" We did our best - London Bridge attack PC Fiance tells of 'chaos' after London Bridge attack French-born Sebastien Belanger was watching the Champions League final with friends at a pub in Borough Market before he was killed in the attack. The 36-year-old, who had been in the UK for seven years, was working as a chef at the French restaurant Coq d'Argent, in central London. Several years earlier, he had been promoted to head chef. ""I am so very proud of him,"" his mother, Josiane Belanger, told the inquest. ""He worked very hard but also liked partying with his friends."" On the night of the attack, Mr Belanger, originally from Angers, western France, and his friends heard a van crash into railings nearby and went to investigate. But under a dark archway, he was cornered and stabbed by the three attackers. Two police officers tried to save him but he died from stab wounds to the chest. ""I do not forgive what they did to him,"" said his mother. ""They mutilated and killed him."" In a tribute, his brother, Julien Belanger, said his family would never forget Sebastien. ""To see you again we simply need to close our eyes, to remember your kindness, your smile, your mischievous look, your generosity, your love for your family."" Medics 'not told' where attack victims were Kirsty Boden, an off-duty nurse, was having a meal out with two friends at Boro Bistro when she heard the sound of a crashing vehicle and ran to offer help. The Australian-born 28-year-old was stabbed as she knelt over restaurant waiter Alexandre Pigeard as he lay dying. She ran through an alleyway but died there from a chest wound. Her bravery earned her the name the ""angel of London Bridge"" and posthumous medals for bravery from the Queen and the Australian government. Her partner, James Hodder, said her actions that night did not surprise anyone who knew her. ""She loved people and lived her life helping others. To Kirsty, her actions that night would have just been an extension of how she lived her life,"" he said. Ms Boden, originally from Loxton in south Australia, had been working at Guy's Hospital and living in Hampstead in north London with Mr Hodder, whom she had first met in a flat-share. ""She completely floored me with her smile and kindness, and I very quickly fell in love with her,"" Mr Hodder told the inquest. He said the two had enjoyed ""geeky"" first dates at the transport museum and a canal museum, before travelling together across much of Europe. ""Anyone who met Kirsty knew that she was different. Whether it was through her smile, the kind words she would always have, or the fact that she would always move heaven and earth to be there for you,"" said Mr Hodder. ""Kirsty just had the ability to leave a lasting impact on your life, and that's why there are so many people here and in Australia who miss her so much."" London Bridge nurse killed treating waiter Ignacio Echeverria ran towards the attackers and tried to beat them with his skateboard when he saw one of them stabbing a woman. But they quickly turned their knives on him. The 39-year-old Spaniard had been cycling with friends along Borough High Street after a day's skateboarding on the South Bank. CCTV shows him get off his bike, run towards two police officers who were trying to stop the attackers and swing his skateboard at Rachid Redouane, who then knocked him to the ground. He died from stab wounds to the back - and was the last person killed in the attack. Mr Echeverria, a financial crime analyst at HSBC, had been living in London for a year-and-a-half, enjoying spending time with his sister and her young family and making skateboarding friends. On the night he died, he postponed a visit to his sister's home as he was having such a good time skateboarding. Mr Echeverria had been a hard-working, disciplined student who completed his law masters in French and Spanish, and also spoke English and German fluently. As a Roman Catholic, he attended Mass every week and always defended his beliefs, his family told the inquest in a statement. Through skateboarding, he befriended youngsters from different backgrounds, and saw an opportunity to influence and encourage them in their studies and work. The Queen presented Mr Echeverria's parents with a bravery award for their son His bravery on the night posthumously earned him the George Medal, which the Queen presented to his parents last year. The award committee said his actions had ""undoubtedly prevented further loss of life"" by giving others time to run away. His father, Joaquin Echeverria Alonso, told the BBC his son said he would have intervened had he passed the Westminster Bridge attack that happened three months earlier. ""Later, during the attack at London Bridge, he demonstrated this through his actions,"" his father said. Skateboard hero receives bravery award Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' James McMullan had nipped out of the Barrowboy and Banker pub for a cigarette after the football match had finished, when the attackers' van smashed into nearby railings. Instead of running, he went to help up Australian au pair Sara Zelenak who appeared to have fallen over on the wet pavement in her high heels, the inquest heard. Witnesses said Mr McMullan tried to pick her up but there was no time for either of them to get away. The 32-year-old British-Filipino became one of the attackers' first victims. He died from a haemorrhage and stab wound to the chest. That night, Mr McMullan had been out with friends celebrating getting financial backing for his own online education company. The day before, he had called his mother, Mila, to excitedly tell her the last two years of sleepless nights were finally going to pay off. He told her everything was going to be OK and he was going to be able to look after her, his sister, Melissa McMullan, told the inquest. He was going to be able to help children who didn't have access to education, through his e-learning platform and make her proud, she said. This video can not be played Melissa McMullan says her brother James was an inspiration At the inquest, his father, Simon McMullan, told how James could talk the socks off anyone. ""James had more friends than most, and all of them will tell you that he was the life and soul of any gathering, that his lust for life was infectious."" He would also help others, no questions asked, said Mr McMullan. ""He would be there to see you through a personal crisis . He would give you the confidence to get that promotion. He would make sure you had a good night out. He would drive in the middle of the night to pick you up from 100 miles away."" London Bridge victim 'slipped' before attack Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter at Boro Bistro, went outside to investigate when he heard the attackers' van crash - but came face to face with the attackers. They stabbed him once, and then all three set upon him again after he collapsed. He died from a haemorrhage and neck and chest stab wounds. The 26-year-old French national, who was living in south-east London, had been in the UK for less than a year. He had settled into his new life, becoming a cheerful, efficient colleague in the restaurant who took full advantage of London's nightlife. A music lover, he was nicknamed ""King of the Night"" by his friends. ""He was a big brother, a confidant, an accomplice whose joy of living was contagious,"" his family said in a tribute set to music that was played at the inquest. He had plans to leave London in the autumn to open a restaurant in Nantes, western France, and produce his first techno EP with his father, the inquest heard. In the hours before the attack, Mr Pigeard, the eldest of six, spoke to his father on his break, chatting about music and upcoming festivals. ""He tells me to kiss the kids. I kiss him and wish him 'bon courage, mon grand',"" said Philippe Pigeard. He told the inquest: ""It's now 703 days since the events took place. ""703 days where I'm a ghost wandering in the night that took away Alexandre, a handful of minutes of horror, of barbarism, cruelty where the assassins jumped on him."" Nurse confronted London Bridge attacker Xavier Thomas was engaged to Christine Delcros when he was killed in the attack Hand-in-hand, Xavier Thomas and his fiancee, Christine Delcros, were walking over London Bridge on their way to cocktails in the Shard, a skyscraper next to the bridge, when the attackers' van mounted the pavement and struck them both. Mr Thomas was thrown over the bridge into the River Thames, and Ms Delcros was seriously injured. For three days, a search team, including a helicopter, scoured the river for him. His body was eventually found almost two miles away, near Shadwell Basin. He had died from immersion. Mr Thomas, 45, had lived in a town near Paris and was a business travel manager for American Express, where he had worked for 25 years. He was a devoted father to his children, Noemie, 24, and Nicolas, 17, whom he had largely raised on his own. At the inquest, Mr Thomas' parents, Philippe and Christiane Pesez, said his number one priority was to secure the best possible future for them. ""They were the apple of his eye. He looked after their education, their sports and other activities and ran the household, always in good spirits, without complaining about the problems he might have to face , and always managing to keep smiling."" Without him, the family felt lost, they said. Both Noemie and Nicolas now have a tattoo to remember their father. Ms Delcros, who had been with Mr Thomas for two years, told the inquest she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas and nothing could destroy that connection. London Bridge fiancee had 'premonition' Sara Zelenak, the youngest of the victims, was given Saturday night off work at the last minute and found herself in Borough Market just as the attackers' van crashed into railings. The 21-year old Australian au pair slipped in her heels on a wet pavement as she tried to get away, witnesses say. James McMullan attempted to help her to her feet but the attackers were too quick. Ms Zelenak was stabbed in the neck. Ms Zelenak grew up in Queensland, loving sport, rarely missing an afternoon nap and getting excited about the little things in life like spaghetti Bolognese. After finishing school, she worked in a pub and tried floristry but realised she could make more money if she joined her father operating a crane truck. Her mother, Julie Wallace, said she had soon saved up more than all her friends put together and decided to go on a ""trip of a lifetime"". She made a plan to tour Europe and meet her parents in Paris. The first three months were spent in the UK, where she started working as a live-in au pair in south-west London. Julie Wallace told the inquest her daughter, who called her daily, loved the family and children and had already bonded with fellow au pairs. ""Sarz was the happiest she had ever been: working, travelling, meeting new people, doing all the things 21-year-olds should do,"" said Mrs Wallace. But on the night of the attack, ""every sliding door slid for Sara to be in harm's way"", she said. She was unexpectedly given the night off; she and a friend had not found a rooftop bar they had been looking for and then they switched plans to go out in Borough Market instead of Soho. Last year, her parents launched a charity - Sarz Sanctuary - in her memory to help others overcome the loss of a loved one in traumatic circumstances.

G7 ministers criticise US tariffs,"The EU is angry at the tariffs, which include 25% on steel US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has faced sharp criticism from angry finance ministers of other G7 nations over America's imposition of new tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. France's Bruno Le Maire warned a trade war could begin in ""a few days"". Meanwhile US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met Chinese Vice Premier Liu He in Beijing to try to ease trade tensions. Afterwards China warned that all trade talks with the US would be void if Washington introduced sanctions. State news agency Xinhua said China was willing to increase imports from many countries including the US. Mr Ross is seeking deals on agriculture and energy to narrow the yawning US trade deficit with China, days afterWashington threatened to impose additional tariffs on $50bn (Â£37bn) of Chinese goods. On Saturday President Trump insisted on Twitter that the US had been ""ripped off by other countries for years on trade"". He says steel tariffs will protect US steelmakers, which he says are vital to national security. Mr Trump has also complained about barriers US firms face in Europe and elsewhere.

There was no joint statement at the end of the meeting, which the BBC's North America correspondent Chris Buckler says is a clear sign of discord. Our correspondent says acrimonious debate is likely to continue next weekend when the leaders of the G7 countries - including Mr Trump - meet for a summit in Quebec. On Thursday, Mr Ross said tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium had come into effect. They apply to items such as plated steel, slabs, coil, rolls of aluminium and tubes - raw materials that are used extensively across US manufacturing, construction and the oil industry. This video can not be played Trudeau: Canada not US national security threat Mr Ross said talks with the EU, Canada and Mexico had not made enough progress to warrant holding off from imposing the tariffs. Canada, Mexico and the EU together exported $23bn (Â£17bn) worth of steel and aluminium to the US in 2017 - nearly half of the $48bn of total steel and aluminium imports last year. Leaders from the EU, Canada and Mexico have criticised the move. French President Emmanuel Macron has called Mr Trump to tell him the tariffs were ""illegal"" but was told by Mr Trump that there was a need to ""rebalance trade"" with the EU. The EU has issued a 10-page list of tariffs on US goods ranging from Harley-Davidson motorcycles to bourbon. The EU is to hit back with tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the US move is ""totally unacceptable"". Canada plans to impose tariffs of up to 25% on about $13bn worth of US exports from 1 July. Goods affected will include some American steel, as well as consumer products such as yoghurt, whiskey and coffee. Some prominent US Republicans have also voiced opposition. House Speaker Paul Ryan has said the move ""targets America's allies when we should be working with them to address the unfair trading practices of countries like China"".

Thousands attend funeral for Gaza medic,"This video can not be played Mourners gathered for the procession of Razan al-Najar through Gaza Thousands of Palestinians have attended the funeral in Gaza of a volunteer medic who was killed by Israeli fire during protests on the border. Razan al-Najar, 21, was shot dead as she ran towards the border fence on Friday to help a casualty, Palestinian health officials said. In a statement the Israeli military said it would investigate her death. Later on Saturday rockets were fired from Gaza and Israel reportedly responded with air strikes. The death of Razan al-Najar followed weeks of deadly violence on the Gaza-Israel border. More than 100 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces amid protests in support of the declared right of Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. Did Israel use excessive force at Gaza protests? Life in the Gaza Strip Gaza border violence in pictures Israel says its soldiers have only opened fire on people trying to break through the border under cover of protests, and has blamed the group Hamas for orchestrating the violence. UN and human rights officials, however, have accused Israel of using disproportionate force. At Saturday's funeral procession, Razan al-Najar's body was carried through the streets of Gaza wrapped in a Palestinian flag. Her father carried her blood-stained medical jacket, while other mourners demanded revenge. Razan al-Najar's blood-stained white tunic was carried by mourners The Palestinian Medical Relief Society said Ms Najar had been trying to reach an injured protester when she was shot near the city of Khan Younis. ""Shooting at medical personnel is a war crime under the Geneva conventions,"" it said in a statement. UN envoy for the Middle East Nickolay Mladenov tweeted that Israel needed to calibrate its use of force and Hamas needed to prevent incidents at the border. The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) also said it was ""deeply concerned"" and called for the protection of medical workers. Allow Twitter content?

Israel's military said its troops along the border had been attacked by militants with gunfire and a grenade on Friday. It said in a written statement that it would investigate the death of Ms Najar. ""The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) constantly works to draw operational lessons and reduce the number of casualties in the area of the Gaza Strip security fence. Unfortunately, the Hamas terror organisation deliberately and methodically places civilians in danger,"" it said. Hours after the funeral two rockets were fired from Gaza towards Israel, the IDF said, triggering air raid sirens in Israeli villages near the border. One rocket was intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome missile defence system and the other apparently landed inside Gaza, a statement said. Israeli warplanes later attacked at least two suspected militant sites in the southern Gaza Strip, reports based on witness accounts said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. At the UN on Friday, Israel's close ally, the US, vetoed a Kuwaiti-drafted Security Council resolution condemning Israel's use of force against Palestinians. It drafted its own resolution that blamed Hamas for the violence and upheld Israel's right to self defence, but the draft failed to win any support in the 15-member council.

Calls to waive VAT on repairs after Grenfell,"Cladding similar to that involved in the Grenfell tower tragedy is having to be removed from other tower blocks. Cladding removal work in the wake of the Grenfell tragedy should be exempt from VAT, according to Scotland's housing minister. Kevin Stewart has written to the UK Treasury calling for the tax to be waived for work carried out in the wake of the tower fire. He said it would be ""immoral"" for the UK government to make money from work to remove combustible cladding. The UK government is to fund the replacement for social housing. The prime minister has committed to spending about Â£400m to pay for councils and housing associations to replace thepotentially dangerous material on tower blocks. But the owners of private buildings have to pay for repairs themselves. Mr Stewart said those living in privately owned buildings would face significant costs to ensure their homes are safe. Work to replace cladding on flats at Glasgow Harbour is to be covered by the developers but at the moment will still be eligible for VAT Cladding fuelled the spread ofthe fire that killed 71 people in the west London block in June last year, and a subsequent safety operation identified hundreds more buildings with similar set-ups. Mr Stewart said: ""We welcome the recent announcement that the UK government will fund replacement cladding for social high-rise domestic buildings, however that funding will not be extended to owners of private high-rise buildings. ""This means that in order to make their homes safe, individual owners will need to fund the full cost of replacing unsafe combustible cladding. Housing minister Kevin Stewart ""These costs run into millions of pounds and are made considerably higher as VAT is payable on this category of repair works. Hundreds of buildings and thousands of individuals across the UK are affected by this."" He added: ""It perturbs me that we find ourselves in a situation where repair work directly linked to the replacement of ACM cladding, in order to ensure the long term fire safety of residents, will ultimately result in additional revenue to HM Treasury."" An HM Treasury spokeswoman said: ""We are providing Â£1m of financial support to help local authorities identify privately owned buildings affected by unsafe cladding, and we will continue to work with them to ensure that safety measures are put in place.""

"Prostate cancer drug hailed as âbig dealâImmunotherapy treatment could provide ""spectacular"" results for some patients, doctors say.","Drugs that boost the immune system have saved the lives of some men with terminal prostate cancer, say doctors in the UK. The team at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said the results were ""spectacular"" and a ""big deal"". However, the therapy will not work for most patients. Cancer Research UK said the next step was to predict who would respond. Immunotherapy is transforming the treatment of cancer and is now part of routine practice for some skin and lung cancers. It works by taking the brakes off a patients' own immune system so it can attack a tumour. An early stage trial, presented at the world's biggest meeting of cancer doctors and scientists in Chicago, is the first to show that this approach works on prostate cancer too. In the UK, the disease is the most common cancer in men and it has recently overtaken breast cancer to become the third biggest killer. Prostate cancer patient Michael English had more than 10 years of treatment before an immunotherapy drug made him ""effectively cancer-free"" Michael English, 72, was one of 258 men who took part in the trial. He was first diagnosed in 2005, but radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone-based therapies did not kill his cancer. Two years ago, he was given the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab. He said: ""We were astonished when scans showed that the tumour had become undetectable. ""Today I'm effectively cancer-free."" He says he's now planning out the next 20 years of his life, not the next two. Prostate cancer breakthrough hailed Help to spot and treat prostate cancer Late prostate cancer diagnosis 'worries' Researcher Prof Johann de Bono told the BBC: ""This is the first evidence that a subset of prostate cancer patients do spectacularly well on immunotherapy. ""We have several patients in the Marsden who have had a complete response. ""It is a new arrow in the quiver for men with lethal prostate cancer, it's a big deal for these patients."" However, he said that only between 10% and 15% of patients had any response to the therapy at all. This is an approach that will not help the majority of men. That is not unusual for immunotherapy. It seems to work incredibly well for a handful of patients, have a temporary effect in others, and do nothing for the rest. The team in London have seen hints that it works best in patients with the most heavily-mutated cancers. Nell Barrie, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""The next step will be to find out how to tell which men will benefit from taking this drug. ""This is important as although immunotherapy is exciting, it can have severe side effects."" Your immune system is trained to fight infection, but it also attacks parts of the body if they malfunction - such as in cancers. However, tumours have a few tricks up their sleeve in order to survive. They can produce a protein called PD-L1 which switches off any part of the immune system that tries to attack them. Pembrolizumab is one of a suite of drugs called ""checkpoint inhibitors"" being developed by pharmaceutical companies. They stop cancers turning off the immune system so the body can keep on attacking the tumour. The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Dead whale had eaten 80 plastic bags,"Helpers tried to stabilise the whale but it died on Friday afternoon A pilot whale has died off southern Thailand after swallowing 80 plastic bags, Thai marine officials say. The whale vomited five bags during a vain attempt by conservation officials to save it in a canal in Songkhla province. The bags, weighing about 8kg (17lbs), had made it impossible for the whale to eat food, a marine expert said. A recent report warned the amount of plastic in the ocean could triple in a decadeunless litter was curbed. Thailand is a major user of plastic bags and its government last month announced it was considering a levy on them.

The small male pilot whale had been discovered ailing and unable to swim in the Na Thap Canal last Monday. Environmental officials used boats to try to help float the whale and erected a sunshade for it. They nursed the whale through the week but it died on Friday afternoon.

London attack: What happenedVictims of the London Bridge attackVideoVideoSpanish skateboard hero's dad pays tribute'We're going to stand all as one' - back at BoroughWho were the attackers?,"Eight people were killed and many more injured when three attackers ploughed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge before launching a knife attack in nearby Borough Market. The men were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. Here is what we know about what happened on Saturday 3 June 2017. At 21:58 BST,a van with the three attackers inside drove onto London Bridge from the north side of the river. The vehicle crossed over, before returning in the opposite direction six minutes later. When it reached the northern end of the bridge, police said it made a U-turn and mounted the pavement. It then crossed the bridge again, ploughing into pedestrians, including three of those killed. Xavier Thomas, walking with his girlfriend, was hit by the van, the force apparently knocking him into the river. His body was later found downstream. BBC reporter Holly Jones, who was on the bridge at the time of the attack, said the van was ""probably travelling at about 50mph"". ""He swerved right round me and then hit about five or six people,"" she said. This video can not be played ""He looked demented"": The BBC's Holly Jones was in the path of the van driver on London Bridge 'I was convinced I was going to die' Victims of the attack Who were the attackers? After crossing the bridge, the van crashed near the Barrowboy and Banker pub. Three men got out, armed with 12in (30cm) pink ceramic knives tied to their wrists, and ran towards Borough Market, slashing and stabbing people in their path. The men attached blades to their wrists before the attack As the attackers moved through Borough Market, people tried to fight them off by throwing crates, chairs and glasses. This video can not be played ""Run, run, run, they're stabbing everyone"": The eyewitness accounts One witness to the attack, Gerard Vowls,told the BBC: ""They were running up shouting, 'This is for Allah'. They stabbed this girl maybe 10 times, 15 times."" Ambulances were called to the scene at 22:07, with police alerted at 22:08. Police arriving on the scene evacuated the area and ensured nearby pubs were locked down to stop the men entering. Four police officers were hurt. Two unarmed police officers were severely injured while trying to fight off the men.

The deputy chairwoman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, Sarah Green, confirmed that 46 shots had been fired by eight police officers - three officers from City of London Police and five from the Metropolitan Police. A member of the public was also shot during the operation and was taken to hospital. London Ambulance Service took more than 100 emergency calls about the incident.

Victims of the London Bridge attackVideoVideoSpanish skateboard hero's dad pays tribute'We're going to stand all as one' - back at BoroughWho were the attackers?,"Eight people were killed during the London Bridge terror attack on 3 June 2017. Three men drove into pedestrians on the bridge and then stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. Here are the victims' stories. Canadian Chrissy Archibald died in the arms of her fiance after being struck by the attackers' van on London Bridge. Tyler Ferguson had proposed to Ms Archibald, 30, four months earlier after she moved to be with him in the Netherlands. The couple were busy learning Dutch, making wedding plans and talking about starting a family. Ms Archibald was a social worker, who had worked in a shelter for people with drug and drink addictions. Her family had worried she was too gentle for such difficult and heart-wrenching work, but she proved them all wrong.  She had found her calling, said her father, Greg Archibald. On the weekend of the attacks, Ms Archibald decided to join Mr Ferguson, who was in London on a work trip. The couple went out for dinner on Saturday night to celebrate a successful day for Mr Ferguson, but as they crossed London Bridge, Ms Archibald was hit by the van.  She died from multiple injuries. Chrissy Archibald and Tyler Ferguson were making wedding plans At the inquest, Mr Archibald said: ""The world has many sunshine people in it. Their smiles warm us. They make life bright and cheerful. ""But Chrissy was not the sunshine. Chrissy was the moon. ""You might not notice the moon on a sunny day, but you need the moon when life is dark and it's hard to find your way. ""That was our Chrissy: quiet and silvery but lighting a path for you to follow and reaching out a hand to help."" We did our best - London Bridge attack PC Fiance tells of 'chaos' after London Bridge attack French-born Sebastien Belanger was watching the Champions League final with friends at a pub in Borough Market before he was killed in the attack. The 36-year-old, who had been in the UK for seven years, was working as a chef at the French restaurant Coq d'Argent, in central London. Several years earlier, he had been promoted to head chef. ""I am so very proud of him,"" his mother, Josiane Belanger, told the inquest. ""He worked very hard but also liked partying with his friends."" On the night of the attack, Mr Belanger, originally from Angers, western France, and his friends heard a van crash into railings nearby and went to investigate. But under a dark archway, he was cornered and stabbed by the three attackers. Two police officers tried to save him but he died from stab wounds to the chest. ""I do not forgive what they did to him,"" said his mother. ""They mutilated and killed him."" In a tribute, his brother, Julien Belanger, said his family would never forget Sebastien. ""To see you again we simply need to close our eyes, to remember your kindness, your smile, your mischievous look, your generosity, your love for your family."" Medics 'not told' where attack victims were Kirsty Boden, an off-duty nurse, was having a meal out with two friends at Boro Bistro when she heard the sound of a crashing vehicle and ran to offer help. The Australian-born 28-year-old was stabbed as she knelt over restaurant waiter Alexandre Pigeard as he lay dying. She ran through an alleyway but died there from a chest wound. Her bravery earned her the name the ""angel of London Bridge"" and posthumous medals for bravery from the Queen and the Australian government. Her partner, James Hodder, said her actions that night did not surprise anyone who knew her. ""She loved people and lived her life helping others. To Kirsty, her actions that night would have just been an extension of how she lived her life,"" he said. Ms Boden, originally from Loxton in south Australia, had been working at Guy's Hospital and living in Hampstead in north London with Mr Hodder, whom she had first met in a flat-share. ""She completely floored me with her smile and kindness, and I very quickly fell in love with her,"" Mr Hodder told the inquest. He said the two had enjoyed ""geeky"" first dates at the transport museum and a canal museum, before travelling together across much of Europe. ""Anyone who met Kirsty knew that she was different. Whether it was through her smile, the kind words she would always have, or the fact that she would always move heaven and earth to be there for you,"" said Mr Hodder. ""Kirsty just had the ability to leave a lasting impact on your life, and that's why there are so many people here and in Australia who miss her so much."" London Bridge nurse killed treating waiter Ignacio Echeverria ran towards the attackers and tried to beat them with his skateboard when he saw one of them stabbing a woman. But they quickly turned their knives on him. The 39-year-old Spaniard had been cycling with friends along Borough High Street after a day's skateboarding on the South Bank. CCTV shows him get off his bike, run towards two police officers who were trying to stop the attackers and swing his skateboard at Rachid Redouane, who then knocked him to the ground. He died from stab wounds to the back - and was the last person killed in the attack. Mr Echeverria, a financial crime analyst at HSBC, had been living in London for a year-and-a-half, enjoying spending time with his sister and her young family and making skateboarding friends. On the night he died, he postponed a visit to his sister's home as he was having such a good time skateboarding. Mr Echeverria had been a hard-working, disciplined student who completed his law masters in French and Spanish, and also spoke English and German fluently. As a Roman Catholic, he attended Mass every week and always defended his beliefs, his family told the inquest in a statement. Through skateboarding, he befriended youngsters from different backgrounds, and saw an opportunity to influence and encourage them in their studies and work. The Queen presented Mr Echeverria's parents with a bravery award for their son His bravery on the night posthumously earned him the George Medal, which the Queen presented to his parents last year. The award committee said his actions had ""undoubtedly prevented further loss of life"" by giving others time to run away. His father, Joaquin Echeverria Alonso, told the BBC his son said he would have intervened had he passed the Westminster Bridge attack that happened three months earlier. ""Later, during the attack at London Bridge, he demonstrated this through his actions,"" his father said. Skateboard hero receives bravery award Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' James McMullan had nipped out of the Barrowboy and Banker pub for a cigarette after the football match had finished, when the attackers' van smashed into nearby railings. Instead of running, he went to help up Australian au pair Sara Zelenak who appeared to have fallen over on the wet pavement in her high heels, the inquest heard. Witnesses said Mr McMullan tried to pick her up but there was no time for either of them to get away. The 32-year-old British-Filipino became one of the attackers' first victims. He died from a haemorrhage and stab wound to the chest. That night, Mr McMullan had been out with friends celebrating getting financial backing for his own online education company. The day before, he had called his mother, Mila, to excitedly tell her the last two years of sleepless nights were finally going to pay off. He told her everything was going to be OK and he was going to be able to look after her, his sister, Melissa McMullan, told the inquest. He was going to be able to help children who didn't have access to education, through his e-learning platform and make her proud, she said. This video can not be played Melissa McMullan says her brother James was an inspiration At the inquest, his father, Simon McMullan, told how James could talk the socks off anyone. ""James had more friends than most, and all of them will tell you that he was the life and soul of any gathering, that his lust for life was infectious."" He would also help others, no questions asked, said Mr McMullan. ""He would be there to see you through a personal crisis . He would give you the confidence to get that promotion. He would make sure you had a good night out. He would drive in the middle of the night to pick you up from 100 miles away."" London Bridge victim 'slipped' before attack Alexandre Pigeard, a waiter at Boro Bistro, went outside to investigate when he heard the attackers' van crash - but came face to face with the attackers. They stabbed him once, and then all three set upon him again after he collapsed. He died from a haemorrhage and neck and chest stab wounds. The 26-year-old French national, who was living in south-east London, had been in the UK for less than a year. He had settled into his new life, becoming a cheerful, efficient colleague in the restaurant who took full advantage of London's nightlife. A music lover, he was nicknamed ""King of the Night"" by his friends. ""He was a big brother, a confidant, an accomplice whose joy of living was contagious,"" his family said in a tribute set to music that was played at the inquest. He had plans to leave London in the autumn to open a restaurant in Nantes, western France, and produce his first techno EP with his father, the inquest heard. In the hours before the attack, Mr Pigeard, the eldest of six, spoke to his father on his break, chatting about music and upcoming festivals. ""He tells me to kiss the kids. I kiss him and wish him 'bon courage, mon grand',"" said Philippe Pigeard. He told the inquest: ""It's now 703 days since the events took place. ""703 days where I'm a ghost wandering in the night that took away Alexandre, a handful of minutes of horror, of barbarism, cruelty where the assassins jumped on him."" Nurse confronted London Bridge attacker Xavier Thomas was engaged to Christine Delcros when he was killed in the attack Hand-in-hand, Xavier Thomas and his fiancee, Christine Delcros, were walking over London Bridge on their way to cocktails in the Shard, a skyscraper next to the bridge, when the attackers' van mounted the pavement and struck them both. Mr Thomas was thrown over the bridge into the River Thames, and Ms Delcros was seriously injured. For three days, a search team, including a helicopter, scoured the river for him. His body was eventually found almost two miles away, near Shadwell Basin. He had died from immersion. Mr Thomas, 45, had lived in a town near Paris and was a business travel manager for American Express, where he had worked for 25 years. He was a devoted father to his children, Noemie, 24, and Nicolas, 17, whom he had largely raised on his own. At the inquest, Mr Thomas' parents, Philippe and Christiane Pesez, said his number one priority was to secure the best possible future for them. ""They were the apple of his eye. He looked after their education, their sports and other activities and ran the household, always in good spirits, without complaining about the problems he might have to face , and always managing to keep smiling."" Without him, the family felt lost, they said. Both Noemie and Nicolas now have a tattoo to remember their father. Ms Delcros, who had been with Mr Thomas for two years, told the inquest she was still ""madly in love"" with Mr Thomas and nothing could destroy that connection. London Bridge fiancee had 'premonition' Sara Zelenak, the youngest of the victims, was given Saturday night off work at the last minute and found herself in Borough Market just as the attackers' van crashed into railings. The 21-year old Australian au pair slipped in her heels on a wet pavement as she tried to get away, witnesses say. James McMullan attempted to help her to her feet but the attackers were too quick. Ms Zelenak was stabbed in the neck. Ms Zelenak grew up in Queensland, loving sport, rarely missing an afternoon nap and getting excited about the little things in life like spaghetti Bolognese. After finishing school, she worked in a pub and tried floristry but realised she could make more money if she joined her father operating a crane truck. Her mother, Julie Wallace, said she had soon saved up more than all her friends put together and decided to go on a ""trip of a lifetime"". She made a plan to tour Europe and meet her parents in Paris. The first three months were spent in the UK, where she started working as a live-in au pair in south-west London. Julie Wallace told the inquest her daughter, who called her daily, loved the family and children and had already bonded with fellow au pairs. ""Sarz was the happiest she had ever been: working, travelling, meeting new people, doing all the things 21-year-olds should do,"" said Mrs Wallace. But on the night of the attack, ""every sliding door slid for Sara to be in harm's way"", she said. She was unexpectedly given the night off; she and a friend had not found a rooftop bar they had been looking for and then they switched plans to go out in Borough Market instead of Soho. Last year, her parents launched a charity - Sarz Sanctuary - in her memory to help others overcome the loss of a loved one in traumatic circumstances.

'We're going to stand all as one' - back at BoroughWho were the attackers?," This article was first published in July 2017 Fruit and veg salesman Paul Crane uses his distinctive Bermondsey rasp to tout his produce at Borough Market. “Strawberries, get 'em by the pound,” he bellows to the punters, trickling down Stoney Street, in London Bridge. The trader has been a staple in Borough for 18 years. On 3 June, he had packed up his stall - as usual - at the end of a busy Saturday. The market had been packed with foodies, locals and tourists. That evening, the nearby pubs and restaurants gradually filled with people enjoying the summer evening. But it all changed shortly after 10 o'clock, when a hired van sped across London Bridge driving into pedestrians. Out jumped three knife-wielding men wearing fake suicide vests - who proceeded to wreak more havoc in the historic market and surrounding streets. “My daughter called me [that night] and said there'd been an attack. Ten minutes later it [turned out] it was the market so I stayed up watching it on TV,” the 46-year-old Crane says. I was just worried that friends that were up here were injured or worse.” Borough Market was closed for about 10 days after the attack, and it's now back open and filled with the usual heady mix of colours, sounds, smells and tastes. But for the stallholders and their customers, is it business as usual? Over the two decades Paul Crane has been working there, Borough Market has been transformed into a place where culinary cultures collide. Fishmongers, butchers and greengrocers now sit alongside street food stalls. There's an enticing aroma in the air. As it approaches midday, business picks up at the Borough Wines stall - with customers tempted by the Prosecco and elderflower cocktails. Stall manager Ian Campbell, 46, says the attackers struck at one of the busiest times. “A lot of traders would hang about on Saturday, it's the last day of the week for a lot of them in the market,” he says. Everyone was touched or affected by it in some way.” He talked about how he knew a female manager from one of the restaurants close to the stall who had been stabbed. The attackers' rampage on London Bridge, left eight people dead and tens more were injured. Although hesitant, stall traders seem happy to talk about the effect of the attack on the market. But for businesses directly involved on the night, the emotions are too raw. The bars and restaurants that were open on the night of the attack politely refuse to talk. One restaurant manager says the staff are too upset. “Some of them were involved. It's too soon.” But inside the market, the pain and loss felt by many is not showing publicly. Punters continue to ogle croissants and Chelsea buns at a bakery stall. Eva Law returns to the market for the first time with her brother-in-law. The 35-year-old, who lives in Wapping, says: “We tried to come the week after and it was closed. I think it's great, the atmosphere feels exactly the same. “It's good to see the tourists have come back, I feel there's a similar amount of activity as before.” For others though, the atmosphere of the market - one of London's go-to tourist attractions - has changed. Alison Monroe, 25, has been working at Wyndham House Poultry for two years and says the market is far less busy than usual. She was drinking on Stoney Street before the attack happened. “If I had gone out for more drinks afterwards I probably would've been involved. “It's just because I'm not very organised and I had a holiday the next day so I had to quickly go home and pack. “Thank God for my poor organisation skills.” Hopefully people will think stuff them, we're going to stand all as one.” As the lunchtime rush continues traders are competing for customers. One man is thrusting forks of paella on passers-by, steam gently rises from the colourful rice. Idie Shashimal Idirisinghe smiles as he prepares salt beef sandwiches. The 39-year-old says: “We had a big problem here but everybody is smiling back, we've got a bit busier every week.” I'm always happy, I always have a smile on my face.” The smell of melted cheeses, cured meats and barbecued seafood becomes even more powerful as the rush continues. Jat Vithlani scoffs his fish and chips around the pillars of the market, looking on to Stoney Street. The 28-year-old, and 10 of his colleagues, make a weekly trip to the market from their offices in The Shard, which looms over the stalls. “I didn't think something like that would happen so local to where we work but it hasn't changed our mindset. “We haven't stopped coming here less frequently, it hasn't changed our daily routine going forward.” The defiant spirit of many Londoners can be seen throughout the market. Teresa Vanneck-Surplice chose to visit in the hope of using scenes from the market in a painting. As the 86-year-old eats an almond croissant, she describes how the market has changed since she visited 30 years ago. “There were no cakes, no young tourists, but with all the publicity I thought I'd come back.” When asked if she thought it was odd that the market could return to normality so quickly, she cackles: That's London darling, you're obviously not a Londoner to ask such a silly question.” By one o'clock the market is in full swing. Tourists can be seen scrolling through their Instagram picture filters, before sending an artistically-lit snap of a roast tomato focaccia. But for fishmonger Max Tucker, the market is still feeling the effects of the attack. “For me, there's [got to be] an energy in a market.” It's just starting to get the atmosphere back, it's sort of been a really dull place.” “We don't all love each other, but we are a whole when it comes to it. I think the day we reopened you got a sense of that.” Many traders are concerned about how quiet it is on Saturday. The tourist trap seems to be losing trade from out-of-towners, concerned about the recent events. Police officers can be seen patrolling the railway archways of the market, putting traders and punters at ease. Inspector Rob McElroy was on duty the day after the attack. He said that “stubbornness” got a lot of people through the most recent atrocities in London and Manchester. “Particularly within the Met, that Blitz spirit is still with us, nothing will stop us. “It's a world city, carry on as normal, ain't gonna get us down or stop us doing what we want to do.” Do whatever you want to do, they can't beat us, we'll carry on as normal.” Built with Shorthand"
Who were the attackers?,"Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba have been named as the London Bridge attackers Three men killed eight people and injured 48 others in an attack at London Bridge on 3 June. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians before stabbing Saturday night revellers in Borough Market, shouting: ""This is for Allah"". They were wearing hoax bomb belts. Detective Chief Inspector Simon Moring told an inquest into their deaths that all three were shot by police at the market. This is what we know about them. Butt worked as a customer service assistant at Transport for London Khuram Butt, 27, was born in the Pakistani city of Jahelum but was a British citizen. He lived in a flat in Barking, east London, with his wife and two children. At the time of the attack, he was unemployed. But until 2016, he had worked at a security firm and as a customer service assistant at Transport for London, according to a CV obtained by the BBC. He also claimed he had a Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence, which is required by security workers and involves a criminal record check. The SIA told the BBC it was unable to comment because an investigation was under way. A spokeswoman said a criminal record would not necessarily prevent someone from holding a licence, as criteria including the type and seriousness of any offences are taken into consideration. Before this, Butt claimed jobseeker's allowance for seven months and later worked in an administrative role between 2012 and 2015 for a company based in East Ham, which manages Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets. The fast food firm confirmed Butt had worked at the franchise, run by Auriga Holdings, and added it was co-operating with authorities. Butt's Whatsapp account shows he was last active on the network at 17:59 BST three days before the attack. In evidence at the inquest, Det Ch Insp Moring said Butt's cause of death at a provisional autopsy was multiple gunshot wounds. He had been identified by his fingerprints and his DNA, the inquest heard. Butt was known to police and security services; an investigation into him began in 2015, when one man called the terrorism hotline after concerns that Butt had been radicalised. A woman also went to police after she became concerned that Butt was trying to radicalise her children. Photographer Gabriele Sciotto's image from the attack appears to show a man with canisters around his waist Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police and MI5 had downgraded the investigation because ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned"". Butt had featured in a Channel 4 documentary, The Jihadis Next Door, broadcast last year. In the programme, he was seen to support convicted hate preacher Anjem Choudary. It is also believed that he had been thrown out of a mosque after interrupting an imam who had urged people to use their vote in the 2015 general election. His family condemned the attack, saying they were ""shocked and appalled"" by his actions. His wife's cousin, Fahad Khan, has said Butt watched propaganda videos made by the militant group Islamic State, and wanted to travel to Syria. He also said Butt openly expressed extremist views at family gatherings. This video can not be played Islamic scholar Dr Usama Hasan describes how he rowed with Khuram Butt at an event last year London attacker showed extremist colours Rachid Redouane was not under surveillance by Irish security forces Rachid Redouane, 30, claimed to be Moroccan-Libyan and was based in the east London suburb of Barking. An Irish identity card was found on his body after he was shot dead by police. Redouane,who was not under surveillance in Ireland,was also known by the name Rachid Elkhdar. It is understood he arrived in the UK in 2006 and applied for asylum but that the application was rejected in 2009. The details of when he arrived in the Republic of Ireland or how long he stayed there are still not clear. He married a British woman, 38-year-old Charisse Ann O'Leary, in Dublin in 2012. The couple lived in Rathmines, Dublin, and reports suggest Redouane worked as a pastry chef. He may have intermittently visited the UK because he had a European Union permit. He left Ireland after the marriage and settled in the UK before returning to Ireland in 2015. Redouane is understood to have had a one-year-old daughter with Ms O'Leary, although the couple were estranged. According to reports, he visited his child before carrying out the London attack. Ms O'Leary said she was ""deeply shocked, saddened and numbed"" by his actions, adding: ""My thoughts and efforts now are with trying to bring up my daughter with the knowledge that some day I will have to try and explain to her why her father did what he did."" At his inquest, Det Ch Insp Moring said Redouane was identified by his fingerprints held by the immigration service. The autopsy gave his cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen, the inquest heard. Ex-wife 'numbed' by attacker's actions Zaghba reportedly tried to enter Syria in 2016, but was stopped by Italian authorities Youssef Zaghba, 22, was born in the Moroccan city of Fez, but was an Italian national. He lived in Ilford, east London, and worked as an audio technician. Italian police sources confirmed that Zaghba was stopped at Bologna airport in March 2016 when he was on his way to Turkey, because of concerns he might travel to fight in Syria. Material about the so-called Islamic State group was found on his phone. Sources told the BBC that the database, which Zaghba was on, would have been shared with British security services - although it is not clear how this was done. There are various methods for passing on information either directly or through shared EU border databases. The Italian authorities said they informed UK intelligence agencies about him and Italian police said they had a ""clear conscience"". Speaking at her home in Bologna in northern Italy, his mother Valeria Collina Kadhija said: ""From 2016 there were problems with my son - the fact that he was stopped at Bologna airport. ""He would say to me 'Come on Mum let's go live in Syria. Over there, they have a pure Islam.' ""I told him 'Are you crazy? I have no intention of going to Syria with you or with anyone. I'm fine in my country.'""

Jordan tax protests enter third night,"This video can not be played Demonstrators have scuffled with police Protests in Jordan against tax rises and austerity measures - the biggest demonstrations in years - continued for a third consecutive night. Police fired tear gas and blocked roads in the capital Amman to stop protesters getting close to the cabinet office. The protesters say a new tax bill backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will hurt the poor and middle class. King Abdullah has called for compromise from all sides. Several thousand protesters chanting anti-government slogans and calling for King Abdullah to dismiss Prime Minister Hani Mulki have been holding vigils near the cabinet office. Police prevented protesters from getting near the cabinet office There have also been some protests in provincial towns, where police have reportedly used tear gas. In the southern town of Maan protesters burned tyres on highways and there were scuffles with police, Reuters reported. Jordanians have seen prices rise with salaries failing to keep up. On Friday King Abdullah intervened to freeze an increase in fuel prices. But the protesters are angriest about the proposed tax bill, which they fear will further worsen living standards. Read more about Jordan The BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says the king is urging a deal that won't overburden ordinary Jordanians while tackling endemic tax evasion. Mr Mulki has refused to scrap the IMF-backed tax bill, saying it was up to parliament to decide whether to pass it or not. There were also protests on Thursday and Friday The government says it needs the money to fund public services and says the new tax bill will see higher earners pay more. Earlier this year sales tax was increased and bread subsidies were scrapped as part of a plan to cut the country's debt. Mr Mulki said he hoped the reforms needed to get Jordan's economy ""back on track"" would be complete by mid-2019. King Abdullah has said that conflict in neighbouring Syria and Iraq has worsened Jordan's financial situation.

Spotify removes 'hate conduct' policy,"Spotify has backtracked on the policy thatremoved R Kelly's music from their playlists. In a statement released on Friday, the streaming service said it had created ""confusion and concern"". The ""Hate Content & Hateful Conduct"" policy was introduced in May. It had proven controversial since its introduction, with Kendrick Lamar's record label threatening to remove music. R Kelly's music was removed from promoted playlists due to sexual assault allegations which he denies On Wednesday Spotify CEO Daniel Ek admitted it ""could have done a much better job"". Friday's statement, which can beread in full here,external, clarified their position, explaining the policy had two distinct parts. The first, relating to the decision to remove artists from playlists if they were involved in ""controversies"", has now been reversed. ""We created concern that allegations might affect artists' chances of landing on a Spotify playlist and negatively impact their future,"" the statement explains. ""Some artists even worried that mistakes made in their youth would be used against them. That's not what Spotify is about."" The second part focused on hate content, described as content whose principal purpose is to incite hatred or violence. Spotify says this policy will remain but they clarified that ""offensive, explicit, or vulgar content"" don't violate the terms. Anthony Tiffith, the CEO of record label Top Dawg Entertainment, home to Kendrick Lamar, SZA and Schoolboy Q had threatened to remove music if changes weren't made. Speaking to Billboard, he confirmed he had spoken with Daniel Ek and Spotify's head of artist relations Troy Carter. Kendrick Lamar's label, Top Dawg Entertainment, threatened to remove music from Spotify over the policy ""I expressed how I felt about it, about censorship, how you can't do artists that way."" Tiffith explained his issue regarding how the specific artists were chosen. ""How come they didn't pick out any others from any other genres? It seems to me that they're constantly picking on hip-hop culture. ""My whole thing with them was, we gotta fix this situation, and if it can't be fixed, then there's gonna be a real problem, we're gonna have to start pulling our music from the site.""
