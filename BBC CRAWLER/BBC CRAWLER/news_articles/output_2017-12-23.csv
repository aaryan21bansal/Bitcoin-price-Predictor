Astronaut who first flew alone dies at 80,"This video can not be played Nasa's Bruce McCandless: 'Quite comfortable flying around' Bruce McCandless, who was captured in a stunning photograph in 1984 as he made the first untethered flight in space, has died aged 80, Nasa said. With a jetpack, McCandless travelled 100m (328ft) from the Space Shuttle. ""That may have been one small step for Neil, but it's a heck of a big leap for me,"" he joked, riffing on Neil Armstrong's famous moon-landing line. Armstrong's words were in fact relayed to McCandless, who was in mission control for the moon landing in 1969. His voice was recorded in those era-defining moments, communicating with Armstrong and his fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins as they planted the US flag on the moon. ""Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. It really is,"" McCandless said over the radio. He died at home in California on Thursday, Nasa said. No cause of death was given. ""The iconic photo of Bruce soaring effortlessly in space has inspired generations of Americans to believe that there is no limit to the human potential,"" said Senator John McCain, who was a classmate of McCandless at the US Naval Academy. McCandless was the youngest of 19 astronauts selected by Nasa in 1966 to join the space programme. He was 28, with a navy career that had seen him in action during the Cuban missile crisis. It would be 1984 before he first flew to space, at the age of 46, but his untethered flight captured the imagination of a public that was becoming accustomed to space flight. McCandless orbited at 18,000mph (29,000km/h), using a hefty jet pack to propel himself away from and then back towards the Space Shuttle. Bruce McCandless pictured with his jetpack in 1982 At a post-flight news conference back on Earth, he said he had experienced no fear of flying loose from the craft. ""Once you're accustomed to seeing the Earth rushing by at four miles per second and you concentrate on the Orbiter and/or the spar as your references at hand, you feel quite comfortable flying around at the relatively slow velocities with respect to them,"" he said. ""It's sort of like two rather fast airplanes flying formation over one another."" McCandless had over the years been involved with the design and development of the jet pack that allowed him to fly alone, and over the radio from space he told mission control ""we sure have a nice flying machine here"". Sixth man on the Moon dies aged 85 Genetically engineered for life in space? Alongside McCandless, Robert Stewart, an army colonel, also tested the jetpack, officially known as the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU). Down on earth, the New York Times described their flight in a front page article as ""a spectacle of bravery and beauty"". ""Free from any lifeline and propelled into the dark void by tiny jets, they became, in effect, the first human satellites,""the paper wrote,external. McCandless went back up to space for a second mission in 1990, helping to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope. In total he spent 312 hours in space, four of them flying the MMU. In a 2015 article for theGuardian,external, he reflected on the photo which made him famous, noting that he had his visor down because he was looking at the sun. ""It's also one of its attractions: my anonymity means people can imagine themselves doing the same thing,"" he wrote. ""Like Neil said in 1969, I was representing mankind up there."" McCandless is survived by his wife, Ellen Shields McCandless, two children and two grandchildren.

'Valiant' troops keeping UK safe - May,"This video can not be played The PM praised troops for their high standards and devotion to duty The prime minister has used her Christmas message to the armed forces to pay tribute to the ""valiant hearts"" of British servicemen and women who are working to keep the UK safe. Theresa May said the RAF, and soldiers training and supporting Iraqi forces, have helped tackle the threat of the so-called Islamic State group in 2017. And she referenced troops on UK streets after terror attacks. She praised the sacrifice of those who could not be home for Christmas. Mrs May also paid tribute to the Royal Navy for helping to bring disaster relief to people in the Caribbean in the wake of Hurricane Irma. Allow Twitter content?

She said the nation remembered the hundreds of thousands of young men who died ""in the cause of freedom"". ""Through a century of great change since, the high standards and devotion to duty of our armed forces have remained constant,"" she said. The prime minister added: ""Whenever you are called upon - regulars or reserves - you always give of your best and inspire us all with your service."" But she said the achievements of the armed forces were ""made possible by the love and support of your families"". ""Partners and children are often called on to make huge sacrifices of their own - from a change of school or job, to coping with extended periods of separation,"" she said. ""That separation is especially difficult at Christmas time, and we should all be immensely grateful for that sacrifice."" She added: ""This Christmas, as people across the United Kingdom celebrate this special time of year with their families and friends, we will do so secure in the knowledge that the valiant hearts of our servicemen and women, many far away from their own loved ones at this special time of year, are working to keep us safe.""

Philippines storm kills more than 180,"This video can not be played The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island More than 180 people are reported to have been killed as a tropical storm swept through the southern Philippines, with dozens more missing. Storm Tembin brought flash flooding and mudslides to parts of Mindanao island. Two towns badly hit were Tubod and Piagapo, where a number of homes were buried by boulders. Tembin, with winds of up to 80km/h (50 mph), has passed across Mindanao and reached the resort islands of Palawan, and will now move further west. The Philippines suffers regularly from deadly tropical storms, although Mindanao is not often hit. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. The remote village of Dalama was wiped out by flash floods. ""The river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there,"" he said. Who cleans up after hurricanes, earthquakes and war? Economic losses from natural disasters counted He said volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in the towns of Sibuco and Salug. Rescuers evacuate residents in Davao on Mindanao Power cuts and the loss of communication lines have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks for disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. ""So the priority yesterday and this morning has really been to check their situation."" Storm Tembin made a second landfall on Balabac island in the Palawan archipelago and is forecast to travel west, south of the Spratly Islands, reaching southern Vietnam in about three days. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens. The region is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 5,000 people and affected millions in 2013.

I'm more than 'Madame Brexit',"Theresa May has insisted she is more than ""Madame Brexit,"" having been given the title by Poland's prime minister. She said there were ""other things"" she wanted to achieve apart from delivering a successful exit from the EU - such as improvements to education and training. And she insisted she was ""in it for the long-term"", shrugging off suggestions she had had a bad year. The prime minister was speaking to reporters during a visit to UK troops stationed in Cyprus. May seeks to reassure Polish residents 'No 10 knew' of Green claims in 2016 Mrs May gained her new nickname on Thursday, after holding talks in Warsaw with Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Mr Morawiecki told their joint press conference: ""As Madame Brexit has said, Brexit is Brexit."" Mrs May said she had been amused by the comment. ""You might have noticed I smiled when I heard the translation of Mrs Brexit or Madame Brexit,"" she told reporters. ""Look, I am going to deliver on Brexit. That is undoubtedly the case, but I am doing other things as well. If you look at the changes we are making on skills, education and training for example. ""The industrial strategy which actually was talked about with the Poles as wellâ¦ and global Britain."" She said she had completed a number of foreign trips in the run up to Christmas ""promoting the UK both in trading terms, but also our role in defence and security"". Asked if she would characterise 2017 - a year which saw her lose her Commons majority in a snap election she had called - as one of the most difficult years of her career, Mrs May highlighted her recent breakthrough in Brexit talks. ""If you look at what's happened over the past couple of months we have made sufficient progress on the Brexit negotiations, we have had a good Budget that is building a Britain that is fit for the future. ""What we've put into the Budget in terms of funding for the health service but also housing is really important for the future of this country. ""We have had the industrial strategy, which I see as an absolutely crucial plan and part of actually ensuring that our economy does meet the needs of the future and is providing the jobs of the future for the people in the UK."" She said she was ""optimistic"" about making progress on defence and security, as well as trade, ""as we go into phase two of Brexit negotiations"". ""What we want to achieve is in the interests of the EU27 as well as ours,"" she added.

Philippines country profile,"More than 7,000 islands make up the Philippines, but the bulk of its fast-growing population lives on just 11 of them. Much of the country is mountainous and prone to earthquakes and eruptions from around 20 active volcanoes. It is often buffeted by typhoons and other storms. The Philippines - a Spanish colony for more than three centuries, and named after a 16th Century Spanish king - was taken over by the US in the early 20th Century after a protracted rebellion against rule from Madrid. Spanish and US influences remain strong, especially in terms of language, religion and government. Self-rule in 1935 was followed by full independence in 1946 under a US-style constitution. The US is a close ally and has provided military aid to help combat Islamist and communist insurgencies.

Â£500m passport claim 'fake news',"Theresa May's communications director has hit out at ""fake news"" after a claim about the cost of post-Brexit blue British passports was shared tens of thousands of times on Twitter. Robbie Gibb said deliberately misrepresenting government policies ""harms our democracy"". Ex-Dragon's Den panellist James Caan had shared claims the passports would cost Â£500m but later withdrew them. The new passports will be issued from October 2019. The redesign, which happens routinely every five years, will come as part of a Â£490m contract which also includes printing and assembling passports and runs for 11 and a half years. But Mr Caan had claimed it would cost Â£500m just to change the colour. Blue passport to return after Brexit Should the British passport be blue? He tweeted: ""A country that would spend Â£500m to change the colour of a passport while children sleep on the streets is a country whose priorities are wholly out of whack."" James Caan admitted his tweet was 'fake news' The tweet was shared tens of thousands of times before the entrepreneur admitted it was ""fake news"". Allow Twitter content?

The row came after Environment Secretary Michael Gove last month hit out at social media users who wrongly claimed MPs voted against treating animals as sentient beings. Mr Gibb tweeted: ""Fake news harms our democracy. Those who would deliberately misrepresent public policy for political gain - be it passports or animal sentience - should be called out.""

Mrs May has hailed the move to bring back blue travel documents as an expression of the UK's post-Brexit ""sovereignty and independence"", although Nicola Sturgeon described it as ""insular, inward looking, nonsense"". The European Parliament's chief Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt pointed out that Britain could have chosen to have a blue passport while remaining a member of the EU. There is no Brussels regulation which states that EU countries' passports have to be a certain colour, simply a legally non-binding European Council resolution from 1981 which recommends burgundy red.

Assad 'may evacuate cancer children',"Rama, 4, has lymphoma and last received medication eight months ago Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is considering a request to evacuate seven children with cancer from a besieged area, a British charity says. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, an adviser to the charity, told the BBC that Mr Assad's private office had said he would decide next week. The children are among more than 130 needing urgent medical treatment in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. The Damascus suburb has been under government siege for four years. Earlier this monththe Red Cross said life in Eastern Ghouta was becoming ""impossible""and the situation there had reached a ""critical point"". The UN has been trying for weeks to arrange medical evacuations. Dozens of civilians are reported to have died in recent government bombardments and food shortages have led to severe malnutrition. UN rebukes Russia and Iran over Eastern Ghouta Why is there a war in Syria? ""We understand Assad is thinking about it. And we're calling him back on Tuesday morning to speak to him direct,"" said Mr de Bretton-Gordon, who advises the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organisations (UOSSM), which operates in Eastern Ghouta. ""And if he gives us the go-ahead then the plan is that we will get to Ghouta as quickly as we can, get the children."" The seven children who could be evacuated include Rama, 4, who has lymphoma, is suffering from malnutrition and has a malignant tumour in her throat. Rama is also malnourished and has a throat tumour The last time she received the medication she needs was eight months ago, the UOSSM said. Mr de Bretton-Gordon said the UN had told him that she and the other children could be treated elsewhere in Syria or abroad. However, an evacuation would not include children in Eastern Ghouta with other medical conditions, such as two-month-old baby Karim, who lost an eye and suffered severe injuries in a reported government attack. Karim's father, four siblings and aunt have taken care of him since his mother's death Photos of Karim have sparked a social media campaign to raise awareness about his and the other children's plight. People in Syria and abroad have posted photographs of themselves covering their left eyes. Syrian baby's lost eye sparks campaign Last month, UN humanitarian co-ordinator Jan Egeland said nine people with urgent medical needs had died in Eastern Ghouta after requests to evacuate them were denied. ""The men with guns and power on the ground are denying us access to the most vulnerable. They are attacking civilians - including massively schools and hospitals. It's been on both sides,"" he said. He called on Iran and Russia to put pressure on Mr Assad to allow the evacuations. This video can not be played Children in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta are among those suffering Nearly 12% of children in Eastern Ghouta are suffering from acute malnutrition - the highest level recorded in Syria since the war began - the UN says. Joint UN and Syrian Red Crescent aid convoys have not been able to deliver enough food for all 400,000 civilians trapped there. Meanwhile limits on electricity, fuel, safe drinking-water and basic sanitation services are increasing the risk of outbreaks of diarrheal diseases, the UN says. The area has been designated a ""de-escalation zone"" by Russia and Iran, the government's main allies, along with Turkey, which supports the opposition.

'Remarkable' truffle discovery in Paris,"The 21g (0.75oz) truffle found on a Paris hotel roof There was celebration among French foodies after a wild truffle was discovered on a Paris rooftop. The discovery, at the base of a hornbeam tree in a hotel roof garden near the Eiffel Tower, is thought to be a first for the city. Truffles usually grow further south, in more Mediterranean climes, and are dug up by specially-trained pigs or dogs. Prices for the aromatic fungi have recently doubled to more than 5,000 euros ($6,000) a kilo. The winter black truffle found in Paris is not the most prized of the truffle family but it is valued by chefs for use with scallops, sausage or potatoes. Experts at France's Museum of Natural History said it was remarkable the truffle had grown so far from its usual habitat. ""The discovery of this wild truffle is a wonderful example of how roof gardens and green roofs have a huge potential for urban biodiversity,"" said the museum, which revealed the find. Perigord black truffle grown in Monmouthshire Frederic Madre, a researcher from the museum's centre of ecology and conservation, told the AFP news agency he felt a ""great surge of joy"" at the discovery. He said he had to resist the temptation to taste the 21g (0.75oz) fungus before handing it over for analysis. The museum's mushroom expert, Professor Marc-Andre Selosse, said the truffle growth in a northern city was ""remarkable"". ""This shows that it could happen again and that it might be  possible to cultivate truffles on Paris roofs,"" he told AFP. The French capital is trying to increase urban gardening, aiming to transform the roofs of office buildings and other spaces into 100 acres of garden over the next two years.

Philippines storm kills more than 100,"This video can not be played The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island More than 180 people are reported to have been killed as a tropical storm swept through the southern Philippines, with dozens more missing. Storm Tembin brought flash flooding and mudslides to parts of Mindanao island. Two towns badly hit were Tubod and Piagapo, where a number of homes were buried by boulders. Tembin, with winds of up to 80km/h (50 mph), has passed across Mindanao and reached the resort islands of Palawan, and will now move further west. The Philippines suffers regularly from deadly tropical storms, although Mindanao is not often hit. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. The remote village of Dalama was wiped out by flash floods. ""The river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there,"" he said. Who cleans up after hurricanes, earthquakes and war? Economic losses from natural disasters counted He said volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in the towns of Sibuco and Salug. Rescuers evacuate residents in Davao on Mindanao Power cuts and the loss of communication lines have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks for disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. ""So the priority yesterday and this morning has really been to check their situation."" Storm Tembin made a second landfall on Balabac island in the Palawan archipelago and is forecast to travel west, south of the Spratly Islands, reaching southern Vietnam in about three days. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens. The region is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 5,000 people and affected millions in 2013.

Zoo fire kills aardvark 'and meerkats',"This video can not be played London Zoo 'devastated' by aardvark fire death Staff have been injured and an aardvark and possibly four meerkats killed in a fire at London Zoo. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze at its height in the Animal Adventure section that spread to a shop. One person was taken to hospital and eight were treated at the scene. The zoo said an aardvark called Misha died in the fire and four meerkats were still unaccounted for, presumed dead. The zoo was shut on Saturday but said it would reopen on Sunday. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Photographs posted on social media showed orange flames rising from the building Ten fire engines went to the zoo, which sits in the capital's Regent's Park, shortly after 06:00 GMT and the fire was brought under control about three hours later. Six people were given help at the scene for the effects of smoke inhalation and two for minor injuries, London Ambulance Service said. One person was taken to a north-west London hospital, the service said. Duty staff who live on site were on the scene ""immediately"" and started moving animals to safety, the zoo said. In a statement the zoo said it was ""devastated"" about what had happened. It said: ""Sadly our vets have confirmed the death of our nine-year-old aardvark, Misha. There are also four meerkats still unaccounted for, but we are now presuming these have also died. ""All other animals in the vicinity are being monitored closely by our vets, but early signs suggest they have not been affected. We will continue to monitor them over the coming days. ""We are all naturally devastated by this, but are immensely grateful to the fire brigade, who reacted quickly to the situation to bring the fire under control. "" You might also be interested in: Mum dies after raising Â£40,000 for sons Christmas bid to identify collapsed man 'Exploding beer' disrupts Christmas getaway Adnan Abdul Husein said he saw the blaze from a nearby park when he was out walking his dog, and alerted zoo security. ""It didn't look like smoke just coming out of a chimney - it was quite heavy"", he said. ""As I got closer to the zoo I could see that it was actually inside the zoo so I went over to the security and told them, 'there's flames or there's smoke coming from inside there, do you know anything about it?'. And they obviously didn't have a clue."" London Fire Brigade (LFB) station manager Clive Robinson, who was at the scene, said three-quarters of the cafe and shop had been affected by the fire and half of the roof. He said: ""Firefighters worked hard to bring the fire under control as quickly as possible and to stop it from spreading to neighbouring animal enclosures.""

"Conductor denies coercion allegationsCharles Dutoit says allegations by women of ""forced physical contact"" have ""no basis in truth"".3h3 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","Charles Dutoit amassed 10 Grammy Award nominations between 1982 and 2008 Renowned conductor Charles Dutoit has said allegations by a number of women of ""forced physical contact"" have ""absolutely no basis in truth"". Dutoit issued a statement after the Associated Press news agency reported three opera singers and a musician as saying he had forced himself on them. Dutoit said he was taking legal advice and planned to defend himself. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) has cancelled its principal conductor and artistic director's appearances. The RPO said on Friday it had ""jointly agreed"" with Dutoit that he would not appear ""for the immediate future"", following the allegations. The Boston Symphony Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony and New York Philharmonic have been among those distancing themselves from the Swiss-born conductor.

Tesco to go 'food waste free' by February,"No food fit for human consumption will be wasted by Tesco's UK stores by the end of February, the retail giant says. Chief executive Dave Lewis told theDaily Telegraph,externalfood waste had been ""talked about for years"" as he unveiled the plans for all 2,654 stores. Urging other chains to follow suit, he said edible food should be used for people, not go to waste. Tesco, with all major UK supermarkets, has signed a commitment to cut food waste by one-fifth within a decade. The voluntary agreement is known as the Courtauld Commitment 2025. Many supermarkets have introduced initiatives to tackle waste - such as moving away from ""buy-one-get-one-free"" offers that have been criticised for potentially increasing the amount of food thrown away in the home. East of England Co-op recently became thefirst major retailer to sell food beyond its ""best before"" dates. But Mr Lewis, who joined Tesco in 2014 from consumer brand Unilever, said the contrast between the amount of wasted food in the UK and the situation in countries suffering food shortages was ""really stark"". He said: ""Last year we sold 10 million tons [10.2 million tonnes] of food to the British public. But even if our waste is just 0.7% of the food, that's still 70,000 tons [71,100 tonnes] of food. ""And so long as that food is fit for human consumption, I'd much prefer it to go to people than animal feed or fuel."" The UK throws away 8.1 million tons [8.2 million tonnes] of food a year, according to theEnvironment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee,external. Tesco says it cuts waste by selling surplus groceries with ""reduced to clear"" stickers and running a scheme giving unsold items to local charities. This video can not be played What's causing Britain's food waste? It uses an app, FoodCloud, to scan and upload surplus food that stores have at the end of the day, which is shared with registered charities that collect the food. ""That goes a long way in reducing charities' bill burdens, so they can spend the money on other things, like the cost of housing two more addicts, or providing much more needed services,"" Mr Lewis said. But he admitted it was ""impossible"" to prevent food surpluses in supermarkets. ""In retail there will always be some surplus food,"" he said. ""No matter how sophisticated the ordering systems are, it will be impossible to perfectly match the supply and demand for every one of our shops, 365 days a year, when there's so much volatility. ""Food waste has been talked about for years but if Tesco can make this work, with all of our different stores across the country, then why can't everybody,"" he added.

GP warns Santa to 'give sherry a miss',"A leading doctor tells Santa to swap his mince pies for some of Rudolph's carrots this Christmas Father Christmas could be doing serious harm to his health by overloading with mince pies and sherry, a leading doctor has warned. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said Santa could face a raft of health issues because of his diet and busy schedule. Some of his conditions could include gout, sleep deprivation and alcoholism. But we can all help Santa get a bit fitter, and inspire ourselves too, she says. Professor Stokes-Lampard said: ""He's overweight, and all of us do our bit to add to his obesity by leaving mince pies and cookies out for him, and milk or alcohol. ""If Mr Claus was a patient at my practice, I would be encouraging him to adopt a vastly healthier diet and take more exercise in the new year."" Santa could risk 'mixing up important presents' if he has too much sherry As well as running between houses, rather than riding on his sleigh, the professor thinks he should ""give the sherry a miss"" and share some of Rudolph's carrots instead. ""The human body can only process one unit of alcohol per hour, which means excessive consumption could make Santa drunk very quickly,"" she said. ""This not only increases the likelihood of him slipping in the snow or mixing up important presents, but could also lead to long-term issues affecting his mood and mental health."" So now Prof Stokes-Lampard thinks it is time for Saint Nicholas to take better care of himself and lead by example. ""Although he sets a brilliant example of good behaviour and teaches the importance of giving rather than receiving, he could probably do more to encourage healthy lifestyles - something youngsters and adults alike can benefit from,"" she says.

London Zoo shuts as fire kills aardvark,"This video can not be played London Zoo 'devastated' by aardvark fire death Staff have been injured and an aardvark and possibly four meerkats killed in a fire at London Zoo. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze at its height in the Animal Adventure section that spread to a shop. One person was taken to hospital and eight were treated at the scene. The zoo said an aardvark called Misha died in the fire and four meerkats were still unaccounted for, presumed dead. The zoo was shut on Saturday but said it would reopen on Sunday. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Photographs posted on social media showed orange flames rising from the building Ten fire engines went to the zoo, which sits in the capital's Regent's Park, shortly after 06:00 GMT and the fire was brought under control about three hours later. Six people were given help at the scene for the effects of smoke inhalation and two for minor injuries, London Ambulance Service said. One person was taken to a north-west London hospital, the service said. Duty staff who live on site were on the scene ""immediately"" and started moving animals to safety, the zoo said. In a statement the zoo said it was ""devastated"" about what had happened. It said: ""Sadly our vets have confirmed the death of our nine-year-old aardvark, Misha. There are also four meerkats still unaccounted for, but we are now presuming these have also died. ""All other animals in the vicinity are being monitored closely by our vets, but early signs suggest they have not been affected. We will continue to monitor them over the coming days. ""We are all naturally devastated by this, but are immensely grateful to the fire brigade, who reacted quickly to the situation to bring the fire under control. "" You might also be interested in: Mum dies after raising Â£40,000 for sons Christmas bid to identify collapsed man 'Exploding beer' disrupts Christmas getaway Adnan Abdul Husein said he saw the blaze from a nearby park when he was out walking his dog, and alerted zoo security. ""It didn't look like smoke just coming out of a chimney - it was quite heavy"", he said. ""As I got closer to the zoo I could see that it was actually inside the zoo so I went over to the security and told them, 'there's flames or there's smoke coming from inside there, do you know anything about it?'. And they obviously didn't have a clue."" London Fire Brigade (LFB) station manager Clive Robinson, who was at the scene, said three-quarters of the cafe and shop had been affected by the fire and half of the roof. He said: ""Firefighters worked hard to bring the fire under control as quickly as possible and to stop it from spreading to neighbouring animal enclosures.""

Princess Michael sorry for 'racist' broochThe royal apologises for wearing a brooch which depicted an African man.6h6 hours ago,"Princess Michael of Kent was pictured wearing the brooch after attending the Queen's annual Christmas banquet at Buckingham Palace Princess Michael of Kent has apologised for wearing a brooch that critics have called ""racist"". The royal, who married the Queen's first cousin, attended a Christmas banquet at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday wearing a blackamoor brooch. Prince Harry's fiancÃ©e, Meghan Markle, who is mixed-race, was also a guest at the lunch. A spokesman said the princess ""is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offence"". Blackamoor figures and sculptures are exotic figures which usually depict African men and were prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries. The brooch is a bust of an African man The brooch, coupled with the fact that Princess Michael will have met Ms Markle at the lunch, has sparked controversy on social media websites. Spokesman Simon Astaire added: ""The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before."" It is understood the princess will not wear the brooch in future. Princess Michael of Kent was born Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz in 1945, in the German-populated Sudetenland - now sitting in the Czech Republic. She was born shortly before the end of the World War Two, in which her father served as a major in the Nazi SS.

'Pay-per-mile' scheme for HGVs considered,"The new scheme would pay to fix damage caused by lorries to roads The government is considering a ""pay-per-mile"" scheme for lorries to cover the cost of damage to roads. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed the current HGV levy, used to pay for wear and tear on the road network, was being consulted on. Critics say the current scheme means international drivers using the roads do not have to pay towards upkeep. But the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said it was unfair to target lorries and it needs to see more detail. Mr Grayling denied any plans for a road toll system for other vehicles for the ""foreseeable future"". Driving home for Christmas - 10 things to know about roads Building more roads 'makes traffic worse' 'Highest' amount of traffic on roads Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the minister said it was about creating a ""level playing field"" for British and international hauliers. ""Our hauliers often complain that a continental trucker comes in with a tank full of lower duty diesel, spends several days working in the country, goes away again and pays nothing towards the use of the roads,"" he said. ""We already have a system in place that provides some limited contribution, but we're now consulting the industry."" But a spokesman for the RHA said he was ""worried"" about the announcement. ""Although it's good news that more money is being spent on roads, it's not right to target only lorries with a new tax,"" he said. ""This has to be revenue neutral for lorry firms. If we fail to do this, it will make us less competitive than our European counterparts."" The government is also consulting on a fund for work to A-roads The news came as the government launched a separate consultation to find out which A-roads in England needed cash to bring them up to scratch. The Department for Transport announced funding in the summer to rejuvenate the road network, but is now asking councils to apply for up to Â£100m per road. Priority will go to road widening projects on dual carriageways, improving road safety measure and major junction improvements. About 5,000 miles of A-roads across the country will be eligible for the multi-billion pound funding pot to improve the nation's strategic road network. The consultation will last for 12 weeks, but Mr Grayling said he hoped plans to start development next year and building work to start within three years. ""We've been spending a lot of money recently on the motorways and big dual carriageways,"" he said. ""What we have not been doing is sorting out the next tier down. ""This [consultation] is all about medium-sized towns on those A-roads that have got clogged up centres, that have got lorries waiting at traffic lights, that have got pollution in the centre. ""It's about time we started to build those bypasses, improve those roads, add extra stretches of dual carriageway and focus on the next tier down of roads."" Motorists in the UK drove 324 billion miles in 2016 - up 2.2% on the previous year - but AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said many drivers suffered a ""daily nightmare"" at notorious pinch points. As a result, he said improvements to ease traffic flow were ""very welcome"". RAC director of motoring Steve Gooding said: ""For many businesses an economically important major road is the one that runs right up to the factory gate. ""It will be interesting to see whether the business bodies consider the government's plans to go far enough in designating the roads that matter to their members."" But Bridget Fox, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the government should focus on improving major transport links, rather than overhauling major road networks. She said the Department for Transport should apply a ""fix it first"" strategy to prioritising road maintenance, and improving public transport and cycling routes.

Bye for now. Everton 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea manager Antonio Conte speaking to Sky Sports:""We had 26 shots, only eight on target. I think we dominated the game and lots of chances to score. I think it is unfair result. Everton deserve credit but we deserve to win. ""Maybe Jordan Pickford was the best player for them. ""We dominated the game and it is a pity to drop two points. It is normal to drop points with a poor performance but not today. ""It is not simple to dominate here, we needed a bit of luck."" Everton 0-0 Chelsea Everton Everton manager Sam Allardyce speaking to Match of the Day:""I am delighted with the players' attitude and application to defending to stifle a side like this. It is a terrific point for us today. We had a bit of fortune but got a well-deserved point. ""We didn't use the ball well enough to get up the pitch enough.

Everton 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois speaking to Sky Sports: ""Coming here was always going to be tough,
theyâre on a good run so we expected a
tough game but we tried our best to win. Their goalkeeper made a few good saves and we
had to be careful on the counter but other than a few free-kicks they didnât have
many chances. Itâs not easy when a team falls back, I think we couldâve had more shots on target but
we didnât have a big guy up front despite lots of crosses into the box. We concentrated hard on keeping the clean sheet, which is a good thing from today of
course, but weâre not happy we didnât create the chances to score Everton 0-0 Chelsea Everton Everton manager Sam Allardyce speaking to Sky Sports:""Hard-earned is certainly right. In terms of effort, commitment, organisation, we have played a hugely talented front five and have had a bit of luck but rolled up our sleeves to get a result. ""It keeps the undefeated run going, and you have to respect a point against the big boys. ""It is disappointing that we did not really threaten their goal apart from Michael Keane's header at the end. The quality of the ball was disappointing today, but the effort was top class and we are well satisfied with a point. ""We want to be better in possession, but when we dominated Swansea, that is what we will be like against other teams."" Everton 0-0 Chelsea Everton Everton defender Michael Keane speaking to Sky Sports: It was tough, but then I couldâve scored at the end there and nicked
it for us. We relied on Jordan a lot today and in the end we're happy with the point. It'll do a lot for my confidence, it had been a
tough few months and the team struggled with results before the manager came in
but weâve done well since. I got my
chance today and I had to take it â Iâm happy with how it went.   Everton 0-0 Chelsea Everton Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford speaking to Sky Sports:""We grafted like hell and dug in for a lot of the game. We came in with a good gameplan from the boss and even had our chance to win it. They are a good team though. ""The defence put their heart on the line and we did not look like we were going to lose today. We are tight at the back and if we improve in possession and going forward we could be a top team."" Chelsea 0-0 Everton Leon OsmanFormer Everton midfielder on Radio 5 live Probably both teams will walk away happy with a draw in the end - Chelsea will think they could have got more but I'm not sure they did enough to get the victory. The substitutions Conte made were very negative, when if he'd been a little braver they would have had those opportunities to score. #bbcfootball or 81111 on text David Thackeray:I had planned to watch four games today. If this is any indication of what's to come it will be shopping for stocking-fillers or the Darts.  Everton 0-0 Chelsea Not a single shot on target from Everton, but endless guts and determination. It is more School of Hard Knocks than School of Science. But it is doing the job. Everton 0-0 Chelsea One minute to go. Whistles all around. Chelsea come forward one final time... Everton 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea are slinging crosses into the box. Everton are meeting every one, but they are really deep and desperate. And a foul on Jordan Pickford by Marcos Alonso. Blessed relief for the hosts. Everton 0-0 Chelsea That was Everton's chance! Michael Keane meets the corner with a flush forehead, but ten yards out can only direct over the top. Big Sam puffs out his considerable cheeks. Everton 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea clear, but only at the expense of a corner. Four minutes of injury time... Everton 0-0 Chelsea Now then. A prime spot for a set-piece. Gylfi Sigurdsson over it and Ashley Williams up from the back. Could Everton nick an unlikely winner? Everton 0-0 Chelsea Oh Davide Zappacosta. An ugly-as-sin balloon into the stands from a prime crossing position. Chelsea's chances might have been cooked right there. Everton 0-0 Chelsea Jordan Pickford clings onto the ball gratefully. Chelsea attacker Eden Hazard laces a shot towards goal from the angle. His effort catches a deflection and could have gone anywhere. Instead it is right into the Everton goalkeeper's gloves. Everton 0-0 Chelsea Leon OsmanFormer Everton midfielder on Radio 5 live There are some seriously tired Everton legs out there now. The home side just can't get forward and they can only briefly get over the half way line. Everton are running out of steam, whilst Chelsea are running out of time... Everton 0-0 Chelsea Chelsea are throwing in all the tricks and flicks to try and pick their way through. Eden Hazard's reverse ball, Cesc Fabregas' backheel, but Michy Batshuayi runs into a cul-de-sac. Everton 0-0 Chelsea A rare bit of respite for Everton. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has done the targetman role well, pinballs between a trio of Chelsea defenders, retains possession and gives his defenders a chance to push out a little from the advertising hoardings.

'Remarkable' truffle discovery in ParisA 21g truffle found in a Paris roof garden raises hopes that more could be grown in the city.5h5 hours agoEurope,"The 21g (0.75oz) truffle found on a Paris hotel roof There was celebration among French foodies after a wild truffle was discovered on a Paris rooftop. The discovery, at the base of a hornbeam tree in a hotel roof garden near the Eiffel Tower, is thought to be a first for the city. Truffles usually grow further south, in more Mediterranean climes, and are dug up by specially-trained pigs or dogs. Prices for the aromatic fungi have recently doubled to more than 5,000 euros ($6,000) a kilo. The winter black truffle found in Paris is not the most prized of the truffle family but it is valued by chefs for use with scallops, sausage or potatoes. Experts at France's Museum of Natural History said it was remarkable the truffle had grown so far from its usual habitat. ""The discovery of this wild truffle is a wonderful example of how roof gardens and green roofs have a huge potential for urban biodiversity,"" said the museum, which revealed the find. Perigord black truffle grown in Monmouthshire Frederic Madre, a researcher from the museum's centre of ecology and conservation, told the AFP news agency he felt a ""great surge of joy"" at the discovery. He said he had to resist the temptation to taste the 21g (0.75oz) fungus before handing it over for analysis. The museum's mushroom expert, Professor Marc-Andre Selosse, said the truffle growth in a northern city was ""remarkable"". ""This shows that it could happen again and that it might be  possible to cultivate truffles on Paris roofs,"" he told AFP. The French capital is trying to increase urban gardening, aiming to transform the roofs of office buildings and other spaces into 100 acres of garden over the next two years.

Du Maurier's Cornish home listedThe riverside home that inspired Daphne du Maurier's first novel is given Grade II listed status.2h2 hours agoCornwall,"Daphne du Maurier's riverside Cornish holiday home was a shipwright's workshop before it was bought by the Du Maurier family The Cornish holiday home where Daphne du Maurier wrote her first novel has been given Grade II listed status. The author wrote The Loving Spirit, published in 1931, at the former boatyard on the River Fowey in Bodinnick, southeast Cornwall. After its publication, Du Maurier said the novel was inspired by ""the sense of freedom"" the home brought. The house and its quay were listed by the Culture Department on the advice of Historic England. The author is probably best known for her novel Rebecca. Ferryside was bought in 1926 by the du Maurier family who transformed it into a second home. Many of British novelist Daphne du Maurier novels were set in Cornwall, a region that inspired some of the greatest novels of the 20th century Du Maurier's son, Christian Browning, said: ""My mother adored the house and fell in love with Cornwall, which was to be the backdrop of her most famous novels. ""I feel sure that she would be immensely proud that Historic England have granted Ferryside a Grade II listing."" Ferryside's transformation reflected a wider trend for second homes which began in the 19th century and has had a significant impact on Cornwall The building was constructed of local granite in the early 1800s, serving as a shipwright's workshop, yard and quay, and is an important survivor of Cornwall's maritime heritage, Historic England said. After it was bought by the du Mauriers, the original quay was turned into a domestic garden, the sail loft became bedrooms and a bathroom, and the former boat store was changed into the family sitting room. The Grade II listed status reflects the home's connection to du Maurier and its wider architectural and historical significance. Did Du Maurier predict Brexit?

Turkey blunder 'a potential dementia sign',"You did turn it on, didn't you? Forgetting to turn on the oven for the Christmas turkey could be a sign of early dementia in a loved one, says the NHS's top dementia expert. Prof Alistair Burns said becoming confused in a strange house and forgetting relatives' names may also be early signs of the disease. He said it was important to look for changes in normal behaviour in older family members. There is usually a rise in calls to the Alzheimer's Society in January. The charity said this was because many people had seen relatives at Christmas gatherings and wanted advice on how to broach the subject. Prof Burns, NHS England's national clinical director for dementia and older people's mental health, has drawn up a list of dementia signs: disorientation or confusion when in a new place or new environment forgetting the names of loved ones to the extent that it causes embarrassment forgetting to buy someone's present forgetting to cook things for a big Christmas dinner, forgetting to switch the oven on or cooking things in the wrong order Around 850,000 people have dementia in the UK, and it mainly affects people over 65 - although it can develop earlier. It is estimated that one in three of us will care for someone with dementia at some point in our lives. Prof Burns said: ""Dementia is something that happens slowly so it may slip by unnoticed in people we see regularly. ""That's why the Christmas visit to wider family and friends is an opportunity to spot the early warning signs."" He urged everyone to take time to consider whether someone they know may need help. Prof Burns also said a visit to a relative or neighbour who might be alone could make a huge difference to their mental health, particularly if they were lonely. Broadcaster Fiona Phillips, whose parents both had early-onset dementia, said Christmas was a ""huge benchmark"" in spotting the symptoms. ""I spent every Christmas with my parents,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But one year, ""we got there and I was absolutely staggered - there was no tree up, both of them were very, very stressed"". Ms Phillips, an Alzheimer's Society ambassador, said her mother showed signs of dementia in her 50s. But she noticed a change that Christmas - when her parents bought her a fluffy toy and her brother an orange ladies' jumper. ""We went into a horrible scene,"" she said. ""We knew things weren't right."" Erika Aldridge, from Alzheimer's Society, said: ""It can be difficult to know how to discuss concerns with a loved one, and there is no right or wrong way to approach this. ""Play a board game instead of watching another hour of TV, get up and take the dog for a walk or go for a family ramble instead of snoozing in the chair for an hour.""

The royal, who married the Queen's first cousin, attended a Christmas banquet at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday wearing a blackamoor brooch. Prince Harry's fiancÃ©e, Meghan Markle, who is mixed-race, was also a guest at the lunch. A spokesman said the princess ""is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offence"". Blackamoor figures and sculptures are exotic figures which usually depict African men and were prominent in the 17th and 18th centuries. The brooch is a bust of an African man The brooch, coupled with the fact that Princess Michael will have met Ms Markle at the lunch, has sparked controversy on social media websites. Spokesman Simon Astaire added: ""The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before."" It is understood the princess will not wear the brooch in future. Princess Michael of Kent was born Baroness Marie Christine von Reibnitz in 1945, in the German-populated Sudetenland - now sitting in the Czech Republic. She was born shortly before the end of the World War Two, in which her father served as a major in the Nazi SS.

Warning over UK's 'hidden' homeless,"This video can not be played Alex, who was forced to sleep in a tent, says he thought homelessness was ""never going to happen to me"". More than 9,000 people will wake up on Christmas Day in cars, trains, buses and tents, a charity has warned. Crisis claims the number of so-called ""hidden"" rough sleepers will rise by 47% to 13,400 over the next decade unless ""immediate action"" is taken. Chief executive Jon Sparkes said they were at risk of being ""hidden from help and trapped in horrifying situations"". The government said it was committed to halving rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminating it altogether by 2027. A spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""We are providing over Â£1bn through to 2020 to prevent homelessness and rough sleeping. ""We are also bringing in the Homelessness Reduction Act - the most ambitious legislation in decades that will mean people get the support they need earlier."" Crisis said the 9,100 number of ""hidden"" rough sleepers was in addition to the current estimate of 9,100 rough sleepers across the UK. Its research, carried out by Heriot-Watt university, looked at current and projected levels of homelessness using government figures, academic surveys and cases recorded by local authorities, and found 160,000 households in the UK were experiencing homelessness. People identified as homeless included those rough sleeping, sofa surfing, squatting, living in hostels and forms of temporary accommodation - as well as other forms, including people forced to sleep in cars, tents and night shelters. Paula, who spent three months sleeping in her car, said being a ""hidden"" rough sleeper was a ""terrifying"" experience. ""You got no privacy,"" she said. ""You don't know who's around your car at any given time. ""I was lucky really, because I had neighbours around who knew the circumstances and supported me and helped me with hot water. ""I was able to keep going with college and have a shower there if I needed to,"" she added. And Alex, 36, slept in a tent for four weeks after the break-up of a relationship. ""The experience was quite overpowering,"" he said. ""I kind of just kept it in my mind that I'm not really homeless, it's just a long camping trip."" He adds: ""Everyone walks past homeless people [but] you kind of acknowledge it and think it'll ever happen to me. ""I really didn't want to explain to friends and family that I'm in that area of need"". Crisis will open its doors to 4,500 homeless people across its centres in London, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Newcastle and Coventry over the festive period. Mr Sparkes told BBC News: ""On top of more than 9,000 people rough sleeping, we've got another 9,000 who are 'hidden' rough sleeping. ""We perhaps haven't focused on those people before."" He said people living in tents, cars and buses ""often end up forgotten, hidden from help and trapped in horrifying situations.""

Trump praises latest N Korea sanctions,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and President Trump have exchanged barbs in the past US President Donald Trump has praised the UN Security Council for imposing tough new sanctions on North Korea in response to ballistic missile tests. In a tweet,Mr Trump said the vote proved the world ""wants peace, not death"",external. The US-drafted resolution includes measures to slash North Korea's petrol imports by up to 90%. China and Russia, Pyongyang's main trading partners, voted in favour of the resolution. North Korea is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. ""The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea. The World wants Peace, not Death!"" Mr Trump tweeted. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the sanctions sent an ""unambiguous message to Pyongyang that further defiance will invite further punishments and isolation"". She described North Korea as ""the most tragic example of evil in the modern world"". UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the latest measures against North Korea were a ""vital step"" towards curbing its nuclear weapons programme. He said the international community had shown it was united in its condemnation of the North's ""reckless behaviour"". This video can not be played Nikki Haley said the new sanctions cut oil and petrol imports The Chinese foreign ministry described the situation on the peninsula as ""complex and sensitive"" and called on all sides to ""exercise restraint and make active efforts to ease tensions"". The US said it was seeking a diplomatic solution to the issue and drafted this new set of sanctions: Deliveries of petrol products will be capped at 500,000 barrels a year, and crude oil at four million barrels a year All North Korean nationals working abroad will have to return home within 24 months under the proposals, restricting a vital source of foreign currency There will also be a ban on exports of North Korean goods, such as machinery and electrical equipment Tensions have risen this year over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, which it has pursued despite pressure from world powers.

The UN sanctions came in response toPyongyang's 28 November firing of a ballistic missile, which the US said was its highest yet. Mr Trump has previously threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it launches a nuclear attack. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has described the US president as ""mentally deranged"". This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC Last month, the US unveiled fresh sanctions against North Koreawhich it said were designed to limit the funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The measures targeted North Korean shipping operations and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang. The UN also approved new sanctions following North Korea's nuclear test on 3 September. These measures restricted oil imports and banned textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US has been imposing sanctions on North Korea for more than a decade with little success. In fact, North Korea has said fresh sanctions will only make it accelerate its nuclear programme. It has continued to test nuclear and ballistic missiles despite these recent examples of UN pressure: 30 November 2016:UN targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it had carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 6 August 2017:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile. Analysis by Sophie Long, BBC, Seoul Some analysts believe this new round of sanctions could have a major effect on North Korea's economy and the caps on oil could be devastating for its haulage industry and for people and state-owned enterprises that rely on generators. Others are less confident, pointing out that Chinese fuel exports have already been reduced due to concerns about North Korea's ability to pay for them. It could also take years for the sanctions to have full impact, while there are fears North Korea could be within months of achieving its nuclear ambitions. Even if the latest round of sanctions do have an economic impact, it's not clear if that would push Pyongyang to stop developing nuclear weapons and negotiate.

How do you defend against N Korea?,"This video can not be played Nuclear N Korea: What do we know? North Korea's nuclear weapons programme has progressed faster than predicted, threatening the security of nearby nations â and potentially the United States. The US envoy to the United Nations put it simply: ""Despite our efforts over the last 24 years, the North Korean nuclear programme is more advanced and dangerous than ever."" Analysts tend to agree that the country's leader, Kim Jong-un, is seeking a nuclear deterrent rather than an all-out war - but other nations are not taking chances. So how do you defend against a politically isolated state with nuclear ambitions, when diplomacy, it appears, simply does not work? South Korea is the closest potential target. The other half of the Korean peninsula has a long history of preparing to defend itself from its northern neighbour. The two countries are technically still at war, having never signed a peace treaty when the Korean War ended in 1953. The Thaad system - seen here in testing - is one of several anti-missile defences One key part of its defensive line is the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) - a region 250km (155 mile) long and 4km (2.5 mile) wide that separates the two nations,guarded by thousands of soldiers, lined with barbed wire fences, and filled with landmines. But it is believed that North Korea's People's Army - with more than a million regular soldiers and millions more reserve troops - has drilled extensively on how to invade across the border. And the heavy land border fortifications do nothing, of course, to prevent a missile strike. For a while, it was thought that Thaad - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense - might be South Korea's best counter to a nuclear attack. Thaad, funded by the South's military ally the United States, is designed to shoot down ballistic missiles as they descend in the final phase of a strike. The complex technology was first deployed in May 2017, and has been successfully tested. But the politics of South Korea's relationship with the North means its rollout has not been easy. North Korea and its only ally China both see Thaad as a provocation, and many South Koreans living near the places its was deployed fear it could be seen as a military target. The South's new president, President Moon Jae-in, suspended the rollout of the system in June, saying an environmental impact analysis was needed. But in light of recent nuclear tests, the South's defence ministry has now said it will deploy the four remaining Thaad launchers that had been delivered, in addition to the two already operational. South Korea halts anti-missile Thaad rollout What do we know about North Korea's nuclear site? At its closest point, Japan is just a little over 500km (310 miles) from North Korea - well within striking distance. In August, Pyongyang fired a missile directly over Japan, in what Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called an ""unprecedented"" threat to his country. The close proximity of the two nations means that Japan has only minutes to respond to any launch. During the August missile test, people had aboutthree minutes from receiving the emergency warninguntil the missile flew overhead. Many only learned about the threat later in the day. Reality Check: Three minutes to shelter from a missile North Korea: Does this mean war? In terms of defence options, Japan utilises the Patriot missile system which, like Thaad, is designed to shoot down incoming missiles. But it has a limited operational range, making it effective at defending key locations - and not the entire country. But Japan does not have to worry about land invasion to the same extent North Korea does, and at sea, it has other options at its disposal. Japan, South Korea, the United States are among the countries with the Aegis naval defence system. Aegis is yet another anti-missile system, but unlike Thaad or Patriot defences, it can also be deployed to ships patrolling the seas in the region. A test missile fired by the US on August 29, left, was shot down by the Aegis system similar to the file photo, right Those battleships come equipped with powerful radar which could detect the launch when deployed near the North Korean coast. They are also fitted with guided missiles, and could attempt to shoot down the incoming missile - or share its tracking data with another missile defence system closer to the target. There are a handful of problems with the system, though. Aegis ships need to be deployed in the right place at the right time - and while they have been tested extensively, they have never been used to defend against an actual launch. For years, the best defence for the US was its sheer distance from North Korea - some 5,000km (3,100 miles) to Alaska and almost 9,000km to San Francisco. But rapid advancements mean that distance might no longer be far enough. North Korea's military wants the capability to shrink a high-yield nuclear warhead to fit on an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). In theory, that would allow Pyongyang to strike the United States. This video can not be played See the US anti-missile system in action After its latest test, North Korea claimed it had managed to shrink the warhead, posting photos of what it said was a hydrogen bomb - in keepingwith a Washington Post report from early August,external. That means the US is now reconsidering its missile defences, with President Trump having ordered a review of the entire system. Can the US defend itself against North Korea? North Korea: What are the military options? It already has detection and interception systems. But critics believe that the US system is far from reliable, the BBC's diplomatic correspondentJonathan Marcus wrote in July. In the foreseeable future, only a handful of its interceptor missiles will be available to deal with the potential North Korean threat, he said. And it also has to worry about its overseas territory of Guam - a key military outpost in the Pacific which has been singled out by North Korea as a threat to be ""contained"". That island already has a Thaad system deployed, but state media saysKim Jong-un has already been briefed on strike plans- and is waiting to see the next US actions. North Korea: Does this mean war?

Firefighters tackle London Zoo blaze,"This video can not be played London Zoo 'devastated' by aardvark fire death Staff have been injured and an aardvark and possibly four meerkats killed in a fire at London Zoo. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze at its height in the Animal Adventure section that spread to a shop. One person was taken to hospital and eight were treated at the scene. The zoo said an aardvark called Misha died in the fire and four meerkats were still unaccounted for, presumed dead. The zoo was shut on Saturday but said it would reopen on Sunday. The cause of the fire is not yet known. Photographs posted on social media showed orange flames rising from the building Ten fire engines went to the zoo, which sits in the capital's Regent's Park, shortly after 06:00 GMT and the fire was brought under control about three hours later. Six people were given help at the scene for the effects of smoke inhalation and two for minor injuries, London Ambulance Service said. One person was taken to a north-west London hospital, the service said. Duty staff who live on site were on the scene ""immediately"" and started moving animals to safety, the zoo said. In a statement the zoo said it was ""devastated"" about what had happened. It said: ""Sadly our vets have confirmed the death of our nine-year-old aardvark, Misha. There are also four meerkats still unaccounted for, but we are now presuming these have also died. ""All other animals in the vicinity are being monitored closely by our vets, but early signs suggest they have not been affected. We will continue to monitor them over the coming days. ""We are all naturally devastated by this, but are immensely grateful to the fire brigade, who reacted quickly to the situation to bring the fire under control. "" You might also be interested in: Mum dies after raising Â£40,000 for sons Christmas bid to identify collapsed man 'Exploding beer' disrupts Christmas getaway Adnan Abdul Husein said he saw the blaze from a nearby park when he was out walking his dog, and alerted zoo security. ""It didn't look like smoke just coming out of a chimney - it was quite heavy"", he said. ""As I got closer to the zoo I could see that it was actually inside the zoo so I went over to the security and told them, 'there's flames or there's smoke coming from inside there, do you know anything about it?'. And they obviously didn't have a clue."" London Fire Brigade (LFB) station manager Clive Robinson, who was at the scene, said three-quarters of the cafe and shop had been affected by the fire and half of the roof. He said: ""Firefighters worked hard to bring the fire under control as quickly as possible and to stop it from spreading to neighbouring animal enclosures.""

'World's ugliest pig' caught on camera,"This video can not be played It had been feared the Javan warty pig had become extinct Scientists have captured the first footage in the wild of one of the world's rarest - and ugliest - pigs. The Javan warty pig is under such threat from hunting and habitat loss that conservationists surveying its habitat believed it might already have been driven to extinction. Camera traps have now revealed that small populations survive in Java's increasingly fragmented forests. The team says its aim now is to protect the rare animals' habitat. The survey was led by Dr Johanna Rode-Margono from Chester Zoo, who said she and her colleagues were ""thrilled"" to see that the pigs were still there. Motion-activated camera traps captured the images of the shy, endangered animals The last study of these lowland forested areas was back in 2004 and revealed a ""serious decline"" in the population of the species. ""We were worried that all or most would have disappeared,"" she told BBC News. While these hairy, warty-faced beasts may not be Java's most photogenic residents, Dr Rode-Margono says they fulfil an important role in the forest's ecology - tilling the soil and spreading seeds as they forage. And in Java, Indonesia's most crowded island, they are also emblematic of the burgeoning human pressure on the country's tropical forest. The pigs are losing habitat to deforestation for agricultural and urban development, but are also coming into direct conflict with humans. The animals are considered pests and often hunted because they raid crops. ""Hunting for sport is also a problem,"" says Dr Rode-Margono, ""and the species may be hybridising with European wild boar."" That could result in the species being bred into extinction. Deforestation continues to threaten Indonesia's forests and the wildlife that relies on it.Palm oil plantations, in particular, have been blamed for the clearance of swathes of biodiverse forest.,externalAnd while the scale can be difficult to measure, one study used satellite images to estimate that, between 2000 and 2012, Indonesia lost more than six million hectares, or 60,000 sq km, of primary forest. Deforestation and increased human activity in the rainforest may also be also exacerbating the illegal trade in pet apes.One charity in Java is now employing former hunters in an effort to guard and patrol areas of forest where they are re-releasing rescued animals. Much of the seemingly pristine forest in Java is being targeted by trappers to feed the demand for wild-caught caged birds,which conservationists now say is threatening to drive several species of previously widespread songbirds to extinction. Most lowland forest in Java has been cleared for building and agriculture Out of seven areas the team surveyed - using hidden, motion-activated cameras - only three had Javan warty pigs. ""That means the threat is ongoing and if we don't do anything, more and more populations will disappear,"" said Dr Rode-Margono. ""This is a big red flag."" One wildlife centre in Java has started a captive breeding programme for the Javan warty pigs, and the scientists hope to identify some areas where these animals could be released and protected in the wild. Captive-bred pigs could be released into the wild if the threats to their survival can be tackled ""There is still hope,"" Dr Rode-Margono told BBC News.  ""If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them. ""For me,"" she added, ""they are not ugly - they are beautiful. ""And everything in our ecosystem is connected - every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. ""If something breaks away, something else [could] break away, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen.""

California fire largest in state history,"Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast A deadly wildfire which has destroyed more than 700 homes in California is now the largest blaze in the state's recorded history. The Thomas fire has burned more than 1000sq km - an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined. The blaze broke out in Santa Paula in early December and has moved west towards the coast, one of several major fires in California in recent months. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to bring it under control. Most of California's largest wildfires have been recorded this century. Scientists say the warming climate and spread of buildings into wilderness areas have contributed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Thomas fire slowly eclipsed previous record-setting blazes, finally overtaking the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County, which burned 273,246 acres. It follows a series of deadly fires in the state's wine country in October that burned more than 10,000 homes and killed more than 40 people. The Thomas fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and claimed the life of one firefighter - Cory Iverson, a father of one from San Diego whose wife was expecting another child. Development has encroached into wilderness, contributing to the wildfires State fire agency Cal Fire says the Thomas blaze is now 65% contained and expected to continue to slow. Controlled burns by firefighters may cause some temporary expansion, it said. Seven of California's 10 largest fires on record have occurred since 2000. Two were in the 1970s and the earliest was in 1932 - the Matilija fire which, like the Thomas fire, burned through Ventura County.

Plan to tackle congested A-roads,"The new scheme would pay to fix damage caused by lorries to roads The government is considering a ""pay-per-mile"" scheme for lorries to cover the cost of damage to roads. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed the current HGV levy, used to pay for wear and tear on the road network, was being consulted on. Critics say the current scheme means international drivers using the roads do not have to pay towards upkeep. But the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said it was unfair to target lorries and it needs to see more detail. Mr Grayling denied any plans for a road toll system for other vehicles for the ""foreseeable future"". Driving home for Christmas - 10 things to know about roads Building more roads 'makes traffic worse' 'Highest' amount of traffic on roads Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the minister said it was about creating a ""level playing field"" for British and international hauliers. ""Our hauliers often complain that a continental trucker comes in with a tank full of lower duty diesel, spends several days working in the country, goes away again and pays nothing towards the use of the roads,"" he said. ""We already have a system in place that provides some limited contribution, but we're now consulting the industry."" But a spokesman for the RHA said he was ""worried"" about the announcement. ""Although it's good news that more money is being spent on roads, it's not right to target only lorries with a new tax,"" he said. ""This has to be revenue neutral for lorry firms. If we fail to do this, it will make us less competitive than our European counterparts."" The government is also consulting on a fund for work to A-roads The news came as the government launched a separate consultation to find out which A-roads in England needed cash to bring them up to scratch. The Department for Transport announced funding in the summer to rejuvenate the road network, but is now asking councils to apply for up to Â£100m per road. Priority will go to road widening projects on dual carriageways, improving road safety measure and major junction improvements. About 5,000 miles of A-roads across the country will be eligible for the multi-billion pound funding pot to improve the nation's strategic road network. The consultation will last for 12 weeks, but Mr Grayling said he hoped plans to start development next year and building work to start within three years. ""We've been spending a lot of money recently on the motorways and big dual carriageways,"" he said. ""What we have not been doing is sorting out the next tier down. ""This [consultation] is all about medium-sized towns on those A-roads that have got clogged up centres, that have got lorries waiting at traffic lights, that have got pollution in the centre. ""It's about time we started to build those bypasses, improve those roads, add extra stretches of dual carriageway and focus on the next tier down of roads."" Motorists in the UK drove 324 billion miles in 2016 - up 2.2% on the previous year - but AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said many drivers suffered a ""daily nightmare"" at notorious pinch points. As a result, he said improvements to ease traffic flow were ""very welcome"". RAC director of motoring Steve Gooding said: ""For many businesses an economically important major road is the one that runs right up to the factory gate. ""It will be interesting to see whether the business bodies consider the government's plans to go far enough in designating the roads that matter to their members."" But Bridget Fox, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the government should focus on improving major transport links, rather than overhauling major road networks. She said the Department for Transport should apply a ""fix it first"" strategy to prioritising road maintenance, and improving public transport and cycling routes.

'Christmas miracle' boy's courage award,"Ceylian Bonnet Bocher's mother had him baptised ahead of the operation as doctors feared the worse A boy hailed a ""Christmas miracle"" after surviving surgery to remove an orange-sized tumour from his brain has received a national award for courage. It was feared Ceylian Bonnet Bocher, three, from Leicestershire, would not survive a 10-hour operation on Christmas Eve 2016. However, on Christmas Day he was able to sit up and open his presents. His mother said she had him baptised ahead of the operation as the doctors were doubtful he would pull through. Marina Bonnet Bocher, who nominated her son for the Cancer Research UK award, said: ""I'll never forget [the medical staff] bringing him out of surgery into intensive care. ""They were smiling and so proud. They called Ceylian their 'Christmas miracle'."" Mrs Bonnet Bocher said she noticed her son was not walking properly in November last year and thought he needed new shoes. Ceylian's recovery surprised medical staff following his operation His walking became worse and after a visit to a GP, Ceylian was referred for an MRI scan. ""By then he couldn't even sit up in bed without falling down,"" she said. ""The surgeon told us he'd found the biggest tumour he'd ever seen in a child that age and didn't know if it was even possible to operate. ""We were so scared we got a priest to come and baptise him before the operation at Birmingham Children's Hospital."" Ceylian was diagnosed withEwing sarcoma,external, a rare type of bone and soft tissue cancer. He was able to return home to Ashby de la Zouch in January, before undergoing cycles of chemotherapy which he finished in September. He had also visited the US, in May, to have proton beam therapy. Mrs Bonnet Bocher said: ""He was so brave throughout his treatment and now our energetic boy is back, smiling from morning to evening, cycling and playing football.""

Dozens killed in Philippines storm,"This video can not be played The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island More than 180 people are reported to have been killed as a tropical storm swept through the southern Philippines, with dozens more missing. Storm Tembin brought flash flooding and mudslides to parts of Mindanao island. Two towns badly hit were Tubod and Piagapo, where a number of homes were buried by boulders. Tembin, with winds of up to 80km/h (50 mph), has passed across Mindanao and reached the resort islands of Palawan, and will now move further west. The Philippines suffers regularly from deadly tropical storms, although Mindanao is not often hit. Tembin, known as Vinta in the Philippines, started lashing Mindanao on Friday, with a state of emergency declared in some areas including the Lanao del Norte and Lanao del Sur regions. Regional officials quoted by the Rappler website said there were 127 fatalities in Lanao del Norte, up to 50 in the Zamboanga peninsula and at least 18 in Lanao del Sur. Tubod police officer Gerry Parami told the AFP news agency that there had been at least 19 deaths in the town, which is in Lanao del Norte. The remote village of Dalama was wiped out by flash floods. ""The river rose and most of the homes were swept away. The village is no longer there,"" he said. Who cleans up after hurricanes, earthquakes and war? Economic losses from natural disasters counted He said volunteers were digging through mud to try to recover bodies in the village. Another official told AFP that at least 10 people had died in the town of Piagapo, 10km east of Tubod. ""We've sent rescuers but they're making little progress,"" Saripada Pacasum said. More deaths were reported in the towns of Sibuco and Salug. Rescuers evacuate residents in Davao on Mindanao Power cuts and the loss of communication lines have hampered rescue efforts. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks for disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. ""So the priority yesterday and this morning has really been to check their situation."" Storm Tembin made a second landfall on Balabac island in the Palawan archipelago and is forecast to travel west, south of the Spratly Islands, reaching southern Vietnam in about three days. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens. The region is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 5,000 people and affected millions in 2013.

Man charged with Melbourne car attack,"The car ploughed into Christmas shoppers near Flinders Street railway station A man accused of driving his car into pedestrians in the Australian city of Melbourne has been charged with 18 counts of attempted murder. Former Afghan refugee Saeed Noori, 32, appeared before magistrates on Saturday and was remanded in custody. Police have said they do not believe the attack terrorism related and that Mr Noori has mental health issues. Twelve people are still being treated in hospital after Thursday's incident in Flinders Street. Three are in a critical condition. Nine of the injured are foreign nationals from countries including South Korea, Ireland, Venezuela, China, India and Italy. The broadcaster ABC said Mr Noori became emotional in court, putting his head in his hands when he saw his mother crying ahead of the brief hearing. The magistrate called for a psychological report. Mr Noori is scheduled to be back in court on Wednesday. There was no application for bail. Melbourne police charged Mr Noori after he was released from hospital on Friday and have called the incident a ""deliberate attack"". In addition to the attempted murder charges, he also faces one count of conduct endangering life. Police have found no link between Mr Noori and any terrorist group. Islamist militants have used vehicles to attack people in Europe and the United States in recent years. Security has been stepped up around Melbourne. Police said there would be a ""highly visible"" presence of officers at the fourth Ashes Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground between Australia and England, which starts on Tuesday.

Ex-marine held over US 'terror plot',"The 25-year-old had unknowingly been communicating with undercover FBI agents A former marine has been arrested by the FBI on suspicion of planning a terror attack in San Francisco over Christmas. Everitt Aaron Jameson, 25, was held after allegedly discussing the plot with undercover FBI agents. Criminal documents allege he planned to target the Pier 39 area, popular with tourists in the city. Authorities say firearms, a will and a letter claiming the attack were found during a search of his home. The FBI criminal complaint says that the Muslim convert's letter made reference to Donald Trump's decision to designate Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Read the complaint in full,external They say Mr Jameson came to their attention in September after expressing ""radical jihadi beliefs"" and support of so-called Islamic State through social media use. The FBI complaint said he had expressed his support of attacks, including the October 31 truck attack in New York. Mr Jameson allegedly named the San Francisco's Pier 39 as a target, an area popular for its restaurants, shops and resident sea lions, because ""he had been there before and knew that it was a heavily crowded area"". The area is an attraction because of the sea lions that frequent Pier 39's famous K-Dock Investigators allege Mr Jameson had expressed a will to use explosives in the attack to ""tunnel"" or ""funnel"" people into a smaller area to inflict casualties. The FBI says he sought materials that could be made into a pipe bomb from an agent. This video can not be played Jameson's father: ""It's just hard to fathom right now"" But on 18 December Mr Jameson apparently hesitated, telling an agent: ""I don't think I can do this after all. I've reconsidered."" A search warrant for his home was issued, where a number of firearms and related material was found. He has been charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. Mr Jameson completed basic recruitment training for the US Marine Corps in 2009, but was reportedly discharged for not disclosing details of his asthma.

Bitcoin slump sees trades suspended,"Bitcoin plunged on Friday, extending a fall that saw the crypto-currency lose almost a third of its value from a record of nearly $20,000 (Â£15,000). The crypto-currency's price dipped below $11,000 on Friday, according to the Coindesk exchange website,,externalbefore recovering to above $13,000. Amid the swings, three Bitcoin-related exchanges suspended certain trades. Bitcoin has had a blistering trip over the past 12 months. Its price at the start of the year was about $1,000. It has skyrocketed since - more than doubling in value since November -  drawing interest from major firms as well as private investors. But since Sunday Bitcoin has been on a losing streak, falling back to where it was at the start of December. Analysts said investors should be prepared for such rapid changes, which have characterised the asset from its start. ""This is exactly how this asset trades and has done since the beginning,"" said Nick Colas, co-founder of New York-based DataTrek Research. ""It has a lot of volatility and it will for the foreseeable future."" This week's plunge led to a flood of trades that swamped one of Bitcoin's major exchanges, Coinbase, on Friday. A technical slowdown prompted the firm tohalt buying and selling,externaltwice. Is Asia driving the Bitcoin craze? What is Bitcoin? 'Be ready to lose your money' The CME and CBOE exchanges in the US also temporarily suspended trading of certain Bitcoin futures contracts, which allow investors to bet on where they expect the price of Bitcoin to be at certain points in the future. The exchanges have automatic brakes that apply once a commodity or asset has moved by a certain amount - as happened in this case. The market remains driven by sentiment, according to Charles Hayter, founder and chief executive of industry website Cryptocompare. ""A manic upward swing led by the herd will be followed by a downturn as the emotional sentiment changes,"" he said. Some traders would have been cashing in on the spectacular gains made over the year, he added. Some argue the crypto-currency craze is just a lot of hot air (yes, we know it is probably helium) Concerns about the infrastructure behind crypto-assets may also be spooking investors, said Nick Colas, himself a Bitcoin trader. In recent weeks,markets have been rattled by hacksandallegations of insider trading. He attributes some of this week's slump to the launch of a new crypto-asset that came earlier than planned. The surprise temporary shutdown of Coinbase on Friday was the kind of thing that could erode investor confidence, he argued. ""It is not OK to just take trading offline randomly through the day,"" he said. ""The robustness of that system is just as important to their confidence... as the price of crypto-currencies themselves."" A spokesman for Coinbase said the firm was working around the clock to ensure smooth trading. Friday's suspensions lasted for about two hours in total. ""We're doing everything within our power,"" the spokesman said. A digital asset, Bitcoin is not backed by any governments. It is created through a complex process known as ""mining"", and then monitored by a network of computers across the world. There is a steady stream of about 3,600 new Bitcoins a day, with more than 16.5 million now in circulation. Supply is expected to peak at about 21 million. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undoing transactions. Regulators around the world have stepped up their warnings about its provenance as an investment. One of this week's most striking comments came from Denmark's central bank governor, who called it a ""deadly"" gamble. Earlier this month, the head of one of the UK's leading financial regulators warned people to be ready to ""lose all their money"" if they invested in Bitcoin. Andrew Bailey, head of the Financial Conduct Authority, told the BBC that neither central banks nor the government stood behind the ""currency"" and therefore it was not a secure investment. Despite the risk to individuals, US authorities have said they do not think it is a big enough part of financial markets to be a threat to broader economic stability.

Critics say the current scheme means international drivers using the roads do not have to pay towards upkeep.

Priority will go to road widening projects on dual carriageways, improving road safety measure and major junction improvements. About 5,000 miles of A-roads across the country will be eligible for the multi-billion pound funding pot to improve the nation's strategic road network.

"I'm more than 'Madame Brexit' - MayThe PM insists she is ""in it for the long-term"" and shrugs off claims she has had a bad year.10h10 hours agoUK Politics","Theresa May has insisted she is more than ""Madame Brexit,"" having been given the title by Poland's prime minister. She said there were ""other things"" she wanted to achieve apart from delivering a successful exit from the EU - such as improvements to education and training. And she insisted she was ""in it for the long-term"", shrugging off suggestions she had had a bad year. The prime minister was speaking to reporters during a visit to UK troops stationed in Cyprus. May seeks to reassure Polish residents 'No 10 knew' of Green claims in 2016 Mrs May gained her new nickname on Thursday, after holding talks in Warsaw with Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Mr Morawiecki told their joint press conference: ""As Madame Brexit has said, Brexit is Brexit."" Mrs May said she had been amused by the comment. ""You might have noticed I smiled when I heard the translation of Mrs Brexit or Madame Brexit,"" she told reporters. ""Look, I am going to deliver on Brexit. That is undoubtedly the case, but I am doing other things as well. If you look at the changes we are making on skills, education and training for example. ""The industrial strategy which actually was talked about with the Poles as wellâ¦ and global Britain."" She said she had completed a number of foreign trips in the run up to Christmas ""promoting the UK both in trading terms, but also our role in defence and security"". Asked if she would characterise 2017 - a year which saw her lose her Commons majority in a snap election she had called - as one of the most difficult years of her career, Mrs May highlighted her recent breakthrough in Brexit talks. ""If you look at what's happened over the past couple of months we have made sufficient progress on the Brexit negotiations, we have had a good Budget that is building a Britain that is fit for the future. ""What we've put into the Budget in terms of funding for the health service but also housing is really important for the future of this country. ""We have had the industrial strategy, which I see as an absolutely crucial plan and part of actually ensuring that our economy does meet the needs of the future and is providing the jobs of the future for the people in the UK."" She said she was ""optimistic"" about making progress on defence and security, as well as trade, ""as we go into phase two of Brexit negotiations"". ""What we want to achieve is in the interests of the EU27 as well as ours,"" she added.

Government cash aims to improve A-roads,"The new scheme would pay to fix damage caused by lorries to roads The government is considering a ""pay-per-mile"" scheme for lorries to cover the cost of damage to roads. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed the current HGV levy, used to pay for wear and tear on the road network, was being consulted on. Critics say the current scheme means international drivers using the roads do not have to pay towards upkeep. But the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said it was unfair to target lorries and it needs to see more detail. Mr Grayling denied any plans for a road toll system for other vehicles for the ""foreseeable future"". Driving home for Christmas - 10 things to know about roads Building more roads 'makes traffic worse' 'Highest' amount of traffic on roads Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the minister said it was about creating a ""level playing field"" for British and international hauliers. ""Our hauliers often complain that a continental trucker comes in with a tank full of lower duty diesel, spends several days working in the country, goes away again and pays nothing towards the use of the roads,"" he said. ""We already have a system in place that provides some limited contribution, but we're now consulting the industry."" But a spokesman for the RHA said he was ""worried"" about the announcement. ""Although it's good news that more money is being spent on roads, it's not right to target only lorries with a new tax,"" he said. ""This has to be revenue neutral for lorry firms. If we fail to do this, it will make us less competitive than our European counterparts."" The government is also consulting on a fund for work to A-roads The news came as the government launched a separate consultation to find out which A-roads in England needed cash to bring them up to scratch. The Department for Transport announced funding in the summer to rejuvenate the road network, but is now asking councils to apply for up to Â£100m per road. Priority will go to road widening projects on dual carriageways, improving road safety measure and major junction improvements. About 5,000 miles of A-roads across the country will be eligible for the multi-billion pound funding pot to improve the nation's strategic road network. The consultation will last for 12 weeks, but Mr Grayling said he hoped plans to start development next year and building work to start within three years. ""We've been spending a lot of money recently on the motorways and big dual carriageways,"" he said. ""What we have not been doing is sorting out the next tier down. ""This [consultation] is all about medium-sized towns on those A-roads that have got clogged up centres, that have got lorries waiting at traffic lights, that have got pollution in the centre. ""It's about time we started to build those bypasses, improve those roads, add extra stretches of dual carriageway and focus on the next tier down of roads."" Motorists in the UK drove 324 billion miles in 2016 - up 2.2% on the previous year - but AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said many drivers suffered a ""daily nightmare"" at notorious pinch points. As a result, he said improvements to ease traffic flow were ""very welcome"". RAC director of motoring Steve Gooding said: ""For many businesses an economically important major road is the one that runs right up to the factory gate. ""It will be interesting to see whether the business bodies consider the government's plans to go far enough in designating the roads that matter to their members."" But Bridget Fox, of the Campaign for Better Transport, said the government should focus on improving major transport links, rather than overhauling major road networks. She said the Department for Transport should apply a ""fix it first"" strategy to prioritising road maintenance, and improving public transport and cycling routes.

'World's ugliest pig' caught on cameraConservationists capture the first footage in the wild of the endangered Javan warty pig5h5 hours agoScience & Environment,"This video can not be played It had been feared the Javan warty pig had become extinct Scientists have captured the first footage in the wild of one of the world's rarest - and ugliest - pigs. The Javan warty pig is under such threat from hunting and habitat loss that conservationists surveying its habitat believed it might already have been driven to extinction. Camera traps have now revealed that small populations survive in Java's increasingly fragmented forests. The team says its aim now is to protect the rare animals' habitat. The survey was led by Dr Johanna Rode-Margono from Chester Zoo, who said she and her colleagues were ""thrilled"" to see that the pigs were still there. Motion-activated camera traps captured the images of the shy, endangered animals The last study of these lowland forested areas was back in 2004 and revealed a ""serious decline"" in the population of the species. ""We were worried that all or most would have disappeared,"" she told BBC News. While these hairy, warty-faced beasts may not be Java's most photogenic residents, Dr Rode-Margono says they fulfil an important role in the forest's ecology - tilling the soil and spreading seeds as they forage. And in Java, Indonesia's most crowded island, they are also emblematic of the burgeoning human pressure on the country's tropical forest. The pigs are losing habitat to deforestation for agricultural and urban development, but are also coming into direct conflict with humans. The animals are considered pests and often hunted because they raid crops. ""Hunting for sport is also a problem,"" says Dr Rode-Margono, ""and the species may be hybridising with European wild boar."" That could result in the species being bred into extinction. Deforestation continues to threaten Indonesia's forests and the wildlife that relies on it.Palm oil plantations, in particular, have been blamed for the clearance of swathes of biodiverse forest.,externalAnd while the scale can be difficult to measure, one study used satellite images to estimate that, between 2000 and 2012, Indonesia lost more than six million hectares, or 60,000 sq km, of primary forest. Deforestation and increased human activity in the rainforest may also be also exacerbating the illegal trade in pet apes.One charity in Java is now employing former hunters in an effort to guard and patrol areas of forest where they are re-releasing rescued animals. Much of the seemingly pristine forest in Java is being targeted by trappers to feed the demand for wild-caught caged birds,which conservationists now say is threatening to drive several species of previously widespread songbirds to extinction. Most lowland forest in Java has been cleared for building and agriculture Out of seven areas the team surveyed - using hidden, motion-activated cameras - only three had Javan warty pigs. ""That means the threat is ongoing and if we don't do anything, more and more populations will disappear,"" said Dr Rode-Margono. ""This is a big red flag."" One wildlife centre in Java has started a captive breeding programme for the Javan warty pigs, and the scientists hope to identify some areas where these animals could be released and protected in the wild. Captive-bred pigs could be released into the wild if the threats to their survival can be tackled ""There is still hope,"" Dr Rode-Margono told BBC News.  ""If we can manage to design some effective conservation projects, maybe we can keep them. ""For me,"" she added, ""they are not ugly - they are beautiful. ""And everything in our ecosystem is connected - every tree, every plant, every animal. They depend on each other. ""If something breaks away, something else [could] break away, and that's a chain reaction where we can't foresee what will happen.""

UN slaps fresh sanctions on North Korea,"This video can not be played Nikki Haley said the new sanctions cut oil and petrol imports The United Nations Security Council has voted unanimously to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea in response to its recent ballistic missile tests. The US-drafted resolution includes measures to reduce the nation's petrol imports by up to 90%. China and Russia, North Korea's main trading partners, voted in favour of the resolution. The country is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Washington has been imposing sanctions on Pyongyang since 2008, freezing the assets of individuals and companies linked to its nuclear programme and banning the export of goods and services to the country. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the sanctions sent an ""unambiguous message to Pyongyang that further defiance will invite further punishments and isolation"". US President Donald Trump welcomed the resolution. He tweeted the world wanted ""peace, not death"". Chinese envoy Wu Haitao said the vote ""reflects the unanimous position of the international community"" on the issue of North Korea's weapons programme. The Chinese foreign ministry described the situation on the peninsula as ""complex and sensitive"" and called on all sides to ""exercise restraint and make active efforts to ease tensions"".

Tensions have risen this year over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes, which it has pursued despite pressure from world powers to stop. The Trump administration says it is seeking a diplomatic solution to the issue, and drafted this new set of sanctions: Deliveries of petrol products will be capped at 500,000 barrels a year, and crude oil at 4 million barrels a year All North Korean nationals working abroad will have to return home within 24 months under the proposals, restricting a vital source of foreign currency There will also be a ban on exports of North Korean goods, such as machinery and electrical equipment Analysis by Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York This is the tenth Security Council resolution imposing sanctions on North Korea. None yet has convinced Kim Jong-un to abandon his nuclear programme, but diplomats hope this resolution will bite hard enough to change the country's path, or at the very least, restrict its ability to carry out additional nuclear and missile tests. These strong new sanctions, passed with China's support, show the growing concern of the international community to the threat posed by Kim Jong-un. President Trump specifically asked President Xi to cut oil to North Korea, believing it would be a pivotal step. According to the US, North Korea imported 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum in 2016. This resolution now caps North Korea's supply to 500,000 barrels a year - a nearly 90% cut to a vital lifeline for Pyongyang. Last month, the US unveiled fresh sanctions against North Korea which it said were designed to limit the funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC The measures targeted North Korean shipping operations and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang. The UN also approved new sanctions following North Korea's nuclear test on 3 September. These measures restricted oil imports and banned textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US has been imposing sanctions on North Korea for more than a decade with little success. In fact, North Korea has said fresh sanctions will only make it accelerate its nuclear programme. It has continued to test nuclear and ballistic missiles despite these recent examples of UN pressure: 30 November 2016:UN targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it had carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 6 August 2017:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile US slaps fresh sanctions on North Korea Trump: 'Isolate the murderous regime' Video, 00:01:07Trump: 'Isolate the murderous regime' China banks fear North Korea sanctions Trump ramps up N Korea sanctions How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme?

"Amazon sorry for 'threats' to customerAmazon has apologised to a customer, who believed he was sent coded death threats by an employee.9h9 hours agoUK","Amazon has apologised to a customer who was emailed what he felt were ""coded death threats"" by a call centre worker. Michael Jacobson received five book recommendations including Death, Follow You Home and Suicide's An Option,he told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours. ""We have zero tolerance for any misuse of customer data and have apologised to the customer,"" Amazon, which offered Mr Jacobson a Â£50 goodwill gesture, said. ""The individual involved no longer works for Amazon,"" it told the BBC. Mr Jacobson, a former special constable in London, first contacted Amazon's help centre after experiencing delivery issues with a package he had ordered in October. Mr Jacobson was sent book recommendations including Death, Follow You Home and Death Made Me He told You and Yours: ""Later that afternoon I checked my emails, and I'd received five, all from Amazon."" ""They were all ostensibly book recommendations but the titles were pretty ominous and threatening, and I was pretty taken aback and I joked with my girlfriend, who I was with at the time, about it being a death threat."" He added: ""The more I looked into it, I realised that they had actually been sent manually by an employee at Amazon rather than via an algorithm."" The books were Death, Follow You Home, The Denial of Death, Death Made Me, and Suicide's An Option. Mr Jacobson suspected the recommendations had been sent by an individual, which made him feel anxious about his safety. ""I was concerned, because as soon as I realised that this had been sent by an individual rather than by a computer, it meant an Amazon employee had access to my personal information."" After getting in touch with Amazon to report the issue, they investigated and found the book recommendations had been sent by a then employee in India. In an email to Mr Jacobson, Amazon said: ""On this occasion, an isolated individual was using the 'share page' function on our site to send you the emails in question. ""We are taking this matter very seriously,"" the company added, saying also that ""corrective actions have been taken internally both in relation to the agent who instigated the emails, and subsequent service failures"". Despite the investigation by Amazon, Mr Jacobson, who felt intimidated by the emails, says he feels the matter has not been handled well. ""At no point did (Amazon) say, we're confident you're not in any danger, this individual is thousands of miles away,"" he said. ""They told me none of that, which I was not happy about.""

Ed Sheeran is number one for Christmas,"This video can not be played Sheeran said he felt ""very proud and happy"" in a video message Ed Sheeran has beaten off competition from Eminem - and himself - to land his first UK Christmas number one single. Perfect - which he released in three separate versions in a bid to clinch the Christmas crown - had faced a challenge from Eminem's River, on which Sheeran provides guest vocals. But the rapper ended in second place, while Wham's Last Christmas came third. In a video message,external, the British singer said securing the Christmas top spot was ""an actual dream come true"". The video for Perfect riffs on Wham's classic Last Christmas clip ""I'm very proud and happy,"" he said. ""Thank you so much and have a very merry Christmas, happy holidays and a happy new year."" Sheeran's domination of the Christmas chart was all but assured after he released a new version of his doe-eyed ballad with Beyonce. That version drove most of his sales - though chart rules mean Beyonce is denied a credit on the Christmas number one, with Sheeran's original counted as the lead track. Eminem's River took an early lead on streaming services but faltered as the week went on. Fans had hoped to send Last Christmas to number one to mark the first anniversary of George Michael's death. Despite support from ITV's This Morning and Michael's ex-bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, however, the song failed to beat its original chart position of number two. Back in 1984, it was denied the top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? charity single. As has become tradition, yuletide standards by Mariah Carey and The Pogues have returned to the Top 40 off the back of huge streaming figures. There are 16 Christmas songs in the Top 40, among them such classics as Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree by Brenda Lee and Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney. The presence of lesser-known tracks, like Ariana Grande's Santa Tell Me and Elton John's Step Into Christmas, can be explained by their prominent placing in Spotify'sChristmas is Coming,externalplaylist. ""By and large, the most popular ones are the ones featured on the front page of Spotify,"" chart analyst James Masterton told the BBC.

Michidma lives with her family in Khentii province, the birthplace of Genghis Khan, a day's drive east of the Mongolian capital Ulan Bator. Her dream is to race in the Naadam Festival, a competition showcasing nomadic skills and traditions, above all horsemanship. Sometimes girls are scared of riding fast horses, they don't hold on well and fall off. That is why they are not always chosen to race in the Naadam Festival. Michidma has just failed to qualify for the competition, losing out to a boy. But it hasn't stopped her dreaming. When I grow up I want to have a baby girl and teach her how to ride horses really fast. I want to train her so she will win the Naadam race. That is my dream. Mongolia's famous Naadam Festival is held annually, marking the anniversary of independence from China in 1921. Traditionally only men were allowed to take part, but these days girls and women compete in horse racing and archery. A six-year-old girl rider at the Naadam Festival Because they are light, girls and boys as young as five are picked as jockeys, riding in races up to 30 kilometres (19 miles) long.For many families it is a matter of pride, despite some children riding without saddles, safety equipment or insurance. I'm very lucky, I have a very strong support system around me. Ever since I was a little girl I had parents who were very supportive of my dreams. Nominjin is a singer and social entrepreneur and lives in Ulan Bator. She gained fame as a teen pop star and now performs in Mongolia and abroad. She also runs a website teaching English and owns a vegan restaurant in the capital.She comes from a relatively privileged background. Her mother is an academic and for many years raised her on her own before marrying Nominjin's American stepfather. I was raised by extremely strong women, my late grandmother and mother. The values they instilled in me are to always know my self-worth, to treat people with respect and to command respect. Nominjin leads quite a nomadic life and has spent time in a number of different countries, including India and Russia. Exposure to different cultures has shaped many of her beliefs. Living in India as a teenager, she became interested in spiritual practices and vegetarianism. When she was just 18 she opened a vegan restaurant in Ulan Bator, a rarity in a country where meat is a staple of the national diet. When I was 13 I took a vow of non-violence which meant not consuming any animal products. Being multilingual, Nominjin believes learning a new language can open doors and create opportunities; that's why she runs an online English language learning programme. I believe everyone should have access to a healthy lifestyle and affordable education. After the collapse of communism in Mongolia in the early 1990s the education sector was hit hard. Without Soviet support the newly established Mongolian government struggled to keep free education running. Fewer children went to school and more dropped out altogether. Source: UNDP But since the early 2000s, the government has built more rural classrooms and libraries and created a modern curriculum, encouraging more children to stay in school longer. The government hopes that better access to education will help bring down the high number of teenage pregnancies. Source: UNFPA About a third of the population lives in rural, often remote areas, making access to reproductive healthcare a challenge. UN figures suggest there's a lack of access to contraceptives, a situation which actually worsened between 2003 and 2013. One factor may be the prevailing tradition and culture which cherishes female fertility. Another may be a government drive to encourage people to have more children in what is the world's most sparsely populated country. I like living in the countryside. The air is clean and life is healthier here. Every morning I milk the cows at 5 am. I also help my mother prepare food and play with my brothers. Khaliunaa lives in Bahnor, a settlement in Khentii, one of 21 provinces in Mongolia. Her parents are livestock herders. There is no hot water, gas or electricity and life can be harsh in winter. Some families use solar panels and generators to produce power for a few hours a day. But even in these remote areas people increasingly have access to the internet, with satellite dishes giving the traditional yurts a contemporary look. I use the internet to find information but I also like to check out my friends' photos and share mine with them. I love singing, but I dream of becoming a flight attendant so I can travel around the world, see developed countries and find out why they call Mongolia poor! Almost a third of Mongolia's labour force are livestock herders like Khaliunaa's family. Meat is one of country's key exports alongside raw materials like wool and leather. Until recently someone like Khaliunaa would have followed in her parents' footsteps. But access to education and the internet is changing the outlook of young women and opening up new possibilities. I don't believe that being a woman has made doing business difficult for me. I think in Mongolia women work harder than men and contribute more to the household economy. Bouya Mandarkh runs a joint business with her husband,  importing lorry parts from China. She studied in China and her knowledge of the language has proved invaluable. She is part of a growing number of businesswomen in Mongolia. A 2014 World Bank report suggests that women now own, or part-own almost 40% of Mongolian firms, but gender pay inequality is still a big problem. Bouya once ran an election campaign for her mother who stood for parliament, and that opened her eyes to the struggles of working class women. There is a huge economic gap in Mongolia. We see young girls from the countryside come to Ulan Bator and work in low wage jobs. If I had political power my priority would be to help single mothers and their children. These mothers need help to feed their kids and give them an education. City girl on Weekdays Country girl on weekends There may be more and more women like Bouya in Mongolia, but as in most parts of the world, women are paid less than men for doing the same job. They also tend to take on a bigger share of household chores. National Statistics Office of Mongolia In politics women also still lag behind. Mongolia ranks 114th out of 193 countries for female representation in parliament. At the end of the Soviet era women held almost a quarter of seats but the numbers plummeted after the collapse of communism. Things have since improved, with women winning 13 seats out of 76 at the last election. Inter-parliamentary Union Built with Shorthand"
Ed Sheeran is number one for ChristmasThe British singer tops the festive chart with Perfect after holding off a challenge - from himself.6h6 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Sheeran said he felt ""very proud and happy"" in a video message Ed Sheeran has beaten off competition from Eminem - and himself - to land his first UK Christmas number one single. Perfect - which he released in three separate versions in a bid to clinch the Christmas crown - had faced a challenge from Eminem's River, on which Sheeran provides guest vocals. But the rapper ended in second place, while Wham's Last Christmas came third. In a video message,external, the British singer said securing the Christmas top spot was ""an actual dream come true"". The video for Perfect riffs on Wham's classic Last Christmas clip ""I'm very proud and happy,"" he said. ""Thank you so much and have a very merry Christmas, happy holidays and a happy new year."" Sheeran's domination of the Christmas chart was all but assured after he released a new version of his doe-eyed ballad with Beyonce. That version drove most of his sales - though chart rules mean Beyonce is denied a credit on the Christmas number one, with Sheeran's original counted as the lead track. Eminem's River took an early lead on streaming services but faltered as the week went on. Fans had hoped to send Last Christmas to number one to mark the first anniversary of George Michael's death. Despite support from ITV's This Morning and Michael's ex-bandmate Andrew Ridgeley, however, the song failed to beat its original chart position of number two. Back in 1984, it was denied the top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas? charity single. As has become tradition, yuletide standards by Mariah Carey and The Pogues have returned to the Top 40 off the back of huge streaming figures. There are 16 Christmas songs in the Top 40, among them such classics as Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree by Brenda Lee and Wonderful Christmastime by Sir Paul McCartney. The presence of lesser-known tracks, like Ariana Grande's Santa Tell Me and Elton John's Step Into Christmas, can be explained by their prominent placing in Spotify'sChristmas is Coming,externalplaylist. ""By and large, the most popular ones are the ones featured on the front page of Spotify,"" chart analyst James Masterton told the BBC. ""It exposes the amount of influence the application has over the singles market."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Airline operator BMI tweeted that its flight BM1822 from Frankfurt was the plane affected. ""All 22 passengers and three crew aboard the Embraer 145 jet disembarked safely with no reported injuries. Emergency services attended as a precaution,"" the airline spokesman said. The Civil Aviation Authority says the delays at Bristol Airport would almost certainly fall into the category of""exceptional circumstances"",external- ones which are outside the control of the airlines - so passengers would not be able to claim compensation for the delays or cancellations. But a CAA spokesman said there is a duty on the airlines to provide reasonable ""care and assistance"" to passengers unable to travel. This could include phone calls, meals, food and drink, or overnight hotel accommodation with transport there and back to the airport. The airport said the runway would remain closed while investigations begin, the plane is towed away and debris cleared. ""We're unable to confirm a time that the runway will reopen at this time,"" a spokesman said. ""While it is too early to speculate about the cause of the incident, we are confident that it was not related to the low visibility conditions currently being experienced."" The airport said additional staff were being brought in to assist passengers. It is not yet known when the runway will re-open Passengers were told at 12:30 GMT that all flights inbound and outbound were suspended due to ""an incident"", although they were not initially told the nature of it. Rumours soon started about a plane coming off a runway, which was later confirmed by airport staff - who stressed no-one was hurt. People are staying calm in the terminal, although those who have had flights cancelled at this busy time are now having to decide whether to get alternative flights out today or tomorrow, or give up their plans. Dave Joyce, who was due to fly to Javea in Spain with his family, said his plane was diverted away from the airport. The 53-year-old finance worker said: ""Nothing's moving at the minute and we haven't had any information at all. ""People keep coming but nobody's leaving, so it's all getting pretty crowded just now. ""We've got seats in a restaurant, so we're OK, but my wife's mother is in a wheelchair. ""A great start to the Christmas break... Javea seems a long way away now."" Bristol Airport said more than 190,000 passengers were due to use the airport between 22 December and 1 January - a 5% increase on the same period last year.
