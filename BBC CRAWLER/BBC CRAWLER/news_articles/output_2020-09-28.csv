Trump taxes are 'national security issue' - Pelosi,"This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" The top-ranked Democrat in Washington has called President Donald Trump's alleged tax avoidance a question of ""national security"". Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, asked whether Mr Trump owed money to foreign interests, following an article on his financial records by the New York Times. It alleges Mr Trump paid only $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax in both 2016 and 2017. Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"". Speaking on NBC, Ms Pelosi said the report showed that ""this president appears to have over $400m in debt"". ""To whom? Different countries? What is the leverage they have?"" she asked, adding: ""So for me, this is a national security question."" ""The fact that you could have a sitting president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars that he's personally guaranteed to lenders, and we don't know who these lenders are,"" she said, and suggested that Mr Trump may be indebted to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""What does Putin have on the president politically? Personally? Financially?"" Do voters care about Trump taxes? Trump's taxes: What you need to know Can Donald Trump release his tax returns? According to the explosive report in the New York Times - which saysit obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades,external- Mr Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. It does not suggest Mr Trump received any previously unknown income from Russia, though it said that the president had earned some money from foreign sources. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says. In a tweet on Monday, the president accused the media of bringing up his taxes and ""other nonsense with illegally obtained information & only bad intent"". He said he had ""paid many millions of dollars in taxes"" but received tax credits as well. Responding to the accusations of losses, Mr Trump added he had ""very little debt"" compared to the value of his assets. Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The New York Times said the information scrutinised in its report was ""provided by sources with legal access to it"". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and weeks before the 3 November election. The New York Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. Trump v Obama: Who's made the economy fly? How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, ""largely because he reported losing much more money than he made"". The newspaper also claims that ""most"" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - ""report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year"". The report also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from ""lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour"" from the president. He is alleged to have made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Trump Organization also received money ""from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics"", according to the New York Times. Licensing deals allegedly netted Mr Trump $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The report says there is evidence that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income in 2017 by paying $747,622 in consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. He is also reported to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on his television show, The Apprentice. Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics,the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018,external, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization has rejected the New York Times' allegations, saying ""most"" of the facts are inaccurate Mr Trump and the Trump Organization denied the allegations in the report, but the president's critics condemned his tax arrangements. Ms Pelosi described the alleged tax avoidance as an insult to America's working families, as well as raising the national security question. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Mr Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.

NHS faces pandemic 'triple whammy' this winter,"The NHS is facing a ""triple whammy"" of rising Covid-19 cases, a major backlog in treatment and reduced capacity due to infection-control measures, according to health bosses. The NHS Confederation report on the English NHS said more investment was desperately needed. The NHS bosses also called on ministers to be ""honest and realistic"" about waiting lists for treatment. It comes despite the government promising an extra Â£3bn this winter. That money - announced over the summer - was intended to: help hospitals cope with the extra-infection control measures required pay for patients to be treated privately for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements But hospitals are still performing only half the number of routine operations they normally would. Two million patients have already waited longer than 18 weeks for treatment, the highest number since records began, in 2007. And services in other areas, such as cancer care, are running at about three-quarters capacity. Of the more than 250 bosses who responded to the confederation's survey: fewer than one in 10 said the current level of funding allowed them to deliver safe and effective care nearly nine in 10 said a lack of funding would be a significant barrier to achieving waiting-time targets for everything from mental-health care to cancer treatment and routine operations SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? NHS Confederation  chief executive Danny Mortimer said a sustainable plan had to be found for the NHS. ""No-one can be in any doubt that the road to recovery for the NHS and social-care services will be long,"" he said. ""Despite dire predictions that it would not be able to cope, the NHS has not only managed a huge wave of Covid patients but also continued to treat millions not infected with the virus. ""We have learned much and are in a better position to manage the virus than first time round, despite still not having an effective test-and-trace system."" Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, called the report ""deeply concerning"".

Water-saving loos leaking billions of litres,"Dual flush toilets allow the option of a large or small flush Billions of litres of water are being wasted every week because of an innovation intended to cut water use. About 400 million litres (88 million gallons) of water are estimated to leak from UK toilets every day. But much of this can be blamed on dual-flush toilets, designed to save water, the BBC has learned. One water company says dual-flush toilets are now wasting more water than they save due to a combination of leaky mechanisms and confusing flush buttons. Dual-flush toilets allow the option of a small or large flush - typically four or six litres - to only use the water necessary for urine or faeces. Water-saving organisation Waterwise estimates that between 5% and 8% of toilets are leaking and says most of these are dual flush. England's future water supplies at 'serious risk' London's leakiest streets revealed Andrew Tucker, water efficiency manager at Thames Water, the UK's largest water and sewerage company, says the problem is getting worse as bathrooms are done up. ""Because we've got so many [loos] that continuously flow all through the day, collectively that water loss is now exceeding the amount of water they should be saving nationally,"" he said. ""The volume of water loss is getting bigger every day as more people refurbish and retrofit their older toilets and as we build more homes, so we're actually adding a problem."" The 400 million litres (88 million gallons) of water lost daily from loos is enough to supply 2.8 million people - the populations of Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast, Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool and Bristol combined. Rising demand for water harms the natural environment and has been strongly linked to rivers running dry. Most dual-flush toilets use a drop valve system (right) rather than a siphon (left) Most dual-flush toilets use a drop valve system, which was allowed onto the UK market back in 2001 due to a change in regulations. The Bathroom Manufacturers Association (BMA) admits the drop valve system is more prone to leakage than the traditional siphon if not maintained. The drop valve, which opens for a flush, sits underwater at the bottom of the cistern. Debris  - like porcelain, grit or calcium - easily catches in the valve causing leaks which can then run constantly. The siphon, on the other hand, works when the flush handle forces a volume of water over a lip down into a tube linked to the pan. Water's only way out is above the water line, making leakage very rare. A leak can be silent but there may be a small ripple at the back of the bowl. Some water companies suggest wiping the back of the bowl dry 30 minutes after a flush and placing a square of toilet paper there overnight - if it is wet or torn in the morning there is a leak. Leak strips can be placed in a toilet bowl or food colouring can be put in the cistern between flushes to see whether it shows up in the toilet pan. Water smart meters will indicate high usage or go up constantly - even when residents are sleeping. Thomas Dudley Ltd, one of the UK's largest plumbing manufacturers, has a testing station that puts any new mechanism through its paces with 200,000 constantly repeated flushes, taking four months. Managing director Jason Parker says: ""A siphon will not leak whereas an outlet valve - if we look at the figures we've got - they could leak within a week of installation. It could be two years but they will leak."" Siphons are now being made dual flush, so he wants drop valves outlawed despite the fact they are his biggest seller and such a move could harm his business. ""If we're serious about wasting water and we want to stop it, the only way to do that is put a siphon back in,"" he says. The BBC's Tom Heap visited a testing station at Thomas Dudley Ltd Water companies and campaigners are asking bathroom manufacturers to ""design the problem out of existence"". Although BMA chief executive Tom Reynolds admits drop valves are more likely to leak, he does not want them banned. ""Individual companies have gone into looking at the issueâ¦ but we haven't cracked what the underlying issue is,"" he says. ""There is a commercial and moral imperative to ensure our products reduce leakage wherever possible."" But water is also lost by confusion over buttons. Style over substance has made many unclear which button does what. Thames Water says in recent research as many as 50% of customers chose the wrong button - or pushed both.

Adults without A-levels to be offered free courses,"This video can not be played PM: Covid has âmassively accelerated changes that were already happening"". Boris Johnson has vowed ""radical"" changes to the adult education system in England to help boost the post-Covid economy. The prime minister said the pandemic had ""massively accelerated"" changes to the world of work, and made training gaps ""painfully apparent"". He said funding changes could help end the ""bogus distinction"" between academic and vocational learning. But Labour said the plans would not make up for ""a decade of cuts"". Speaking at a further education college in Exeter, Mr Johnson said the government cannot ""save every job"" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But he added that better training would ""give people the skills to find and create new and better jobs"". Seven ways covid changed the workplace Jobs scheme 'won't stop major rise in unemployment' How many people could become unemployed? He said a new ""lifetime skills guarantee"" would offer a fully funded college course to all people over 18 in England without an A-level or equivalent qualification. Currently, only people aged under 23 qualify for a fully-funded qualification at this level. The commitment will be paid for under an already-announced Â£2.5bn boost to England's National Skills Fund coming into effect next April. Funding will be offered for courses offering ""skills valued by employers"" - with full list to be announced next month. The prime minister added that the government would make higher education loans more flexible, to allow people to ""space out their study across their lifetimes"". Whether it's Boris Johnson's ""levelling up"" agenda or previous governments' promises to tackle the skills gap, some of what we've heard today may sound familiar. For example, that the supply of skilled workers in certain industries simply isn't meeting demand, and calls to end the ""snootiness"" between academic and vocational qualifications. Also familiar was the suggestion that the economy is evolving, at speed, as technology changes the way we live. Coronavirus has, it's argued, accelerated the latter trend with, for example, more working from home and online shopping. And that therefore the task of re-directing workers into industries where there's a shortage of workers has been made more urgent. With fears unemployment will continue to rise, particularly in hospitality and retail, the government is saying that there will be more support for retraining. But this announcement also comes a week after ministers opted for measures such as the 10pm curfew in bars and pubs. That's led to accusations that this government is actually causing job losses in already hard-hit sectors. With that in mind, and amid all the gloomier headlines, Boris Johnson may want to be the person offering some help and some hope. The question is whether it's enough and in time. Mr Johnson said the pandemic had ""compressed"" a ""revolution"" to the jobs market caused by trends such as online shopping. He added that although some jobs would fall away, he wanted people to take advantage of ""new opportunities opening up with dizzying speed"". Meanwhile, the government's Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) said care workers, butchers, and bricklayers should go on the UK's""shortage occupation list"",external. The recommended move would be easier for migrants to get a work visa for those jobs after the post-Brexit transition period ends in January. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In other plans, small businesses will be offered financial incentives to take on apprentices and Â£8m will be spent on skills ""boot camps"" in West Yorkshire, south-west England, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire to cover sectors like construction and engineering. This follows pilots in Greater Manchester and the West Midlands that focused on digital skills. And the government's online Skills Toolkit, a collection of training resources launched in the spring to help people acquire jobs skills ahead of businesses reopening, will be expanded to include 62 additional courses. Seven ways covid changed the workplace Jobs scheme 'won't stop major rise in unemployment' How many people could become unemployed? Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green called the new funding announcement ""a mix of reheated old policies and funding that won't be available until April"". ""By then many workers could have been out of work for nearly a year, and the Tories still think that they will need to take out loans to get the training they will need to get back in work."" Her party has previously called for the money in the National Skills Fund to be brought forward to tackle the crisis. Paul from Leeds lost his job at the start of lockdown and then saw several job opportunities fall through as the pandemic took hold. But he says he eventually got a job as a site manager at his local primary school, after taking a course in children's mental health funded by the Yorkshire Cricket Foundation. The qualification was his first experience of formal training since he took a glasswork and glazing apprenticeship around 20 years ago. ""Having the time is something I've never had before,"" said the father of three. ""If I hadn't done the course, I don't think I would have had the answers to the questions in the interview,"" he adds. ""It's given me the confidence to walk into a school and believe I can get the job."" CBI director general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the ""significant"" unemployment coronavirus is leaving in its wake ""only accelerates the need for people to develop new skills and adapt to new ways of working"". ""The lifetime skills guarantee and flexible loans to support bitesize learning are a strong start but to really shift gears, this must be backed up by meaningful progress on evolving the apprenticeship levy into a flexible skills levy,"" she added. The apprenticeship levy - introduced in 2017 - takes 0.5% of the salary bill from major employers that have an annual pay bill over Â£3m, with the intention of using the money to improve skills and provide training.

'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan',"Mark Telling's personal details were stolen to set up a bogus company In June this year, Tellings Home Made Furniture Service ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from a government Covid bail-out scheme. There was just one problem. The company isn't real - the loan went to a criminal gang, who will never pay it back. Mark Telling, though, does exist and had no idea a company had been set up in his name. When we told him his personal details had been stolen to set up a bogus company to steal money from the government, he was horrified. ""That's crazy, shocking, it's going to worry us to death,"" he said. UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud Mark - who's 47 and works in the building trade - and his partner are saving to buy a house. ""I don't know what else is to come,"" he added. And Mark may be one of many. Victims could find themselves liable for the debt and have their credit rating badly affected. This video can not be played Watch the moment Mark Telling finds out he's been a victim of fraud A BBC investigation has found criminals are setting up fake businesses on an industrial scale and successfully applying for government-backed Covid emergency loans - with no intention of paying the money back. They claim up to Â£50,000 on each application. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme - or BBLS - was announced in April and is designed to help small firms stay afloat during the crisis. The loans are 100% backed by the government and do not have to be paid off for six years. They are interest free for the first 12 months, and are administered by 12 banks. But we have uncovered evidence criminals are taking advantage of the system and could be making millions of pounds. One fraud expert, a retired detective, has called it a ""scandal"" and said we may never know the true scale of the problem. The Treasury insists banks are taking ""appropriate precautions"" and the government would take ""criminal action against the most serious cases"". The revelations come after the head of the National Audit Officetold the Guardian,externalthe BBLS was the ""riskiest"" of all the bailout measures. So, how does the fraud work? Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The rules state the scheme should only apply to firms set up before 1 March 2020. But we've seen successful applications for companies that were created as late as June. We met a fraud investigator who has successfully infiltrated a criminal gang online. His work is highly sensitive so he asked to remain anonymous. He showed us the details of multiple people who had their personal details stolen, of businesses set up in their names and Bounce Back Loans applied for. Typically the criminals apply for the maximum of Â£50,000. The fraud investigator told us ""it seems to be free money for the scammers"". ""There are hundreds, possibly thousands of people involved, engaged in this. It's going to cost us billions,"" he said. We also obtained data from Companies House that indicates a sharp increase in the registration of new companies after the BBLS was announced. In early March registrations were running at 15,602 per week. After lockdown that figure halved to 7,571 per week. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the scheme on 27 April. Registrations then rose to a record 21,616 by the end of June. We don't know how many of those new companies might be fake - or how many actually applied for a loan. Former detective and now civilian fraud and money laundering expert Martin Woods says the scheme was always vulnerable. ""Criminals identified it as a fabulous opportunity,"" he said, adding there were inadequate checks on the applications that were made. He added: ""Ultimately, it will be our children and grandchildren who pay for this."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? Acuris Risk Intelligence, which tracks online fraud, claims to have found more than 100 fake businesses set up by one criminal gang alone. Its CEO Joel Lange said: ""This type of fraud could have been prevented by conducting even the most basic checks by the banks."" UK Finance, which represents the banking sector, rejected the criticisms, saying: ""Lenders have a range of checks in place to detect and prevent fraudulent activity."" That includes ""a cross-industry initiative to check if duplicate applications have been made"", it said. Everything BBC News discovered is being made available to the authorities.

Curfew bride says wedding 'no less special',"Photographer Wattie Cheung captured this candid moment on Friday night A bride who was photographed on a Glasgow street minutes after the Covid curfew cut short her wedding has said nothing could ruin her special day. Rowan McCabe was snapped by press photographer Wattie Cheung on Byres Road just after 22:00 on Friday. Dressed in a full, white bridal gown, she was looking for a taxi with new husband, Jason. They were supposed to marry in spring but rescheduled in the hope lockdown restrictions would have eased. But on Friday, new rules came into force which forcedbars and restaurants to close at 22:00. Mr and Mrs McCabe were wed at a distillery The wedding ceremony took place below a waterfall at Glengoyne Distillery near Killearn, where Jason, 32, works as a distiller. It was followed by a meal at The Bothy restaurant,  just off Byres Road in Glasgow's west end, with 17 close friends and relatives. Shortly after the reception came to an end, the happy couple darted across Byres Road to the taxi rank so they could get back to their home in Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire. Wattie Cheung's photograph of that moment has since attracted substantial attention on social media. He was there to take pictures of pubs and restaurants emptying out on the first night of the curfew for the media. Speaking to BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland, he said: ""Everything just came together when Rowan walked across the road. There was two cars lighting her dress up. It was just quite lucky in some sense."" The new Mrs McCabe - who was Miss Foxley until Friday - said the couple had made a few attempts to marry, the first of which was in May. After other dates and plans were cancelled down to Covid, the couple decided to go ""full steam ahead"" for the September date - no matter what restrictions were in place. Mrs McCabe, 22, said: ""Even with things ending at 22:00, it felt like a really long time coming for the two of us. ""We'd planned for years. Obviously we couldn't plan for coronavirus happening so it was a really stressful time, but Jason - my now husband! - made me a promise that by 25 September this year we'd be married couple and he fulfilled that for me. ""We keep joking he was the bride this time round 'cos he planned everything!"" Current restrictions meant they could only have 20 people,externalat their ceremony. Mrs McCabe told the BBC: ""It was socially distant - we got married up at Glengoyne distillery... They kindly stepped in and rescued the day for us. ""They set up at the waterfall behind the distillery. There were chairs for our 17 guests socially distant in household bubbles at the waterfall. ""Everybody was then taken for a tasting where they grabbed their masks and sat socially distant from each other. Afterwards, everyone made their way to the reception at The Bothy where they sat with their households. ""It was nothing we could ever have imagined would have happened but it didn't make it any less special,"" she added. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

Call for 'urgent review' of 10pm pub closures,"This video can not be played Crowds in York formed after people left pubs and bars at the 22:00 curfew There should be an ""urgent review"" of 10pm closure times for restaurants and pubs, Greater Manchester's mayor says. Andy Burnham said it meant people were gathering in homes and supermarkets that were ""packed out to the rafters"" once the bars closed. Scenes of crowds forming after closing time have been filmed in UK cities including Liverpool and York. There are no specific plans to review the policy, but all measures are kept under review, the PM's spokesman said. He highlighted a police statement that said the crowds seen in Liverpool over the weekend were dispersed within minutes, with the city centre ""virtually empty"" by 22:30 BST. The 22:00 closing time had been used in local lockdown areas and experience there suggested it struck ""the right balance"", allowing businesses to trade ""for the majority of the evening"", the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government is putting into law existing guidance thatpeople from different households in the north-east of England should not mix in any indoor setting. He said the ban was being introduced from midnight on Wednesday because a ""large number"" of infections were occurring in indoor venues other than people's homes - where mixing households is already banned by law. The UK reported another 4,044 confirmed coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. A further 13 people died within 28 days of a positive test, the government said. What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? Parliament stops alcohol sales after 10pm What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Curfew bride says wedding 'no less special' Under the new restrictions, all pubs, bars and restaurants in England and Scotland must provide table service only and close by 22:00. In Wales, all licensed premises must stop selling alcohol at the same curfew timeand close 20 minutes later, at the latest,external. In Northern Ireland closing time remains at 23:30, with First Minister Arlene Foster last week saying thatno decision had yet been reachedover imposing a curfew for pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar said the closures were ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"" It comes asfines of up to Â£10,000 for refusing to self-isolatecome into force in England andthousands of students are self-isolatingin university accommodation across the UK. Mr Burnham said people gathering after closures was ""the opposite of what local restrictions here are trying to do"". ""My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good,"" the Labour politician told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there needs to be an urgent review of the emerging evidence from police forces across the country."" He suggested one option could be to impose a 21:00 cut-off on alcohol sales in shops to prevent the rush to off-licences after the pubs close. Bride Rowan McCabe was pictured on the streets of Glasgow minutes after the curfew came into force - and said nothing could ruin her special day Mr Burnham has also called for more financial support for areas under greater restrictions and tougher powers for local areas to close businesses not observing the rules. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar Sacha Lordtweeted,externalthat the plan was ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"". Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said the earlier closing time ""makes no sense"", saying figures suggested only 5% of coronavirus outbreaks were linked to hospitality. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The health secretary faced several Tory MPs in the House of Commons who criticised the way the new coronavirus regulations were introduced without Parliamentary scrutiny. Former minister Mark Harper said laws that exposed employers and directors to serious criminal penalties should not be imposed ""by decree"". And Wycombe MP Steve Baker said the measures had been briefed to the media eight days in advance, suggesting there had been time for a debate. Mr Hancock said the government had to move ""at pace"", butsaid he was looking at ways to ensure Parliament ""can be properly involved in the processin advance where possible"". Liverpool's Labour mayor Joe Andersonhas also spoken outabout the early closures, saying they are ""making things more dangerous"". Crowds gathered in the city as the pubs turned out drinkers on Saturday night. Extra restrictions on socialising between households were introduced in Greater Manchester, as well as parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire,at the end of Julyfollowing a spike in cases. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said: ""My colleagues will do the best they can to encourage and coerce people to move on but it is really difficult. ""All that you need is a hostile group that turns against those officers and the resources for that city centre are swallowed up dealing with that one incident."" Health minister Helen Whately defended the policy and urged people to head home after their evenings out. She said the government was keeping an ""open mind"" about the new regulations.

About 40 universities report coronavirus cases,"Students at Manchester Metropolitan face isolation after a Covid outbreak About 40 universities around the UK have had reports of coronavirus cases and thousands of students are self-isolating as the new term begins. The University of Aberystwyth is the latest to suspend face-to-face teaching because of Covid-19. But the prime minister's spokesman said students would be able to go home for the Christmas break. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon said ensuring students could go home at Christmas would be a priority. On whether students in England should receive a fees refund, the prime minister's spokesman said universities were autonomous and would make their own decisions. But the Office for Students, the watchdog for higher education in England, indicated that universities would have to seriously consider requests for a partial refund and must not ""adopt a blanket policy that refunds are not available"". Manchester lockdown students feel neglected Tips and tricks for coping at uni in a pandemic Can students get their money back this year? 'Don't scapegoat students' for campus Covid outbreaks Join the debate in our BBC News Students group on Facebook,external Manchester Metropolitan University has offered a two-week rent rebate and Â£50 supermarket voucher for students in two halls of residence affected by outbreaks. Some students have questioned why they were told to leave home and pay for accommodation when most teaching is being done remotely. NHS staff hand out test kits to Glasgow University students There has also been uncertainty about when students can visit their homes. Labour says pausing the return of universities should be considered, rather than risk further Covid outbreaks and self-isolation for students. There are no official figures on university Covid outbreaks from the government, the Office for Students or Universities UK - but a tracking of local reports suggests more than 40 universities have had Covid cases so far, out of about 130 in total. In the absence of official information, websites such asUnicovid,external, run by academics, have gathered data. In Wales, the University of Aberystwyth said that from Monday in-person teaching would be temporarily suspended and courses would be taught online. At Manchester Metropolitan University, all classes for first year and foundation year students will be online for the next 14 days. At the University of Essex acluster of cases has been linked to sports teams. Warnings about staying safe at Queen's University Belfast Universities affected by coronavirus cases include: Manchester Metropolitan University -where about 1,700 students have been told to isolate for a fortnightafter 127 tested positive for the virus Glasgow University -where 600 students were told to self-isolateafter 172 tested positive Queen's University Belfast -100 students have been told to self-isolate after 30 positive cases Many universities had promised students a mix of in-person and online teaching. But with more switching to online there have been questions about students getting a refund or if they should be paying for university accommodation if lessons are delivered remotely. Labour shadow education secretary Kate Green said the option of student fee rebates should be kept ""absolutely on the table"". Students contacting the BBC have reported confusion and uncertainty about Covid outbreaks. ""A lot of people we know just left because they didn't want to get stuck here,"" said Eve, a first year at Manchester Metropolitan University. ""I can't go home because I live with my grandad and I don't want to risk him getting sick,"" she said. ""They're turning round and blaming us and telling us it's our fault when it was the uni that told us to come here in the first place."" This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" Parents have concerns too. Lluis Borrell has twin sons starting at Warwick and Nottingham and is worried about the risk of Covid and the negative impact of restricting students to staying within a small group of people. ""I understand the rules are needed but it makes any socialising very difficult,"" said Mr Borrell from Cambridge. ""Is this fair? Should he have gone in the first instance? ""It feels like they have gone there just to get Covid."" Another student at the University of Leeds, who wanted her name withheld, was so unhappy that she is planning to leave. She said that she did not get on with the her neighbouring students, but is not allowed to meet students from other halls. ""We do not want to be stuck in our small bedroom in a space we have only just come to. ""We are paying so much money for this,"" she said. Manchester Metropolitan University students Natasha Kutscheruk and Joe Ward Joe Ward at Manchester Metropolitan University said: ""If I was made aware that this is how things would be and things would only be online then I definitely would have reconsidered going to university this year."" ""I would definitely like to think that there might be some sort of compensation,"" he said. His flatmate Natasha Kutscheruk said the initial lockdown ""caused a lot of panic"", saying the university ""should have been prepared and organised before sending out an email saying we are locked down"". Almost a third of universities have had Covid cases already - and the new term is only getting underway, with more students still returning. So the number of outbreaks is only likely to increase - raising urgent questions for university bosses, watchdogs and ministers about what should happen next. It's not exactly the university experience that students imagined. First years might be worried about going away from home, but they might now also be worried about not being able to get back, if they end up in an outbreak and are forced to self-isolate. They were promised a mix of face-to-face and online teaching and have paid for accommodation - but the balance seems to be shifting more towards online lessons. This means even less in-person time with other students and staff and more hours cooped up in their room with online recordings and academic versions of Zoom meetings. So should universities just press on with this online-but-on-campus approach? Is it realistic for the rest of term? Or will it mean a loop tape of outbreaks and lockdowns? Or do ministers or health officials step in and urge more students to study from home where possible? Universities cherish their autonomy, but in this case it feels as though they're waiting for someone else to make a decision for them. For students in England, the prime minister's spokesman said on Monday that students should follow health advice just like the wider public. If they have tested positive or have symptoms they do need to self isolate - and should follow any local restrictions in place, said the spokesman. But it was expected that all students would be able to return home at Christmas, said the PM's spokesman, after suggestions that students might have to remain in their student accommodation. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In Scotland, a briefing from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered reassurance that students could return home for the Christmas break. There has beennew guidance issued by the Scottish governmentwhich allows short home visits if there is a ""reasonable excuse"" such as a bereavement or family emergency. Students can also move home and study from there permanently, but the default advice is to stay in university accommodation where possible. Are you a student? How are the rules affecting you?

How are people reacting to new rules?,"The new rules cover Newcastle Sunderland, Northumberland, North and South Tyneside, Gateshead and the Durham County Council area New rules have been introduced across large swathes of north-east England in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus. What has the reaction in the region been? The seven affected councilshave identified people socialising as a key common factor in the rise of coronavirus cases across the area. So since midnight on Thursday, almost two million people have been banned from meeting with other households, while pubs and restaurants and restaurants can only offer table service and have to shut at 22:00. The move has promoted a mixture of confusion, concern and incredulity among many. New restrictions in north-east England Live updates on new North East regulations Which areas are under lockdown and what are the rules? Nick Greaves, who runs The Patricia restaurant in Jesmond, Newcastle, said the new measures, which were a mixture of rules and guidelines, must nots and should nots, were confusing, worrying and ""a bit of a nightmare"". ""It's a bit of a shock,"" he said. ""We have come so far to get back on our feet and now we are back down in this saga again."" He said the 22:00 curfew put the restaurant ""in an awkward position"". ""We have changed the restaurant to have people much more spaced out time wise, in three sittings almost,"" Mr Greaves said. ""It's going to take out that 20:30 table sitting."" The Patricia now effectively has three sittings for meals He said the restaurant offered a six-course menu that took about two-and-a-half hours to work through. Mr Greaves also said he couldn't understand how the rules would help stop the spread of the coronavirus. ""It could even be a little bit dangerous with people going to the pub, necking as much as they can and then they end up drunk and are like 'let's go to a house or something'. ""I can't get my head around that's going to help anything. The virus is still as dangerous before 22:00 as it is afterwards."" This video can not be played Coronavirus: North East new restrictions reaction That's a concern shared by Spencer Hughes who lives in Sunderland and whose wife Jaci is a waitress at a social club in South Hylton which is open from 11:00 to 23:00. ""I don't see how closing an hour earlier will make any difference to the chances of getting the coronavirus,"" Mr Hughes said. ""As for other pubs which would normally be open later, I think people are just going to change their drinking habits. ""They will go out drinking earlier and once they've had a few, how much are they really going to be adhering to the social distancing as they were when they had their first pint?"" He said there was too much confusion over what was a rule and what was a guideline, with people able to interpret the latter to suit their own needs. Becci Nye is manager of the Fifteas Vintage tearoom in Bishop Auckland Becci Nye, manager of Fifteas Vintage tearoom in Bishop Auckland, also said the confusion between what you must not do and what you were advised not to do was posing a problem. The regulations ban people from visiting another household, including going to private gardens, apart from within a support bubble. And they advise people not to meet with other households at public venues, although Newcastle director of public health Eugene Milne said it would be alright in parks if people adhered to social distancing guidelines. ""I think people just need clear instructions,"" Ms Nye said, adding: ""Like right, 'you can mix, you can't mix'. ""Can you come with your neighbour, can you meet your mam in a tearoom rather than your house?"" She said she did not expect to see much of a change. ""I don't think the big tables will be booked any more but other than that I think it will be quite samey,"" she said. Mr Hughes in Sunderland also wasn't sure how well the rules would be followed. ""When we first went into lockdown and people didn't know much about the virus then everyone went with it,"" he said. ""Now there is a split, some people haven't been affected by it and don't even think it's real or claim it's the government trying to control them. ""But others like me have lost friends to it, we know it's there and what it does. ""What's needed are clear definitive rules that are scientifically proven that everybody sticks to."" Speaking to BBC Newcastle, Mr Milne said it would be ""very hard"" to enforce rules about people mixing in public places, saying: ""How would a pub know if people coming in together did actually live together or not?""

Trump's taxes 'national security' issue - Pelosi,"This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" The top-ranked Democrat in Washington has called President Donald Trump's alleged tax avoidance a question of ""national security"". Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, asked whether Mr Trump owed money to foreign interests, following an article on his financial records by the New York Times. It alleges Mr Trump paid only $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax in both 2016 and 2017. Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"". Speaking on NBC, Ms Pelosi said the report showed that ""this president appears to have over $400m in debt"". ""To whom? Different countries? What is the leverage they have?"" she asked, adding: ""So for me, this is a national security question."" ""The fact that you could have a sitting president who owes hundreds of millions of dollars that he's personally guaranteed to lenders, and we don't know who these lenders are,"" she said, and suggested that Mr Trump may be indebted to Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""What does Putin have on the president politically? Personally? Financially?"" Do voters care about Trump taxes? Trump's taxes: What you need to know Can Donald Trump release his tax returns? According to the explosive report in the New York Times - which saysit obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades,external- Mr Trump paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. It does not suggest Mr Trump received any previously unknown income from Russia, though it said that the president had earned some money from foreign sources. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says. In a tweet on Monday, the president accused the media of bringing up his taxes and ""other nonsense with illegally obtained information & only bad intent"". He said he had ""paid many millions of dollars in taxes"" but received tax credits as well. Responding to the accusations of losses, Mr Trump added he had ""very little debt"" compared to the value of his assets. Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The New York Times said the information scrutinised in its report was ""provided by sources with legal access to it"". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and weeks before the 3 November election. The New York Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. Trump v Obama: Who's made the economy fly? How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, ""largely because he reported losing much more money than he made"". The newspaper also claims that ""most"" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - ""report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year"". The report also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from ""lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour"" from the president. He is alleged to have made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Trump Organization also received money ""from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics"", according to the New York Times. Licensing deals allegedly netted Mr Trump $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The report says there is evidence that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income in 2017 by paying $747,622 in consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. He is also reported to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on his television show, The Apprentice. Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics,the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018,external, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization has rejected the New York Times' allegations, saying ""most"" of the facts are inaccurate Mr Trump and the Trump Organization denied the allegations in the report, but the president's critics condemned his tax arrangements. Ms Pelosi described the alleged tax avoidance as an insult to America's working families, as well as raising the national security question. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Mr Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.

Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Victoria Bisset, Ashitha Nagesh, Doug Faulkner, and Alex Kleiderman. The editors were Hugo Bachega and Owen Amos. We're about to bring our live coverage to an end - here's a round-up of what's been happening in the UK today.  If you're joining us from the Americas, good morning or good afternoon - and if you're in Asia, you'll be settling in to sleep. We're heading into the evening here in the UK. A lot has happened today. To summarise, here are some of the main global headlines. A woman has described her pain at not being able to see her husband regularly at his care home during the pandemic, calling it a ""torture of the heart"". Jean Haste, 70, says she has only been able to see Trevor, 75, who has dementia, once a week for 30 minutes at his home in Suffolk due to visiting restrictions. She said the lack of interaction had affected her husband's illness ""grossly"", saying he hunches in his wheelchair and barely makes eye contact when she does visit. ""I call it torture of the heart. I took a vow and that was to have and to hold. And I can't be with him,"" said Mrs Haste. The Department of Health and Social Care said its ""first priority"" was to prevent infections in care homes, but local public health officials were ""responsible for the policy on visits"". This video can not be played Thecoronavirus contact tracing appfor England and Wales has now been downloaded more than 12.4 million times, the government has said. The app, launched on Thursday, uses Bluetooth technology to keep tabs on encounters with other people and informs them if one subsequently tests positive for Covid. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs it was ""the fastest download of an app in British history"". Our technology correspondents have been answeringyour questions about how the app works. The Netherlands is bringing in new restrictions to try to curb a surge in Covid cases, which will come into force tomorrow at 18:00 local time (17:00 BST). According to the new rules, people should: Although the new rules are only in place for three weeks for now, they may be extended. The Netherlands has recorded more than 115,000 confirmed cases of the virus, and more than 6,400 deaths. Many countries are seeing a surge in cases right now. For some this is a second surge, after an initial peak in spring. For others, cases have been rising steadily through the year. In Europe, including the UK, cases initially peaked in Spring. They have started to increase again, and many countries are now reintroducing restrictions. In the US, which still has the highest number of infections and deaths, the virus has surged in different states at different times throughout the year. At the start the outbreak was centred on northern states such as Washington and New York, and in the summer cases were concentrated in southern states. Now, cases are surging in the mid-west. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The National Police Chiefs Council has confirmed officers are being told not to install the NHS Covid-19 app for England on their work smartphones. The app detects when users have been in proximity to someone with the virus. Some officers have also been told they may not need to obey self-isolate alerts generated by the app when downloaded to their personal phones. Lancashire Constabulary has told staff to call the force's own Covid-19 helpline instead. A Lancashire Constabulary spokeswoman told the BBC its guidance remains in line with the national NPCC position. The NPCC confirmed the work-phones policy was common to all forces, but said it was carrying out an urgent review of the matter. Read more here. Newcastle is one of the areas subject to the new law A law prohibiting households from mixing in any indoor setting is to be introduced in the most populous parts of north-east England from 00:01 BST on Wednesday. The Department of Health said existing local lockdown measures for Durham,
     Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Northumberland and
     Sunderland are being tightened at the request of the local councils in response to high and
increasing infection rates. Current guidance only advises residents
not to mix with people outside their household or bubble in indoor settings,
such as pubs and restaurants. The DoH says the guidance will
now be enforceable and subject to fines, although the law will not apply to Covid-secure schools and workplaces. A funding package is being agreed with councils to
support the measures and the rising infection rate. Reality Check The government's 10pm mandatory closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants in England has come under scrutiny, following videos posted on social media of crowds gathering outside venues after closing time. Ministers have been defending the policy but the mayor of Greater Manchester has called for an ""urgent review of the emerging evidence"" of its impact. Dr Julian Lang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, says: ""Wherever you get people crowded together, for example concert halls, cruise ships, house parties, bars and pubs, you risk spreading a virus."" However, speaking on the BBC Andrew Marr Show this weekend,the University of Edinburgh's Prof Mark Woolhouse, a member of the government's infection modelling team, said ""there isn't a proven scientific basis for any of this"". So,why was the rule brought in and what is the science behind it? Knowsley in Merseyside, north-west England, currently has the highest weekly rate of new cases of Covid-19 in England, new data shows. A total of 422 cases were recorded in the area in the seven days to 25 September - the equivalent of 279.7 cases per 100,000, up sharply from 152.5 in the previous week. Eight other areas of England now have weekly rates above 200 cases per 100,000 people - including Liverpool where the rate has jumped from 165.4 to 262.2 with 1,306 new cases recorded. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? As we reported earlier, as of Monday you can be fined Â£1,000 forfailing to self-isolatefor a first-time offence, rising to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders. People whofail to tell their employer,externalthey have to self-isolate can be fined Â£50, while anyone considered to have acted recklessly, for example by going into a crowded place when they know they should self-isolate, can be fined Â£4,000. But other rules have also come into law today which ban pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes from playing music which exceeds 85 decibels, although live performances are exempt. The new laws also say that pub landlords or those who run other venues like hotel bars, restaurants and members clubs, must take ""all reasonable measures"" to stop singing on the premises by customers in groups of more than six, and dancing. Wedding ceremonies and receptions are exempt from the rule. The Department of Health said that while the NHS Covid-19 app can tell people to self-isolate, it is anonymous and cannot force people to or identify them. The head of the US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been overheard complaining about a new member of President Trump's coronavirus task force. According to a report from NBC News, Dr Robert Redfield was heard saying that Dr Scott Atlas was giving Trump false and misleading data on the virus - including on whether masks work, and on herd immunity. On a phone call, made in public on a flight from Atlanta to Washington DC, Redfield was heard saying: ""Everything he says is false."" He later confirmed he was talking about Atlas, who joined the White House task force in August. Atlas's appointment has been criticised, because he doesn't have a background in infectious diseases or public health. A landowner has been issued with a Â£10,000 fine for hosting a wedding party with 100 to 300 people in attendance, police said.  Police said they had received calls about the event taking place on land near New Farnley, Leeds at about 17:00 BST on Saturday.  The force said the group had been dispersed by 21:30.  One of the landowners, aged 49, was identified and issued a fine for breaching coronavirus legislation.  Ch Supt Damien Miller said it had been an ""absolutely blatant breach"" of the law, whichlimits the numbers of people,externalable to attend a wedding.  On Saturday the limit was 30, but by Monday it had been reduced to 15 people.

Trading hours, however, have been restricted - they have to close at 22:00 local time. The announcement was made by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who also extended a nationwide curfew for a further 60 days, but said it would start two hours later - now lasting from 23:00 to 04:00. But an expected announcement on the reopening of schools did not happen. The ministry of education ordered teachers to report to school on Monday, but President Kenyatta said learning institutions could only open once the safety of students could be guaranteed. Kenya has had more than 38,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Nine deaths were reported today, pushing the number of fatalities to above 700. There has been a steady
decline in the number of cases in recent weeks. Only 53 new cases were announced
on Monday, although critics have noted a low testing rate. Read more: Cases of coronavirus are surging in 21 different US states - almost half of the country - according to broadcaster CNN, which analysed data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of cases in these states increased by at least 10% in the last week, compared to the week before. Those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington state, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The figures are sparking fears of a new wave in autumn and winter as temperatures fall. The US has reported more than seven million confirmed cases of the virus so far, and more than 200,000 deaths. As the rate of infection increases across the country it can be difficult to keep track of where new local restrictions have been put in place. In Wales, Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan arethe latest local authorities to impose extra measures, which come into force at 18:00 BST on Monday. In total, at least 16.6 million people are under regional restrictions in the UK - about one in four people. To make things easier we have compiled thishandy guide. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Ministers in the Commons have had perhaps the clearest steer yet
on the governmentâs plans for managing coronavirus over the next six months. Speaking to MPs, Health Secretary Matt Hancock ruled out the idea of trying to
eliminate the virus and keep new cases at zero. He pointed out that this
strategy had not worked for Scotland or New Zealand - both countries have seen
a resurgence of the virus. And he rejected the notion of letting coronavirus
rip among young people while trying to protect the most vulnerable, arguing
that the death toll would likely be âtoo high to bearâ. That leaves suppressing new infections until a vaccine comes
to the rescue (perhaps in the Spring if the trials continue to go well). The
new mantra - control the virus while protecting the economy and education. What
extra measures and restrictions might be necessary to do that remain to be
seen, but a full lockdown would not fit the brief. Here are the latest charts for cases and deaths in the UK - updated to include the data released in the past half hour. The latest UK figures show the number of people testing positive for coronavirus has dropped for a third day in a row. While there can be a lag in reporting figures over the weekend, thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,externalshows there were 4,044 cases reported on Monday, compared to 5,693 cases in the previous 24 hours. There were 6,042 on Saturday, down from 6,874 cases reported on Friday. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan'Criminals are targeting loans designed to help small firms stay afloat in the coronavirus pandemic.UK,"Mark Telling's personal details were stolen to set up a bogus company In June this year, Tellings Home Made Furniture Service ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from a government Covid bail-out scheme. There was just one problem. The company isn't real - the loan went to a criminal gang, who will never pay it back. Mark Telling, though, does exist and had no idea a company had been set up in his name. When we told him his personal details had been stolen to set up a bogus company to steal money from the government, he was horrified. ""That's crazy, shocking, it's going to worry us to death,"" he said. UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud Mark - who's 47 and works in the building trade - and his partner are saving to buy a house. ""I don't know what else is to come,"" he added. And Mark may be one of many. Victims could find themselves liable for the debt and have their credit rating badly affected. This video can not be played Watch the moment Mark Telling finds out he's been a victim of fraud A BBC investigation has found criminals are setting up fake businesses on an industrial scale and successfully applying for government-backed Covid emergency loans - with no intention of paying the money back. They claim up to Â£50,000 on each application. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme - or BBLS - was announced in April and is designed to help small firms stay afloat during the crisis. The loans are 100% backed by the government and do not have to be paid off for six years. They are interest free for the first 12 months, and are administered by 12 banks. But we have uncovered evidence criminals are taking advantage of the system and could be making millions of pounds. One fraud expert, a retired detective, has called it a ""scandal"" and said we may never know the true scale of the problem. The Treasury insists banks are taking ""appropriate precautions"" and the government would take ""criminal action against the most serious cases"". The revelations come after the head of the National Audit Officetold the Guardian,externalthe BBLS was the ""riskiest"" of all the bailout measures. So, how does the fraud work? Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The rules state the scheme should only apply to firms set up before 1 March 2020. But we've seen successful applications for companies that were created as late as June. We met a fraud investigator who has successfully infiltrated a criminal gang online. His work is highly sensitive so he asked to remain anonymous. He showed us the details of multiple people who had their personal details stolen, of businesses set up in their names and Bounce Back Loans applied for. Typically the criminals apply for the maximum of Â£50,000. The fraud investigator told us ""it seems to be free money for the scammers"". ""There are hundreds, possibly thousands of people involved, engaged in this. It's going to cost us billions,"" he said. We also obtained data from Companies House that indicates a sharp increase in the registration of new companies after the BBLS was announced. In early March registrations were running at 15,602 per week. After lockdown that figure halved to 7,571 per week. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the scheme on 27 April. Registrations then rose to a record 21,616 by the end of June. We don't know how many of those new companies might be fake - or how many actually applied for a loan. Former detective and now civilian fraud and money laundering expert Martin Woods says the scheme was always vulnerable. ""Criminals identified it as a fabulous opportunity,"" he said, adding there were inadequate checks on the applications that were made. He added: ""Ultimately, it will be our children and grandchildren who pay for this."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? Acuris Risk Intelligence, which tracks online fraud, claims to have found more than 100 fake businesses set up by one criminal gang alone. Its CEO Joel Lange said: ""This type of fraud could have been prevented by conducting even the most basic checks by the banks."" UK Finance, which represents the banking sector, rejected the criticisms, saying: ""Lenders have a range of checks in place to detect and prevent fraudulent activity."" That includes ""a cross-industry initiative to check if duplicate applications have been made"", it said. Everything BBC News discovered is being made available to the authorities.

"Trump taxes 'national security' issue, Pelosi says","This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Donald Trump paid just $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House, the New York Times says. The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades,external- also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says. Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"". ""Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,"" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. ""The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me wellâ¦ they treat me very badly,"" he said. Can Donald Trump release his tax returns? Trump's taxes: What you need to know How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was ""provided by sources with legal access to it"". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. Trump v Obama: Who's made the economy fly? It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, ""largely because he reported losing much more money than he made"". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS ""portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes"". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics,the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018,external, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"". The Trump Organization has rejected the New York Times' allegations, saying ""most"" of the facts are inaccurate ""Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,"" he said. By using the term ""personal taxes"", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. The newspaper also claims that ""most"" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - ""report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year"". ""That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,"" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from ""lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour"" from the president. President Trump, pictured in 2015 at the launch of The Celebrity Apprentice TV series, made $427.4m in 2018 from the show The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money ""from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics"". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. President Trump's golf courses in Scotland, together with one in Ireland, made $63.3m in losses in 2018, the New York Times alleges The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to ""carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years"". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story ""goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman"". ""You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,"" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: ""That makes me smart."" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken ""extraordinary measures"" to ""game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes"". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.

The newspaper also claims that ""most"" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - ""report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year"". ""That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,"" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from ""lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour"" from the president. President Trump, pictured in 2015 at the launch of The Celebrity Apprentice TV series, made $427.4m in 2018 from the show The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money ""from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics"". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. President Trump's golf courses in Scotland, together with one in Ireland, made $63.3m in losses in 2018, the New York Times alleges The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to ""carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years"". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story ""goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman"". ""You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,"" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: ""That makes me smart."" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken ""extraordinary measures"" to ""game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes"". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president.

Trump taxes 'national security' issue says top Democrat,"This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Donald Trump paid just $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House, the New York Times says. The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades,external- also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says. Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"". ""Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,"" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. ""The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me wellâ¦ they treat me very badly,"" he said. Can Donald Trump release his tax returns? Trump's taxes: What you need to know How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was ""provided by sources with legal access to it"". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. Trump v Obama: Who's made the economy fly? It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, ""largely because he reported losing much more money than he made"". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS ""portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes"". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics,the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018,external, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"". The Trump Organization has rejected the New York Times' allegations, saying ""most"" of the facts are inaccurate ""Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,"" he said.

About 40 universities report coronavirus casesBut students are assured they will be able to return home for Christmas holidays.UK,"Students at Manchester Metropolitan face isolation after a Covid outbreak About 40 universities around the UK have had reports of coronavirus cases and thousands of students are self-isolating as the new term begins. The University of Aberystwyth is the latest to suspend face-to-face teaching because of Covid-19. But the prime minister's spokesman said students would be able to go home for the Christmas break. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon said ensuring students could go home at Christmas would be a priority. On whether students in England should receive a fees refund, the prime minister's spokesman said universities were autonomous and would make their own decisions. But the Office for Students, the watchdog for higher education in England, indicated that universities would have to seriously consider requests for a partial refund and must not ""adopt a blanket policy that refunds are not available"". Manchester lockdown students feel neglected Tips and tricks for coping at uni in a pandemic Can students get their money back this year? 'Don't scapegoat students' for campus Covid outbreaks Join the debate in our BBC News Students group on Facebook,external Manchester Metropolitan University has offered a two-week rent rebate and Â£50 supermarket voucher for students in two halls of residence affected by outbreaks. Some students have questioned why they were told to leave home and pay for accommodation when most teaching is being done remotely. NHS staff hand out test kits to Glasgow University students There has also been uncertainty about when students can visit their homes. Labour says pausing the return of universities should be considered, rather than risk further Covid outbreaks and self-isolation for students. There are no official figures on university Covid outbreaks from the government, the Office for Students or Universities UK - but a tracking of local reports suggests more than 40 universities have had Covid cases so far, out of about 130 in total. In the absence of official information, websites such asUnicovid,external, run by academics, have gathered data. In Wales, the University of Aberystwyth said that from Monday in-person teaching would be temporarily suspended and courses would be taught online. At Manchester Metropolitan University, all classes for first year and foundation year students will be online for the next 14 days. At the University of Essex acluster of cases has been linked to sports teams. Warnings about staying safe at Queen's University Belfast Universities affected by coronavirus cases include: Manchester Metropolitan University -where about 1,700 students have been told to isolate for a fortnightafter 127 tested positive for the virus Glasgow University -where 600 students were told to self-isolateafter 172 tested positive Queen's University Belfast -100 students have been told to self-isolate after 30 positive cases Many universities had promised students a mix of in-person and online teaching. But with more switching to online there have been questions about students getting a refund or if they should be paying for university accommodation if lessons are delivered remotely. Labour shadow education secretary Kate Green said the option of student fee rebates should be kept ""absolutely on the table"". Students contacting the BBC have reported confusion and uncertainty about Covid outbreaks. ""A lot of people we know just left because they didn't want to get stuck here,"" said Eve, a first year at Manchester Metropolitan University. ""I can't go home because I live with my grandad and I don't want to risk him getting sick,"" she said. ""They're turning round and blaming us and telling us it's our fault when it was the uni that told us to come here in the first place."" This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" Parents have concerns too. Lluis Borrell has twin sons starting at Warwick and Nottingham and is worried about the risk of Covid and the negative impact of restricting students to staying within a small group of people. ""I understand the rules are needed but it makes any socialising very difficult,"" said Mr Borrell from Cambridge. ""Is this fair? Should he have gone in the first instance? ""It feels like they have gone there just to get Covid."" Another student at the University of Leeds, who wanted her name withheld, was so unhappy that she is planning to leave. She said that she did not get on with the her neighbouring students, but is not allowed to meet students from other halls. ""We do not want to be stuck in our small bedroom in a space we have only just come to. ""We are paying so much money for this,"" she said. Manchester Metropolitan University students Natasha Kutscheruk and Joe Ward Joe Ward at Manchester Metropolitan University said: ""If I was made aware that this is how things would be and things would only be online then I definitely would have reconsidered going to university this year."" ""I would definitely like to think that there might be some sort of compensation,"" he said. His flatmate Natasha Kutscheruk said the initial lockdown ""caused a lot of panic"", saying the university ""should have been prepared and organised before sending out an email saying we are locked down"". Almost a third of universities have had Covid cases already - and the new term is only getting underway, with more students still returning. So the number of outbreaks is only likely to increase - raising urgent questions for university bosses, watchdogs and ministers about what should happen next. It's not exactly the university experience that students imagined. First years might be worried about going away from home, but they might now also be worried about not being able to get back, if they end up in an outbreak and are forced to self-isolate. They were promised a mix of face-to-face and online teaching and have paid for accommodation - but the balance seems to be shifting more towards online lessons. This means even less in-person time with other students and staff and more hours cooped up in their room with online recordings and academic versions of Zoom meetings. So should universities just press on with this online-but-on-campus approach? Is it realistic for the rest of term? Or will it mean a loop tape of outbreaks and lockdowns? Or do ministers or health officials step in and urge more students to study from home where possible? Universities cherish their autonomy, but in this case it feels as though they're waiting for someone else to make a decision for them. For students in England, the prime minister's spokesman said on Monday that students should follow health advice just like the wider public. If they have tested positive or have symptoms they do need to self isolate - and should follow any local restrictions in place, said the spokesman. But it was expected that all students would be able to return home at Christmas, said the PM's spokesman, after suggestions that students might have to remain in their student accommodation. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In Scotland, a briefing from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered reassurance that students could return home for the Christmas break. There has beennew guidance issued by the Scottish governmentwhich allows short home visits if there is a ""reasonable excuse"" such as a bereavement or family emergency. Students can also move home and study from there permanently, but the default advice is to stay in university accommodation where possible. Are you a student? How are the rules affecting you?

Matt Eastley lost the gold wedding band on Ventnor Beach on the Isle of Wight on 6 August but 11-year-old Priya Sahu found it in the sand a day later. Priya and her mother, Aswita, met up with Mr Eastley in a Southampton park to return it to him. Mr Eastley compared the ring to the ""glass slipper in Cinderella"". He said he had been ""splashing about"" in the sea before he realised the ring had slipped off his finger. He left the Isle of Wight having asked a cafe owner on the beach to keep an eye out for it ""more in hope than expectation"" and had planned to replace it. Priya Sahu after she found the wedding band on Ventnor beach on the Isle of Wight in August The next day, Priya found the ring washed up and the mother-daughter team sought to track its owner down. Mrs Sahu, from Southampton, said: ""We thought someone must be devastated about losing their wedding ring and Priya said it would be magical if we could actually find this person."" Through friends and friends of friends, they contacted the cafe owner, who then eventually put them in touch with Mr Eastley, who married his wife Lisa 15 years ago. Priya and Mrs Sahu celebrated the find and reunited Mr Eastley with his wedding ring in Watts Park on Sunday. Mr Eastley said the ring's return had ""put a smile on my face"" Mr Eastley, from Paddock Wood in Kent, said: ""[Losing the ring] was devastating. It is irreplaceable - that's the only word I can think of. ""But it's been wonderful. It's life-affirming. It's a really happy ending.

Who will be the next US president? You decide,"This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states. Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Mr Trump and 233 to Mr Biden. Can Joe Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Donald Trump romp home to a second term? It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Votes:10 Mr Trump won a surprise victory in Wisconsin in 2016 by a small margin, mainly by appealing to rural areas and working-class white women. But this same group of voters helped elect a Democratic state governor two years later - and Mr Biden is currently ahead in the polls.Wisconsinites may have been put off Mr Trump by foreign trade wars that have strangled exports from the state's many dairy farmers, leading to plummeting prices and farm closures.The state has been rocked further by violent protests after a black man was shot by police in the city of Kenosha. Republicans warn that a Democrat win would bring lawlessness and further violence. But will Wisconsin voters be persuaded? Votes:11 Mr Trump scooped the traditionally Republican state in 2016, but his 4% lead was a lot smaller than those enjoyed by Republican candidates in previous elections. This time, pollsters are forecasting Mr Trump will lose to Mr Biden.The Grand Canyon state has a growing Latino population and an increasing number of rich city dwellers, who both tend to vote Democrat. The state has also been badly hit by coronavirus, so voters who think the president has handled the crisis badly may want change.But Mr Trump's focus on building a wall along the state's southern border with Mexico, and a crackdown on visas for foreign workers, could still play well with voters. Votes:15 North Carolina was a Republican stronghold before Barack Obama won with a narrow majority in 2008. That blue blip in a history of voting red suggests that a Democratic victory is not off the cards completely.Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump have shelled out millions in advertising to try to capture the state, where Mr Biden is leading in the polls.North Carolina is the first state to begin early voting by post and record numbers of requests for postal votes have flooded in - more than half of them registered Democrats. If mail-in voting swings the final result, things are looking less rosy for Mr Trump. Votes:16 Mr Trump squeaked out a win here in 2016 with just a 0.3% lead on Hillary Clinton. The traditionally Democratic, working-class state bucked a 28-year trend to elect Mr Trump after he promised trade deals to benefit manufacturing.Mr Biden, whose father was a car salesman, says he has a deep personal connection to Detroit and often visited Michigan as vice-president. He even considered popular Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate. Mr Biden's seen as a strong moderate candidate, the type that has always done well in Michigan. Votes:20 Four years ago, many western Pennsylvanians voted to preserve their way of life, which is reliant on the energy industry, and flipped the traditionally Democratic state for Mr Trump. He promised protection from Democratic promises to reform coal mining and fracking. But has Mr Trump delivered?Unemployment has hovered in double-digits since the pandemic struck. Mr Biden, who was born in the eastern town of Scranton (more well-known, perhaps, for being the home of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. in the US version of British comedy The Office), has long been a familiar face and that personal touch might carry him to victory. Votes:29 One thing is sure in Florida: its elections are always close. The Sunshine State may be the adopted second home of Mr Trump, but his victory at the last election was no landslide.The result in Florida is difficult to call because its population is diverse and ever-shifting. The state's large Cuban population leans Republican, but they tend to live in some of the most Democratic counties of the state. Pensioners from other states continue to retire to Florida, and they turn out to vote in droves. Younger voters, who tend to lean Democrat, are multiplying. And suburban voters across the state have been shifting slowly away from the Republican party.Keep your eyes peeled for Florida's result on election night: in every election bar one since 1964, the presidential candidate who has won Florida has also won the White House. Votes:16 Georgia has voted solidly Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1960. Yet this year, Mr Biden's campaign team believes he may have a shot. They're betting on support from black voters, who make up at least a quarter of all registered voters in the state.On race-related issues, Mr Biden polls far better than Mr Trump. Black Lives Matter protests have gripped national news this year, and Georgia's youth have often led the demonstrations outside major cities.But Mr Trump is pitching himself as the ""law-and-order candidate"", which could carry weight amongst white, conservative Georgians, who usually drive the state's result.It all depends on who shows up on polling day.  First to 270 wins   Click here if you can't see the interactive,external In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. Two independent American sources, Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report, publish lists of states grouped by how they are expected to vote on election night. Several states are classified as ""toss-ups"", which means they could be won by either side. We chose our seven key states from those toss-ups which have enough electoral votes to sway the final outcome and where we expect the battle to be fought most closely. President Trump won all of them in 2016 Since most states are already tipped to vote one way or another, we've assigned their respective electoral votes to the candidate that each is considered most likely to vote for. This means the game starts at 188 votes for Mr Trump and 233 for Mr Biden. Technically, yes. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes and it is possible for two candidates to win states in such a way that each will come out with 269 votes. Awkward.

Police search farmland over Sgt Matt Ratana death,"The farmland used to serve as an ammunition depot during the Second World War Police are continuing to search farmland in Surrey which is believed to be connected to the murder of Sgt Matiu Ratana. Five police vehicles were seen at the site in Park Road, Banstead, on Monday. New Zealand-born Sgt Ratana, 54, died in hospital after being shot by a handcuffed suspect who was taken into custody in Croydon on Friday morning. Louis De Zoysa, 23, from Norbury, who is thought to have also shot himself, remains critically ill in hospital. A man was also arrested in Norwich on suspicion of supplying a firearm on Sunday. He remains in custody at a South London police station. Matiu Ratana, known as Matt, was a keen rugby union coach, a fan of performance motorcycles and weight-training The BBC's Daniel De Simone previously said the Banstead address is down a long driveway and its land contains a series of concrete bunkers. Acontrolled explosion took place at the site overthe weekend and a marked police car had been guarding the entrance to the property. BBC Home Affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw: The murder inquiry appears to be expanding, with the former Ministry of Defence weapons depot in Banstead the focus of activity. The site, disguised as a chicken farm during the war, is believed to be the last remaining ammunition depot to serve London during the Second World War. Searches and forensic work can take a long time, but the presence of so many police officers and vehicles three days after the shooting suggests there may have been a significant discovery, or at least the prospect of one. Detectives will want to find out why the shooting took place, whether it was premeditated and if other attacks were being planned. Were other people involved or aware of what was going on? At the same time, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has stepped up its own investigation, taking accounts from officers who were involved on the day of the shooting. Police guarded the entrance to a property on Park Road in Banstead Police confirmed the other scenes undergoing searches are Croydon Custody Centre, where the shooting occurred, an area of London Road in Pollards Hill, where the suspect was initially arrested, and an address in Southbrook Road, Norbury. On Monday,a video produced by community leaders,externalin Croydon in tribute to Mr Ratana was shared on social media. Heavy police presence was seen at a property in Banstead, Surrey on Monday Posting a link to the footage on Twitter, Supt Andy Brittain said: ""Matt touched the lives of so many,"" while colleagues using the Met Police's Croydon account called the video a ""beautiful tribute to our incredible Sergeant"". Supt Brittain also tweeted a picture of a McDonald's breakfast, along with an All Blacks rugby shirt placed in the empty chair of Sgt Ratana. Allow Twitter content?

This video can not be played Dame Cressida Dick paid tribute to Sgt Ratana, saying he was ""big in stature, big in heart"" The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said Mr De Zoysa was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of ammunition. The IOPC confirmed he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and had been taken to the custody centre in a police vehicle, before being escorted into the building. Louis De Zoysa, from Norbury, remains critically ill in hospital The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect with a metal detector, the IOPC said. ""A non-police issue firearm, which appears to be a revolver, has been recovered from the scene. Further ballistic work will be required,"" said  regional director Sal Naseem. Sgt Ratana joined the Met in 1991, having moved to the UK in 1989. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boy's High School's, a town north of the capital, Wellington. The Met said a murder investigation was under way, but the shooting was not being treated as a counter-terrorism incident.

The covenant,external, first announced at the start of the September, places a statutory duty on the government to do more to support the police.

Uber spared from London ban despite 'past failings'The firm gets a new licence to work in the capital after a court says it has addressed safety issues.BusinessComments,"Uber has secured its right to continue operating in London after a judge upheld its appeal against Transport for London (TfL). The ride-hailing giant has been granted a new licence to work in the capital, nearly a year after TfL rejected its application over safety concerns. It ends uncertainty for the 45,000 drivers who use the taxi app in London. Westminster Magistrates' Court said Uber was now a ""fit and proper"" operator ""despite historical failings"". One of the main concerns raised by TfL was a flaw in Uber's system that allowed unauthorised people to upload their photographs to legitimate drivers' accounts, which then allowed them to pick up passengers. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that 24 drivers shared their accounts with 20 others which led to 14,788 rides. Want an Uber? Send a selfie proving you are wearing a mask Uber's self-driving operator charged over fatal crash Uber pledges all-electric fleet by 2040 Uber's regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said: ""It was not what we would do now. It was inadequate, we could have done better."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said TfL was ""absolutely right"" not to renew Uber licence last year but acknowledged the company had ""made improvements"". However, he added: ""I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers."" Deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said he took Uber's ""track-record of regulation breaches"" into account but said it had made efforts to address failings and had improved standards. ""Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London PHV [private hire vehicle] operator's licence,"" he said. The judge said Uber ""does not have a perfect record but it has been an improving picture"". ""The test as to whether [Uber] are a 'fit and proper person' does not require perfection. I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more."" The new licence will run for 18 months and comes with a number of conditions, allowing TfL to closely monitor Uber's adherence to the regulations. Uber's Mr Heywood said: ""This decision is a recognition of Uber's commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL."" With 45,000 drivers on its books in London, Uber is a force to be reckoned with. But the body in charge of licensing in London has gone out of its way to take Uber on. Transport for London (TfL) did manage to draw attention to a previous flaw in Uber's system which allowed unauthorised drivers to ferry people around. TfL piled on the pressure and, according to a judge, Uber's safety record has improved. But when it refused to renew Uber's license, TfL knew that a judge would have the ultimate call. And at no point did anyone have to tell Uber's users in London that they couldn't order a cab. Talking tough on Uber is one thing. But banishing it from a key European capital would carry significant consequences. TfL originally refused to renew Uber's licence in September 2017. The company then won a 15-month licence by a judge in June 2018 after taking the case to court. Uber was granted a two-month extension to its licence in September last year, but in NovemberTfL decided not to grant it a new licence,external. At the time, TfL said it had ""identified a pattern of failures by the company including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk"". Uber appealed against the decision and was allowed to keep operating throughout the process. Business campaign group London First said Monday's decision was ""good news for millions of Londoners and visitors who rely on Uber to get around the capital"". However, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said it was a ""disaster for London"". ""Uber has demonstrated time and time again that it simply can't be trusted to put the safety of Londoners, its drivers and other road users above profit,"" it said. ""Sadly, it seems that Uber is too big to regulate effectively but too big to fail."" Uber is still awaitinga separate UK court rulingover whether its drivers should be classed as workers or self-employed. The case, brought by two former drivers, could see Uber forced to compensate drivers across the UK for missed holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage. Uber, however, says the ""vast majority"" of its drivers like being freelance. The courts ruled in favour of the drivers in 2016 and Uber lost an appeal in 2018.

Who will be the next US president? You decidePlay our game to predict whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden will win the key states at the election.,"This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states. Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Mr Trump and 233 to Mr Biden. Can Joe Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Donald Trump romp home to a second term? It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Votes:10 Mr Trump won a surprise victory in Wisconsin in 2016 by a small margin, mainly by appealing to rural areas and working-class white women. But this same group of voters helped elect a Democratic state governor two years later - and Mr Biden is currently ahead in the polls.Wisconsinites may have been put off Mr Trump by foreign trade wars that have strangled exports from the state's many dairy farmers, leading to plummeting prices and farm closures.The state has been rocked further by violent protests after a black man was shot by police in the city of Kenosha. Republicans warn that a Democrat win would bring lawlessness and further violence. But will Wisconsin voters be persuaded? Votes:11 Mr Trump scooped the traditionally Republican state in 2016, but his 4% lead was a lot smaller than those enjoyed by Republican candidates in previous elections. This time, pollsters are forecasting Mr Trump will lose to Mr Biden.The Grand Canyon state has a growing Latino population and an increasing number of rich city dwellers, who both tend to vote Democrat. The state has also been badly hit by coronavirus, so voters who think the president has handled the crisis badly may want change.But Mr Trump's focus on building a wall along the state's southern border with Mexico, and a crackdown on visas for foreign workers, could still play well with voters. Votes:15 North Carolina was a Republican stronghold before Barack Obama won with a narrow majority in 2008. That blue blip in a history of voting red suggests that a Democratic victory is not off the cards completely.Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump have shelled out millions in advertising to try to capture the state, where Mr Biden is leading in the polls.North Carolina is the first state to begin early voting by post and record numbers of requests for postal votes have flooded in - more than half of them registered Democrats. If mail-in voting swings the final result, things are looking less rosy for Mr Trump. Votes:16 Mr Trump squeaked out a win here in 2016 with just a 0.3% lead on Hillary Clinton. The traditionally Democratic, working-class state bucked a 28-year trend to elect Mr Trump after he promised trade deals to benefit manufacturing.Mr Biden, whose father was a car salesman, says he has a deep personal connection to Detroit and often visited Michigan as vice-president. He even considered popular Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate. Mr Biden's seen as a strong moderate candidate, the type that has always done well in Michigan. Votes:20 Four years ago, many western Pennsylvanians voted to preserve their way of life, which is reliant on the energy industry, and flipped the traditionally Democratic state for Mr Trump. He promised protection from Democratic promises to reform coal mining and fracking. But has Mr Trump delivered?Unemployment has hovered in double-digits since the pandemic struck. Mr Biden, who was born in the eastern town of Scranton (more well-known, perhaps, for being the home of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. in the US version of British comedy The Office), has long been a familiar face and that personal touch might carry him to victory. Votes:29 One thing is sure in Florida: its elections are always close. The Sunshine State may be the adopted second home of Mr Trump, but his victory at the last election was no landslide.The result in Florida is difficult to call because its population is diverse and ever-shifting. The state's large Cuban population leans Republican, but they tend to live in some of the most Democratic counties of the state. Pensioners from other states continue to retire to Florida, and they turn out to vote in droves. Younger voters, who tend to lean Democrat, are multiplying. And suburban voters across the state have been shifting slowly away from the Republican party.Keep your eyes peeled for Florida's result on election night: in every election bar one since 1964, the presidential candidate who has won Florida has also won the White House. Votes:16 Georgia has voted solidly Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1960. Yet this year, Mr Biden's campaign team believes he may have a shot. They're betting on support from black voters, who make up at least a quarter of all registered voters in the state.On race-related issues, Mr Biden polls far better than Mr Trump. Black Lives Matter protests have gripped national news this year, and Georgia's youth have often led the demonstrations outside major cities.But Mr Trump is pitching himself as the ""law-and-order candidate"", which could carry weight amongst white, conservative Georgians, who usually drive the state's result.It all depends on who shows up on polling day.

"Pub curfew of 10pm 'dangerous', says mayor","Social media footage showed a crowd in Hanover Street after pubs shut at 10pm The 10pm pub curfew in England is ""making things more dangerous"", Liverpool's mayor has said. Joe Anderson spoke out after crowds gathered in the city as the pubs turned out drinkers on Saturday night. Merseyside Police said there was ""a spontaneous gathering around a local street performer"" in Hanover Street, seen in footage shared on social media. A spokesperson said people ""dispersed within minutes under the close monitoring of officers and via CCTV"". Mr Anderson said the images were ""shocking but predictable"". Allow Twitter content?

The number of positive cases in Liverpool has nearly doubled to 1,214 in the week to 23 September, compared to 653 in the previous week. Under the new restrictions, which came into force on Thursday, all pubs, bars and restaurants in England are to provide table service only and must shut no later than 10pm. But concerns have been raised that the new curfew encourages customers to leave at once and carry on drinking together. New rules allow only table service in pubs Labour mayor Anderson criticised the government for its ""blanket approach"". ""You can't have off-licences and supermarkets open until midnight selling beer, and pubs emptying out at 10pm, when people go to the off-licences, buy beer, drink either out in the street in large groups or go to houses, and drink in large groups. It will just spread the virus. ""The situation currently is making things more dangerous and not better. ""I think it's stupid to close restaurants at 10pm,"" he said, adding that midnight would be ""more responsible"" and that pubs closures should be staggered. ""Some can operate till 11pm, some 12, with entertainment licences managed by local authorities. ""It's not going to be 100% successful but it'll be a lot better than what we currently have."" Mayor Joe Anderson suggested staggered closures to prevent people leaving at the same time Earlier on Sunday, shadow justice secretary David Lammyquestioned the science behind the new restrictions, saying: ""It's not clear where that came from."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the table service restrictions were to stop the flow of customers ""to and from the bar"". ""We are reducing the closing times to stop people staying later and drinking,"" he said. ""And the point about all of this is that everyone has their part to play. If we all play by the rules, we can ensure that there are not further, more draconian restrictions."" However, Mr Anderson said: ""Everybody knows what alcohol does to inhibitions in terms of people disobeying rules.""

"Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes'The New York Times alleges years of tax avoidance, a claim the US president calls âfake newsâ.Business","This video can not be played Trump describes allegations he avoided taxes as ""fake news"" Donald Trump paid just $750 (Â£580) in federal income tax both in 2016, the year he ran for the US presidency, and in his first year in the White House, the New York Times says. The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades,external- also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal ""chronic losses and years of tax avoidance"", it says. Mr Trump called the report ""fake news"". ""Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time,"" he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. ""The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me wellâ¦ they treat me very badly,"" he said. Can Donald Trump release his tax returns? Trump's taxes: What you need to know How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was ""provided by sources with legal access to it"". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. Trump v Obama: Who's made the economy fly? It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, ""largely because he reported losing much more money than he made"". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS ""portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes"". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics,the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018,external, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that ""most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate"". The Trump Organization has rejected the New York Times' allegations, saying ""most"" of the facts are inaccurate ""Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015,"" he said. By using the term ""personal taxes"", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. The newspaper also claims that ""most"" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - ""report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year"". ""That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes,"" it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from ""lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour"" from the president. President Trump, pictured in 2015 at the launch of The Celebrity Apprentice TV series, made $427.4m in 2018 from the show The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money ""from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics"". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. President Trump's golf courses in Scotland, together with one in Ireland, made $63.3m in losses in 2018, the New York Times alleges The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to ""carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years"". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story ""goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman"". ""You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat,"" he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: ""That makes me smart."" A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken ""extraordinary measures"" to ""game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes"". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.

Aldi looks at online move as shopping habits change,"Clive Perkins hasn't been to a supermarket since March, but he's just driven to an Aldi store in Loughborough to have his groceries delivered straight to his car. He's one of the first customers to try its new click and collect trial - a loyal Aldi customer for the past nine years prior to the pandemic. ""We've done everything online,"" he tells the BBC. ""We've been able to isolate because of the risk. We've got a regular slot with somebody else, but we'll drop that if this works."" For more than a decade, discounters have been the disruptors in the supermarket aisles, stealing customers from their bigger rivals and growing sales. But this pandemic has been disruptive for them. They've missed out on the huge boom in online sales and increase in convenience store sales. Now Aldi's dipping its toe into the online food market, trialling several new concepts, including a Deliveroo rapid delivery service and a click and collect service. 'Three quarters of UK does grocery shopping online' Tesco joins Morrisons to limit sales of some items Supermarkets Tesco, Asda, Aldi and Lidl go on hiring spree ""It's been an extraordinary six months, like nothing I've ever known in grocery,"" says Aldi's UK chief executive Giles Hurley. ""The business performance has been very, very solid... but we also recognise customer habits are changing and that we need to evolve our business to meet the new demands and we're actively doing that."" Aldi's boss now wants to redefine discount retailing. The click and collect trial will soon expand to 15 stores. Aldi customer Clive Perkins says he is considering switching to Click and Collect, as an alternative to online grocery deliveries ""I'm very, very confident that this is a model that we can scale successfully,"" he says. ""We have a unique model, a set of efficiency principles unrivalled in the market, and that it is my firm belief that we can apply those principles to picking and packing stock in a very efficient way for customersâ¦ I'm very excited about it."" All this would have been unthinkable for Aldi a year ago. The business has just posted its annual results for the year ending December 2019 showing an 8% increase in sales to Â£12.3bn as well as a 49% rise in pre-tax profits compared with the previous 12 months. But the pandemic has made things less easy. ""Aldi has still seen strong growth, they're still selling 10% more than they did last year, but for the first time they've grown behind the market,"" says Fraser McKevitt, Head of Retail and Consumer Insight at consumer analysts Kantar. Aldi has missed out on the extra purchasing by consumers during the pandemic, he says, especially with people shopping locally and online. ""Shoppers were also doing fewer but bigger shopping trips so with the smaller stores the discounters have, they lost out a bit on that which isn't a position they've been in before."" Mr McKevitt says he's now seen a return to more normal patterns of shopping in convenience stores in the last month and that the level of online grocery sales has reduced slightly from their earlier peak, as people relied less on online after lockdown ended. Aldi customer Clive Perkins loads groceries into his car with the help of an Aldi staff member Aldi insists it's more than holding its own and that shoppers are switching from the big four grocers to its stores. ""85% of customers still shop inside supermarkets and that still means huge opportunities for us to grow our business,"" insists Mr Hurley. And he says despite the dramatic changes in the grocery market, there's no reining back on store expansion. Aldi is still planning to add another 100 stores over the next two years, creating another 4,000 jobs in 2021. ""We're investing Â£1.3bn over this year and next, our biggest ever investment in Britain in over 30 years, expanding our business and that is testament to the confidence we have in our future here,"" he says. As job losses mount and family finances come under increasing pressure, shoppers may soon be worrying about the cost of their weekly shop, as much as about home delivery slots. The industry is bracing itself for a price war this autumn. During the last recession, savvy shoppers switched to the discounters and their lower prices. The discounters have enjoyed rapid growth ever since. Having been caught off their guard back in 2008, the big four grocers are now far better prepared and are already upping the ante with price cuts. Aldi has written to customers, asking them to buy only what they need, to prevent the food shortages seen in March when lockdown began But Aldi insists it will win this battle: ""We won't be beaten on price. We know the most important thing for our customers is value for money and this is why we've made it our mission to keep our prices the lowest in Britain."" As for reports about panic buying, Mr Hurley says there has been a bit of an uptick for certain items like toilet roll and pasta. However he insists it's nothing like what the industry experienced in March and that availability is still ""really good"". There are no plans to re-introduce restrictions although it remains under review. He's already written to customers urging them to only buy what they need. It's shaping up to be a festive period like no other, says Adam Leyland, editor of grocery trade magazine The Grocer. ""In any other recession, it would all be about price, price, price,"" he tells the BBC. ""But in the current environment with all the restrictions going on, price isn't always as important when people are locked down, it's also about availability and people are prepared to pay a premium when demand outstripped supply for online."" He thinks the shift to online - currently 12.5% of all grocery sales - is permanent, and ignoring that market altogether is a dangerous game to play. ""You can't be complacent because as a retailer you have to give the customer what they want,"" he says. He explains that both Lidl and Aldi previously used a business model for many years that had not been developed for a British market, and thus ""weren't able to make any progress"". In the past, Aldi's business model did not cater to the British market, says Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer ""Then they began evolving, from introducing shopping trolleys and credit cards to vastly expanding and improving their ranges,"" he says. ""Now Aldi are trying new things again as they realise the world's changed and if we have a second lockdown, it's even more important that they are responding."" Aldi already sells online wine and non-food. But going digital with groceries, even with a less costly click and collect service, would be a huge step. The challenge is how to do it without compromising their low-cost business model which has served them so well. The click and collect trial will be a fascinating test. The boss of Aldi says he'll be listening closely to customer feedback and as well as the demand before assessing the next steps. ""What are they waiting for?"" said one shopper. On our brief visit, it was already luring some customers back.

Football structure at risk of 'collapse',"This video can not be played How long can football clubs survive without the return of fans in the stadium? Football is now at risk of ""the collapse of the national league structure that we have known for over 100 years"", the government has been warned. A group of prominent figures has written a joint letter urging ministers to help with a coronavirus crisis rescue package. Signatories include former Football Association chairmen Greg Dyke and Lord Triesman, Sunderland shareholder Charlie Methven and broadcaster Robbie Savage. They say many EFL and National League clubs are now preparing to ""cease playing... and put their business into administration"". ""We would ask that the government now make clear what financial support it's prepared to give before it is too late,"" the group writes. ""In order for clubs to sustain themselves over the winter and keep playing, they would need to be compensated for the loss of match ticket sales. ""There is still time to act, but not long left."" Sports have been told to prepare for several more months without gate receipts after plans for some fans to return to grounds from 1 October were scrapped last week because of the rising number of coronavirus cases. EFL chairman Rick Parry told BBC Radio 5 Live on Saturday that some clubs ""are on the brink"". Culture Secretary Oliver Dowdentold the BBC on Sundayhe was ""hopeful"" the Premier League would confirm it would help lower-league clubs this week. But it is now unlikely a rescue package will be agreed this week. A meeting of the top-flight clubs will take place on Tuesday, but Premier League sources have suggested such a timeframe is unrealistic. Sports governing bodies have been asked to tell the government what they estimate they will lose in gate receipts over the next six months by Wednesday this week. The government has been told it cannot rely on the top flight, and must also provide emergency funding to cover clubs' loss of matchday revenue. ""The absence of this income is not a result of their actions, but the policies that have been put in place by the government,"" the group writes. ""It cannot be the Premier League's sole responsibility to sort out issues arising from government policy. ""The government itself needs to take responsibility or many already embattled towns - often in areas of the country which have suffered many hardships in recent decades - will lose their last focal point."" Sent to both Dowden and the Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston, the letter is also endorsed by chair of the Football Supporters' Association Malcolm Clarke, Damian Collins - former chairman of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee - and a number of other MPs. ""Without any plans being made to rescue football clubs, many in the EFL and others in the National League as well, are now actively preparing to make all but essential staff redundant, cease playing, close down their youth academies and community foundations, and put their business into administration,"" Dowden and Huddleston are told. ""This could lead not only to the failure of many historic community clubs, but the collapse of the national league structure that we have known for over 100 years."" ""These are decisions that will be made in the coming weeks, with many clubs unable to meet their payroll obligations for next month."" The group refers to the Â£1.5bn bailout that the government gave to arts and cultural organisations in July. ""We believe that football, like other well-loved professional sports in this country, is also a cultural activity,"" the signatories add.

Mayor wants 'urgent review' of 10pm pub closures,"This video can not be played Crowds in York formed after people left pubs and bars at the 22:00 curfew There should be an ""urgent review"" of 10pm closure times for restaurants and pubs, Greater Manchester's mayor says. Andy Burnham said it meant people were gathering in homes and supermarkets that were ""packed out to the rafters"" once the bars closed. Scenes of crowds forming after closing time have been filmed in UK cities including Liverpool and York. There are no specific plans to review the policy, but all measures are kept under review, the PM's spokesman said. He highlighted a police statement that said the crowds seen in Liverpool over the weekend were dispersed within minutes, with the city centre ""virtually empty"" by 22:30 BST. The 22:00 closing time had been used in local lockdown areas and experience there suggested it struck ""the right balance"", allowing businesses to trade ""for the majority of the evening"", the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government is putting into law existing guidance thatpeople from different households in the north-east of England should not mix in any indoor setting. He said the ban was being introduced from midnight on Wednesday because a ""large number"" of infections were occurring in indoor venues other than people's homes - where mixing households is already banned by law. The UK reported another 4,044 confirmed coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. A further 13 people died within 28 days of a positive test, the government said. What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? Parliament stops alcohol sales after 10pm What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Curfew bride says wedding 'no less special' Under the new restrictions, all pubs, bars and restaurants in England and Scotland must provide table service only and close by 22:00. In Wales, all licensed premises must stop selling alcohol at the same curfew timeand close 20 minutes later, at the latest,external. In Northern Ireland closing time remains at 23:30, with First Minister Arlene Foster last week saying thatno decision had yet been reachedover imposing a curfew for pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar said the closures were ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"" It comes asfines of up to Â£10,000 for refusing to self-isolatecome into force in England andthousands of students are self-isolatingin university accommodation across the UK. Mr Burnham said people gathering after closures was ""the opposite of what local restrictions here are trying to do"". ""My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good,"" the Labour politician told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there needs to be an urgent review of the emerging evidence from police forces across the country."" He suggested one option could be to impose a 21:00 cut-off on alcohol sales in shops to prevent the rush to off-licences after the pubs close. Bride Rowan McCabe was pictured on the streets of Glasgow minutes after the curfew came into force - and said nothing could ruin her special day Mr Burnham has also called for more financial support for areas under greater restrictions and tougher powers for local areas to close businesses not observing the rules. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar Sacha Lordtweeted,externalthat the plan was ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"". Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said the earlier closing time ""makes no sense"", saying figures suggested only 5% of coronavirus outbreaks were linked to hospitality. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The health secretary faced several Tory MPs in the House of Commons who criticised the way the new coronavirus regulations were introduced without Parliamentary scrutiny. Former minister Mark Harper said laws that exposed employers and directors to serious criminal penalties should not be imposed ""by decree"". And Wycombe MP Steve Baker said the measures had been briefed to the media eight days in advance, suggesting there had been time for a debate. Mr Hancock said the government had to move ""at pace"", butsaid he was looking at ways to ensure Parliament ""can be properly involved in the processin advance where possible"". Liverpool's Labour mayor Joe Andersonhas also spoken outabout the early closures, saying they are ""making things more dangerous"". Crowds gathered in the city as the pubs turned out drinkers on Saturday night. Extra restrictions on socialising between households were introduced in Greater Manchester, as well as parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire,at the end of Julyfollowing a spike in cases. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said: ""My colleagues will do the best they can to encourage and coerce people to move on but it is really difficult. ""All that you need is a hostile group that turns against those officers and the resources for that city centre are swallowed up dealing with that one incident."" Health minister Helen Whately defended the policy and urged people to head home after their evenings out. She said the government was keeping an ""open mind"" about the new regulations.

Can Donald Trump release his tax returns?,"US President Donald Trump says his tax returns are currently being audited, and that he won't release them while an inspection is continuing. But there is no legal reason why the president can't release his returns while an audit is taking place, and he would be the first in almost 50 years not to make them available. Donald Trump 'paid $750 in federal income taxes' We do not know this definitively because it's confidential. Only the person being audited or their lawyer can release that information publicly. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - which conducts the review - is not permitted to disclose if an individual's finances are under inspection. It has been common practice since the 1970s for US presidents to be audited by the IRS. It is therefore likely that President Trump's accounts have been under audit since he took office in 2017. Even before he took office, one of Mr Trump's lawyersreleased a letter,externalsaying his tax returns had been under ""continuous examination"" since 2002. The letter said an audit of his returns since 2009 was ongoing, but it also pointed out that the IRS had finished inspecting Mr Trump's accounts from 2002 to 2008. President Trump has not published his tax returns from any of these years. Before running to become president, Mr Trump said: ""If I decide to run for office, I'll produce my tax returns, absolutely."" But he has since said he will only do this once any audit is complete. Yes. Despite it being regular practice for sitting presidents to be under audit, every president since Gerald Ford has released complete tax returns while in office. Presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush both did so during their tenures, and there is no law stopping President Trump from doing the same. But he isn't legally obliged to release his tax returns publicly. There is however a law stating the president must hand over his tax returns to the US Congress to be reviewed confidentially if requested. Democratic lawmakers have requested this, but Republicans have questioned whether they can demonstrate ""a legitimate legislative purpose"" as the law requires. When asked about the law in April, President Trump said: ""No, there is no law. As you know, I got elected last time with this same issue. And while I'm under audit, I won't do it."" There is also an ongoing legal battle over the president's tax returns - but even if his financial records are turned over to prosecutors, they are likely to remain hidden from public view unless he decides to disclose them.

Mayor wants 'urgent review' of 10pm pub closuresManchester's Andy Burnham says masses of people are gathering elsewhere once bars shut.ManchesterComments,"This video can not be played Crowds in York formed after people left pubs and bars at the 22:00 curfew There should be an ""urgent review"" of 10pm closure times for restaurants and pubs, Greater Manchester's mayor says. Andy Burnham said it meant people were gathering in homes and supermarkets that were ""packed out to the rafters"" once the bars closed. Scenes of crowds forming after closing time have been filmed in UK cities including Liverpool and York. There are no specific plans to review the policy, but all measures are kept under review, the PM's spokesman said. He highlighted a police statement that said the crowds seen in Liverpool over the weekend were dispersed within minutes, with the city centre ""virtually empty"" by 22:30 BST. The 22:00 closing time had been used in local lockdown areas and experience there suggested it struck ""the right balance"", allowing businesses to trade ""for the majority of the evening"", the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government is putting into law existing guidance thatpeople from different households in the north-east of England should not mix in any indoor setting. He said the ban was being introduced from midnight on Wednesday because a ""large number"" of infections were occurring in indoor venues other than people's homes - where mixing households is already banned by law. The UK reported another 4,044 confirmed coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. A further 13 people died within 28 days of a positive test, the government said. What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? Parliament stops alcohol sales after 10pm What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Curfew bride says wedding 'no less special' Under the new restrictions, all pubs, bars and restaurants in England and Scotland must provide table service only and close by 22:00. In Wales, all licensed premises must stop selling alcohol at the same curfew timeand close 20 minutes later, at the latest,external. In Northern Ireland closing time remains at 23:30, with First Minister Arlene Foster last week saying thatno decision had yet been reachedover imposing a curfew for pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar said the closures were ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"" It comes asfines of up to Â£10,000 for refusing to self-isolatecome into force in England andthousands of students are self-isolatingin university accommodation across the UK. Mr Burnham said people gathering after closures was ""the opposite of what local restrictions here are trying to do"". ""My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good,"" the Labour politician told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there needs to be an urgent review of the emerging evidence from police forces across the country."" He suggested one option could be to impose a 21:00 cut-off on alcohol sales in shops to prevent the rush to off-licences after the pubs close. Bride Rowan McCabe was pictured on the streets of Glasgow minutes after the curfew came into force - and said nothing could ruin her special day Mr Burnham has also called for more financial support for areas under greater restrictions and tougher powers for local areas to close businesses not observing the rules. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar Sacha Lordtweeted,externalthat the plan was ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"". Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said the earlier closing time ""makes no sense"", saying figures suggested only 5% of coronavirus outbreaks were linked to hospitality. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The health secretary faced several Tory MPs in the House of Commons who criticised the way the new coronavirus regulations were introduced without Parliamentary scrutiny. Former minister Mark Harper said laws that exposed employers and directors to serious criminal penalties should not be imposed ""by decree"". And Wycombe MP Steve Baker said the measures had been briefed to the media eight days in advance, suggesting there had been time for a debate. Mr Hancock said the government had to move ""at pace"", butsaid he was looking at ways to ensure Parliament ""can be properly involved in the processin advance where possible"". Liverpool's Labour mayor Joe Andersonhas also spoken outabout the early closures, saying they are ""making things more dangerous"". Crowds gathered in the city as the pubs turned out drinkers on Saturday night. Extra restrictions on socialising between households were introduced in Greater Manchester, as well as parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire,at the end of Julyfollowing a spike in cases. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said: ""My colleagues will do the best they can to encourage and coerce people to move on but it is really difficult. ""All that you need is a hostile group that turns against those officers and the resources for that city centre are swallowed up dealing with that one incident."" Health minister Helen Whately defended the policy and urged people to head home after their evenings out. She said the government was keeping an ""open mind"" about the new regulations.

Covid rule-breakers face crackdown as fines rise,"A man self-isolating in April receives groceries from a local community group in High Wycombe Refusing to self-isolate when told to is now illegal in England, with fines of up to Â£10,000. Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19, or has been told they have been in contact with someone who has, now has a legal duty to quarantine. It comes as a study commissioned by the government found just 18% of people who had symptoms went into isolation. Meanwhile, the government has promised an ""uninterrupted supply"" of PPE for front-line workers over the winter. Four-month stockpiles of PPE - personal protective equipment such as masks, visors and gowns - will be available from November, the Department of Health has said. What are the self-isolation rules? The latest social distancing rules in England From Monday, it will be a punishable offence not to comply with an official instruction to self-isolate, with fines starting at Â£1,000 and rising to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders or serious breaches. Police officers can check that people are complying with the rules in virus hotspots and among high-risk groups based on ""local intelligence"", the government said. The law applies to people who have tested positive for coronavirus, or who have been told by NHS Test and Trace to self-isolate because they have been in close contact with someone with the virus. And if someone tests positive, it is illegal to knowingly give false information about their close contacts to NHS Test and Trace. This video can not be played Five ways to self-isolate successfully to prevent the spread of coronavirus People on low incomes who cannot work and are losing income while self isolating will be able to get a Â£500 payment. Nearly four million people who receive benefits in England will be eligible for the money, and it will be backdated once the scheme is properly set up in their council area, the Department of Health said. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the NHS Test and Trace App, which launched on Thursday, had been downloaded by 10m people by midday on Sunday. If the app tells you to self-isolate, you're supposed to, but it isnot a legal requirement,externalin the same way as when you test positive for the virus or are contacted directly by NHS test and trace. Home Secretary Priti Patel added the new fines were ""a clear sign that we will not allow those who break the rules to reverse the hard-won progress made by the law-abiding majority"". And Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government would ""not hesitate"" to introduce further measures if case numbers continued to rise. NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson told BBC Breakfast that NHS Test and Trace ""has now become as important in a sense as catching criminals, fighting fires and treating heart attacks"". ""It's a key public service and if it doesn't work, then we all suffer,"" he said. ""We've all got a role to play in making this service work - if you've got symptoms you need to get a test quickly; if the test turns out positive you've got to self-isolate, you've then got to pass your contacts on to Test and Trace."" He said that going into winter the country would need ""probably four times as many tests as we've currently got"" and he said there was a need to build testing facilities much closer to where people live and work. This video can not be played Are the lockdown restrictions too strict? As of the last week of August, more than 19,000 fines had been issued in England and Wales for alleged breaches of coronavirus laws, a letter from the attorney general said. The UK government hopes the new fines will be replicated in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - which all have powers to set their own coronavirus rules. Earlier this month, the Scottish health secretarysaid the issue would be under discussion. Meanwhile, Wales is the latest part of the UK tobring in further local lockdown rules,with new restrictions in Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan from 18:00 BST on Monday. It will mean nearly two-thirds of Wales' population will be under lockdown - with people not allowed to enter or leave their county unless for a limited number of reasons and banned from meeting other households indoors. The latest lockdown rules in Wales Thegovernment's self-isolation rules,externalmean a person cannot leave their house - even to buy food or other essentials, or to exercise. It requires anyone with symptoms or a positive test result to isolate for 10 days, while members of their household or people who have been contacted by Test and Trace must quarantine for 14 days. The crackdown on self-isolating comesas research carried out for the Department of Health,externalfound that the number of people with symptoms following the self-isolation rules was low. Although people's intention to self-isolate was high - about 70% - only 11% of people went into quarantine after being asked to by NHS Test and Trace. The most common reasons that people gave for not self-isolating were because they needed to go to the shops for groceries or a pharmacy or because their symptoms got better. Men and younger people were also less likely to follow the test, trace and isolate guidance, the research added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? Mr Hancock has also promised that health and social care workers will get enough PPE, as the number of UK coronavirus cases rises again. He said it had been a ""massive challenge"" to get enough at the start of the pandemic - when health and care staff warned of widespread shortages. ""That's why we have worked every day since to ensure we have an uninterrupted supply to meet the challenges in the coming months and protect those who are protecting us,"" he said.

Online lessons at Manchester Met amid virus cases,"Students at Manchester Metropolitan face isolation after a Covid outbreak About 40 universities around the UK have had reports of coronavirus cases and thousands of students are self-isolating as the new term begins. The University of Aberystwyth is the latest to suspend face-to-face teaching because of Covid-19. But the prime minister's spokesman said students would be able to go home for the Christmas break. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon said ensuring students could go home at Christmas would be a priority. On whether students in England should receive a fees refund, the prime minister's spokesman said universities were autonomous and would make their own decisions. But the Office for Students, the watchdog for higher education in England, indicated that universities would have to seriously consider requests for a partial refund and must not ""adopt a blanket policy that refunds are not available"". Manchester lockdown students feel neglected Tips and tricks for coping at uni in a pandemic Can students get their money back this year? 'Don't scapegoat students' for campus Covid outbreaks Join the debate in our BBC News Students group on Facebook,external Manchester Metropolitan University has offered a two-week rent rebate and Â£50 supermarket voucher for students in two halls of residence affected by outbreaks. Some students have questioned why they were told to leave home and pay for accommodation when most teaching is being done remotely. NHS staff hand out test kits to Glasgow University students There has also been uncertainty about when students can visit their homes. Labour says pausing the return of universities should be considered, rather than risk further Covid outbreaks and self-isolation for students. There are no official figures on university Covid outbreaks from the government, the Office for Students or Universities UK - but a tracking of local reports suggests more than 40 universities have had Covid cases so far, out of about 130 in total. In the absence of official information, websites such asUnicovid,external, run by academics, have gathered data. In Wales, the University of Aberystwyth said that from Monday in-person teaching would be temporarily suspended and courses would be taught online. At Manchester Metropolitan University, all classes for first year and foundation year students will be online for the next 14 days. At the University of Essex acluster of cases has been linked to sports teams. Warnings about staying safe at Queen's University Belfast Universities affected by coronavirus cases include: Manchester Metropolitan University -where about 1,700 students have been told to isolate for a fortnightafter 127 tested positive for the virus Glasgow University -where 600 students were told to self-isolateafter 172 tested positive Queen's University Belfast -100 students have been told to self-isolate after 30 positive cases Many universities had promised students a mix of in-person and online teaching. But with more switching to online there have been questions about students getting a refund or if they should be paying for university accommodation if lessons are delivered remotely. Labour shadow education secretary Kate Green said the option of student fee rebates should be kept ""absolutely on the table"". Students contacting the BBC have reported confusion and uncertainty about Covid outbreaks. ""A lot of people we know just left because they didn't want to get stuck here,"" said Eve, a first year at Manchester Metropolitan University. ""I can't go home because I live with my grandad and I don't want to risk him getting sick,"" she said. ""They're turning round and blaming us and telling us it's our fault when it was the uni that told us to come here in the first place."" This video can not be played Student Joe Gallagher believes the outbreak was ""inevitable"" Parents have concerns too. Lluis Borrell has twin sons starting at Warwick and Nottingham and is worried about the risk of Covid and the negative impact of restricting students to staying within a small group of people. ""I understand the rules are needed but it makes any socialising very difficult,"" said Mr Borrell from Cambridge. ""Is this fair? Should he have gone in the first instance? ""It feels like they have gone there just to get Covid."" Another student at the University of Leeds, who wanted her name withheld, was so unhappy that she is planning to leave. She said that she did not get on with the her neighbouring students, but is not allowed to meet students from other halls. ""We do not want to be stuck in our small bedroom in a space we have only just come to. ""We are paying so much money for this,"" she said. Manchester Metropolitan University students Natasha Kutscheruk and Joe Ward Joe Ward at Manchester Metropolitan University said: ""If I was made aware that this is how things would be and things would only be online then I definitely would have reconsidered going to university this year."" ""I would definitely like to think that there might be some sort of compensation,"" he said. His flatmate Natasha Kutscheruk said the initial lockdown ""caused a lot of panic"", saying the university ""should have been prepared and organised before sending out an email saying we are locked down"". Almost a third of universities have had Covid cases already - and the new term is only getting underway, with more students still returning. So the number of outbreaks is only likely to increase - raising urgent questions for university bosses, watchdogs and ministers about what should happen next. It's not exactly the university experience that students imagined. First years might be worried about going away from home, but they might now also be worried about not being able to get back, if they end up in an outbreak and are forced to self-isolate. They were promised a mix of face-to-face and online teaching and have paid for accommodation - but the balance seems to be shifting more towards online lessons. This means even less in-person time with other students and staff and more hours cooped up in their room with online recordings and academic versions of Zoom meetings. So should universities just press on with this online-but-on-campus approach? Is it realistic for the rest of term? Or will it mean a loop tape of outbreaks and lockdowns? Or do ministers or health officials step in and urge more students to study from home where possible? Universities cherish their autonomy, but in this case it feels as though they're waiting for someone else to make a decision for them. For students in England, the prime minister's spokesman said on Monday that students should follow health advice just like the wider public. If they have tested positive or have symptoms they do need to self isolate - and should follow any local restrictions in place, said the spokesman. But it was expected that all students would be able to return home at Christmas, said the PM's spokesman, after suggestions that students might have to remain in their student accommodation. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? In Scotland, a briefing from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered reassurance that students could return home for the Christmas break. There has beennew guidance issued by the Scottish governmentwhich allows short home visits if there is a ""reasonable excuse"" such as a bereavement or family emergency. Students can also move home and study from there permanently, but the default advice is to stay in university accommodation where possible. Are you a student? How are the rules affecting you?

Uber secures right to continue operating in London,"Uber has secured its right to continue operating in London after a judge upheld its appeal against Transport for London (TfL). The ride-hailing giant has been granted a new licence to work in the capital, nearly a year after TfL rejected its application over safety concerns. It ends uncertainty for the 45,000 drivers who use the taxi app in London. Westminster Magistrates' Court said Uber was now a ""fit and proper"" operator ""despite historical failings"". One of the main concerns raised by TfL was a flaw in Uber's system that allowed unauthorised people to upload their photographs to legitimate drivers' accounts, which then allowed them to pick up passengers. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard that 24 drivers shared their accounts with 20 others which led to 14,788 rides. Want an Uber? Send a selfie proving you are wearing a mask Uber's self-driving operator charged over fatal crash Uber pledges all-electric fleet by 2040 Uber's regional general manager for Northern and Eastern Europe, Jamie Heywood, said: ""It was not what we would do now. It was inadequate, we could have done better."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said TfL was ""absolutely right"" not to renew Uber licence last year but acknowledged the company had ""made improvements"". However, he added: ""I can assure Londoners that TfL will continue to closely monitor Uber and will not hesitate to take swift action should they fail to meet the strict standards required to protect passengers."" Deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said he took Uber's ""track-record of regulation breaches"" into account but said it had made efforts to address failings and had improved standards. ""Despite their historical failings, I find them, now, to be a fit and proper person to hold a London PHV [private hire vehicle] operator's licence,"" he said. The judge said Uber ""does not have a perfect record but it has been an improving picture"". ""The test as to whether [Uber] are a 'fit and proper person' does not require perfection. I am satisfied that they are doing what a reasonable business in their sector could be expected to do, perhaps even more."" The new licence will run for 18 months and comes with a number of conditions, allowing TfL to closely monitor Uber's adherence to the regulations. Uber's Mr Heywood said: ""This decision is a recognition of Uber's commitment to safety and we will continue to work constructively with TfL."" With 45,000 drivers on its books in London, Uber is a force to be reckoned with. But the body in charge of licensing in London has gone out of its way to take Uber on. Transport for London (TfL) did manage to draw attention to a previous flaw in Uber's system which allowed unauthorised drivers to ferry people around. TfL piled on the pressure and, according to a judge, Uber's safety record has improved. But when it refused to renew Uber's license, TfL knew that a judge would have the ultimate call. And at no point did anyone have to tell Uber's users in London that they couldn't order a cab. Talking tough on Uber is one thing. But banishing it from a key European capital would carry significant consequences. TfL originally refused to renew Uber's licence in September 2017. The company then won a 15-month licence by a judge in June 2018 after taking the case to court. Uber was granted a two-month extension to its licence in September last year, but in NovemberTfL decided not to grant it a new licence,external. At the time, TfL said it had ""identified a pattern of failures by the company including several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk"". Uber appealed against the decision and was allowed to keep operating throughout the process. Business campaign group London First said Monday's decision was ""good news for millions of Londoners and visitors who rely on Uber to get around the capital"". However, the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association said it was a ""disaster for London"". ""Uber has demonstrated time and time again that it simply can't be trusted to put the safety of Londoners, its drivers and other road users above profit,"" it said. ""Sadly, it seems that Uber is too big to regulate effectively but too big to fail."" Uber is still awaitinga separate UK court rulingover whether its drivers should be classed as workers or self-employed. The case, brought by two former drivers, could see Uber forced to compensate drivers across the UK for missed holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the national minimum wage. Uber, however, says the ""vast majority"" of its drivers like being freelance. The courts ruled in favour of the drivers in 2016 and Uber lost an appeal in 2018. A judgement on the firm's final appeal to the Supreme Court is expected soon.

Who will be the next US president? You decidePlay our game to predict whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden will win the key states at the election.Who will be the next US president? You decidePlay our game to predict whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden will win the key states at the election.,"This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states. Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Mr Trump and 233 to Mr Biden. Can Joe Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Donald Trump romp home to a second term? It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Votes:10 Mr Trump won a surprise victory in Wisconsin in 2016 by a small margin, mainly by appealing to rural areas and working-class white women. But this same group of voters helped elect a Democratic state governor two years later - and Mr Biden is currently ahead in the polls.Wisconsinites may have been put off Mr Trump by foreign trade wars that have strangled exports from the state's many dairy farmers, leading to plummeting prices and farm closures.The state has been rocked further by violent protests after a black man was shot by police in the city of Kenosha. Republicans warn that a Democrat win would bring lawlessness and further violence. But will Wisconsin voters be persuaded? Votes:11 Mr Trump scooped the traditionally Republican state in 2016, but his 4% lead was a lot smaller than those enjoyed by Republican candidates in previous elections. This time, pollsters are forecasting Mr Trump will lose to Mr Biden.The Grand Canyon state has a growing Latino population and an increasing number of rich city dwellers, who both tend to vote Democrat. The state has also been badly hit by coronavirus, so voters who think the president has handled the crisis badly may want change.But Mr Trump's focus on building a wall along the state's southern border with Mexico, and a crackdown on visas for foreign workers, could still play well with voters. Votes:15 North Carolina was a Republican stronghold before Barack Obama won with a narrow majority in 2008. That blue blip in a history of voting red suggests that a Democratic victory is not off the cards completely.Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump have shelled out millions in advertising to try to capture the state, where Mr Biden is leading in the polls.North Carolina is the first state to begin early voting by post and record numbers of requests for postal votes have flooded in - more than half of them registered Democrats. If mail-in voting swings the final result, things are looking less rosy for Mr Trump. Votes:16 Mr Trump squeaked out a win here in 2016 with just a 0.3% lead on Hillary Clinton. The traditionally Democratic, working-class state bucked a 28-year trend to elect Mr Trump after he promised trade deals to benefit manufacturing.Mr Biden, whose father was a car salesman, says he has a deep personal connection to Detroit and often visited Michigan as vice-president. He even considered popular Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate. Mr Biden's seen as a strong moderate candidate, the type that has always done well in Michigan. Votes:20 Four years ago, many western Pennsylvanians voted to preserve their way of life, which is reliant on the energy industry, and flipped the traditionally Democratic state for Mr Trump. He promised protection from Democratic promises to reform coal mining and fracking. But has Mr Trump delivered?Unemployment has hovered in double-digits since the pandemic struck. Mr Biden, who was born in the eastern town of Scranton (more well-known, perhaps, for being the home of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. in the US version of British comedy The Office), has long been a familiar face and that personal touch might carry him to victory. Votes:29 One thing is sure in Florida: its elections are always close. The Sunshine State may be the adopted second home of Mr Trump, but his victory at the last election was no landslide.The result in Florida is difficult to call because its population is diverse and ever-shifting. The state's large Cuban population leans Republican, but they tend to live in some of the most Democratic counties of the state. Pensioners from other states continue to retire to Florida, and they turn out to vote in droves. Younger voters, who tend to lean Democrat, are multiplying. And suburban voters across the state have been shifting slowly away from the Republican party.Keep your eyes peeled for Florida's result on election night: in every election bar one since 1964, the presidential candidate who has won Florida has also won the White House. Votes:16 Georgia has voted solidly Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1960. Yet this year, Mr Biden's campaign team believes he may have a shot. They're betting on support from black voters, who make up at least a quarter of all registered voters in the state.On race-related issues, Mr Biden polls far better than Mr Trump. Black Lives Matter protests have gripped national news this year, and Georgia's youth have often led the demonstrations outside major cities.But Mr Trump is pitching himself as the ""law-and-order candidate"", which could carry weight amongst white, conservative Georgians, who usually drive the state's result.It all depends on who shows up on polling day.  First to 270 wins   Click here if you can't see the interactive,external In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. Two independent American sources, Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report, publish lists of states grouped by how they are expected to vote on election night. Several states are classified as ""toss-ups"", which means they could be won by either side. We chose our seven key states from those toss-ups which have enough electoral votes to sway the final outcome and where we expect the battle to be fought most closely. President Trump won all of them in 2016 Since most states are already tipped to vote one way or another, we've assigned their respective electoral votes to the candidate that each is considered most likely to vote for. This means the game starts at 188 votes for Mr Trump and 233 for Mr Biden. Technically, yes. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes and it is possible for two candidates to win states in such a way that each will come out with 269 votes. Awkward. It's also possible for no candidate to receive a majority. To determine a single winner, the US House of Representatives will vote for the next president and the US Senate will vote for the next vice-president. This is so rare, though, that it's only happened a few times in US historyâ¦ and not since the 19th Century.

Mayor wants 'urgent review' of 10pm closures,"This video can not be played Crowds in York formed after people left pubs and bars at the 22:00 curfew There should be an ""urgent review"" of 10pm closure times for restaurants and pubs, Greater Manchester's mayor says. Andy Burnham said it meant people were gathering in homes and supermarkets that were ""packed out to the rafters"" once the bars closed. Scenes of crowds forming after closing time have been filmed in UK cities including Liverpool and York. There are no specific plans to review the policy, but all measures are kept under review, the PM's spokesman said. He highlighted a police statement that said the crowds seen in Liverpool over the weekend were dispersed within minutes, with the city centre ""virtually empty"" by 22:30 BST. The 22:00 closing time had been used in local lockdown areas and experience there suggested it struck ""the right balance"", allowing businesses to trade ""for the majority of the evening"", the spokesman added. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government is putting into law existing guidance thatpeople from different households in the north-east of England should not mix in any indoor setting. He said the ban was being introduced from midnight on Wednesday because a ""large number"" of infections were occurring in indoor venues other than people's homes - where mixing households is already banned by law. The UK reported another 4,044 confirmed coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. A further 13 people died within 28 days of a positive test, the government said. What's the evidence for 10pm pub closing time? Parliament stops alcohol sales after 10pm What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Curfew bride says wedding 'no less special' Under the new restrictions, all pubs, bars and restaurants in England and Scotland must provide table service only and close by 22:00. In Wales, all licensed premises must stop selling alcohol at the same curfew timeand close 20 minutes later, at the latest,external. In Northern Ireland closing time remains at 23:30, with First Minister Arlene Foster last week saying thatno decision had yet been reachedover imposing a curfew for pubs and restaurants. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar said the closures were ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"" It comes asfines of up to Â£10,000 for refusing to self-isolatecome into force in England andthousands of students are self-isolatingin university accommodation across the UK. Mr Burnham said people gathering after closures was ""the opposite of what local restrictions here are trying to do"". ""My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good,"" the Labour politician told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there needs to be an urgent review of the emerging evidence from police forces across the country."" He suggested one option could be to impose a 21:00 cut-off on alcohol sales in shops to prevent the rush to off-licences after the pubs close. Bride Rowan McCabe was pictured on the streets of Glasgow minutes after the curfew came into force - and said nothing could ruin her special day Mr Burnham has also called for more financial support for areas under greater restrictions and tougher powers for local areas to close businesses not observing the rules. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar Sacha Lordtweeted,externalthat the plan was ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"". Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said the earlier closing time ""makes no sense"", saying figures suggested only 5% of coronavirus outbreaks were linked to hospitality. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The health secretary faced several Tory MPs in the House of Commons who criticised the way the new coronavirus regulations were introduced without Parliamentary scrutiny. Former minister Mark Harper said laws that exposed employers and directors to serious criminal penalties should not be imposed ""by decree"". And Wycombe MP Steve Baker said the measures had been briefed to the media eight days in advance, suggesting there had been time for a debate. Mr Hancock said the government had to move ""at pace"", butsaid he was looking at ways to ensure Parliament ""can be properly involved in the processin advance where possible"". Liverpool's Labour mayor Joe Andersonhas also spoken outabout the early closures, saying they are ""making things more dangerous"". Crowds gathered in the city as the pubs turned out drinkers on Saturday night. Extra restrictions on socialising between households were introduced in Greater Manchester, as well as parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire,at the end of Julyfollowing a spike in cases. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said: ""My colleagues will do the best they can to encourage and coerce people to move on but it is really difficult. ""All that you need is a hostile group that turns against those officers and the resources for that city centre are swallowed up dealing with that one incident."" Health minister Helen Whately defended the policy and urged people to head home after their evenings out. She said the government was keeping an ""open mind"" about the new regulations.

TikTok: US judge halts app store ban,"TikTok has avoided a government-ordered block on new downloads in the US after a judge issued a temporary injunction. The video-sharing app had faced being removed from Apple's App Store and Android's Google Play marketplace at midnight local time in Washington DC. Existing US-based users would have been able to have continued using it. But they would not have been able to have re-downloaded the app if they had deleted it from their phones, nor have been offered software updates. Judge Carl Nichols of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued the injunction on Sunday evening having held a 90-minute hearing earlier in the day. He wrote that the government had ""provided ample evidence that China presents a significant national security threat"", but added that specific evidence that TikTok itself posed a risk and that taking its app off stores was the required was ""less substantial"". TikTok welcomed the intervention, and vowed to keep defending its rights. ""We're pleased that the court agreed with our legal arguments and issued an injunction preventing the implementation of the TikTok app ban,"" it said in a statement. TikTok: Oracle confirms being picked by Bytedance to be app's partner TikTok and WeChat: US to ban app downloads in 48 hours TikTok: What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat TikTok had argued that forcing it off the iOS and Android app stores would have violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the US constitution. It claimed that preventing some users joining the app unlawfully impinged upon their freedom of speech and that the firm's own right to due process would have been breached by not giving it a proper opportunity to defend itself first. ""How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations underway that might make it unnecessary?"" added a member of the app's legal team. The US government's lawyers in turn had described the app's parent as being ""a mouthpiece"" for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The ruling comes one week after another Chinese app - WeChat - that also faced a ban, wasgiven its own last minute reprieve by the US courts. The long-term fate of TikTok in the US is still unclear. At present it is owned by a Chinese company, Bytedance, but operated as a separate entity to Douyin - a parallel version used by Chinese consumers. The Trump administration has claimed Bytedance's involvement poses a unacceptable national security threat, because it would have to comply with an order to support the CCP's ""malicious collection of American citizens' personal data"". Bytedance denies this, saying that TikTok's user data is kept in the US and Singapore, andso is not subject to Chinese law,external. Even so, after being threatened with a ban, a week ago TikTok said that it had agreed a dealto let database company Oracle and retail giant Walmart take up to a 20% stakein a new spun-off entity called TikTok Globalahead of shares in the endeavour being floated,external. But President Trump subsequently said he would not accept any arrangement that did not involveBytedance ceding controlto the two US firms. TikTok's statement on Monday suggested negotiations over the deal were still ongoing. ""We will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement,"" it said. TikTok's audience skews younger than that of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter To further complicate matters, Beijing has yet to announce whether it will grant Bytedance a licence to include TikTok's algorithms in any deal. Algorithms power the app's recommendation engine, deciding which videos to show to each user, based on the ways they have previously interacted with the product. The algorithms are highly responsive to each person's interests, quickly picking up on shifts in behaviour, and are credited with helping make the app so popular. If China refused to let them be included in a deal, it could scupper any sell-off. TikTok really has morphed into a platform that rivals Instagram and Facebook in America. For the US to ban the app would be simply unprecedented. And for now, it's been given a stay of execution. The court will now take its time, as it looks into whether it's a threat to national security. One thing that was striking in the open evidence presented though was that there was no smoking gun. There were lots of assertions, for example that TikTok's owner Bytedance was a ""mouthpiece"" for the Chinese government, but no killer punch. What this delay does is buy TikTok much needed time. They need to do three things. Wrap up a deal with Oracle and Walmart, get Trump to support it and then get the Chinese government to approve it. And all whilst the clock runs down. This TikTok saga isn't even close to being done. TikTok has said it has more than 100 million active users in the US and about 700 million worldwide. It has claimed even a temporary ban would threaten its business. ""[A] ban will cause our user base to stagnate and then precipitously decline,"" wroteinterim boss Vanessa Pappas in a court filing,external. ""For TikTok to remain competitive, continued growth at this stage in our development is critical."" The US government has issued two executive orders targeting TikTok. While the first is designed to prevent it being distributed via Apple and Google, the second is more far-reaching. Due to come into force on 12 November,external, it is designed to shut the app down outright in the US, if the president's national security concerns are not resolved.

Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar said the closures were ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"" It comes asfines of up to Â£10,000 for refusing to self-isolatecome into force in England andthousands of students are self-isolatingin university accommodation across the UK. Mr Burnham said people gathering after closures was ""the opposite of what local restrictions here are trying to do"". ""My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good,"" the Labour politician told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I think there needs to be an urgent review of the emerging evidence from police forces across the country."" He suggested one option could be to impose a 21:00 cut-off on alcohol sales in shops to prevent the rush to off-licences after the pubs close. Bride Rowan McCabe was pictured on the streets of Glasgow minutes after the curfew came into force - and said nothing could ruin her special day Mr Burnham has also called for more financial support for areas under greater restrictions and tougher powers for local areas to close businesses not observing the rules. Greater Manchester's night-time economy tsar Sacha Lordtweeted,externalthat the plan was ""ill-thought-out"" and ""shambolic"". Senior Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood said the earlier closing time ""makes no sense"", saying figures suggested only 5% of coronavirus outbreaks were linked to hospitality. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? The health secretary faced several Tory MPs in the House of Commons who criticised the way the new coronavirus regulations were introduced without Parliamentary scrutiny. Former minister Mark Harper said laws that exposed employers and directors to serious criminal penalties should not be imposed ""by decree"". And Wycombe MP Steve Baker said the measures had been briefed to the media eight days in advance, suggesting there had been time for a debate. Mr Hancock said the government had to move ""at pace"", butsaid he was looking at ways to ensure Parliament ""can be properly involved in the processin advance where possible"". Liverpool's Labour mayor Joe Andersonhas also spoken outabout the early closures, saying they are ""making things more dangerous"". Crowds gathered in the city as the pubs turned out drinkers on Saturday night. Extra restrictions on socialising between households were introduced in Greater Manchester, as well as parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire,at the end of Julyfollowing a spike in cases. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation, said: ""My colleagues will do the best they can to encourage and coerce people to move on but it is really difficult. ""All that you need is a hostile group that turns against those officers and the resources for that city centre are swallowed up dealing with that one incident."" Health minister Helen Whately defended the policy and urged people to head home after their evenings out. She said the government was keeping an ""open mind"" about the new regulations. Supermarkets 'should enforce mask-wearing' Pub curfew of 10pm 'dangerous', says mayor Moral duty to get all children back in school - PM Visiting people at home banned in parts of England Local tracing launched as NHS 'not fast enough' Pubs 'may need to shut' to allow schools to reopen National test and trace 'hampering' virus control Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them? 2024 first year to pass 1.5C global warming limit Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Who will be the next US president?Play our game to predict whether Donald Trump or Joe Biden will win the key states at the election.,"This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states. Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Mr Trump and 233 to Mr Biden. Can Joe Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Donald Trump romp home to a second term? It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Votes:10 Mr Trump won a surprise victory in Wisconsin in 2016 by a small margin, mainly by appealing to rural areas and working-class white women. But this same group of voters helped elect a Democratic state governor two years later - and Mr Biden is currently ahead in the polls.Wisconsinites may have been put off Mr Trump by foreign trade wars that have strangled exports from the state's many dairy farmers, leading to plummeting prices and farm closures.The state has been rocked further by violent protests after a black man was shot by police in the city of Kenosha. Republicans warn that a Democrat win would bring lawlessness and further violence. But will Wisconsin voters be persuaded? Votes:11 Mr Trump scooped the traditionally Republican state in 2016, but his 4% lead was a lot smaller than those enjoyed by Republican candidates in previous elections. This time, pollsters are forecasting Mr Trump will lose to Mr Biden.The Grand Canyon state has a growing Latino population and an increasing number of rich city dwellers, who both tend to vote Democrat. The state has also been badly hit by coronavirus, so voters who think the president has handled the crisis badly may want change.But Mr Trump's focus on building a wall along the state's southern border with Mexico, and a crackdown on visas for foreign workers, could still play well with voters. Votes:15 North Carolina was a Republican stronghold before Barack Obama won with a narrow majority in 2008. That blue blip in a history of voting red suggests that a Democratic victory is not off the cards completely.Both Mr Biden and Mr Trump have shelled out millions in advertising to try to capture the state, where Mr Biden is leading in the polls.North Carolina is the first state to begin early voting by post and record numbers of requests for postal votes have flooded in - more than half of them registered Democrats. If mail-in voting swings the final result, things are looking less rosy for Mr Trump. Votes:16 Mr Trump squeaked out a win here in 2016 with just a 0.3% lead on Hillary Clinton. The traditionally Democratic, working-class state bucked a 28-year trend to elect Mr Trump after he promised trade deals to benefit manufacturing.Mr Biden, whose father was a car salesman, says he has a deep personal connection to Detroit and often visited Michigan as vice-president. He even considered popular Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer as his running mate. Mr Biden's seen as a strong moderate candidate, the type that has always done well in Michigan. Votes:20 Four years ago, many western Pennsylvanians voted to preserve their way of life, which is reliant on the energy industry, and flipped the traditionally Democratic state for Mr Trump. He promised protection from Democratic promises to reform coal mining and fracking. But has Mr Trump delivered?Unemployment has hovered in double-digits since the pandemic struck. Mr Biden, who was born in the eastern town of Scranton (more well-known, perhaps, for being the home of Dunder Mifflin Paper Company, Inc. in the US version of British comedy The Office), has long been a familiar face and that personal touch might carry him to victory. Votes:29 One thing is sure in Florida: its elections are always close. The Sunshine State may be the adopted second home of Mr Trump, but his victory at the last election was no landslide.The result in Florida is difficult to call because its population is diverse and ever-shifting. The state's large Cuban population leans Republican, but they tend to live in some of the most Democratic counties of the state. Pensioners from other states continue to retire to Florida, and they turn out to vote in droves. Younger voters, who tend to lean Democrat, are multiplying. And suburban voters across the state have been shifting slowly away from the Republican party.Keep your eyes peeled for Florida's result on election night: in every election bar one since 1964, the presidential candidate who has won Florida has also won the White House. Votes:16 Georgia has voted solidly Republican in all but two presidential elections since 1960. Yet this year, Mr Biden's campaign team believes he may have a shot. They're betting on support from black voters, who make up at least a quarter of all registered voters in the state.On race-related issues, Mr Biden polls far better than Mr Trump. Black Lives Matter protests have gripped national news this year, and Georgia's youth have often led the demonstrations outside major cities.But Mr Trump is pitching himself as the ""law-and-order candidate"", which could carry weight amongst white, conservative Georgians, who usually drive the state's result.It all depends on who shows up on polling day.  First to 270 wins   Click here if you can't see the interactive,external In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. Two independent American sources, Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report, publish lists of states grouped by how they are expected to vote on election night. Several states are classified as ""toss-ups"", which means they could be won by either side. We chose our seven key states from those toss-ups which have enough electoral votes to sway the final outcome and where we expect the battle to be fought most closely. President Trump won all of them in 2016 Since most states are already tipped to vote one way or another, we've assigned their respective electoral votes to the candidate that each is considered most likely to vote for. This means the game starts at 188 votes for Mr Trump and 233 for Mr Biden. Technically, yes. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes and it is possible for two candidates to win states in such a way that each will come out with 269 votes. Awkward. It's also possible for no candidate to receive a majority. To determine a single winner, the US House of Representatives will vote for the next president and the US Senate will vote for the next vice-president.

Gove heads to Brussels as EU trade talks resume,"This video can not be played Michael Gove says the two sides would use âevery second, every minute, every hour in order to reach agreementâ. Michael Gove has said parts of a bill which override provisions in the Brexit deal agreed with the EU would remain, despite EU requests to remove them. The Cabinet Office minister said he is ""committed"" to reaching a deal on the UK's future relationship with the EU. He met the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to discuss the UK's future relationship with the EU on Monday. Mr Sefcovic said the UK's negotiating position is still ""far apart from what the EU can accept"". Formal trade talks resume on Tuesday. Mr Gove said the talks on implementing the withdrawal agreement are at a ""healthy stage"". But both sides say there is still disagreement over the UK's plan to override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland in a bill currently going through the House of Commons. Speaking after his meeting with Mr Gove, Vice President Mr Sefcovic said there was a ""window of opportunity"" to come to an agreement on the Northern Ireland protocol, but added that was ""rapidly closing"". Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Seven things that will change on 1 January The disagreement centres on the UK government's Internal Market Bill, which would override agreements made on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The agreement aimed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is still part of the EU. Mr Sefcovic repeated the EU's request for the UK to remove the ""contentious parts"" of the bill by the end of September. This video can not be played Maros Sefcovic says ""much work remains to be done"" to reach a trade deal with the UK. He said the EU would ""not be shy"" in using ""legal remedies"" written into the withdrawal agreement to address any ""violations"". But Mr Gove said the provisions on Northern Ireland would remain in the Internal Market Bill. ""There are those in European Union who have been concerned about clauses in Internal Market Bill but I was able to stress today these clauses are a safety net,"" he said. He added: ""We want to reach agreement in the joint committee, we want to make sure position of Northern Ireland is secure in UK, we want to make sure the withdrawal agreement is implemented in full. But those clauses are there, they are in legislation, supported by the House of Commons...and those clauses will remain in that bill."" The UK government has previously said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". The bill is set to be debated by MPs on Tuesday. The Brexit transition period, in which the UK has kept to EU trading rules, ends on 31 December. The UK and EU are yet to agree a deal that will govern their future trade. Ahead of the resumption of trade talks, a UK government spokesperson said while this week represented the final formal round of negotiations, he expected discussions to continue up to a meeting of the EU Council, scheduled for 15 October. He described the atmosphere as positive but added that ""much was to be done"". Other long-running sticking points that could stymie negotiations include state aid and fishing access. During this week's talks, negotiators will also discuss law enforcement and transport. The two chief negotiators - the EU's Mr Barnier and the UK's David Frost will meet on Friday morning. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said sources in government say that while progress is being made, there are ""fundamental gaps"" between the two sides and talk of ""optimism"" in recent days has been overstated. Time is tight and there is no breakthrough... yet. A sentence you may just have heard before in these Brexit negotiations. The chief negotiators on both sides - Lord Frost for the UK, Michel Barnier for the EU - will oversee this week's discussions, before meeting formally on Friday morning. Whatever happens, a crunch point is rapidly approaching. The deadline for a deal is two and a half weeks away. Like lots of Brexit deadlines it could slip a bit... but not by much. If the sides fail to reach a deal by the end of the year, the UK would trade with the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. This would mean tariffs would be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU, making UK goods more expensive and harder to sell in Europe. The UK could also apply tariffs to EU goods. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses.

Our writers were Toby Luckhurst, Victoria Bisset, Ashitha Nagesh, Doug Faulkner, and Alex Kleiderman. The editors were Hugo Bachega and Owen Amos. We're about to bring our live coverage to an end - here's a round-up of what's been happening in the UK today.  If you're joining us from the Americas, good morning or good afternoon - and if you're in Asia, you'll be settling in to sleep. We're heading into the evening here in the UK. A lot has happened today. To summarise, here are some of the main global headlines. A woman has described her pain at not being able to see her husband regularly at his care home during the pandemic, calling it a ""torture of the heart"". Jean Haste, 70, says she has only been able to see Trevor, 75, who has dementia, once a week for 30 minutes at his home in Suffolk due to visiting restrictions. She said the lack of interaction had affected her husband's illness ""grossly"", saying he hunches in his wheelchair and barely makes eye contact when she does visit. ""I call it torture of the heart. I took a vow and that was to have and to hold. And I can't be with him,"" said Mrs Haste. The Department of Health and Social Care said its ""first priority"" was to prevent infections in care homes, but local public health officials were ""responsible for the policy on visits"". This video can not be played Thecoronavirus contact tracing appfor England and Wales has now been downloaded more than 12.4 million times, the government has said. The app, launched on Thursday, uses Bluetooth technology to keep tabs on encounters with other people and informs them if one subsequently tests positive for Covid. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs it was ""the fastest download of an app in British history"". Our technology correspondents have been answeringyour questions about how the app works. The Netherlands is bringing in new restrictions to try to curb a surge in Covid cases, which will come into force tomorrow at 18:00 local time (17:00 BST). According to the new rules, people should: Although the new rules are only in place for three weeks for now, they may be extended. The Netherlands has recorded more than 115,000 confirmed cases of the virus, and more than 6,400 deaths. Many countries are seeing a surge in cases right now. For some this is a second surge, after an initial peak in spring. For others, cases have been rising steadily through the year. In Europe, including the UK, cases initially peaked in Spring. They have started to increase again, and many countries are now reintroducing restrictions. In the US, which still has the highest number of infections and deaths, the virus has surged in different states at different times throughout the year. At the start the outbreak was centred on northern states such as Washington and New York, and in the summer cases were concentrated in southern states. Now, cases are surging in the mid-west. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent The National Police Chiefs Council has confirmed officers are being told not to install the NHS Covid-19 app for England on their work smartphones. The app detects when users have been in proximity to someone with the virus. Some officers have also been told they may not need to obey self-isolate alerts generated by the app when downloaded to their personal phones. Lancashire Constabulary has told staff to call the force's own Covid-19 helpline instead. A Lancashire Constabulary spokeswoman told the BBC its guidance remains in line with the national NPCC position. The NPCC confirmed the work-phones policy was common to all forces, but said it was carrying out an urgent review of the matter. Read more here. Newcastle is one of the areas subject to the new law A law prohibiting households from mixing in any indoor setting is to be introduced in the most populous parts of north-east England from 00:01 BST on Wednesday. The Department of Health said existing local lockdown measures for Durham,
     Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, South Tyneside, Northumberland and
     Sunderland are being tightened at the request of the local councils in response to high and
increasing infection rates. Current guidance only advises residents
not to mix with people outside their household or bubble in indoor settings,
such as pubs and restaurants. The DoH says the guidance will
now be enforceable and subject to fines, although the law will not apply to Covid-secure schools and workplaces. A funding package is being agreed with councils to
support the measures and the rising infection rate. Reality Check The government's 10pm mandatory closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants in England has come under scrutiny, following videos posted on social media of crowds gathering outside venues after closing time. Ministers have been defending the policy but the mayor of Greater Manchester has called for an ""urgent review of the emerging evidence"" of its impact. Dr Julian Lang, a professor in respiratory sciences at the University of Leicester, says: ""Wherever you get people crowded together, for example concert halls, cruise ships, house parties, bars and pubs, you risk spreading a virus."" However, speaking on the BBC Andrew Marr Show this weekend,the University of Edinburgh's Prof Mark Woolhouse, a member of the government's infection modelling team, said ""there isn't a proven scientific basis for any of this"". So,why was the rule brought in and what is the science behind it? Knowsley in Merseyside, north-west England, currently has the highest weekly rate of new cases of Covid-19 in England, new data shows. A total of 422 cases were recorded in the area in the seven days to 25 September - the equivalent of 279.7 cases per 100,000, up sharply from 152.5 in the previous week. Eight other areas of England now have weekly rates above 200 cases per 100,000 people - including Liverpool where the rate has jumped from 165.4 to 262.2 with 1,306 new cases recorded. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? As we reported earlier, as of Monday you can be fined Â£1,000 forfailing to self-isolatefor a first-time offence, rising to Â£10,000 for repeat offenders. People whofail to tell their employer,externalthey have to self-isolate can be fined Â£50, while anyone considered to have acted recklessly, for example by going into a crowded place when they know they should self-isolate, can be fined Â£4,000. But other rules have also come into law today which ban pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes from playing music which exceeds 85 decibels, although live performances are exempt. The new laws also say that pub landlords or those who run other venues like hotel bars, restaurants and members clubs, must take ""all reasonable measures"" to stop singing on the premises by customers in groups of more than six, and dancing. Wedding ceremonies and receptions are exempt from the rule. The Department of Health said that while the NHS Covid-19 app can tell people to self-isolate, it is anonymous and cannot force people to or identify them. The head of the US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been overheard complaining about a new member of President Trump's coronavirus task force. According to a report from NBC News, Dr Robert Redfield was heard saying that Dr Scott Atlas was giving Trump false and misleading data on the virus - including on whether masks work, and on herd immunity. On a phone call, made in public on a flight from Atlanta to Washington DC, Redfield was heard saying: ""Everything he says is false."" He later confirmed he was talking about Atlas, who joined the White House task force in August. Atlas's appointment has been criticised, because he doesn't have a background in infectious diseases or public health. A landowner has been issued with a Â£10,000 fine for hosting a wedding party with 100 to 300 people in attendance, police said.  Police said they had received calls about the event taking place on land near New Farnley, Leeds at about 17:00 BST on Saturday.  The force said the group had been dispersed by 21:30.  One of the landowners, aged 49, was identified and issued a fine for breaching coronavirus legislation.  Ch Supt Damien Miller said it had been an ""absolutely blatant breach"" of the law, whichlimits the numbers of people,externalable to attend a wedding.  On Saturday the limit was 30, but by Monday it had been reduced to 15 people.

Trading hours, however, have been restricted - they have to close at 22:00 local time. The announcement was made by President Uhuru Kenyatta, who also extended a nationwide curfew for a further 60 days, but said it would start two hours later - now lasting from 23:00 to 04:00. But an expected announcement on the reopening of schools did not happen. The ministry of education ordered teachers to report to school on Monday, but President Kenyatta said learning institutions could only open once the safety of students could be guaranteed. Kenya has had more than 38,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. Nine deaths were reported today, pushing the number of fatalities to above 700. There has been a steady
decline in the number of cases in recent weeks. Only 53 new cases were announced
on Monday, although critics have noted a low testing rate. Read more: Cases of coronavirus are surging in 21 different US states - almost half of the country - according to broadcaster CNN, which analysed data from Johns Hopkins University. The number of cases in these states increased by at least 10% in the last week, compared to the week before. Those states are: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington state, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The figures are sparking fears of a new wave in autumn and winter as temperatures fall. The US has reported more than seven million confirmed cases of the virus so far, and more than 200,000 deaths. As the rate of infection increases across the country it can be difficult to keep track of where new local restrictions have been put in place. In Wales, Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen and Vale of Glamorgan arethe latest local authorities to impose extra measures, which come into force at 18:00 BST on Monday. In total, at least 16.6 million people are under regional restrictions in the UK - about one in four people. To make things easier we have compiled thishandy guide. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Ministers in the Commons have had perhaps the clearest steer yet
on the governmentâs plans for managing coronavirus over the next six months. Speaking to MPs, Health Secretary Matt Hancock ruled out the idea of trying to
eliminate the virus and keep new cases at zero. He pointed out that this
strategy had not worked for Scotland or New Zealand - both countries have seen
a resurgence of the virus. And he rejected the notion of letting coronavirus
rip among young people while trying to protect the most vulnerable, arguing
that the death toll would likely be âtoo high to bearâ. That leaves suppressing new infections until a vaccine comes
to the rescue (perhaps in the Spring if the trials continue to go well). The
new mantra - control the virus while protecting the economy and education. What
extra measures and restrictions might be necessary to do that remain to be
seen, but a full lockdown would not fit the brief. Here are the latest charts for cases and deaths in the UK - updated to include the data released in the past half hour. The latest UK figures show the number of people testing positive for coronavirus has dropped for a third day in a row. While there can be a lag in reporting figures over the weekend, thegovernment's coronavirus dashboard,externalshows there were 4,044 cases reported on Monday, compared to 5,693 cases in the previous 24 hours. There were 6,042 on Saturday, down from 6,874 cases reported on Friday. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Movers 'more likely to buy than first-time buyers'The coronavirus crisis is changing the dynamic in the UK housing market, researchers suggest.Business","First-time buyers - often cited as the lifeblood of the UK housing market - are becoming less likely to buy a home than movers, researchers predict. For more than a year, the highest proportion of sales were to people buying for the first time, according to property portal Zoopla. But the squeeze on mortgage lending and increased interest from movers will change the dynamic this year and next. The coronavirus crisis has changed conditions in the UK housing market. Four ways the property market 'will be tougher' for first-time buyers First-time buyers in Scotland at 'seven-year-low' Lockdown led to many people reconsidering their domestic arrangements, particularly as they have spent more time working from home. Gardens and space, as well as proximity of family, have risen on the priority list. That has led some existing homeowners to look around for an alternative property. First-time buyers, in contrast, have seen their options squeezed as lenders tighten their criteria for granting a mortgage - demanding larger deposits and guarantees of secure employment. The result, according to Zoopla, is that home movers will become the more likely buyers at the end of this year and next year. Pent-up demand, and government incentives such as a stamp duty holiday, led to property portals and estate agents reporting a surge in interest when lockdown restrictions were lifted. This resulted in some people, like Alex Phillips, buying their first home. The 27-year-old teacher bought a terraced house in Newport in August, on the same street as the primary school he attended as a child. Alex Phillips managed to secure a home loan with a 10% deposit ""The situation meant viewings were not straightforward, but it all went through in two months,"" he said. ""I did not want to be in limbo and for this to be a starting point."" He said a mortgage adviser helped him secure a home loan with a 10% deposit, which he said was ""vital"" for affordability. In August, agreed sales of homes with two bedrooms or fewer, excluding central London, were up 36% compared with the same month last year, according to property portal Rightmove. ""These types of homes are finding a buyer within 53 days on average, which is seven days quicker than last year,"" said Rightmove's director of property data, Tim Bannister. This demand is expected to fade as mortgage restrictions feed through. Zoopla research suggested demand from first-time buyers was already dropping following the post-lockdown peak, whereas demand from movers was ""holding steady"" at 37% higher than pre-Covid levels. ""First-time buyers have been a driving force of housing sales over the last decade,"" said Richard Donnell, research and insight director at Zoopla.

Attenborough spent lockdown 'listening to birds',"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough: ""Weâve overrun the planet"" Sir David Attenborough has revealed he spent much of lockdown sitting in his garden and ""listening to birds"". Forced to abandon his travels, the famous naturalist said lockdown offered ""a vision of what life can be like when you've got more time to sit and stare"". Time, too, to join Instagram, wherehe last week landed a million followersin record-breaking time. ""The message that I am concerned about is so important I would use any medium to get it out,"" he told BBC Breakfast. Sir David Attenborough's exclusive interview with BBC Breakfast Speaking ahead of the release of a book and a Netflix documentary, both titled A Life On Our Planet, the 94-year-old broadcaster acknowledged that the months of lockdown had been relatively painless for him. ""Many people are having a much worse time than I am,"" he told the BBC. ""I am lucky. I have a garden, I have a house... my daughter and I are surviving very well."" ""I've certainly spent more time in my garden listening to birds, than I have for a very long time. A lot of people have been surprised by that - a lot of people have suddenly realised what deep, profound joy can come from witnessing the rest of the world - the natural world."" A really simple guide to climate change World split on climate action, poll suggestsWorld split on climate action, poll suggests Attenborough makes stark warning on extinction He said his astonishing debut on Instagram last week - which saw himbreak Jennifer Aniston's recordfor the fastest time to reach a million followers - gave him ""great hope"" that the younger generation were engaged in the issue of climate change. ""That is the most important hope,"" he said. ""It's their world and it's their tomorrow. I won't be there, they will be. It's theirs and if they aren't persuaded that it's important, we're wasting our time."" ""I feel privileged that they should listen to what an old bloke like me is talking about.""

But hecautioned against using overtly aggressive tacticsto communicate the climate message, as favoured by some Extinction Rebellion activists recently. ""In getting it [the law] changed you have to be careful that you don't break the law, I think. ""I also think that we have to treat the people we share our community with, with respect. Disturbing their lives to such an extent that innocent people can't get about their own business is a serious thing to do and could disenchant an awful lot of people from the action that we're talking about."" ""Of course I agree with their message. It's simply a question of what is politic and sensible."" Asked about the government's response to the climate emergency, Sir David said they had ""made the right noises"" and it remained to be seen what would happen following the delayed UN climate conference, known as the COP. The annual conference, which was due to be held in Glasgow, has been delayed to November 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""But we must back them, we must urge them to get international agreements as a country,"" insisted Sir David warning that otherwise ""it's going to cost us a very, very great deal more"". But what about the divergence of opinion - and actions - of some of the most industrialised nations? ""China is taking very big steps you know in many directions - it's a huge country with an immense population. They're starting doing things about sorting out their climate... China is moving in the right direction ""I agree that the present administration in America, from a conservationist's point of view, is disastrous.

Rail line reopens after Â£2.2m flood repairs,"Washed away: Storm damage left tracks suspended A railway line washed away by Storm Ciara in February has finally reopened after Â£2.2m of repairs. The Conwy Valley Line links the Gwynedd town of Blaenau Ffestiniog with Llandudno on the coast but has been closed since flood-water damaged it. It is at least the sixth time flooding on the stretch has forced it to close in the past 20 years. Storm damage means the line has been closed more than it has been open in the past 18 months. Network Rail said it had installed 16,000 tonnes of rock armour alongside a lengthy section of the railway between Tal y Cafn and Llanrwst to protect the railway during what it said were ""ever more frequent flooding events"" in the Conwy Valley. New rock armour should protect the line from future storms, Network Rail says According to rail officials, the rock armour works by slowing down the water to prevent it carrying away the railway embankment. If that happens, the track is exposed and suspended in the air and is unable to support the weight of trains. The 10 worst weather events to shake Britain Wales' quietest rail stations Bill Kelly, Network Rail's route director for Wales and Borders, said: ""I am delighted that the Conwy Valley Line is now better protected as extreme weather has forced it to be closed too often in recent years. ""We have worked around the clock in recent months to not just repair the line, but to make it more resilient so we can help to prevent these long closures in the future."" The Conwy Valley Line stretches from Blaenau Ffestiniog to Llandudno Engineers said the new rock armour had already been tested by Storm Francis, which hit the area at the end of August. Access to the site was flooded and ended up under water, but the railway came through unscathed. ""I would like to thank passengers and the communities we serve along the line for their patience as this significant investment was delivered,"" said Mr Kelly. The new protection has already been tested by Storm Francis when the River Conwy flooded UK Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""The Conwy Valley line is a vital link for many local communities in north Wales, and this investment will improve the resilience of that crucial route during extreme weather. ""Upgrading the railway defences will help prevent lengthy closures for passengers, avoid frustrating rail replacement services, and deliver a more reliable timetable people can depend on.""

TikTok: US judge halts app store banDistrict Judge Carl Nichols has issued a temporary injunction preventing a ban on TikTok downloads.Technology,"TikTok has avoided a government-ordered block on new downloads in the US after a judge issued a temporary injunction. The video-sharing app had faced being removed from Apple's App Store and Android's Google Play marketplace at midnight local time in Washington DC. Existing US-based users would have been able to have continued using it. But they would not have been able to have re-downloaded the app if they had deleted it from their phones, nor have been offered software updates. Judge Carl Nichols of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued the injunction on Sunday evening having held a 90-minute hearing earlier in the day. He wrote that the government had ""provided ample evidence that China presents a significant national security threat"", but added that specific evidence that TikTok itself posed a risk and that taking its app off stores was the required was ""less substantial"". TikTok welcomed the intervention, and vowed to keep defending its rights. ""We're pleased that the court agreed with our legal arguments and issued an injunction preventing the implementation of the TikTok app ban,"" it said in a statement. TikTok: Oracle confirms being picked by Bytedance to be app's partner TikTok and WeChat: US to ban app downloads in 48 hours TikTok: What TikTokers make of Trump's ban threat TikTok had argued that forcing it off the iOS and Android app stores would have violated the First and Fifth Amendments of the US constitution. It claimed that preventing some users joining the app unlawfully impinged upon their freedom of speech and that the firm's own right to due process would have been breached by not giving it a proper opportunity to defend itself first. ""How does it make sense to impose this app store ban tonight when there are negotiations underway that might make it unnecessary?"" added a member of the app's legal team. The US government's lawyers in turn had described the app's parent as being ""a mouthpiece"" for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The ruling comes one week after another Chinese app - WeChat - that also faced a ban, wasgiven its own last minute reprieve by the US courts. The long-term fate of TikTok in the US is still unclear. At present it is owned by a Chinese company, Bytedance, but operated as a separate entity to Douyin - a parallel version used by Chinese consumers. The Trump administration has claimed Bytedance's involvement poses a unacceptable national security threat, because it would have to comply with an order to support the CCP's ""malicious collection of American citizens' personal data"". Bytedance denies this, saying that TikTok's user data is kept in the US and Singapore, andso is not subject to Chinese law,external. Even so, after being threatened with a ban, a week ago TikTok said that it had agreed a dealto let database company Oracle and retail giant Walmart take up to a 20% stakein a new spun-off entity called TikTok Globalahead of shares in the endeavour being floated,external. But President Trump subsequently said he would not accept any arrangement that did not involveBytedance ceding controlto the two US firms. TikTok's statement on Monday suggested negotiations over the deal were still ongoing. ""We will also maintain our ongoing dialogue with the government to turn our proposal, which the President gave his preliminary approval to last weekend, into an agreement,"" it said. TikTok's audience skews younger than that of Facebook, YouTube and Twitter To further complicate matters, Beijing has yet to announce whether it will grant Bytedance a licence to include TikTok's algorithms in any deal. Algorithms power the app's recommendation engine, deciding which videos to show to each user, based on the ways they have previously interacted with the product. The algorithms are highly responsive to each person's interests, quickly picking up on shifts in behaviour, and are credited with helping make the app so popular. If China refused to let them be included in a deal, it could scupper any sell-off. TikTok really has morphed into a platform that rivals Instagram and Facebook in America. For the US to ban the app would be simply unprecedented. And for now, it's been given a stay of execution. The court will now take its time, as it looks into whether it's a threat to national security. One thing that was striking in the open evidence presented though was that there was no smoking gun. There were lots of assertions, for example that TikTok's owner Bytedance was a ""mouthpiece"" for the Chinese government, but no killer punch. What this delay does is buy TikTok much needed time. They need to do three things. Wrap up a deal with Oracle and Walmart, get Trump to support it and then get the Chinese government to approve it. And all whilst the clock runs down. This TikTok saga isn't even close to being done. TikTok has said it has more than 100 million active users in the US and about 700 million worldwide. It has claimed even a temporary ban would threaten its business.

Gove heads to Brussels ahead of trade talks,"This video can not be played Michael Gove says the two sides would use âevery second, every minute, every hour in order to reach agreementâ. Michael Gove has said parts of a bill which override provisions in the Brexit deal agreed with the EU would remain, despite EU requests to remove them. The Cabinet Office minister said he is ""committed"" to reaching a deal on the UK's future relationship with the EU. He met the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to discuss the UK's future relationship with the EU on Monday. Mr Sefcovic said the UK's negotiating position is still ""far apart from what the EU can accept"". Formal trade talks resume on Tuesday. Mr Gove said the talks on implementing the withdrawal agreement are at a ""healthy stage"". But both sides say there is still disagreement over the UK's plan to override parts of the withdrawal agreement relating to Northern Ireland in a bill currently going through the House of Commons. Speaking after his meeting with Mr Gove, Vice President Mr Sefcovic said there was a ""window of opportunity"" to come to an agreement on the Northern Ireland protocol, but added that was ""rapidly closing"". Why does the UK need another Brexit deal? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Seven things that will change on 1 January The disagreement centres on the UK government's Internal Market Bill, which would override agreements made on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The agreement aimed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, which is still part of the EU. Mr Sefcovic repeated the EU's request for the UK to remove the ""contentious parts"" of the bill by the end of September. This video can not be played Maros Sefcovic says ""much work remains to be done"" to reach a trade deal with the UK. He said the EU would ""not be shy"" in using ""legal remedies"" written into the withdrawal agreement to address any ""violations"". But Mr Gove said the provisions on Northern Ireland would remain in the Internal Market Bill. ""There are those in European Union who have been concerned about clauses in Internal Market Bill but I was able to stress today these clauses are a safety net,"" he said. He added: ""We want to reach agreement in the joint committee, we want to make sure position of Northern Ireland is secure in UK, we want to make sure the withdrawal agreement is implemented in full. But those clauses are there, they are in legislation, supported by the House of Commons...and those clauses will remain in that bill."" The UK government has previously said it would ""discharge its treaty obligations in good faith"", but added that ""it is important to remember the fundamental principle of parliamentary sovereignty"". The bill is set to be debated by MPs on Tuesday. The Brexit transition period, in which the UK has kept to EU trading rules, ends on 31 December. The UK and EU are yet to agree a deal that will govern their future trade. Ahead of the resumption of trade talks, a UK government spokesperson said while this week represented the final formal round of negotiations, he expected discussions to continue up to a meeting of the EU Council, scheduled for 15 October. He described the atmosphere as positive but added that ""much was to be done"". Other long-running sticking points that could stymie negotiations include state aid and fishing access. During this week's talks, negotiators will also discuss law enforcement and transport. The two chief negotiators - the EU's Mr Barnier and the UK's David Frost will meet on Friday morning. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said sources in government say that while progress is being made, there are ""fundamental gaps"" between the two sides and talk of ""optimism"" in recent days has been overstated. Time is tight and there is no breakthrough... yet. A sentence you may just have heard before in these Brexit negotiations. The chief negotiators on both sides - Lord Frost for the UK, Michel Barnier for the EU - will oversee this week's discussions, before meeting formally on Friday morning. Whatever happens, a crunch point is rapidly approaching. The deadline for a deal is two and a half weeks away. Like lots of Brexit deadlines it could slip a bit... but not by much. If the sides fail to reach a deal by the end of the year, the UK would trade with the EU on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. This would mean tariffs would be applied to most goods which UK businesses send to the EU, making UK goods more expensive and harder to sell in Europe. The UK could also apply tariffs to EU goods. The bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses.

"Swiss firmly reject end to free movement with EUWith all votes counted, nearly 62% people have said they want to maintain the pact with the EU.Europe","Opponents of the proposal argued it would damage relations with the EU and hurt trade Swiss voters have rejected a proposal to end an accord with the EU allowing the free movement of people. With all referendum votes counted, nearly 62% said they wanted to keep free movement, while 38% were against. Switzerland is not a member of the EU but has a series of interdependent treaties with Brussels which allow it to access to Europe's free trade area. The move to rein in immigration was proposed by the Swiss People's Party (SVP), but opposed by the government. A similar initiative to introduce quotas on immigrants from the EU to Switzerland narrowly passed in a 2014 referendum, damaging Swiss-EU relations. Swiss people are given a direct say in their own affairs under the country's system of direct democracy. They are regularly invited to vote on various issues in national or regional referendums. The Swiss free movement vote explained How the migrant crisis changed Europe Supporters of the anti-free movement plan said it would allow Switzerland to control its borders and select only the immigrants it wants. Opponents argued it would plunge a healthy economy into recession at an uncertain time and deprive hundreds of thousands of Swiss citizens of their freedom to live and work across Europe. The push to scrap the freedom of movement deal comes from the right-wing Swiss People's Party A landlocked country that has observed neutrality for centuries, Switzerland has over time veered between seeking closer engagement with the EU, and preferring a more isolationist course. Sunday's referendum could have forced the Swiss government to unilaterally void its free movement agreement with the EU by invoking a so-called guillotine clause. This clause would have impacted other bilateral deals on transport, research and trade with the EU, disrupting economic activity. The president of the right-wing SVP, Marco Chiesa, conceded that his campaign had struggled to garner enough support for a proposal which was opposed by the government, parliament and tradio unions. Given that opposition, Mr Chiesa framed the campaign as a ""fight between David and Goliath"". ""But we will continue to fight for the country and take back control of immigration,"" he said. SVP President Marco Chiesa admitted the proposal failed to gain traction Opponents of the proposal said the result was an expression of Swiss support for open, bilateral relations with the EU. They said voters were worried about the economic cost of ending free movement during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The bilateral path is the right one for Switzerland and for the EU,"" Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told reporters. ""The Swiss people have confirmed this path again today"". ""Today is a great day for the relations between the European Union and Switzerland,"" tweeted European Council President Charles Michel. ""The Swiss people have spoken & sent a clear message: together we have a great future ahead of us."" Analysis by Imogen Foulkes,BBC News Geneva correspondent Swiss voters have said a convincing ""no"" to ending free movement of people with the EU. The People's Party argued that immigration from Europe was to blame for a rising population, and placed an unsustainable burden on Switzerland's public services, and environment. In the past, the party has done well with anti-immigration campaigns, but not this time. The economic consequences were clear. Some 60% of Swiss exports go to Europe, for example. Moreover, half a million Swiss live and work in the EU, and 1.4 million EU citizens work in Switzerland, many in the health service. Ending free movement would have put the entire relationship with Europe at risk. Brussels has always told the Swiss they cannot cherry pick: no free trade without free movement. Today, Swiss voters have shown they think that deal is reasonable. A referendum on paternity leave for new fathers was among the other issues on Sunday's ballot. The initiative was backed by a majority of voters, heralding a major change in Switzerland, a country seen as lagging behind its European neighbours on parental leave provision. Under the proposal, fathers will for the first time be granted two weeks of paid leave within six months of the birth of a child. They will also be entitled to receive 80% of their salary, up to a ceiling of 196 Swiss francs (Â£165; $210) per day. In addition, voters narrowly approved a government plan to buy new fighter jets, and blocked a revision of Switzerland's hunting law which would have made it easier to cull protected species such as wolves. The Swiss referendum was already being prepared before the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016. The SVP - the biggest party in Switzerland's parliament - has used similar arguments to Brexiteers about the benefits of having more control over immigration. But net migration into Switzerland is actually falling at the moment, and there is a sense voters are becoming weary of the party's anti-immigration message. The strong vote in favour of free movement could strengthen Brussels' hand with London, and be a signal to the UK of just what kinds of compromises might be needed to agree a free trade deal with the EU. 1992:Swiss vote by 50.3% to 49.7% against joining European Economic Area 1992-2002:Switzerland negotiates, then signs first bilateral agreements with EU - they are interdependent, and include free movement of people - backed by a vote in 2000 2005:Swiss vote to join Europe's Schengen open borders treaty and extend free movement to 10 new EU states 2009:Vote to extend freedom of movement to new EU members Romania and Bulgaria 2014:Swiss narrowly back quotas on EU workers No quotas in Swiss immigration bill Will the Swiss limit EU immigration?
