Review: Chicago âââââThe award-winning writer returns with his first novel in 20 years - a thriller set in mobbed-up 1920s Chicago.3m4 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts,"If you're thinking of going on a creative writing course, don't. Save your money and read David Mamet's new thriller Chicago instead. It's a whole lot cheaper and you'll learn all you need to fulfil your literary dream. Mamet can write. We know that. He's got a Pulitzer Prize to prove it. Plays and movies are where he has made his literary name. American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Untouchables, The Postman Always Rings Twice: it's not a bad CV. Dialogue is his thing. He's got a reputation for it. So much so, it has its own name, Mametspeak. This novel is packed with it: dense passages of jargon-laden conversations between earthy, cynical protagonists who finish off each other's sentences, if the sentences get finished at all. The bulk of the chat in this instance is between two old-school, hard-boiled, inky journalists called Mike Hodge and Clement Parlow who work in Coffin Corner at the Chicago Tribune, so called because ""it was the place stories went to die"". Chicago Tribune newsroom, circa 1923 ""Is non-coterminous a word?"" Parlow said. ""It is if you want it to be,"" Mike said. ""Read Walt Whitman."" ""I can't. It makes me sick with envy,"" Parlow said. And so it goes. We're in Prohibition-era 1920s Chicago where the rat-a-tat speed of their conversations matches the sound of guns being fired around the mean streets and back alleys of the corrupt, violent, crime-ridden city on which they report. Contraband beer being spilled into the streets from barrels during the Prohibition era It is a story soaked in illicit whisky and the warm blood of dead mobsters. The Italians run one side of town, the Irish the other. Between the two are the Jews. Everyone is on the make; the only thing going straight are the bullets. The story takes a while to get going. The first third of the book, the set-up, is about getting the atmospherics right; dragging us back a century, filling in the characters' back-stories, hearing them bicker about journalism. ""What do you think they're paying us for?"" Crouch [the news editor] had said. ""Man bites dog,"" Mike had said. ""Bullshit."" Crouch said. ""Man bites dog is too interesting to be news."" ""Then what is news?"" Mike said. ""News,"" Crouch said, ""is that which makes its consumer self-important, angry, or sufficiently whatever the hell to turn to page twelve, and, turning, encounter the ad for the carpet sale."" Most of our time is spent hanging out in speakeasies and brothels, where new characters emerge and plot lines are planted with the subtly of a brown paper bag changing hands on a park bench. By the time the story finally kicks off, Mike has fallen in love, two local ""faces"" have been murdered, and a couple of goons wearing unusual overcoats are lurking ominously in the background like an old score about to be settled. At this point the novel morphs from being a thoroughly enjoyable period piece into a slug of genre writing that belongs to the era in which it is set. We're talking Pulp Fiction. ""They said that knowledge is power."" ""Power is power,"" Ruth said. ""People say differently don't understand power. Or knowledge. Knowledge is what gets you killed."" The pace changes. There's less chat and more action. Al Capone makes a cameo. American mobster Al Capone, makes a cameo appearance in the novel, Chicago Things turn nasty. And life gets complicated, as Mike discovers the people on whom he is relying are more unreliable than backstreet gin. It is not a perfect novel. There are some bum notes to go alongside the groovy chords Mamet creates with his rhythmic dialogue. David Mamet He undermines his character Peekaboo, the all-seeing African American madam at the Ace of Space whorehouse, by making her reveal far more information than she ever would to Mike - without getting anything in return. And there are moments, not many but some, where he overwrites in a way that the masters of the American crime novel like Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard, never would. That though is being picky. If you like your language dense, if you're interested to see it being toyed with by a maestro, and if you fancy a blokey whodunnit to while away the hours until some half-decent weather arrives, then you could do a lot worse than hang out in David Mamet's Chicago.

"'Scammers conned me out of my holiday'Victims of holiday booking fraud are losing an average of Â£1,500 each, according to the police.","Holidaymakers are being warned about fraudsters who place false adverts on accommodation websites, conning them out of hundreds of pounds. Last year, some 4,700 travellers fell victim to such scams, which included fake airline tickets. On average those affected lost Â£1,500 each in 2017, according to the police, a 25% rise on the year before. In many cases the fraudsters hack into accommodation websites and ask to be paid directly. But as soon as payment is made, they disappear. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) is also warning about fake airline tickets that never arrive. Last year, most of the flights concerned were to Africa or Asia. Last May, legal secretary Georgia Brown tried to book a holiday in Amsterdam for herself, her partner Jamie, and some friends. She spotted an advert on an accommodation website, where the owner of the apartment was asking for a deposit of Â£915. She corresponded with the man by email, and then sent the money off by bank transfer. But she never heard from him again. ""At the time I was petrified. I thought someone had hacked into my bank account. It was really scary,"" she said. She was also critical of the booking site involved. ""I just don't understand how this person was allowed to advertise on the website."" Georgia Brown eventually got her money back through her bank. In order to avoid being conned, Abta advises holidaymakers to: Do research. Check the holiday company's credentials, and look at several reviews of the property involved Check the web address is legitimate, and has not been altered. For example from co.uk to .org Be cautious about paying directly into an individual's bank account. Bank transfers are like paying by cash, so are difficult to trace. It is safer to use a debit or credit card More than half of the victims of travel scams told Action Fraud that the experience had affected their mental health or financial well-being. Duped mum warns over fake caravan holiday scam In some cases the impact was even more serious. ""The startling emotional impact of falling victim to holiday fraud is highlighted in the latest figures, as 575 people reported that the harm to them was so severe, they had to receive medical treatment or were at risk of bankruptcy,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud. It follows earlier warnings this year about so-called ""chalet fraud"" for people booking ski-ing holidays. On average those who were tricked into sending off money to reserve a chalet lost more than Â£2,000 each.

"Deadly unrest erupts on Gaza-Israel borderPalestinian officials say eight protesters have been killed by Israeli forces and over 1,300 wounded.3h3 hours agoMiddle East","This video can not be played Palestinians set tyres on fire as tear gas falls on them Ten Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during fresh protests on Gaza's border with Israel, Palestinian health ministry officials say. The Israeli military said troops had opened fire when people attempted to breach the fence on the frontier. The protesters are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to ancestral lands that are now in Israel. But Israel says the militant group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, is staging the rallies in order to launch attacks. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres called on all parties to ""avoid confrontation and exercise maximum restraint"",externalafter 16 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded during similar unrest a week ago. Who are Hamas? Palestinian territories: Timeline One of those killed in the latest unrest was Yasser Murtaja, a journalist with the Gaza-based Ain Media agency, the health ministry in Gaza said. Piles of tyres were set on fire in an attempt to create a smokescreen to block the view of Israeli snipers, as thousands of protesters gathered at five sites along the 65km-long (40-mile) Israel-Gaza border for fresh protests on Friday. The Israeli military said protesters had thrown stones and firebombs at its troops ""Israel took everything from us, the homeland, freedom, our future,"" 27-year-old protester Samer told Reuters news agency. ""I have two kids - a boy and a girl - and if I die, God will take care of them."" Protesters threw stones and firebombs at troops deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier, the Israeli military said, andmultiple attempts were made to break through the border fence,external. ""Our forces are using riot disposal means and live fire in accordance with the rules of engagement,"" it added. The Palestinian health ministry said dozens of protesters were wounded Gaza's health ministry said a 16-year-old boy was among those killed by Israeli gunfire, and that more than 1,300 other people were wounded. The first death reportedly occurred east of Khan Yunis, in the south of the territory. Israel's Army Radio cited the military as saying a large group of people had attempted to rush the border fence and that troops had opened fire to stop them. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. Source: Haaretz Hamas and other groups organising the six-week protest campaign, dubbed the Great March of Return, say they are peacefully calling for the right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they fled from or were forced to leave in 1948, when Israel was created. The Israeli government has long ruled out any right of return and says terrorists are using the cover of the protests to try to cross illegally into its territory. Palestinians say unarmed protesters were shot last week while posing no threat, and the UN and EU have called for an independent inquiry. Israeli soldiers were deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier A spokeswoman for the UN high commissioner for human rights warned that, under international law, firearms could be used only in cases of extreme necessity, as a last resort and in response to an imminent threat of death or risk of serious injury. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem called on Israeli soldiers to refuse to open fire on unarmed demonstrators,external. The US blamed Palestinian leaders,external""who call for violence or who send protesters - including children - to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed"". The protesters are demanding that Palestinian refugees are given the right of return The Israeli foreign ministry has said most of those killed last week were members of Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and EU. Hamas has acknowledged that some belonged to its military wing, but said they were protesting ""side-by-side with their people"". The group has said it will pay $3,000 (Â£2,140) to the family of anyone shot dead by Israeli troops at the protests. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya denied the group was putting a ""price tag"" on casualties,external. ""This is our duty to our people, to ease the suffering of our citizens,"" he told the New York Times.

Facebook to verify major page owners,"Facebook will start verifying the identities of people running popular pages on its platform Facebook will verify the identity of people running popular pages, as part of its continued efforts to stem fake news and propaganda. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said,externalall âlargeâ pages would be audited - any which did not clear the process would be prevented from posting. The move is designed to prevent users who run pages using fake accounts from hiding their true identity. Mr Zuckerberg said he backed proposed political ads regulation. It would require technology companies to collect more data on the source of those advertisements. ""Election interference is a problem that's bigger than any one platform,"" he wrote. ""And that's why we support the Honest Ads Act. This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online."" Also announced today, Facebook will add more transparency over the funding of ""issue-based"" political ads. ""These steps by themselves won't stop all people trying to game the system,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads."" The firm will ask those placing political ads for a US government-issued ID and a physical mailing address. A unique code will be sent to the address - and will need to be inputted before the advertising is allowed to run. The measures are to counter some of the tactics apparently used by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian âtroll farmâ said to have manipulated Facebook in order to target American voters. Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has endorsed calls for more legislation on political ads One of the groupâs most effective techniques was to set up pages that appeared to be run by passionate US-based campaigners. In some cases, these pages successfully encouraged people to take to the streets and engage in protests. A spokeswoman told the BBC that Facebook had not finalised what would qualify as a large page, but that it would include other indicators as well as simply the number of followers a page has. It will also make it clear if the page has changed its name. It is understood Russian trolls used innocuous titles to attract followers to a page, only to then switch the page into promoting a political view. Facebook already verifies the identity of celebrities and other public figures, and the system for verifying page owners will likely work a similar way, the spokeswoman said. The changes have been announced ahead of a critical week for Facebook. On Tuesday, Mr Zuckerberg will begin a round of Congressional hearings into Facebookâs handling of data and other issues. It will be the first time the 33-year-old has personally appeared to represent the social network he founded, and comes following intense pressure to do so. Likely on the minds of senators and representatives will be the extent to which Facebook is able to prevent attempts to manipulate voters in the future. In October 2017, the company began forcing those placing ads to support specific candidates to make it clear who was funding that promotion. âWe're extending that requirement to anyone that wants to show 'issue adsâ - like political topics that are being debated across the country,â the company said. ""We are working with third parties to develop a list of key issues, which we will refine over time. To get authorised by Facebook, advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location. ""Advertisers will be prohibited from running political ads - electoral or issue-based - until they are authorised."" Perhaps foreshadowing Mr Zuckerbergâs response to politicians next week, the statement admitted this system would not solve the problem entirely.

'Scammers conned me out of my holiday',"Holidaymakers are being warned about fraudsters who place false adverts on accommodation websites, conning them out of hundreds of pounds. Last year, some 4,700 travellers fell victim to such scams, which included fake airline tickets. On average those affected lost Â£1,500 each in 2017, according to the police, a 25% rise on the year before. In many cases the fraudsters hack into accommodation websites and ask to be paid directly. But as soon as payment is made, they disappear. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) is also warning about fake airline tickets that never arrive. Last year, most of the flights concerned were to Africa or Asia. Last May, legal secretary Georgia Brown tried to book a holiday in Amsterdam for herself, her partner Jamie, and some friends. She spotted an advert on an accommodation website, where the owner of the apartment was asking for a deposit of Â£915. She corresponded with the man by email, and then sent the money off by bank transfer. But she never heard from him again. ""At the time I was petrified. I thought someone had hacked into my bank account. It was really scary,"" she said. She was also critical of the booking site involved. ""I just don't understand how this person was allowed to advertise on the website."" Georgia Brown eventually got her money back through her bank. In order to avoid being conned, Abta advises holidaymakers to: Do research. Check the holiday company's credentials, and look at several reviews of the property involved Check the web address is legitimate, and has not been altered. For example from co.uk to .org Be cautious about paying directly into an individual's bank account. Bank transfers are like paying by cash, so are difficult to trace. It is safer to use a debit or credit card More than half of the victims of travel scams told Action Fraud that the experience had affected their mental health or financial well-being. Duped mum warns over fake caravan holiday scam In some cases the impact was even more serious. ""The startling emotional impact of falling victim to holiday fraud is highlighted in the latest figures, as 575 people reported that the harm to them was so severe, they had to receive medical treatment or were at risk of bankruptcy,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud. It follows earlier warnings this year about so-called ""chalet fraud"" for people booking ski-ing holidays. On average those who were tricked into sending off money to reserve a chalet lost more than Â£2,000 each.

Brazil's Lula misses surrender deadline,"Dilma Rousseff (foreground) was at the side of Lula, seen here waving Former Brazilian President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has appeared on stage before supporters outside Sao Paulo as he defies a court order to begin a 12-year jail term for corruption. He emerged from the union building where he is staying to attend a Mass for his late wife, Marisa Leticia. Dilma Rousseff, his impeached successor as president, joined him on the stage along with several priests. Two last-minute appeals to have his arrest warrant suspended have failed. Lula says the case against him was politically motivated. A large crowd of supporters are surrounding the union building in the suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, where Lula built his trade union and political career. Supporters of Lula camped out at the union building The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He is the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. The authorities stress he is not being regarded as a fugitive, as everyone knows where he is. Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president in October's poll, which he had been favourite to win. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. Minutes before the deadline, his lawyers lost a bid to keep him out of jail while he appealed against his conviction. Lula posters are hung on fencing at the union building Lula's opponents protested outside the federal police headquarters where he was meant to surrender. The sign reads: ""Lula, the place for a thief is prison."" By Katy Watson, BBC News, Sao Bernardo do Campo These past 24 hours have captivated Brazil. Helicopters have been circling the metalworkers' union building where Lula is with his supporters, broadcasting every move for viewers across the country. This video can not be played Lula waves at some of his supporters, who have taken to the street As Friday went on the crowds got bigger. The deadline came and went, and the thousands of Lula fans waiting outside carried on regardless - chanting their support for a man many say was the best president Brazil ever had. What happens now though is unclear - even for a country used to complicated political sagas, this is uncharted territory. Will he go willingly, or could he - and his supporters - put up a fight? There is concern that Lula's demise could yet turn violent. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Read more about Lula The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the   Superior Court was declined. Supporters of the judge who ordered Lula's arrest are gathered outside federal police HQ The two courts did not re-examine Lula's conviction, only whether legal procedures were followed correctly and his constitutional rights were observed. Ordering his surrender on Thursday, Judge Moro said the former president would have a separate cell with its own toilet in Curitiba. He would not be handcuffed if he came quietly, the judge promised.

US slaps sanctions on key Putin allies,"It is the most aggressive move against Russia taken by President Trump's administration The US has imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs and 17 senior government officials, accusing them of ""malign activity around the globe"". Twelve companies owned by the oligarchs, the state arms exporter and a bank are also sanctioned. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the penalties targeted those profiting from Russia's ""corrupt system"". The move was a response to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, he said. The sanctions are also being imposed because of the actions taken by the Kremlin in Crimea, eastern Ukraine and Syria, Mr Mnuchin said in a statement on Friday. He accused the Russian government of ""malicious"" cyber-activities and said the sanctions would target ""those who benefit from the Putin regime"". ""The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs,"" he added. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered It is the most aggressive action taken by the Trump administration thus far against Moscow. Last month the US imposed sanctions on 19 Russians, accusing them of interference in the 2016 election and alleged cyber-attacks. The US has also expelled dozens of Russian diplomats in response tothe poisoning of a former Russian spyin the UK. Among those targeted isOleg Deripaska, a billionaire aluminium magnate and Putin associate with ties to President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Also on the list is Suleiman Kerimov, who is one of Russia's richest men. His family controls Russia's largest gold producer, Polyus, and he has an estimated net worth of $6.3bn (Â£4.7bn). In November,Mr Kerimov was placed under formal investigationin France on suspicion of tax evasion. Suleiman Kerimov is one of Russia's richest men Alexander Torshin, a senior Russian official with reported ties to the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), has been blacklisted. Mr Putin's bodyguard, his son-in-law, the head of Russia's national security council, and former prime minister Viktor Zubkov are also sanctioned. Russian state arms exporter Rosoboronexport, one of the companies targeted, said the sanctions were designed to force Russia out of the global arms market. Any assets they have under US jurisdiction have been frozen and US nationals are forbidden from doing business with them. ""This is unfair competition in its purest form,"" a spokeswoman told Reuters news agency. Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington This is the most aggressive move against Russia taken by the Trump administration: targeting Vladimir Putin's inner circle. The name most familiar to Britons will be Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire who was at the centre of a political scandal ten years ago when he entertained Labour's Peter Mandelson and the Conservative shadow chancellor George Osborne on his super yacht. Of more interest here in the US are his connections to Paul Manafort, Mr Trump's former campaign manager. Congress passed a law last summer calling for such measures and has criticised the Trump administration for taking so long to act. But senior officials insist that they have been planning the moves for some time. These sanctions were already in the works before the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in the UK, so are not a direct response to it. But they add to the rising diplomatic tensions between the West and Russia over that incident, and contrast sharply with President Trump's consistently softer approach to Mr Putin. Earlier this week, Mr Trump felt compelled to insist he was being tough on Russia but said he still hoped a good relationship with its leader was possible. That seems even less likely now. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Russia has vowed that there will be a ""tough response"" to the new sanctions. ""We will not leave the current and any new anti-Russian attack without a tough response,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. ""We would like to advise Washington to drop, as soon as possible, the illusions that they can talk to us in the language of sanctions"". Earlier on Friday, the Russian embassy in Washington said the sanctions were a mistake. ""We are told that these measures are not aimed against the Russian people, but they are,"" the embassy said in a post on its Facebook page. It described the sanctions as ""a new blow to Russo-American relations.""

School exclusions rise over weapon attacks,"The number of Scottish school exclusions or physical assaults involving weapons or improvised weapons has risen to a five-year high. Figures for 2016/17 showed there were 311 instances of a pupil being excluded for using a weapon to assault another pupil or member of staff. There were a further 428 incidents involving improvised weapons. The Scottish government said it was working with schools and local authorities on anti-violence campaigns. The Scottish Conservatives said the increase would ""horrify"" parents, and demonstrated a problem with discipline in classrooms. The statistics, published by the Scottish government, are only gathered every two years. Boy, 10, charged over 'weapon at school' More than 2,000 weapons seized in schools More than 200 weapon offences recorded Pupils given anti-weapons lessons Schoolboy's killer jailed for nine years The total of 739 is up on the 661 incidents recorded in 2014/15, and 710 in 2012/13. Exclusions as a result of physical assaults involving no weapon were also up, with 4,635 instances in 2016/17, a rise from 3,990 and 4,371 in the previous years. The figures also showed exclusions as a result of physical assaults on staff increased, up 23% from 1,588 in 2014/15 to 1,990 in 2016/17. Overall, the number of exclusions declined again, down from 18,430 in 2014/15 to 18,377 in 2016/17. Scottish Conservative early years spokeswoman Michelle Ballantyne said: ""While it's generally welcome to see a reduction in the number of exclusions in recent years, the individual reasons are alarming. ""Parents will be horrified that two pupils a day are excluded for violent incidents involving a weapon - either conventional or improvised. ""That shows a problem with discipline remains within our schools, and that teachers need more support in dealing with it for the sake of their own safety and that of other pupils."" Bailey Gwynne was stabbed by a fellow pupil A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""These figures should be seen in the overall context of a 64% reduction in crimes of handling offensive weapons over the last decade. ""The number of overall exclusions is also less than half the comparable figure from 2006-07. ""We are working with schools and local authorities on anti-violence campaigns and curriculum programmes on a range of initiatives. ""In Scotland it is already illegal to sell knives or similar products with blades or points to anyone under the age of 18, including online, and also illegal to sell cutlery and kitchen knives to those under 16."" She added that the justice secretary had written to the UK government early last year raising concerns about the online sale of knives and the need for a joined-up approach to address the concerns. ""The UK government has committed to working with us on these issues and we would expect to be fully involved as this important proposal is further developed,"" the spokeswoman added. In 2016, hundreds of secondary pupils across Aberdeen were given anti-weapons lessons in the wake of the killing of schoolboy Bailey Gwynne. Bailey, 16, was stabbed during a fight with a fellow pupil at Cults Academy. His killer is servingnine years for culpable homicide.

Facebook to verify major page ownersThe company tries to show it can prevent future abuses as Congressional hearings loom.5h5 hours agoTechnologyComments,"Facebook will start verifying the identities of people running popular pages on its platform Facebook will verify the identity of people running popular pages, as part of its continued efforts to stem fake news and propaganda. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said,externalall âlargeâ pages would be audited - any which did not clear the process would be prevented from posting. The move is designed to prevent users who run pages using fake accounts from hiding their true identity. Mr Zuckerberg said he backed proposed political ads regulation. It would require technology companies to collect more data on the source of those advertisements. ""Election interference is a problem that's bigger than any one platform,"" he wrote. ""And that's why we support the Honest Ads Act. This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online."" Also announced today, Facebook will add more transparency over the funding of ""issue-based"" political ads. ""These steps by themselves won't stop all people trying to game the system,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads."" The firm will ask those placing political ads for a US government-issued ID and a physical mailing address. A unique code will be sent to the address - and will need to be inputted before the advertising is allowed to run. The measures are to counter some of the tactics apparently used by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian âtroll farmâ said to have manipulated Facebook in order to target American voters. Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has endorsed calls for more legislation on political ads One of the groupâs most effective techniques was to set up pages that appeared to be run by passionate US-based campaigners. In some cases, these pages successfully encouraged people to take to the streets and engage in protests. A spokeswoman told the BBC that Facebook had not finalised what would qualify as a large page, but that it would include other indicators as well as simply the number of followers a page has. It will also make it clear if the page has changed its name. It is understood Russian trolls used innocuous titles to attract followers to a page, only to then switch the page into promoting a political view. Facebook already verifies the identity of celebrities and other public figures, and the system for verifying page owners will likely work a similar way, the spokeswoman said. The changes have been announced ahead of a critical week for Facebook. On Tuesday, Mr Zuckerberg will begin a round of Congressional hearings into Facebookâs handling of data and other issues. It will be the first time the 33-year-old has personally appeared to represent the social network he founded, and comes following intense pressure to do so. Likely on the minds of senators and representatives will be the extent to which Facebook is able to prevent attempts to manipulate voters in the future. In October 2017, the company began forcing those placing ads to support specific candidates to make it clear who was funding that promotion. âWe're extending that requirement to anyone that wants to show 'issue adsâ - like political topics that are being debated across the country,â the company said. ""We are working with third parties to develop a list of key issues, which we will refine over time. To get authorised by Facebook, advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location. ""Advertisers will be prohibited from running political ads - electoral or issue-based - until they are authorised."" Perhaps foreshadowing Mr Zuckerbergâs response to politicians next week, the statement admitted this system would not solve the problem entirely. ""We know we were slow to pick-up foreign interference in the 2016 US elections. ""Today's updates are designed to prevent future abuse in elections - and to help ensure you have the information that you need to assess political and issue ads, as well as content on pages. ""By increasing transparency around ads and pages on Facebook, we can increase accountability for advertisers â improving our service for everyone.""

British snowboarder suffocates in snowThe 25-year-old man was found buried head-first after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps.7h7 hours agoUK,"The man was skiing near the Meribel ski resort. (File pic) A British snowboarder has suffocated after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps, authorities there say. The 25-year-old man, who has not been named, was discovered buried head-first in an off-piste area near the Meribel ski resort in France on Wednesday. He was uncovered after two skiers alerted emergency services to a snowboard sticking out of the snow about 20 metres (66ft) from the piste. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. French rescuers said the man, who was a seasonal worker at the resort in south-eastern France, had suffered cardiac arrest when he was found. An Alps Mountain Rescue spokesman said the man could have been buried for up to half an hour, adding: ""He was buried up to his pelvis and the snow was very heavy, very compacted."" French authorities are investigating the incident and an inquest has been opened in the nearby town of Albertville. Foreign Office staff are in contact with police in the UK and France, as well as a tour operator, about the incident, a spokesman said. Off-piste refers to any area not marked out and maintained for use by skiers. These slopes are not groomed by snow ploughs, so rocks, precipices and cliffs may be hard to spot, especially in poor visibility. Avalanches are a major risk as marked pistes are usually protected by controlled explosions and the use of snow ploughs. Ski resorts do not have the same responsibilities for off-piste areas. The incident follows thedeath of a British skier in an off-piste area of the Alpe d'Huez, who fell from a cliff near the French Alps resort in February. Last January, British skiers Oscar Cassagneau-Francis and Rajen Mahendra, both 26,died after falling hundreds of metres in an off-piste areaof the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc region. During this winter season there have been many avalanches in the Alps, following very heavy snowfall. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collombtweeted last month to urge caution,externalto those taking part in winter sports, following a number of avalanches. ANENA, France's National Association for the Study of Snow and Avalanches, has recorded more than 30 deaths since the beginning of the ski season in November.

Deadly unrest erupts on Gaza-Israel border,"This video can not be played Palestinians set tyres on fire as tear gas falls on them Ten Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during fresh protests on Gaza's border with Israel, Palestinian health ministry officials say. The Israeli military said troops had opened fire when people attempted to breach the fence on the frontier. The protesters are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to ancestral lands that are now in Israel. But Israel says the militant group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, is staging the rallies in order to launch attacks. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres called on all parties to ""avoid confrontation and exercise maximum restraint"",externalafter 16 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded during similar unrest a week ago. Who are Hamas? Palestinian territories: Timeline One of those killed in the latest unrest was Yasser Murtaja, a journalist with the Gaza-based Ain Media agency, the health ministry in Gaza said. Piles of tyres were set on fire in an attempt to create a smokescreen to block the view of Israeli snipers, as thousands of protesters gathered at five sites along the 65km-long (40-mile) Israel-Gaza border for fresh protests on Friday. The Israeli military said protesters had thrown stones and firebombs at its troops ""Israel took everything from us, the homeland, freedom, our future,"" 27-year-old protester Samer told Reuters news agency. ""I have two kids - a boy and a girl - and if I die, God will take care of them."" Protesters threw stones and firebombs at troops deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier, the Israeli military said, andmultiple attempts were made to break through the border fence,external. ""Our forces are using riot disposal means and live fire in accordance with the rules of engagement,"" it added. The Palestinian health ministry said dozens of protesters were wounded Gaza's health ministry said a 16-year-old boy was among those killed by Israeli gunfire, and that more than 1,300 other people were wounded. The first death reportedly occurred east of Khan Yunis, in the south of the territory. Israel's Army Radio cited the military as saying a large group of people had attempted to rush the border fence and that troops had opened fire to stop them. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. Source: Haaretz Hamas and other groups organising the six-week protest campaign, dubbed the Great March of Return, say they are peacefully calling for the right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they fled from or were forced to leave in 1948, when Israel was created.

Long NHS waits: My child flew to Turkey for op,"This video can not be played Megan's family had to pay privately for surgery ""I was really sore. It was really painful. And I felt really drowsy and sick, and just wanted to go back to bed,"" says Megan, watching a video of her first steps after major spinal surgery. Wearing pyjamas and fluffy slippers, she treads carefully, held up on either side by a Turkish nurse. Megan flew to Istanbul for private surgery late last year, having been told she faced long delays for an operation to fix the deformation of her spine, which was causing her problems breathing. When the healthcare trust in Belfast told her parents it would be at least a year before she could have the procedure, they felt they had no choice but to fundraise for treatment. NI hospital waiting list target not met NHS surgery waits run into years in Northern Ireland Through the generosity of strangers, the money was raised - but surgery to insert four metal rods into her spine was painful and expensive, costing about Â£30,000. Just a few days after treatment, 14-year-old Megan had to board a plane home to Northern Ireland. ""But I was so happy, because I just wanted it over and done with, and to get back on the road to recovery,"" she says. Rods were inserted into Megan's spine For her mother, Karen Fleming, though, the upset and uncertainty still plays on her mind. And she is angry on behalf of dozens of other children still waiting for similar treatment. ""It's a shambles. It's a mess,"" she says. ""It's no fault of the surgeons. It's no fault of the nurses. But it's awful. It's just seeing your child in pain every day, knowing that you can't help them. And the only way for a lot of families is to fundraise, or actually to remortgage your house."" In Northern Ireland, targets say most patients should be seen within nine weeks and none should wait over 15 weeks. Just a few miles away from Megan's home in Carrickfergus, we visit 16-year-old Sophie Tanner in Belfast. She waited 20 months for the same operation, to correct curvature of the spine, before it was cancelled the day before surgery. Her parents were delighted when Sophie was then offered the procedure in Stanmore hospital, in Middlesex. It went well but took 14 hours instead of the eight it was supposed to. Nevertheless, the operation has taken the pressure off her heart and lungs and she has made a very good recovery. But Sophie's parents say having to wait as long as she did was unacceptable. ""What most people in Northern Ireland want is the same treatment as the rest of the UK,"" says her father, Eddie. ""We're part of the UK, so we think that the waiting lists should be similar. We pay taxes. We pay National Insurance. We would expect the powers to be to make sure that places are pretty equal."" Spinal surgeon Niall Eames, in Belfast, says the health service is doing what it can to restructure itself and offer surgery faster. But in the short term he has no choice but to tell many children they need to expect long waits. ""Telling a child that they can't have the operation when they need and want the operation - it's completely inappropriate,"" he says. ""Obviously it's terrible for the patients. It's awful for them. But equally for the healthcare people involved in the caring, the managers, the nurses, the consultants, the staff -  it's awful not being able to offer the treatment we know they require in a timely manner."" New data from the Royal College of Surgeons shows the problem in Northern Ireland is getting worse. At the end of 2017, there were more than 14,000 patients waiting over a year for treatment, with more than 3,000 waiting over two years. In Northern Ireland that represents nearly one in 100 people. By comparison there are about 1,800 people waiting over a year for surgery in England. The Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board, which runs the NHS, said: ""The system is under huge pressure and the waiting times experienced by many patients continue to be unacceptable. ""There simply isn't either the money or required staffing levels to sustain the current model of care."" But the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said it had announced a Â£30 million investment in tackling hospital waiting lists in the current year. However, the money has not yet reached the frontline.

British snowboarder suffocates in snow,"The man was skiing near the Meribel ski resort. (File pic) A British snowboarder has suffocated after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps, authorities there say. The 25-year-old man, who has not been named, was discovered buried head-first in an off-piste area near the Meribel ski resort in France on Wednesday. He was uncovered after two skiers alerted emergency services to a snowboard sticking out of the snow about 20 metres (66ft) from the piste. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. French rescuers said the man, who was a seasonal worker at the resort in south-eastern France, had suffered cardiac arrest when he was found. An Alps Mountain Rescue spokesman said the man could have been buried for up to half an hour, adding: ""He was buried up to his pelvis and the snow was very heavy, very compacted."" French authorities are investigating the incident and an inquest has been opened in the nearby town of Albertville. Foreign Office staff are in contact with police in the UK and France, as well as a tour operator, about the incident, a spokesman said. Off-piste refers to any area not marked out and maintained for use by skiers. These slopes are not groomed by snow ploughs, so rocks, precipices and cliffs may be hard to spot, especially in poor visibility. Avalanches are a major risk as marked pistes are usually protected by controlled explosions and the use of snow ploughs. Ski resorts do not have the same responsibilities for off-piste areas. The incident follows thedeath of a British skier in an off-piste area of the Alpe d'Huez, who fell from a cliff near the French Alps resort in February. Last January, British skiers Oscar Cassagneau-Francis and Rajen Mahendra, both 26,died after falling hundreds of metres in an off-piste areaof the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc region. During this winter season there have been many avalanches in the Alps, following very heavy snowfall. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collombtweeted last month to urge caution,externalto those taking part in winter sports, following a number of avalanches. ANENA, France's National Association for the Study of Snow and Avalanches, has recorded more than 30 deaths since the beginning of the ski season in November.

Teacher massage 'was sexual subterfuge',"Ajaz Karim denies sex offences against six teenage girls A sports teacher at a private school offered massages to girls in his locked study as cover for sexually touching them, a court has heard. Ajaz Karim, from west London, denies a string of indecent assaults on teenage pupils at Christ's Hospital School, Sussex, from 1985 to 1993. The jury at Brighton Crown Court heard Mr Karim, 63, told police he was teaching breathing and relaxation. Prosecutor Eloise Marshall said Mr Karim left the school after complaints. ""Mr Karim used his position as a member of staff and his role in the sports department at the school to use massage of these girls as a subterfuge for touching them sexually,"" Ms Marshall said. ""They [the girls] didn't all appreciate at the time that the touching was sexual but all say they felt uncomfortable."" She said on one occasion, Mr Karim told a girl to keep her eyes closed while he put music on and touched her naked body. ""She had never been touched by anyone in that way,"" Ms Marshall said. The court heard he massaged the girl while she was lying face down on the floor and then he turned her over and began to touch her inappropriately. The top private school charges up to Â£31,500 a year Ms Marshall said another 14-year-old recalled how he found her alone and was ""pretty certain that he was going to snog her"". ""He found it funny and she was shocked by his audacity,"" the prosecutor added. Another girl complained to the Horsham school when he kissed her on the lips, but he claimed it was a peck on the cheek, jurors heard. Mr Karim denied the claims during a police interview after his arrest in 2016 - he said he was teaching the girls breathing and relaxation techniques and when he did massage them it was to help them bend their legs. He is accused of nine indecent assaults and one attempted indecent assault against six girls aged 14 to 18. The court heard how Mr Karim, who lives in Hammersmith, had also worked at Eton College, Queen's Club, the Hurlingham Club, and has links to London branches of Champneys health spas and Credit Suisse. Christ's Hospital School charges boarders up to Â£31,500 a year and its pupils still wear a Tudor-style uniform featuring a long, blue coat and high yellow socks. The trial continues.

'Reclassify cancers to improve treatment',"Cancers should no longer be categorised by where they are first formed in the body, but instead by similarities in tumour types, researchers say. A US-led study of 33 cancer types from more than 10,000 patients found they could be reclassified into 28 clusters that shared similar molecules. Reclassification would ultimately lead to better, more targeted treatments, said the researchers. ""It's time to rewrite the textbooks on cancer,"" one of the authors said. 'One-stop shops' for cancer diagnosis Rise in cancers 'caused by weight' Cancers have traditionally been classed and treated according to the part of the body from which they originate, such as the breasts or lungs. But for this new study, the Pan-Cancer Atlas, scientists carried out analysis of 23 of the most common tumour types, and also 10 rare ones, to see which similarities and differences they had on both a genetic and cellular level. They found that nearly two-thirds of cancer clusters that shared key molecular similarities were found in more than one area of the body. One tumour type was found in 25 parts of the body, meaning it would traditionally be treated differently depending on which area it was found in, the study found. They also found that common cancers, such as in the lung and breast, can be broken down into more than one cancer. Prof Christopher Benz, from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in California, told the BBC this was significant because it meant patients would not always be receiving the most effective treatment. For example, in some cases medications for one type of cancer - such as of the bladder - should be used to treat another, like lung cancer, he said. ""Patients will have the best shot at successful treatment if their tumours can first be classified according to their genomic and molecular makeup,"" said Prof Benz. Lung cancer is one area where treatment could be improved, researchers say Immunotherapy - where the body's immune system is enlisted to help fight cancer - is one treatment that could potentially be rolled out more widely, Prof Benz said. Drugs used for the treatment of other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, could also ultimately be repurposed to fight cancer. In other cases, cancers that are harder to treat might require a combination of medications. Lung and colorectal cancers are among those that would often benefit from more targeted treatment, Prof Benz said. But he explained that it could take up to a decade for new treatments to become available because of the difficulty in getting drugs approved. He called for oncology departments, which tend to focus on specific areas of the body, and drugs companies to work together better to improve care for patients. ""It's time to rewrite the textbooks on cancer, and it's time to break down the silos in clinical oncology that make it difficult for patients to take advantage of this paradigm shift in cancer classification,"" Prof Benz said. Dr Justine Alford, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""By revealing the molecular groups that cancers tend to fall into, this research opens up new possibilities for patients who would traditionally be treated based on where in the body their cancer is. ""Identifying patients most likely to benefit from a particular treatment could also help improve clinical trials. ""The real test now will be to put this knowledge into practice and find out if this way of treating patients helps save more lives,"" she added. The research was published inCell,external.

"Paddy Jackson 'sorry' and 'ashamed'The rugby player says he is ""ashamed"" that the woman who accused him of rape left his home distressed.","Paddy Jackson and his teammate Stuart Olding were unanimously acquitted of rape last month An Ulster and Ireland rugby player who was last month acquitted of rape has said he is ""ashamed"" that the woman who accused him left his home distressed. Paddy Jackson said he would ""always regret"" the events of that night and apologised ""unreservedly"" for messages he sent in the aftermath. He and his teammate Stuart Olding were found not guilty of rape. But he told the Press Association he had ""betrayed the values of his family"" and was sorry. Mr Jackson was also cleared of sexual assault. He and Mr Olding have been relieved of their playing duties while an IRFU and Ulster Rugby review takes place. On Friday,campaigners took out a full-page advertisement in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper, calling for both men to be dropped by Ulster and Ireland. Mr Jackson said public criticism of his behaviour was ""fully justified"" and he expressed determination to return to the values and principles that guided his upbringing, in particular the importance of respect. He said: ""I am also truly sorry for engaging in a Whatsapp group chat which was degrading and offensive and I apologise unreservedly for this. ""The criticism of my behaviour is fully justified and I know I have betrayed the values of my family and those of the wider public. ""Following the trial I have taken time to reflect with my family on the values that were such an integral part of my upbringing, the most important of which is respect. ""My departure from these values has caused understandable public anger and I am resolutely committed to returning to those principles."" In the wake of his acquittal, Mr Olding also expressed regret for his involvement in the incident. Two other men were unanimously acquitted of lesser charges related to the high-profile case. Blane McIlroy, 26, was acquitted of exposure while Rory Harrison, 25, was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice and withholding information.

Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains sold,"Conviviality's retail arm includes the Wine Rack chain Conviviality brands Bargain Booze and Wine Rack are set to be sold to food wholesaler Bestway for Â£7m. Conviviality's retail arm, which also includes the WS Retail and Select Convenience chains, was looking for suitors after the company ran into financial trouble. The sale is expected to save 2,000 jobs at the chains. Bestway is one of the UK's biggest food wholesalers and also owns the Well pharmacy chain. Earlier this week,the wholesale division of Conviviality was bought by C&C, the owner of Magners cider. Both deals were completed through a pre-pack administration process, which was overseen by PwC. The pre-pack process allows for the sale of assets before the official appointment of administrators. The process effectively allows the buyer to cherry-pick the profitable parts of a failing business instead of taking on all liabilities. Last week,Conviviality had announced plans to file for administration. The company had shocked investors last month with a profit warning and news of an unpaid Â£30m tax bill. Those revelations prompted the resignation of chief executive Diana Hunter, who had been in charge since 2013, the year Conviviality listed on the London Stock Exchange. Conviviality attempted to raise Â£125m to rescue the business, but failed to do so.

Facebook to verify major page ownersThe company is trying to show it can prevent future abuses of its system ahead of Congressional hearings next week.16m17 minutes agoTechnologyComments,"Facebook will start verifying the identities of people running popular pages on its platform Facebook will verify the identity of people running popular pages, as part of its continued efforts to stem fake news and propaganda. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said,externalall âlargeâ pages would be audited - any which did not clear the process would be prevented from posting. The move is designed to prevent users who run pages using fake accounts from hiding their true identity. Mr Zuckerberg said he backed proposed political ads regulation. It would require technology companies to collect more data on the source of those advertisements. ""Election interference is a problem that's bigger than any one platform,"" he wrote. ""And that's why we support the Honest Ads Act. This will help raise the bar for all political advertising online."" Also announced today, Facebook will add more transparency over the funding of ""issue-based"" political ads. ""These steps by themselves won't stop all people trying to game the system,"" Mr Zuckerberg said. ""But they will make it a lot harder for anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election and use fake accounts and pages to run ads."" The firm will ask those placing political ads for a US government-issued ID and a physical mailing address. A unique code will be sent to the address - and will need to be inputted before the advertising is allowed to run. The measures are to counter some of the tactics apparently used by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian âtroll farmâ said to have manipulated Facebook in order to target American voters. Facebook's chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has endorsed calls for more legislation on political ads One of the groupâs most effective techniques was to set up pages that appeared to be run by passionate US-based campaigners. In some cases, these pages successfully encouraged people to take to the streets and engage in protests. A spokeswoman told the BBC that Facebook had not finalised what would qualify as a large page, but that it would include other indicators as well as simply the number of followers a page has. It will also make it clear if the page has changed its name. It is understood Russian trolls used innocuous titles to attract followers to a page, only to then switch the page into promoting a political view. Facebook already verifies the identity of celebrities and other public figures, and the system for verifying page owners will likely work a similar way, the spokeswoman said. The changes have been announced ahead of a critical week for Facebook. On Tuesday, Mr Zuckerberg will begin a round of Congressional hearings into Facebookâs handling of data and other issues. It will be the first time the 33-year-old has personally appeared to represent the social network he founded, and comes following intense pressure to do so. Likely on the minds of senators and representatives will be the extent to which Facebook is able to prevent attempts to manipulate voters in the future. In October 2017, the company began forcing those placing ads to support specific candidates to make it clear who was funding that promotion. âWe're extending that requirement to anyone that wants to show 'issue adsâ - like political topics that are being debated across the country,â the company said. ""We are working with third parties to develop a list of key issues, which we will refine over time. To get authorised by Facebook, advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location. ""Advertisers will be prohibited from running political ads - electoral or issue-based - until they are authorised."" Perhaps foreshadowing Mr Zuckerbergâs response to politicians next week, the statement admitted this system would not solve the problem entirely. ""We know we were slow to pick-up foreign interference in the 2016 US elections. ""Today's updates are designed to prevent future abuse in elections - and to help ensure you have the information that you need to assess political and issue ads, as well as content on pages. ""By increasing transparency around ads and pages on Facebook, we can increase accountability for advertisers â improving our service for everyone.""

The man who thinks Europe is being invaded," In January 2015, four days after the terror attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, an estimated 1.5 million people marched through Paris. Viktor Orban was one of 40 world leaders at their head, standing in solidarity for freedom of expression and against terror. 2015: World leaders march through Paris after the Charlie Hebdo attacks Different countries drew different conclusions from the Charlie Hebdo murders, and later terror attacks. Orban was clear from the first moment who to blame. Immigrants. The troubled family background of the perpetrators, their upbringing in an orphanage, the radicalisation they succumbed to - all these were of no interest to Orban. He told Hungarian TV: “We will never allow Hungary to become a target country for immigrants. We do not want to see significantly sized minorities with different cultural characteristics and backgrounds among us. We want to keep Hungary as Hungary.” It was a narrative that Orban had used before but then started to exploit tirelessly to win votes at home. In 2015 and 2016, in addition to a wave of terror attacks, Europe faced another challenge - the arrival of hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees. By equating migrants with terrorists Orban tried to offer both a simple explanation and a simple solution. Most of those coming were not refugees, fleeing war and persecution, he explained. They were economic migrants wanting a better life in Western Europe. His message struck a chord with many Hungarians. Orban asked his population in a referendum in October 2016 whether they wanted the EU to “impose migrants” on Hungary. He got a resounding “no” from the 41% of the electorate who cast a valid vote, although that turnout was too low to make the final result count. Votes being counted in the 2016 referendum on migration quotas Hungary’s population has long been falling - 30,000 people a year, equivalent to the loss of a small town. The solution is not immigration, but rather to encourage Hungarian families to have more children, Orban believes. To understand why an anti-immigration agenda might be so successful, it’s necessary to explore Hungary’s history. Less than 2% of the Hungarian population was born outside the country. And Hungarians have long memories of foreign invasion - of being overrun by the Turks, the Austrians and the Russians. In 1920, the Treaty of Trianon settled the post-World War One borders of Hungary, one of the successor states of the defeated Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hungary lost 72% of her territory, and 31% of ethnic Hungarians found themselves outside her borders as minorities in Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Hungary was also deprived of her multicultural communities - the many Romanians, Slovaks, Serbs, Croats and Ruthenians who had previously lived side-by-side with Hungarians. In World War Two, most of her large Jewish population was murdered in death camps, and in the post-war deportations she lost many of the Germans who had settled in Hungary since the 18th Century. Hungary had been emptied of all but her Hungarians. There’s a historical and literary parable that Viktor Orban likes. Every Hungarian schoolchild reads Geza Gardonyi’s novel - The Eclipse of the Crescent Moon. It's 1552 and the castle of Eger in northern Hungary is besieged by a huge Ottoman army. Captain Istvan Dobo and his tiny garrison defend the town and send the Turks packing. The hero is Gergely Bornemissza, an explosives expert who plays a central role in the defence of the fortress. Hungarian author Geza Gardonyi (1863-1922) Other Hungarian castles fell to the Turks in the following decades but only after inflicting such losses on the invaders that their advance into Europe faltered, then failed. In September 2015 at the monastery of Banz in Bavaria, Orban conjured up the spirit of the 16th Century. He told his admirers from the German centre-right that he was just a captain, defending the outer castles from the same Muslim enemy, intent on swamping Christian Europe. “If we want a Hungarian Hungary and a European Europe, and that is exactly what we want,” he said in a speech in October 2017 in Oradea, Romania, “then we must also want a Christian Hungary and a Christian Europe, instead of what now threatens us - a Europe with a mixed population and no sense of identity.” Orban’s image of “mixed” versus “unmixed” populations provoked strong reactions. In February the UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Husseincalled him a racist and a xenophobe. The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto rejected the criticism as “unacceptable and inappropriate” andcalled on al-Hussein to resign. They were on their way to the more prosperous countries of Western Europe. But Orban’s nightmare was that they might in future be sent back to Hungary by Vienna or Berlin. In May 2015, the European Commission proposed compulsory quotas to redistribute asylum seekers. Orban was having none of it. “No-one will tell us who we let into our own house,” he thundered. His answer was a fence. On 16 June 2015, Hungary announced the construction of a 175km (110-mile) barrier along the southern border with Serbia. In the spring of 2015, Orban’s party Fidesz had lost two by-elections and the leader, according to his critics, saw the value of playing the migration card. In the following months his party won back anything up to a million supporters, pollsters estimated. The border fence (in red) spans Hungary's border with Serbia and Croatia The fence was built by a combination of soldiers, prison inmates and unemployed people on community work schemes. It was completed on 15 September 2015. By mid-October, a 40km extension was added along the border with Croatia. At 3m high, dug 1.5m into the ground, and topped with coils of razor wire, it was later reinforced with a second fence, a service road down the middle, a 900-volt electric current and night-vision cameras. All of this was guarded by up to 10,000 police and soldiers. “The old Iron Curtain was built against us, this one was built for us,” Orban told a press conference. He introduced new laws to criminalise migrants. Crossing or damaging the fence became a crime punishable by up to three years in prison. Most who do so are caught and summarily expelled from the country - through gates built into the fence. One Syrian found guilty of inciting migrants to cross the border and throwing objects at police has recently been found guilty of “complicity in an act of terror” and sentenced to seven years in jail. Two “transit zones” built into the fence at Tompa and Roszke, initially allowed 20 asylum seekers a day to apply. That figure is now down to two a day,according to the UNHCR. The border near Roszke In April 2017 the zones were enlarged into “container camps” where asylum seekers, including unaccompanied minors as young as 14, could be detained for many months. In 2017, 3,700 were allowed to apply, of whom 1,300 were granted some kind of protected status. Most subsequently left the country. Integration programmes for the small number granted asylum in Hungary have been slashed or abolished. Orban’s message is clear. Hungary is not open to migrants. Soviet soldiers pulling out of Hungary, 1990 The phone rang in my 4th floor apartment overlooking the Kiraly Baths in Budapest. It was Miklos Haraszti, a well-known dissident. “I’ve got a young man here who wants to meet you.” Later that day Viktor Orban was sitting in my flat, drinking tea from one of my chipped mugs. He was bearded, earnest, and keen to impress - explaining how he and his friends were setting up a new political movement. It was to be called Fidesz - the Alliance of Young Democrats - and would be a rival of the Young Communist League. It was March 1988 and Orban was 25. At secondary school he had briefly pledged his allegiance to the Young Communists. But now they were falling apart. The Party’s grip on power was always backed up by the presence of 55,000 Soviet troops. One would occasionally see them, always in small groups, at the zoo or railway stations, their broad-topped green felt caps looking like the baize on a miniature pool table. But their effect was well understood. It was Soviet troops who had crushed the Hungarian attempt to break away from Moscow in 1956 under Prime Minister Imre Nagy. The threat remained in the years which followed. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union in 1985, he publicly renounced the Brezhnev doctrine under which Moscow claimed the right to send military force to defend the Communist Party in any Warsaw Pact country. This was a body-blow to the Communist leaders of Eastern Europe. They now realised that if the people ever rose up, the regimes might be unable to defend themselves. They didn’t have long to wait. Meanwhile, Hungary increasingly took over from Poland as the main seedbed of democracy in the region. Viktor Orban quickly became one of the bigger seeds. He was born in Szekesfehervar in May 1963, a city 60km (37 miles) south of Budapest, and capital of Hungary in the Middle Ages. By the 1970s, it had recovered from heavy damage in World War Two, and boasted important bus and electronics factories, as well as a mechanised infantry battalion of the Red Army. Orban grew up in the nearby villages of Felcsut and Alcsutdoboz, the oldest of three sons. He still has a weekend house in Felcsut. His father Gyozo was a member of the Communist Party and technical inspector in a local mine. The young Viktor was a bright pupil and a talented footballer. The trainer’s notes for the Felcsut team read: “Viktor Orban: Forward - quick thinker, fast shooter, dynamic passer - shows potential.” Orban later told an interviewer: “I was probably the first in our family, when there was a choice of schoolwork or work in the garden, who chose to study.” He was beaten regularly by his father as a teenager for“disobeying him and being cheeky to his mother”. His mother taught children with special needs. Orban’s anti-Communism probably stemmed from the bullying and Marxist propaganda he was subjected to during his military service, according to one of his biographers, Paul Lendvai. In 1982 he moved to Budapest to study law and political science at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest. He quickly formed a tight group with his fellow students - who later became the core of Fidesz. There was a fierce loyalty among them, and according to their adversaries, “the best girls hung out there”. Orban came from a Calvinist Protestant background but is thought to have been an atheist in his youth. In 1986 he married university classmate Aniko Levai in a civil ceremony, despite her Catholic upbringing. They were both 23. Orban with his wife Aniko Levai in 2016 Fidesz rapidly transformed itself from a youth movement into a political party, with a liberal ideology and an upper age limit of 35. “Rather than attacking Communist rule directly, we would create small islands of freedom, interconnected social circles and associations, which, when the moment came, could be connected to change the system,” wrote Orban. In June 1989, anti-Communist and Communist reform groups agreed that it was time to rebury Imre Nagy and his colleagues, secretly executed by the Communists in 1958. In front of a crowd of tens of thousands in Heroes Square in Budapest, Viktor Orban broke ranks with other leaders of the nascent Hungarian opposition, to demand that Soviet troops leave Hungary. “If we are determined enough, we will be able to coerce the ruling party to submit to free elections. If we have the guts to will all of this, then and only then we shall fulfil the destiny of our revolution.” In the taxi afterwards the Polish dissident leader Adam Michnik told him: “Viktor, you shouldn’t have said that.” But while others on the stage were afraid of a coup against Gorbachev in Moscow, and hardline Communists returning to power in Hungary, Orban plunged in. The last Soviet soldier left Hungarian soil in June 1991, as Fidesz activists waved triumphant banners beside their trains. Fidesz won a respectable 9% in the election in 1990, but slipped to a disappointing 7% in 1994. Orban saw a gap opening on the political right and seized it - dragging his liberal party to the conservative side, although several of his closest friends quit in protest. Inspired by Germany’s long-serving centre-right Chancellor Helmut Kohl, from 1995 onwards Orban set about gathering everyone in Hungary who was right of centre under his own flag. What mattered to him was to win power, and keep it, at any cost” A conversation from the early 1990s illustrates Orban’s ambition. “We were sitting in the Angelika cafe, across the Danube from parliament,” economist Peter Rona remembers. Orban was describing how he wanted to turn Fidesz into a modern conservative party, but Rona warned of the danger of abandoning the “modern” at the first sign of electoral trouble. “‘I will not fall into that trap, but if necessary, so be it,’ replied Orban, to my surprise. What mattered to him was to win power, and keep it, at any cost.” In the mid-1990s, while a Socialist-Liberal coalition ruled Hungary, Orban was becoming more conservative. He had opposed the Pope’s visit to Hungary in 1991 and mocked Christian Democrats in parliament, but he now realised he would have to be a Christian. His decade-long marriage to Aniko Levai was blessed in a Calvinist church ceremony in 1996. All his five children were baptised. The 1990s saw dramatic change in Hungary. Factories, agricultural land, forests, homes, and businesses were privatised. Many late Communist-era managers made fortunes overnight, but there were also opportunities for sharp-witted, younger entrepreneurs, unconnected to the old regime. Foreign investment poured into the country, but a large part of Hungarian manufacturing was destroyed. Western companies didn’t want semi-obsolete industries. Unemployment leapt to one million. The country was brimming with resentment - between the city and the village, the new rich and the new poor, and between nationalists and liberals. Many people felt that privatisation had gone too far, and that the national wealth had been lost. Orban won the 1998 election, and formed a coalition government. His government was viewed as moderately successful and quietly prepared Hungary for EU membership. Orban was stunned to lose narrowly to the Socialists in 2002. 2002: A poster from Orban's unsuccessful campaign for re-election “The nation cannot be in opposition,” he assured a mass torch-lit vigil by his supporters in the castle district in Buda, after conceding. It was a turning point in his career. That autumn Orban was introduced to Arpad Habony, a communications expert and a champion in the Japanese martial art of kendo. “[Habony] taught him to change the way he dressed, and the audience he talked to,” says a source close to the government. “To create a new image for himself, to speak and act like an average Hungarian.” To this day, Habony remains Orban’s communications guru, although he has no official role in the government, and does not appear on the payroll. Behind the scenes, Orban’s old schoolfriend Lajos Simicska was building a financial empire that would also help Fidesz back into power. Simicska’s company specialised in concrete, steel, and tarmac. As Hungary built hundreds of kilometres of highway, largely with EU money, the cash flowed into the coffers of Simicska, and his party. Orban was beaten again in the 2006 election. Finally in 2010, Fidesz swept back to power with a two-thirds majority in a country still staggering from the effects of the global economic crisis. Orban during his successful 2010 election campaign Orban went first to Brussels, to ask for more time to tackle the country’s excessive deficit. The cold shoulder he received there, and in Berlin, left him bitter towards “the Brussels bureaucrats”. His government needed money. Private pension funds were diverted to the state. There were new taxes on bank transactions, mobile phone calls and text messages. The tax on the revenue of foreign-owned energy companies was doubled. 2010: A Fidesz supporter carries a banner reading “Thank you Hungary” With a two-thirds majority in parliament, Fidesz was unstoppable, carving out a new state based on its own ideology. Orban pushed through a new constitution which stressed Christian-Conservative values - nation and family. This new constitution stated that Hungary had lost its self-determination from March 1944 to May 1990 - the years first of Nazi then Communist rule - and so partially absolved Hungarians of guilt for the Holocaust. It also weakened the power of the Constitutional Courtto act as a check on the power of the government. Orban granted citizenship and the right to vote in Hungarian elections to more than a million Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. At the last election, 95% of those who voted backed Fidesz. A new media law was passed, creating a powerful National Media Authority. Public TV and radio and the state news agency became government mouthpieces. Under international pressure, the law was amended. But a year later, in 2012, the Council of Europe criticised political influence over appointments to the authority. Critics were purged from the civil service, state companies, schools and even hospitals. When I asked Orban before the 2010 election how many people he intended to replace if he won, he replied without hesitation “12,000”. It was as if he knew their names. In 2014 Orban won again. The new election law, passed in 2011, turned the 44% won by Fidesz into another two-thirds majority. Even his critics acknowledge grudgingly that he “got the country back to work”, though they challenge the way he did it. In 2010, only 54% per cent of Hungarians of active age worked - now the figure is nearer 70%. Orban promised a million jobs in 10 years, and claims to have now reached 740,000. But 180,000 are employed in government work schemes, sweeping streets and clearing scrubland, with little training for the job market. The boom in construction is fuelled by EU funds of €3-4bn a year. Massive state construction projects focus on football stadiums and the rebuilding of public spaces. Many Hungarians undoubtedly feel better off than four years ago. Wages have risen at more than 10% a year. Annual growth is over 4% and unemployment is below 4%. But there is a growing shortage of workers, as over 600,000 emigrated to other EU countries seeking higher wages. Electronics companies cannot fulfil orders because of a shortage of IT engineers. Hospitals complain of a shortage of doctors and nurses. Loudspeaker announcements at train stations try to attract new train drivers. Restaurants and shops advertise in vain for staff. Orban and his media lambastmigrationas both undesirable and stoppable, but Hungarian families are acutely aware ofemigration. There are allegations of corruption. The prime minister’s son-in-law, as well as a narrow coterie of ministers and businessmen connected to Fidesz stand accused of diverting public funds. Orban’s son-in-law denies any wrongdoing. OLAF, the EU anti-corruption watchdog, is investigating alleged irregularities in contracts for the street-lighting of 39 towns. The most radical action the EU could take would be to suspend all payments until investigations are completed. In the spring of 1986 a new sound could be heard in the secondary schools and libraries of Hungary - the whirr and clunk of photocopiers. The Hungarian-born financier and philanthropist George Soros, who made a spectacular fortune after emigrating to the US, donated hundreds of them. George Soros, pictured in 1991 It was about more than education. While teachers could copy pages for their classes, pupils could mass produce subversive pamphlets. The young radicals around Viktor Orban were among the first to take advantage. And that wasn’t the last time Orban benefited from the largesse of George Soros. The billionaire set up the first branch of his Open Society organisation in Budapest in the 1980s to support dissident groups. He also handed out scholarships liberally to a new generation of bright students. In October 1989 Orban went to Pembroke College, Oxford,on a Soros scholarship. From there, he watched the revolutions unfolding across Eastern Europe in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Bulgaria and Romania, then broke off his studies to hurry home to Budapest, to make sure he was in the front row of his own. Then Orban was happy to accept support from Soros. Thirty years later he takes a very different view. The Berlin Wall falls, 1989 Many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been targeted by the Fidesz government. They depend on contributions from philanthropic organisations like the Open Society Foundations. These NGOs include Transparency International which examines state corruption, and the Helsinki Committee, which provides legal aid to the small number of people who still seek asylum in Hungary. 2018: A Fidesz election poster shows opposition leaders alongside George Soros, tearing down Hungary's border fence Soros’s support for groups like these has angered Orban. In 2017, giant posters went up across the country, with a grinning Soros and the words “don’t let Soros have the last laugh”. “National consultations” were launched, with questionnaires sent to all households in the country, blaming Soros and the groups which his foundations support for mass immigration to Europe. George Soros was long silent but he hit back in June 2017 in a speech in Brussels. Soros in Brussels, 2017 “I admire the courageous way Hungarians have resisted the deception and corruption of the mafia state Orban has established.” He praised the European Commission for taking action against Orban. As well as the NGOs, a Budapest-based university became a symbol of the battle between the two men. A new law restricting foreign universities was seen as an attack on the Central European University (CEU), part-funded by Soros. Fidesz officials took to calling it the “Soros university”. After protests and international criticism, the fate of the university still hangs in the balance. Those working in critical NGOs have been referred to as “the Soros mercenaries” in the government-controlled media. “Soros is one of the most dangerous people in the world,” Andras Bencsik, editor-in-chief of the weekly Magyar Demokrata, and organiser of large pro-Fidesz rallies tells me. “Soros has caused bigger damage to civilisation than a world war.” A “Stop Soros” bill, as the government refers to it, has already been tabled by parliament, to be voted on after the election. It could make the work of several groups impossible. On Easter Friday Orban told state radio that his government had the names of 2,000 “Soros henchmen” and warned that they would be dealt with after he won the election. That is likely to bring him into more conflict with the European Union, and its strongest member, Germany. In November 2009, Viktor Orban paid a short visit to St Petersburg, to the congress of Vladimir Putin’s United Russia Party. It was a peculiar choice of trip for a man who had risen to fame in 1989 by telling Russian soldiers to get out of his country. But the 2008 financial crisis had shaken Orban’s trust in the Western economic model. By “turning to the east” - including Russia, China, and Turkey - he looked for new investors whose willingness to do business wouldn’t be affected by disdain for his domestic actions. Meeting in Moscow, 2010 He saw how the Germans, quick to lecture him about democratic issues, were quietly doing plenty of business with President Putin. Hungary is heavily dependent on Russian energy. Giant pipelines, built in the Soviet era, channel it into Hungary across Ukraine. Hungary’s lone Soviet-era nuclear power station at Paks on the Danube, was getting old. Orban was in the market for a brand new nuclear power station, Paks 2, and Putin was keen to sell. Orban went to Moscow and signed the contract, despite studies suggesting that nuclear power would cost three times more than electricity bought from the European grid. The Russians will both build and finance it via a massive loan. Full details of the contract were made secret by the Hungarian parliament for 30 years. At about the same time, Orban agreed with the Russians to extend a 20-year gas deal, due to expire in 2016, on favourable terms. “The prime minister’s strategy is to keep equal distance between two bears, the Russians and the Germans,” a close political ally of Orban tells me. “He sees the tragedies of Hungarian history stemming from being too close to one or the other. But Orban is not Putin’s puppet. In fact, Orban thinks he can manipulate Putin.” Hungary’s economic fortunes are deeply intertwined with those of Germany. A quarter of Hungarian exports go to Germany, and 300,000 people work for German companies. The car industry alone provides 175,000 jobs in Hungary. 2012: Orban opens a Hungarian factory for the German car manufacturer Daimler Relations with Angela Merkel have cooled noticeably since her last visit to Budapest in February 2015. Since then, Orban has preferred to develop his contacts with German companies based in Hungary, andwith individual German statesrather than the federal government. He wanted “more understanding, a more business-oriented focus, and less criticism on human rights and political issues,” said Milan Nic, an analyst with the German Council on Foreign Relations. Angela Merkel is said to distrust Orban Even before the 2015 refugee crisis Angela Merkel regarded Viktor Orban as “a dangerous man”. Orban’s support for Merkel’s critics in the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) - the sister party of her Christian Democratic Union - did nothing to improve their relations. German diplomatic sources say Merkel now refuses to even pick up the phone if Orban rings. This is fiercely denied by Hungarian diplomats. Hungary’s loyalty to the EU and Nato, they say, is proven by Hungary’s decision to expel a Russian diplomat over the recent Skripal poisoning affair in the UK. “There are other ways of showing solidarity with our European partners than taking in migrants,” says a senior government source, “for example by building fences to strengthen the outer borders of the EU.” Senior politicians from Germany’s CSU have pressed Hungary to compromise on migration. Part of the solution could be financial - countries that refuse asylum seekers, like Hungary, might give money to front-line states like Greece and Italy. Another option would be for Hungary to accept voluntary - not compulsory - quotas. But there are no signs yet of Orban backing down. Orban insists that the EU pay at least half his €800m (£700m) bill for building and defending the fence on the border with Serbia. Before Britain voted to leave the EU, Orban counted on it as a counterweight to French and German designs to create a stronger, deeper union. Now he relies on the four Visegrad Group countries - Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland - to act as a counterweight, a champion of national sovereignty, in the east of the EU. 2016: Orban with fellow leaders of the Visegrad Group of countries (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary) There is no European identity, Orban says, contradicting the assertions of German, as well as French leaders. But there is a central European one - between the two bears of Russia and Germany. “What I admire most in Viktor Orban,” says his loyal champion, the journalist Andras Bencsik, “is his ability to predict the future.” Bencsik compares him to a chess grandmaster who can see 25 moves in advance. Viktor Orban has promised “a settling of accounts” after the election with those who mocked, criticised, or tried to undermine his rule. “Political, moral and legal” retribution will follow, he told a rally of 100,000 supporters. Every Wednesday, Viktor Orban holds a cabinet meeting. Thursday is his reading day. The Israeli author Yuval Noah Hariri’s Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind is a recent favourite. Target Hungary by the British-based sociologist Frank Furedi is another. Boston Politics, by Thilo Schabert, a third. Natural Right and History, by the German Jewish emigre Leo Strauss, whose thinking strongly influenced a generation of Republican politicians in the US, is the latest addition to his coffee table. What the books have in common is a pessimism about the future of Western liberal civilisation, and a fondness for strong leaders, rather than strong institutions. “Orban concentrates harder than he used to, he’s not as jovial, as easy going as he was,” says Bencsik. “Those who call him ‘Machiavellian’ are mistaking that ability to concentrate, for something else.” Budapest is a small city, and almost every year I bump into the prime minister, purely by accident. I was sitting in a cafe on Normafa, a popular hill overlooking Budapest, when Orban walked in without a bodyguard, looking for a table. I greeted him and he replied: “Hello Nick. Are you still alive?” Not the friendliest greeting, but I let it pass. We shook hands. His handshake is no longer firm, I noticed. In just the past four years he has put on a lot of weight. I asked him about Hodmezovasarhely, where a recent by-election saw an independent candidate defeat the Fidesz favourite by gathering the entire anti-Fidesz vote behind him. “It will certainly change the dynamic of the campaign,” he admitted. But to the surprise of even his supporters, the Fidesz campaign focused on the “threat of migration”, instead of the economic achievements of his government. Orban appeared rattled. March 2018: Opposition activists at an election rally for the Socialist Party (MSZP) “Orban runs the country like a city, in which he has a million workers,” says Sandor Csintalan, a friend of Orban’s former ally Lajos Simicska, who is now one of his chief foes. “If he wins again, the only way he can keep power is more autocracy. You cannot consolidate a system like this, because only fear and feudal relations hold it together.” Viktor Orban has stamped his own personality on the map of Europe. He is admired across the world by people who want to defend national sovereignty from globalisation. But how will history judge him? It depends whether he ends up on the winning or the losing side. If the Visegrad 4 countries grow stronger, as a counterweight to Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel’s visions of Europe, he will feel reassured. If his critics concede that he was right to identify migration as the “curse” of this age, he will claim victory. But if future EU funds are linked to respect for European values, or if the Hungarian public grow weary of his authoritarian style, Viktor Orban will be left out in the cold. Built with Shorthand"

Electronic tags up as prisoner numbers fall,"The use of electronic tags on offenders has increased, as the number of prisoners has dropped to its lowest level in seven years, figures show. The number of prisoners released early on electronic tags rose by more than 1,000 in seven months to 3,028. The Ministry of Justice said there are about 83,000 prisoners in England and Wales, down 2,000 in four months. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the rise in tag use had contributed to the sudden drop. He said while jail staff would welcome the spare capacity in prisons, some governors have privately expressed concern that the expansion in the use of the tagging scheme has removed some of their discretion over the release of prisoners. It may also fuel fears that some offenders are being let out when they are not ready for release and may go on to commit further crimes, our correspondent added. The BBC understands this is the first time the number of offenders on electronic tags has surpassed the 3,000 mark since the tagging scheme - known as HDC (home detention curfew) - began in 1999. The last time the prisoner population was this low was in January 2011. 'More' prisoners to be freed with tag as early-release scheme simplified Why are the numbers of community sentences falling? Prisoners 'lack support after release' HDC - introduced by Labour - sees prisoners freed between two weeks and four-and-a-half months before their automatic release date. They are made to wear a tag and abide by a curfew. In February, it emerged that ministers had simplified the rules around granting HDC to ensure it became a ""normal part of release"", because only a fifth of eligible offenders were being let out. The scheme is available for those sentenced to at least three months' imprisonment. HDC is not available for sex offenders, people convicted of terrorism offences and certain violent criminals. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""While we have said that we want to see the prison population come down, we are clear that public safety is paramount. ""No one will be allowed out of prison without a thorough risk-assessment, strict license conditions, and close monitoring. ""If someone has committed a crime found worthy of a custodial sentence, we will not hesitate to lock them up."" 'More' prisoners to be freed with tags Why are community sentences falling out of favour?

"Soft drink sugar tax starts, but will it work?Half of manufacturers cut sugar content, with ministers calling it a good start in fight against obesity.4h4 hours agoHealthComments","The ""ground-breaking"" sugar tax on soft drinks has come into force in the UK. From Friday manufacturers have to pay a levy on the high-sugar drinks they sell. Ministers and campaigners believe it has already proved to be a success with many firms reducing sugar content ahead of the change. But others say it is still too early to judge the impact. Leading brands such as Fanta, Ribena and Lucozade have cut the sugar content of drinks, but Coca-Cola has not. The introduction of the levy means the UK joins a small handful of nations, including Mexico, France and Norway, which have introduced similar taxes. The levy is being applied to manufacturers - whether they pass it on to consumers or not is up to them. Drinks with more than 8g per 100ml will face a tax rate equivalent to 24p per litre. Those containing 5-8g of sugar per 100ml will face a slightly lower rate of tax, of 18p per litre. Pure fruit juices will be exempt as they do not carry added sugar, while drinks with a high milk content will also be exempt due to their calcium content. Originally, the Treasury forecast it would raise more than Â£500m a year, but that has now been reduced to Â£240m because some manufacturers have reduced the sugar content in their products. In England that income is being invested in schools sports and breakfast clubs. Products such as cakes, biscuits and other foods are not covered by the tax, although a separate initiative is encouraging manufacturers to reduce the sugar content of those items voluntarily. But will it work? The jury is still out. University of Bedfordshire nutrition expert Dr Daniel Bailey said that while the levy is a ""positive step"" in tackling obesity and had led to a ""notable"" reaction by the industry, the response by consumers is uncertain. ""The increase in tax placed on soft drinks will make products more expensive, but will this actually discourage people from buying them? ""We could just end up with consumers buying the same amount but paying more."" Polling suggests this may be the case for many people. Research by Mintel found just under half of Britons say taxing unhealthy products would encourage them to cut back. By comparison easier-to-understand nutritional information would alter the purchasing habits of three-quarters of people, the survey of 2,000 people showed. Mintel's associate director of food and drink Emma Clifford said it suggested ""carrot"" rather than ""stick"" may be a better approach. Reaction to the new tax has been mixed with many consumers arguing that government should not interfere in what they consider to be a personal choice.

Twitter user @GregoryJSpeakman added: ""Fully support the #sugartax. If we're to tackle obesity in this country then we need to take it seriously. ""We've tried education and ad campaigns, this is the next logical step."" All age groups are consuming too much sugar, with teenagers the worst offenders. They get a quarter of their sugar intake from soft drinks. Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: ""Our teenagers consume nearly a bathtub of sugary drinks each year on average, fuelling a worrying obesity trend. ""The levy is a ground-breaking policy that will help to reduce sugar intake."" Public Health England also hopes it will improve the oral health of children. To coincide with the introduction of the levy, the agency released figures showing a child in England has a tooth removed in hospital every 10 minutes due to preventable decay. PHE's Dr Sandra White said: ""It's upsetting to see so many children admitted to hospital with tooth decay."" She is urging families to skip soft drinks altogether and to consume water and lower-fat milks. Sugar tax is already producing results What happens to sugar tax money? Young 'to get biggest sugar tax boost' Why are sugar and alcohol about to get more expensive? Estimates by the Treasury based on market data suggest 50% of manufacturers have reduced the sugar content of their drinks. Fanta has cut it by nearly a third, Ribena and Irn-Bru by half and Lucozade by nearly two-thirds. Tesco has said none of its own-brand drinks will fall foul of the levy, although the process of reformulation started before the sugar tax was announced. Head of soft drinks Phil Banks, believes about 85% of products purchased at the company's stores will be below the levy threshold. ""At Tesco, things won't be so very different,"" he said. But he conceded customers could see some of the branded drinks becoming more expensive or being served in smaller containers. Earlier this year Coca-Cola announced it will cut the size of its 1.75l bottle to 1.5l and put up the price by 20p. The company said it had decided not to change its classic recipe because ""people love the taste and have told us not to change"". Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke are not affected by the levy. This video can not be played Sugar tax: Drinks becoming pricier and in smaller bottles Mexico introduced a tax on sugary drinks on 1 January 2014, which operates in a similar way to the UK's. By the end of its first full year, Mexicans were consuming 12% fewer sugary beverages than in the year leading up to the tax's introduction. The biggest reductions were among the poorest households. Researchers also looked at what happened to other drinks and found there was an increase in sales of drinks that did not come under the tax. This was mainly driven by a rise in popularity of bottled water. There is no evidence yet that this has led to a reduction in obesity - but it may well still be too soon to tell what the longer-term effects will be on the population's weight.

Paddy Jackson 'sorry' and 'ashamed',"Paddy Jackson and his teammate Stuart Olding were unanimously acquitted of rape last month An Ulster and Ireland rugby player who was last month acquitted of rape has said he is ""ashamed"" that the woman who accused him left his home distressed. Paddy Jackson said he would ""always regret"" the events of that night and apologised ""unreservedly"" for messages he sent in the aftermath. He and his teammate Stuart Olding were found not guilty of rape. But he told the Press Association he had ""betrayed the values of his family"" and was sorry. Mr Jackson was also cleared of sexual assault. He and Mr Olding have been relieved of their playing duties while an IRFU and Ulster Rugby review takes place. On Friday,campaigners took out a full-page advertisement in the Belfast Telegraph newspaper, calling for both men to be dropped by Ulster and Ireland. Mr Jackson said public criticism of his behaviour was ""fully justified"" and he expressed determination to return to the values and principles that guided his upbringing, in particular the importance of respect. He said: ""I am also truly sorry for engaging in a Whatsapp group chat which was degrading and offensive and I apologise unreservedly for this. ""The criticism of my behaviour is fully justified and I know I have betrayed the values of my family and those of the wider public. ""Following the trial I have taken time to reflect with my family on the values that were such an integral part of my upbringing, the most important of which is respect. ""My departure from these values has caused understandable public anger and I am resolutely committed to returning to those principles."" In the wake of his acquittal, Mr Olding also expressed regret for his involvement in the incident. Two other men were unanimously acquitted of lesser charges related to the high-profile case. Blane McIlroy, 26, was acquitted of exposure while Rory Harrison, 25, was found not guilty of perverting the course of justice and withholding information.

Gaia Pope police response investigated,"Gaia Pope's body was found 11 days after she went missing on 7 November The response to the disappearance and subsequent searches for teenager Gaia Pope is to be investigated by the police watchdog.

S Africa's Zuma charged with corruption,"This video can not be played Jacob Zuma in the Durban courthouse South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has been charged with corruption linked to a 1990s arms deal. After the 75-year-old's 15-minute appearance at the High Court in Durban, the case was adjourned until 8 June. He faces 16 counts of corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering, which dogged his presidency and were reinstated in 2016. Mr Zuma, who was forced out of office in February, denies any wrongdoing. His supporters descended on the city to rally for him, while his critics think court action is long overdue. After the hearing, Mr Zuma addressed the crowds who had come to stand alongside him at the court in his home province. ""I have never seen it before where someone is charged with a crime, those charges are dropped and then years later those same charges are re-instated,"" he said, speaking in Zulu. ""This is a just a political conspiracy,"" He then led the crowd in song and dance. Africa Live: latest updates The arms deal that landed Zuma in court Jacob Zuma - the survivor whose nine lives ran out The many trials of Jacob Zuma The arms deal took place in 1999, the year Mr Zuma moved from being a provincial minister to deputy president. He is accused of accepting 783 illegal payments. His financial adviser, Schabir Shaikh, was found guilty of trying to solicit bribes on his behalf from a French arms firm and was jailed in 2005. The case against Mr Zuma was dropped shortly before he ran for president in 2009. A woman representing French arms manufacturer Thales was also in the Durban courthouse on Friday, as the company faces corruption charges too. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Durban The Zuma of old is still here - the crowd pleaser, the charmer and tactical politician. This is the Jacob Zuma who boldly addressed crowds outside the courthouse, minutes after his brief hearing. A sure, perhaps even defiant, Zuma told crowds he was being targeted by political foes both within his party, the ruling African National Congress (ANC), and opposition parties who were against his attempts to bring economic empowerment to black people. Here in his home province he remains a hero who brought development to forgotten corners of this vast and largely rural province. On the face of it, he appears to be unperturbed by the latest controversy, having survived many a scandal. ""I keep asking what has Zuma done and no one has an answer for me,"" he told the crowds. And with that in mind, Mr Zuma fights on. Zuma's supporters drown out corruption charges in song The BBC's Andrew Harding says the former president appearing in court on corruption charges is hugely symbolic for South Africa's young democracy. Many, he reports, see it as an era of impunity coming to an end. The ANC, led by new president Cyril Ramaphosa, is keen to distance itself from the controversy as it prepares to contest the national elections in a year's time. Mr Ramaphosa came in on a ticket of clean governance and his party cannot afford another scandal. The ANC asked Mr Zuma's supporters not to wear its colours outside court on Friday but many did not follow this advice and were seen dressed in black, green and yellow. Hundreds of police officers were dispatched to provide security in Durban Mr Zuma's opponents had long fought for him to be charged over the 1990s bribes. The charges were reinstated in 2016 as his grip on the ANC weakened. He was facing his ninth vote of no-confidence in parliament before he left office, forced out by the ANC. His rule was beset with a series of scandals, including claims of state looting. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes In 2016, a court ruled that he had breached his oath of office by using government money to upgrade a private home in the rural area of Nkandla. He later repaid the money. Last year he was also accused of profiteering from a relationship with the wealthy Gupta family - allegations that both parties have denied. In February,Mr Zuma resigned following intense pressure from the ANC party. He had been told to step down or face another vote of no-confidence in parliament. Six reasons why S Africa's president quit Mr Zuma's remaining supporters argue that he is being targeted for backing a radical economic reform agenda. A battle is also brewing over whether the state should keep paying his legal bills.

British snowboarder suffocates in snowThe 25-year-old man was found buried head-first after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps.,"The man was skiing near the Meribel ski resort. (File pic) A British snowboarder has suffocated after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps, authorities there say. The 25-year-old man, who has not been named, was discovered buried head-first in an off-piste area near the Meribel ski resort in France on Wednesday. He was uncovered after two skiers alerted emergency services to a snowboard sticking out of the snow about 20 metres (66ft) from the piste. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. French rescuers said the man, who was a seasonal worker at the resort in south-eastern France, had suffered cardiac arrest when he was found. An Alps Mountain Rescue spokesman said the man could have been buried for up to half an hour, adding: ""He was buried up to his pelvis and the snow was very heavy, very compacted."" French authorities are investigating the incident and an inquest has been opened in the nearby town of Albertville. Foreign Office staff are in contact with police in the UK and France, as well as a tour operator, about the incident, a spokesman said. Off-piste refers to any area not marked out and maintained for use by skiers. These slopes are not groomed by snow ploughs, so rocks, precipices and cliffs may be hard to spot, especially in poor visibility. Avalanches are a major risk as marked pistes are usually protected by controlled explosions and the use of snow ploughs. Ski resorts do not have the same responsibilities for off-piste areas. The incident follows thedeath of a British skier in an off-piste area of the Alpe d'Huez, who fell from a cliff near the French Alps resort in February. Last January, British skiers Oscar Cassagneau-Francis and Rajen Mahendra, both 26,died after falling hundreds of metres in an off-piste areaof the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc region. During this winter season there have been many avalanches in the Alps, following very heavy snowfall. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collombtweeted last month to urge caution,externalto those taking part in winter sports, following a number of avalanches. ANENA, France's National Association for the Study of Snow and Avalanches, has recorded more than 30 deaths since the beginning of the ski season in November.

US judge awards art to Holocaust heirs,"Woman Hiding Her Face is one of the two artworks awarded to Fritz Grunbaum's heirs A New York judge has awarded two Nazi-looted drawings to the heirs of an Austrian Holocaust victim. The drawings - Woman Hiding Her Face and Woman in a Black Pinafore by Egon Schiele - will go to the heirs of Fritz Grunbaum, killed in Dachau concentration camp in 1941. The Nazis confiscated Grunbaum's 449-piece art collection when he was arrested in 1938. London-based art dealer Richard Nagy had claimed a legal title to the works. He had exhibited the drawings at a 2015 art show in New York, where the heirs discovered the art was up for sale. 'We should give back art looted by the Nazis' Is this your family's lost 'Nazi art'? Mr Nagy said he had bought them legally. But the Manhattan state court ruled against him, citing the 2016 Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery (Hear) Act. Egon Schiele (1890-1918), depicted here in a self-portrait, was an Austrian figurative painter The act extended the statute of limitations for making claims on Nazi-stolen art to six years after its ""actual discovery"". Raymond Dowd, a lawyer for the Grunbaum heirs - Timothy Reif, David Fraenkel and Milos Vavra - argued that the lost works were not discovered by his clients until they noticed they were up for sale at the art fair. After the ruling, Mr Dowd praised the decision for moving ""a step closer"" to recovering art taken in ""the largest mass theft in history"". The Tattooist of Auschwitz - and his secret love 'Lost' film predicting rise of Nazism returns to screen Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The case follows a failed attempt by Milos Vavra and Mr Dowd in 2005 to win restitution for another Schiele drawing from Grunbaum's collection. The court in that case ruled in favour of Boston businessman who owned the work, on the grounds that too much time had passed since the heirs had made their claim. Is this your family's lost 'Nazi art'? 'We should give back art looted by the Nazis' Nazi looted art returned to owner.

"Soft drink sugar tax starts, but will it work?","The ""ground-breaking"" sugar tax on soft drinks has come into force in the UK. From Friday manufacturers have to pay a levy on the high-sugar drinks they sell. Ministers and campaigners believe it has already proved to be a success with many firms reducing sugar content ahead of the change. But others say it is still too early to judge the impact. Leading brands such as Fanta, Ribena and Lucozade have cut the sugar content of drinks, but Coca-Cola has not. The introduction of the levy means the UK joins a small handful of nations, including Mexico, France and Norway, which have introduced similar taxes. The levy is being applied to manufacturers - whether they pass it on to consumers or not is up to them. Drinks with more than 8g per 100ml will face a tax rate equivalent to 24p per litre. Those containing 5-8g of sugar per 100ml will face a slightly lower rate of tax, of 18p per litre. Pure fruit juices will be exempt as they do not carry added sugar, while drinks with a high milk content will also be exempt due to their calcium content. Originally, the Treasury forecast it would raise more than Â£500m a year, but that has now been reduced to Â£240m because some manufacturers have reduced the sugar content in their products. In England that income is being invested in schools sports and breakfast clubs. Products such as cakes, biscuits and other foods are not covered by the tax, although a separate initiative is encouraging manufacturers to reduce the sugar content of those items voluntarily. But will it work? The jury is still out. University of Bedfordshire nutrition expert Dr Daniel Bailey said that while the levy is a ""positive step"" in tackling obesity and had led to a ""notable"" reaction by the industry, the response by consumers is uncertain. ""The increase in tax placed on soft drinks will make products more expensive, but will this actually discourage people from buying them? ""We could just end up with consumers buying the same amount but paying more."" Polling suggests this may be the case for many people. Research by Mintel found just under half of Britons say taxing unhealthy products would encourage them to cut back. By comparison easier-to-understand nutritional information would alter the purchasing habits of three-quarters of people, the survey of 2,000 people showed. Mintel's associate director of food and drink Emma Clifford said it suggested ""carrot"" rather than ""stick"" may be a better approach. Reaction to the new tax has been mixed with many consumers arguing that government should not interfere in what they consider to be a personal choice.

Twitter user @GregoryJSpeakman added: ""Fully support the #sugartax. If we're to tackle obesity in this country then we need to take it seriously. ""We've tried education and ad campaigns, this is the next logical step."" All age groups are consuming too much sugar, with teenagers the worst offenders. They get a quarter of their sugar intake from soft drinks. Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: ""Our teenagers consume nearly a bathtub of sugary drinks each year on average, fuelling a worrying obesity trend. ""The levy is a ground-breaking policy that will help to reduce sugar intake."" Public Health England also hopes it will improve the oral health of children. To coincide with the introduction of the levy, the agency released figures showing a child in England has a tooth removed in hospital every 10 minutes due to preventable decay. PHE's Dr Sandra White said: ""It's upsetting to see so many children admitted to hospital with tooth decay."" She is urging families to skip soft drinks altogether and to consume water and lower-fat milks. Sugar tax is already producing results What happens to sugar tax money? Young 'to get biggest sugar tax boost' Why are sugar and alcohol about to get more expensive? Estimates by the Treasury based on market data suggest 50% of manufacturers have reduced the sugar content of their drinks. Fanta has cut it by nearly a third, Ribena and Irn-Bru by half and Lucozade by nearly two-thirds. Tesco has said none of its own-brand drinks will fall foul of the levy, although the process of reformulation started before the sugar tax was announced. Head of soft drinks Phil Banks, believes about 85% of products purchased at the company's stores will be below the levy threshold. ""At Tesco, things won't be so very different,"" he said. But he conceded customers could see some of the branded drinks becoming more expensive or being served in smaller containers. Earlier this year Coca-Cola announced it will cut the size of its 1.75l bottle to 1.5l and put up the price by 20p. The company said it had decided not to change its classic recipe because ""people love the taste and have told us not to change"". Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke are not affected by the levy. This video can not be played Sugar tax: Drinks becoming pricier and in smaller bottles Mexico introduced a tax on sugary drinks on 1 January 2014, which operates in a similar way to the UK's. By the end of its first full year, Mexicans were consuming 12% fewer sugary beverages than in the year leading up to the tax's introduction. The biggest reductions were among the poorest households. Researchers also looked at what happened to other drinks and found there was an increase in sales of drinks that did not come under the tax. This was mainly driven by a rise in popularity of bottled water. There is no evidence yet that this has led to a reduction in obesity - but it may well still be too soon to tell what the longer-term effects will be on the population's weight.

her place in the British team for the European championships in the Summer. Simmonds - a former European and Commonwealth medallist, who
raced at the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics - was written off by many in
the sport after having her funding axed and being controversially overlooked

Wins for the Adcocks, Rajiv Ouseph and Olympic bronze medallists Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis ensured the win, before Chloe Birch and women's doubles pair Lauren Smith and Sarah Walker hit the final nail in the Aussie coffin.

it was nice whilst it lasted on day one with England dominating in the pool,

certainly a major highlight on a night of so much success for the hosts. Weâre
not quite finished though - next up are a couple of swim-offs including the
100m backstroke between Scotlandâs Kathleen Dawson & Englandâs Lizzie
Simmonds. Swimming It was Australia's day at the aquatics centre as the team came away with 15 medals in total - including six golds. South African Chad le Clos became the most successful male swimmer in history at the Commonwealth Games after winning the 50m butterfly - his 13th medal. Scotland claimed three: a bronze from Duncan Scott in the 200m free, silver from Mark Szaranek in the 400m individual medley and bronze in the 4x100m free relay. England bagged two more golds through Sarah Vasey (50m breaststroke) and Alice Tai (S9 100m free) while Lewis White added S9 100m free silver and so did the relay team. Weightlifting Wales' man of the moment Gareth Evans finally calmed down after winning weightlifting gold a little earlier today, and spoke to BBC Sport. ""It was hard not to get a bit teary, if I'm being completely honest. Like every Welshman, I'm ridiculously proud,"" he said. ""I missed out on a medal in Glasgow [2014 Commonwealth Games] and vowed I would never miss a medal again. I have let that spur me on for the past four years."" So what next for the 31-year-old? ""Beer."" Weightlifting Gareth Evans claimed Wales' first gold medal of these Games with victory in the men's -69kg. His total of 299kg was enough to surpass Sri Lanka's Indika Dissanayake Mudiyanselage, and India's Deepak Lather. There was disappointment for the home nations in the women's -58kg final, however. England's Laura Hewitt finished fourth, with Wales' Christie Williams and Scotland's Jodey Hughes in seventh and ninth respectively. Â© 2025 BBC.

Seven people were stabbed in five incidents on Thursday. Two more were injured earlier - a male in his late teens or early 20s, and a 16-year-old boy who were found with stab injuries at the Whitgift Shopping Centre in Croydon, south London. They were taken to hospital following the attack at about 17:15 BST. No arrests have been made.

Six of the reported stabbings on Thursday happened within 95 minutes of each other. Over the past two years there have been between eight and 15 ""knife crimes with injury"" on average each day in London, according to the Metropolitan Police. There were between 243 and 476 knife crimes with injury recorded in each month between February 2016 and February 2018. Last April there were 420 such crimes, an average of 14 every day. Protesters and community leaders gathered at Hackney Central station, east London, to call for an end to the recent bloodshed. It comes after London Mayor Sadiq Khandenied police had ""lost control of crime in London""in the wake of more than 50 murders in the capital this year.

Demonstrators from local churches and community groups called for unity and peace in Hackney Speaking toBBC Newsbeatnear to where the schoolgirl died, a young man called Brandon urged his peers to ""get out"" of gangs. Brandon, who used to ""chill out"" with many gang members in the area, said: ""One day I just thought, what am I really doing here? ""People are dying that are not even in gangs. I don't know what it is, if they getting killed (by) accident, or mistaken identity, and it's just making me think, you gonna be next. ""Could it be one of my family, one of my friends. Could it be me?"" Amaan Shakoor was fatally shot and another boy stabbed in Walthamstow on Monday Israel Ogunsola was stabbed to death in Hackney on Wednesday At the Hackney protest, people huddled around the station entrance before locking fists in a wide circle in solidarity for those killed. Protest organisers Guiding A New Generation - commonly known as G.A.N.G. - asked people to share their stories and pleaded for an end to the killings over a megaphone. Activist Boogz, 40, said: ""We are trying to guide these children to let them know that their life is not going in the right direction. ""I want to say to them this is not the life. ""All the music that you listen to which glorifies this kind of thing, all the money that they see, all the cars that they see people driving, they are being sold a lie, they are being sold a false narrative - and we are here to change that narrative for them.""

Che Donald, the vice chairman of the Police Federation, said London must learn from the way Glasgow had tackled knife crime Officers need help from other organisations to stop the UK from becoming a ""police state"", the vice chairman of the Police Federation told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Che Donald said the recent spike in violent crime had led to questions ""that the police can't answer on their own"". He said London must learn from the joined up approach taken byGlasgow more than a decade ago, where knife crime was treated as a public health problem. ""We have to look at the fundamental root causes of why people - young men in particular - are carrying knives on the street. Do they feel unsafe? Is it a cultural issue, is it a social issue, is it an ideological issue?"" he added. ""What we do not want to do is turn it into a police state, but unfortunately we are left with very little options and opportunities to address this growing crime.""

Russia says UK is 'playing with fire',"This video can not be played Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia: ""You are playing with fire and you will be sorry"" Russia has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" and ""playing with fire"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning. At a UN Security Council meeting, Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia with ""unsubstantiated accusations"". The UK says Russia is behind the attack but Moscow denies responsibility. Britain's UN representative Karen Pierce said the UK's actions ""stand up to any scrutiny"". She likened Moscow's requests to take part in the investigation to an arsonist investigating his own fire. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Russian tensions with West 'worse than Cold War' Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on 4 March. Ms Skripal, 33, is recovering in hospital andhas released a statementsaying her ""strength is growing daily"". Her father, 66, remains critically ill but stable. Meanwhile it has emerged that when police sealed off Mr Skripal's home at the start of the investigation. there were two guinea pigs and a cat inside. The BBC understands the guinea pigs died of starvation and the cat, distressed from dehydration, was put down. Moscow called the special meeting of the Security Council in New York to discuss the attack, saying Britain had ""legitimate questions"" to answer. Mr Nebenzia said the accusations were ""horrific and unsubstantiated"", and claimed the UK was waging a ""propaganda war"" against Russia. He said Novichok - the group of nerve agent used in the poisoning - is ""not copyrighted by Russia, in spite of the obviously Russian name"" and has been developed in many countries. ""It's some sort of theatre of the absurd. Couldn't you come up with a better fake story?"" he asked. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital In his statement to the 15-member council, Mr Nebenzia questioned why Russia would eliminate someone using a ""dangerous and highly public"" method. He contrasted the use of a chemical with the ""hundreds of clever ways of killing someone"" shown in British series Midsomer Murders. Responding, the British Ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, accused Russia of seeking to ""undermine the international institutions that have kept us safe since the Second World War"". She said Russia came under suspicion for several reasons, saying it had ""a record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations"" and that it ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"". Ms Pierce told delegates that Russia's request to visit Ms Skripal had been passed on and ""we await her response"". ""Ms Skripal's own wishes need to be taken into account,"" Ms Pierce added. This video can not be played Viktoria, the cousin of Yulia Skripal, says she is 100% certain it was her cousin who rang her On Friday, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Russia's comments were a ""classic Russian attempt to obfuscate"". He said: ""They are in a very serious position because it's not just the UK that has taken action against them. In an unprecedented way, that did not even happen in the Cold War, 29 countries have withdrawn their diplomats."" He also said the UK had shared ""highly classified information"" with the other countries which was also ""unprecedented"". Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be wrong to think Russia would end up ""admitting to all terrible sins and saying 'I was wrong, please forgive me, I will now act by your rules'. Meanwhile, US representative Kelley Currie said Russia was attempting to use the Security Council ""for political gains"", adding: ""This is not a tactic that is appropriate for this body."" The escalating diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West saw 60 expelled US envoys leave Russia on Thursday. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. The UK government has constantly maintained Russia was behind the attack, claiming there is ""no other plausible explanation"". Chemical weapons expert Hamish De Bretton Gordon said he had seen some of the intelligence in the Skripals' case and was ""100% sure"" Russia was responsible. He told BBC Radio 5 live ""we know almost 100%"" that Novichok, which requires a ""sophisticated laboratory, a lot of money, resources and expertise to make"", was made at Shikhany, a military facility ""the size of Salisbury"" in central Russia, and the agent used in the attack on the Skripals was ""military grade"". He added: ""We are talking a tiny amount [of Novichok], a quarter of an egg cup full which would be very easy to smuggle."" On Wednesday,Russia proposed a joint investigation into the poisoningbut the idea was voted down by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In a press conference, Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said it marked a vote against ""transparency"". Meanwhile on Thursday, ina statement issued through UK police, Ms Skripal thanked those who came to her and her father's aid. It came shortly afterRussian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversationbetween Ms Skripal and her cousin. Doubts were raised over the authenticity of the recording but the cousin, Viktoria, hastold Newsnight she is 100% certain it was Yulia.

Wins for the Adcocks, Rajiv Ouseph and Olympic bronze medallists Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis ensured the win, before Chloe Birch and women's doubles pair Lauren Smith and Sarah Walker hit the final nail in the Aussie coffin. They're through to the quarter-finals without dropping a rubber - impressive stuff! Hockey England's men began their Commonwealth campaign by thumping Malaysia 7-0. England's women also won, with a 5-1 victory over Wales, while Scotland are currently taking on Canada. You can watch that oneover here. Manx swimmer Atkinson fifth in 100m fly final Mark EdwardsReporter, BBC Isle of Man An amazing fifth-place finish and another Manx record for the remarkable Charlotte Atkinson. She told the BBC: âItâs a another PB and thereâs more to come from me. âItâs not even my main event.â Her time of 57.88 secs was 1.10 second down of Australian winner Emily Mckeon, (56.78) who set a new Games Record. Her strongest event is the 200m butterfly. Charlotte Atkinson Swimming Nick HopeBBC Sport on the Gold Coast Well,
it was nice whilst it lasted on day one with England dominating in the pool,
but day two certainly belonged to the Aussies. Fifteen medals - six of them gold - and a one-two-three in the womenâs 100m butterfly
certainly a major highlight on a night of so much success for the hosts. Weâre
not quite finished though - next up are a couple of swim-offs including the
100m backstroke between Scotlandâs Kathleen Dawson & Englandâs Lizzie
Simmonds. Swimming It was Australia's day at the aquatics centre as the team came away with 15 medals in total - including six golds. South African Chad le Clos became the most successful male swimmer in history at the Commonwealth Games after winning the 50m butterfly - his 13th medal. Scotland claimed three: a bronze from Duncan Scott in the 200m free, silver from Mark Szaranek in the 400m individual medley and bronze in the 4x100m free relay. England bagged two more golds through Sarah Vasey (50m breaststroke) and Alice Tai (S9 100m free) while Lewis White added S9 100m free silver and so did the relay team. Weightlifting Wales' man of the moment Gareth Evans finally calmed down after winning weightlifting gold a little earlier today, and spoke to BBC Sport. ""It was hard not to get a bit teary, if I'm being completely honest. Like every Welshman, I'm ridiculously proud,"" he said. ""I missed out on a medal in Glasgow [2014 Commonwealth Games] and vowed I would never miss a medal again. I have let that spur me on for the past four years."" So what next for the 31-year-old? ""Beer."" Weightlifting Gareth Evans claimed Wales' first gold medal of these Games with victory in the men's -69kg. His total of 299kg was enough to surpass Sri Lanka's Indika Dissanayake Mudiyanselage, and India's Deepak Lather. There was disappointment for the home nations in the women's -58kg final, however. England's Laura Hewitt finished fourth, with Wales' Christie Williams and Scotland's Jodey Hughes in seventh and ninth respectively. Â© 2025 BBC.

Young 'to get biggest boost',"The health of children will benefit most from the sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industry, according to a study. It predicted if sugar was cut in the sweetest drinks in response to the tax, levels of tooth decay, obesity and type 2 diabetes would fall, particularly among the high-consumption under-18s. Researchers said the overall effect of the tax - due to start in April 2018 - would be modest but significant. Soft drinks firms say there is no evidence a tax would cut obesity. The tax will be applied depending on the sugar content of drinks, so there will be no tax on diet drinks, a lower tax on mid-sugar drinks and a higher tax on high-sugar drinks. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the levy could add 18p to 24p to the price of a litre of fizzy drink if the full cost is passed on to the consumer. This amounts to an extra 6p on a regular can of Fanta and Sprite, and an extra 8p on a regular can of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Irn-Bru. The study,external, published in the Lancet Public Health Journal, modelled different ways that the soft drinks industry could respond to the tax and then estimated what the likely impact would be on the health of the UK population. The study estimated that reducing sugar content in the sweetest drinks by a third and mid-sugar drinks by 15% could result in more than 140,000 fewer children and adults with obesity, out of a UK total of more than 15 million. This move could also lead to 269,000 fewer cases of decaying teeth and 19,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes every year, the study said. Passing on half of the cost of the levy to consumers, leading to a 20% increase in the price of high and mid-sugar drinks, was predicted to reduce the number of obese adults and children by 81,600, cases of diabetes by 10,800, and decaying teeth by 149,000. This would impact children the most because they are the largest consumers of sugary drinks. And it would result in an average reduction in sugar intake of 5kcal per person per day - equivalent to a third of a teaspoon of sugar. Reality Check: Would the tax cost 4,000 jobs? Sugar tax: How will it work? But Prof Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said this was ""a very small reduction in energy intake"". ""It's equivalent to the amount of energy expended by one minute of brisk walking."" The industry is likely to react to the tax by using a combination of all three responses, the study said. Dr Adam Briggs, lead author of the study and from the University of Oxford, said: ""We must therefore be vigilant to ensure the food industry acts to remove sugar from soft drinks, and that where the tax is passed on to consumers, it increases the price of targeted products only - drinks with high levels of sugar."" Prof Susan Jebb, co-author, from the University of Oxford, said the levy on soft drinks would not be enough on its own to solve the obesity problem. ""We need to consider how to take effective action to reduce other sources of sugar in children's diets, notably confectionery, which has so far been relatively overlooked."" Gavin Partington, director general of The British Soft Drinks Association, said there was no evidence that a tax on soft drinks would have an impact on levels of obesity. ""The problem with this modelling is that it is based on the flawed concept that obesity can simply be attributed to calorie or sugar intake per se and consumption of one product in  particular, rather than overall lifestyle and diet. ""This error is plain to see given that sugar intake from soft drinks has been declining for several years now, down 17% since 2012.""

Tax is already getting results,"It will be a major change in health and tax policy. On 6 April the UK will join the small number of countries which have introduced a tax on sugary drinks as part of an anti-obesity policy. Shoppers will pay 18p or 24p per litre extra depending on how much extra sugar has been added to the drink. So are retailers and manufacturers in revolt and is the Treasury looking forward to a tax windfall to help prop up the public finances? The answer, intriguingly, is no to both questions. Rather than waiting to see how customers react to the tax - known officially as the soft drinks industry levy - companies have already started altering their recipes. UK pushes ahead with sugar tax Sugar tax: How will it work? Sugar tax: Drinks becoming pricier and in smaller bottles What happens to money raised by sugar tax? The fine print of Treasury budget documents reveals that the revenue from the levy will be a lot less than was first forecast. The simple explanation is that there will be fewer drinks than anticipated on sale above the threshold for paying the levy. When the Chancellor at the time George Osborneannounced in 2016,externalthere would be a tax on sugary drinks, the expected revenue was about Â£500m a year. A year later the expected yield had fallen to Â£385m. In the Budget documents in November 2017 the anticipated figure had dropped again to Â£275m per year from the launch date in April this year. Treasury mandarins might be expected to be frustrated that their anticipated tax take has fallen. But in this case it is being hailed as a success as it reflects the fact that companies have been cutting the sugar content of their products. The aim of the policy is to reduce consumption of sugar and if companies can do that by changing drink recipes ahead of the levy taking effect then that, so the argument goes, is a good outcome. Irn Bru will contain less sugar The maker of the iconic Scottish drink Irn Bru hasstopped making the original full-sugar version. The sugar content will be cut to just below the levy threshold as part of what the company AG Barr said was part of a ""long-standing sugar reduction programme"". The company said it expected 99% of its drinks range, including other brands, to be below the threshold by the time it comes into force. There has been adverse reaction to the new Irn Bru, however, from some customers who have been stockpiling the original product. Britvic is another manufacturer to have cut added sugar across its product range. The company, whose product range includes Robinson's, J2O and Fruit Shoot, has pursued this policy since 2013 and says that by 6 April, 94% of its brand portfolio will be exempt from the sugar levy. Ribena and Lucozade, owned by the Japanese company Suntory, has also moved to cut sugar. Peter Harding, chief operating officer, said: ""Over the past 16 months, we have reduced the sugar content of our core portfolio by 50%. ""Our nutritionists and research and development team have been working extremely hard to ensure our products still taste great, while containing significantly less sugar."" In simple terms these companies are reacting to their markets. They don't want their customers to have to fork out more for their favourite soft drinks from 6 April and they also sense people need help doing the ""right thing"" when shopping for their families. If shoppers want healthy options then it is in the interest of retailers and manufacturers to supply them. All this comes at a time of shifting opinion in Downing Street. Theresa May was instinctively against the idea of policies which might be seen as ""anti-business"" when she became prime minister in July 2016. The government'schildhood obesity strategy,externalwas watered down under Mrs May and waswidely criticisedwhen it was unveiled in August of that year. Restrictions on TV advertising of high calorie food and supermarket promotions were not included in the strategy. But the prime minister and her Downing Street advisers are now understood to be more sympathetic to a bolder anti-obesity plan. Advertising restrictions are back on the agenda and are being considered - there may be announcements this summer. Food manufacturers have signed up to a voluntary sugar reformulation plan and accepted a calorie reduction target without complaint and that has emboldened ministers. How consumers react when full sugar drinks go up in price from 6 April remains to be seen. But what is already clear is that the proposed levy has had an impact on the content. And that may spur the government into more action on obesity. Sugar tax: How will it work?

"Russia: UK 'playing with fire' over SkripalsMoscow's UN ambassador accuses the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning.","This video can not be played Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia: ""You are playing with fire and you will be sorry"" Russia has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" and ""playing with fire"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning. At a UN Security Council meeting, Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia with ""unsubstantiated accusations"". The UK says Russia is behind the attack but Moscow denies responsibility. Britain's UN representative Karen Pierce said the UK's actions ""stand up to any scrutiny"". She likened Moscow's requests to take part in the investigation to an arsonist investigating his own fire. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Russian tensions with West 'worse than Cold War' Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on 4 March. Ms Skripal, 33, is recovering in hospital andhas released a statementsaying her ""strength is growing daily"". Her father, 66, remains critically ill but stable. Meanwhile it has emerged that when police sealed off Mr Skripal's home at the start of the investigation. there were two guinea pigs and a cat inside. The BBC understands the guinea pigs died of starvation and the cat, distressed from dehydration, was put down. Moscow called the special meeting of the Security Council in New York to discuss the attack, saying Britain had ""legitimate questions"" to answer. Mr Nebenzia said the accusations were ""horrific and unsubstantiated"", and claimed the UK was waging a ""propaganda war"" against Russia. He said Novichok - the group of nerve agent used in the poisoning - is ""not copyrighted by Russia, in spite of the obviously Russian name"" and has been developed in many countries. ""It's some sort of theatre of the absurd. Couldn't you come up with a better fake story?"" he asked. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital In his statement to the 15-member council, Mr Nebenzia questioned why Russia would eliminate someone using a ""dangerous and highly public"" method. He contrasted the use of a chemical with the ""hundreds of clever ways of killing someone"" shown in British series Midsomer Murders. Responding, the British Ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, accused Russia of seeking to ""undermine the international institutions that have kept us safe since the Second World War"". She said Russia came under suspicion for several reasons, saying it had ""a record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations"" and that it ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"". Ms Pierce told delegates that Russia's request to visit Ms Skripal had been passed on and ""we await her response"". ""Ms Skripal's own wishes need to be taken into account,"" Ms Pierce added. This video can not be played Viktoria, the cousin of Yulia Skripal, says she is 100% certain it was her cousin who rang her On Friday, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Russia's comments were a ""classic Russian attempt to obfuscate"". He said: ""They are in a very serious position because it's not just the UK that has taken action against them. In an unprecedented way, that did not even happen in the Cold War, 29 countries have withdrawn their diplomats."" He also said the UK had shared ""highly classified information"" with the other countries which was also ""unprecedented"". Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be wrong to think Russia would end up ""admitting to all terrible sins and saying 'I was wrong, please forgive me, I will now act by your rules'. Meanwhile, US representative Kelley Currie said Russia was attempting to use the Security Council ""for political gains"", adding: ""This is not a tactic that is appropriate for this body."" The escalating diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West saw 60 expelled US envoys leave Russia on Thursday. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. The UK government has constantly maintained Russia was behind the attack, claiming there is ""no other plausible explanation"". Chemical weapons expert Hamish De Bretton Gordon said he had seen some of the intelligence in the Skripals' case and was ""100% sure"" Russia was responsible. He told BBC Radio 5 live ""we know almost 100%"" that Novichok, which requires a ""sophisticated laboratory, a lot of money, resources and expertise to make"", was made at Shikhany, a military facility ""the size of Salisbury"" in central Russia, and the agent used in the attack on the Skripals was ""military grade"". He added: ""We are talking a tiny amount [of Novichok], a quarter of an egg cup full which would be very easy to smuggle."" On Wednesday,Russia proposed a joint investigation into the poisoningbut the idea was voted down by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In a press conference, Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said it marked a vote against ""transparency"". Meanwhile on Thursday, ina statement issued through UK police, Ms Skripal thanked those who came to her and her father's aid. It came shortly afterRussian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversationbetween Ms Skripal and her cousin. Doubts were raised over the authenticity of the recording but the cousin, Viktoria, hastold Newsnight she is 100% certain it was Yulia.

"'Crafty Cockney' Eric Bristow dies, aged 60","Eric Bristow was awarded an MBE for his services to sport in 1989 Five-time world darts champion Eric Bristow has died at the age of 60 after suffering a heart attack. Professional Darts Corporation chairman Barry Hearn told BBC Sport he collapsed at a Premier League event in Liverpool. As news of his death reached the crowd at the Echo Arena, fans repeatedly sang: ""There's only one Eric Bristow."" Hearn said Bristow, known by his nickname the Crafty Cockney, would ""always be a legend in the world of darts and British sport"". World champion five times between 1980 and 1986, Bristow also won five World Masters titles and was a founder player when the PDC was formed in 1993. He was awarded an MBE for his services to sport in 1989. He also worked as a TV pundit and appeared on ITV show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here in 2012. READ MORE: 'The Crafty Cockney' - a darts pioneer This video can not be played Archive: Bristow wins first BDO World Championship in 1980 In November he lost his role with Sky aftersuggesting sexual abuse victims were not ""proper men"". After more than 20 former footballers made allegations of child sex abuse, Bristow asked on social media why victims did not ""sort out"" their abusers ""when they got older and fitter"". He later apologised for his comments, describing himself as a ""bull in a China shop"" and said he ""appreciated my wording was wrong and offended many people"". ""Eric was never afraid of controversy, but he spoke as he found and was honest and straightforward, which is what people admired about him,"" Hearn added. ""The PDC, and the sport of darts, will miss him."" Bristow competed at a World Championship for the final time in 2000 - his 23rd in a career during which he won more than 70 professional titles. He was inducted into the PDC Hall of Fame in 2005 and retired from competing at the end of 2007. PDC chief executive Matthew Porter posted on social media that he had been with Bristow at Thursday's event in Liverpool before the 60-year-old collapsed. He wrote: ""Awful evening here in Liverpool. Was with Eric earlier and he was in great spirits. A massive character. There are tears for a legend backstage here tonight."" Keith Deller, who beat Bristow to win the 1983 title, said on stage at the Echo Arena on Thursday: ""I'm devastated, me and Eric were together all the time. ""What he's done for our game, tonight, if it wasn't for Eric, no-one would be here tonight."" PDC chairman Barry Hearn, speaking to BBC Sport It's just unbelievable. He was working as normal in hospitality, started feeling ill and collapsed and died. Our thoughts go out to his family because this has come as a massive shock to the whole sport of darts. You had players in tears on the Premier League stage tonight and the crowd chanting his name endlessly because of the influence he had on darts. The word legend is overused but it's an understatement for Eric Bristow. We often talk about the absence of characters in sport but Eric Bristow was a character with a capital 'c'. He was very much a man of the people. He understood what crowds wanted to see - he was controversial, he was a maverick, he spoke his mind and upset a few people from time to time, but the man in the street warmed to him because he was very much one of theirs. He had time for people, he knew how to entertain, he developed his own style, his own persona and he transcended the sport for 10-15 years and to this day people still remember the Crafty Cockney in his pomp. He is probably one of the reasons why darts is where it is today - it hasn't lost that touch with the ordinary man, because it is made up of ordinary men with extraordinary ability, and Bristow was the ringleader from the beginning. His name is synonymous with darts. Eric Bristow and Phil Taylor are the two legendary names from that era that took the sport out of the pubs and onto the global stage. It has come out from the ordinary working man's game and Eric Bristow epitomised where the game came from but had the star quality to take it to the next level. For that, every player playing today should be grateful, because he blazed a trail. I think Eric deserves to be remembered and we'll discuss how but at the moment we're just shocked by a great player and great personality leaving us far too early at age of 60. Two-time world championMichael van Gerwenon BBC Radio Merseyside: ""It's a huge shock. He's a legend in what he did. Look at what he did for darts, how many titles he won. ""He was someone with very honest opinions. He's going to be a big miss. He was one of the makers of darts, great for the sport. He was still working always and never gave up and to hear of this - I know him quite well - I have goosebumps all over my body at the moment. ""I just heard the news straight after my game, no-one ever saw this coming. My thoughts are with his family who must be going through a horrible time right now."" Sixteen-time world championPhil Taylor, who was mentored by Bristow, wrote on Twitter: ""Words cannot express how sad and shocked I am to hear the terrible news about Eric's passing. A huge influence on my career and a larger than life character, the world has lost a legend. RIP pal."" Two-time world championDennis Priestleyalso wrote on Twitter: ""Absolutely devastated to be told earlier that my good friend Eric Bristow has passed away. We shared some great times together and I'm so saddened that we won't get to share anymore. Rest in peace old friend."" Five-time world championRaymond van Barneveld:""I am lost for words and really devastated! He was darts. He meant so much to me, I cannot believe it. My thoughts go out to his wife and family."" Two-time World Championship runner-upSimon Whitlock:""Shocked and saddened to hear the news about a true legend of the sport I love. RIP Eric Bristow. Thanks for everything you did for darts."" Former Doctor Who starColin Baker, who appeared with Bristow in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here: ""So very sad to hear about Eric Bristow tonight. He kept me sane and focused in I'm A Celeb and was a funny, forthright, no-nonsense friend. My thoughts are with his family. I'll miss him."" Kevin Painter, PDC World Championship runner-up in 2004: ""Devastated to hear the news that my great pal and darting legend Eric Bristow has passed away, RIP my friend."" Former world heavyweight boxing championFrank Bruno:""Very saddened to hear the news that Eric Bristow has passed away today, God rest his soul. RIP."" Ex-heavyweight world boxing championDavid Haye, who appeared with Bristow in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here in 2012: ""So sad to hear darts legend and great guy Eric Bristow passed away. I was fortunate to spend three weeks as his camp mate living in the jungle. Even on the toughest of days his dry sense of humour and quick wit truly made the trip memorable.

Pension costs increase a 'harsh jolt',"Millions of workers face a ""harsh jolt"" to their incomes this month, as the amount they have to pay into their pensions triples in value. From the start of the new tax year on Friday, workers in auto-enrolment pensions will see minimum contributions rise from 1% of their income to 3%. One accountancy firm is warning that pay packets will suffer as a result. But other experts say the contributions are easily affordable and will mean higher incomes in retirement. ""The increase in monthly auto-enrolment pension contributions may result in a decrease in take-home pay for some workers,"" said Rebecca Goldring, a tax manager at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. ""For many, this increase will feel like a harsh jolt."" A pension of Â£1,000 or Â£18,000: The auto-enrolment dilemma April tax changes: Will I be better or worse off? But Nathan Long, senior pension analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes most workers will shrug off the increases relatively easily. ""Workers can now look forward to retirement with more confidence,"" he said. ""Without this jump in contributions, retirement would be unaffordable for many, and an entire lifetime spent working could become the reality."" Auto-enrolment pensions began with modest contributions: 1% from the employee - including tax relief - and 1% from the employer. But to afford a decent retirement, the government has always said that rates need to rise. So from Friday, employees will pay a minimum of 3%, while employers will pay 2%. From April next year, the rates will rise again: 5% from the employee, and 3% from the employer. Someone earning an average salary of Â£27,000 - and currently paying in 1% - will have to pay an extra Â£350 or so this year. However, after contribution rates rise next April, that will rise to an extra Â£700 a year. Someone earning the minimum amount to qualify for an auto-enrolment pension - Â£10,000 a year - will pay an extra Â£78, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Former pensions minister Steve Webb has argued that millions of people receive an annual pay rise in April, which will help soften the blow. This month, more than two million people on the National Minimum Wage will see their pay rise by up to 5.3%. Figures produced for the BBC suggest that someone who pays into an auto-enrolment pension from the age of 25 could eventually earn an annual income of up to Â£18,000 a year, on top of the state pension. This assumes they use their pension pot to buy an annuity that does not increase with inflation. It also assumes that auto-enrolment pensions will soon be calculated on the whole of a person's salary. At the moment, contributions are only compulsory on earnings above Â£5,876. A worker who starts paying contributions at the age of 35 could expect a retirement income of as much as Â£11,726. Workers now have three choices: Continue paying in at the new, higher, rate Opt out of a pension altogether Opt to continue paying in at the old rate. The last option is known as ""opting down"". As far as the rules are concerned, this means that your employer is no longer obliged to make any contribution at all. However in such circumstances the Treasury would still provide tax relief. Someone who decides to do this at the age of 25 could receive as little as Â£2,000 a year in retirement. The Pensions Advisory Service hasmore advice here,external.

Wales lost 70-44 against world number two side New Zealand, while Jamaica beat South Africa 57-46 and Australia thrashed Barbados 79-24.  Table tennis Wales' women are out of the table tennis competition after defeat by Australia. They lost their quarter-final against the home favourites 3-1. There was plenty of success for the home nations in the squash. Wales' Joel Makin beat Jamaica's Chris Binnie 3-0 England's men and women all progressed beyond their round of 16 matches, including Nick Matthews and Laura Massaro. Scotland's Kevin Moran won his quarter-final, but Greg Lobban lost to England's Daryl Selby. Gymnastics team final England claimed silver in the gymnastics team event, with a total score of 162.650 points. Canada claimed the gold, while Australia had to settle for bronze. Women's 100m backstroke Nick HopeBBC Sport on the Gold Coast Scotlandâs Kathleen Dawson celebrates like sheâs won gold,
but that swim-off success over Englandâs Lizzie Simmonds is an important one
for her. Yes it puts her into tomorrowâs final, but it should confirm
her place in the British team for the European championships in the Summer. Simmonds - a former European and Commonwealth medallist, who
raced at the Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympics - was written off by many in
the sport after having her funding axed and being controversially overlooked
for selection for Rio 2016. Sheâll now have to hope for a big performance in the 200m
event later in the Gold Coast Games if sheâs to extend her career to another
major event. Women's 100m backstroke Scotland's Kathleen Dawson beat England's Lizzie Simmonds in a swim-off to reach the final of the women's 100m backstroke. They both finished their semi-finals in a time of 1 minute, 00.67 seconds meaning they had to go head-to-head in order to complete the final line-up. That result could have consequences for Simmonds as Dawson is now more likely to be selected for the Glasgow European
championships in the summer. England's women were beaten by Canada in their opening Pool A match - they lost 80-54. The men are in action tomorrow, when they play India, while Scotland's men take on Cameroon at 11:00 BST on Saturday. Swimming Nick HopeBBC Sport on the Gold Coast Rivals
in the pool, but always friends out of it. Great
to see Scotlandâs Duncan Scott and Englandâs James Guy share a laugh and joke
together moments after receiving their respective bronze and silver 4x100m
freestyle relay medals tonight. Remember
they won two Olympic silver medals together as part of the Team GB relay
line-ups at Rio 2016 and will unite again for the European championships this
summer. Dominant. Badminton It's another dominant 5-0 win for England's badminton players against hosts Australia in the mixed team event. Wins for the Adcocks, Rajiv Ouseph and Olympic bronze medallists Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis ensured the win, before Chloe Birch and women's doubles pair Lauren Smith and Sarah Walker hit the final nail in the Aussie coffin. They're through to the quarter-finals without dropping a rubber - impressive stuff! Hockey England's men began their Commonwealth campaign by thumping Malaysia 7-0. England's women also won, with a 5-1 victory over Wales, while Scotland are currently taking on Canada. You can watch that oneover here. Manx swimmer Atkinson fifth in 100m fly final Mark EdwardsReporter, BBC Isle of Man An amazing fifth-place finish and another Manx record for the remarkable Charlotte Atkinson. She told the BBC: âItâs a another PB and thereâs more to come from me. âItâs not even my main event.â Her time of 57.88 secs was 1.10 second down of Australian winner Emily Mckeon, (56.78) who set a new Games Record. Her strongest event is the 200m butterfly. Charlotte Atkinson Swimming Nick HopeBBC Sport on the Gold Coast Well,
it was nice whilst it lasted on day one with England dominating in the pool,
but day two certainly belonged to the Aussies. Fifteen medals - six of them gold - and a one-two-three in the womenâs 100m butterfly
certainly a major highlight on a night of so much success for the hosts. Weâre
not quite finished though - next up are a couple of swim-offs including the
100m backstroke between Scotlandâs Kathleen Dawson & Englandâs Lizzie
Simmonds. Swimming It was Australia's day at the aquatics centre as the team came away with 15 medals in total - including six golds. South African Chad le Clos became the most successful male swimmer in history at the Commonwealth Games after winning the 50m butterfly - his 13th medal. Scotland claimed three: a bronze from Duncan Scott in the 200m free, silver from Mark Szaranek in the 400m individual medley and bronze in the 4x100m free relay. England bagged two more golds through Sarah Vasey (50m breaststroke) and Alice Tai (S9 100m free) while Lewis White added S9 100m free silver and so did the relay team. Weightlifting Wales' man of the moment Gareth Evans finally calmed down after winning weightlifting gold a little earlier today, and spoke to BBC Sport. ""It was hard not to get a bit teary, if I'm being completely honest. Like every Welshman, I'm ridiculously proud,"" he said. ""I missed out on a medal in Glasgow [2014 Commonwealth Games] and vowed I would never miss a medal again. I have let that spur me on for the past four years."" So what next for the 31-year-old? ""Beer."" Weightlifting Gareth Evans claimed Wales' first gold medal of these Games with victory in the men's -69kg. His total of 299kg was enough to surpass Sri Lanka's Indika Dissanayake Mudiyanselage, and India's Deepak Lather. There was disappointment for the home nations in the women's -58kg final, however. England's Laura Hewitt finished fourth, with Wales' Christie Williams and Scotland's Jodey Hughes in seventh and ninth respectively. Â© 2025 BBC.

British snowboarder suffocates in snowThe 25-year-old man was found buried head-first after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps.14m14 minutes agoUK,"The man was skiing near the Meribel ski resort. (File pic) A British snowboarder has suffocated after falling into a snow-drift in the French Alps, authorities there say. The 25-year-old man, who has not been named, was discovered buried head-first in an off-piste area near the Meribel ski resort in France on Wednesday. He was uncovered after two skiers alerted emergency services to a snowboard sticking out of the snow about 20 metres (66ft) from the piste. The Foreign Office said it was giving support to the dead man's family. French rescuers said the man, who was a seasonal worker at the resort in south-eastern France, had suffered cardiac arrest when he was found. An Alps Mountain Rescue spokesman said the man could have been buried for up to half an hour, adding: ""He was buried up to his pelvis and the snow was very heavy, very compacted."" French authorities are investigating the incident and an inquest has been opened in the nearby town of Albertville. Foreign Office staff are in contact with police in the UK and France, as well as a tour operator, about the incident, a spokesman said. Off-piste refers to any area not marked out and maintained for use by skiers. These slopes are not groomed by snow ploughs, so rocks, precipices and cliffs may be hard to spot, especially in poor visibility. Avalanches are a major risk as marked pistes are usually protected by controlled explosions and the use of snow ploughs. Ski resorts do not have the same responsibilities for off-piste areas. The incident follows thedeath of a British skier in an off-piste area of the Alpe d'Huez, who fell from a cliff near the French Alps resort in February. Last January, British skiers Oscar Cassagneau-Francis and Rajen Mahendra, both 26,died after falling hundreds of metres in an off-piste areaof the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc region. During this winter season there have been many avalanches in the Alps, following very heavy snowfall. French Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collombtweeted last month to urge caution,externalto those taking part in winter sports, following a number of avalanches.

S Korea's ex-leader given heavy jail term,"Ms Park was brought to court in May 2017 shortly after her arrest South Korea's former President Park Geun-hye has been sentenced to 24 years in jail after she was found guilty of abuse of power and coercion. The verdict was broadcast live and represents the culmination of a scandal which rocked the country, fuelling rage against political and business elites. Park, who was also fined 18bn won (Â£12m, $17m), faced a string of corruption charges. The former leader was not in court on Friday for the verdict. She has boycotted her trial hearings and has previously accused the courts of being biased against her. She has also denied all wrongdoing and has said she will appeal against her sentence. Who is Park Geun-hye? South Korea's presidential scandal explained Did a puppy bring down South Korea's president? The friendship behind South Korea's presidential crisis Judge Kim Se-yoon said Park had shown ""no sign of repentance"" after causing ""massive chaos"" in the country. ""We cannot help but sternly hold her accountable,"" the judge said. South Korea's presidential residence, the Blue House, issued a statement after the verdict calling it a ""heartbreaking event for the nation"". ""A history that is not remembered is bound to be repeated,"" it read. The move by the authorities to allow Friday's verdict to be broadcast live was unprecedented, but they cited extraordinary public interest in the case. South Koreans watched as the verdict was broadcast live Park was found guilty of 16 out of 18 charges,,externalmost of which related to bribery and coercion. The court ruled that she had colluded with her close friend, Choi Soon-sil, to pressure conglomerates such as electronics giant Samsung and retail chain Lotte to give millions of dollars to foundations run by Choi. She was also convicted of forcing companies to sign lucrative deals with firms owned by Choi and donate gifts to Choi and her daughter. In addition, Park was found guilty of leaking confidential presidential documents to Choi. She has seven days to file an appeal. A friendship lies at the heart of the undoing of South Korea's first female president. Park and Choi were childhood friends and Choi swiftly became the leader's most trusted confidante. But their relationship latterly came under intense public scrutiny and the charge is that Choi had undue influence over a nation's affairs through her connection with Park. Choi (centre) was a longtime friend and adviser to former South Korean President Park Geun-hye Choi was eventually found guilty of corruption, and sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this year. After a prolonged series of hearings and months of street protests calling for her resignation, Park was finally removed from office in March 2017, making her the first democratically-elected president to be impeached. She was arrested shortly afterwards, and has been in detention ever since. Park's supporters gathered outside the court in Seoul demanding her release Some of the biggest South Korean companies and their leaders have been drawn into the scandal, as well as numerous figures from the entertainment world and government servants. Samsung's de facto leader Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y Lee, was singled out in particular after details emerged that he had given a horse to Choi's daughter Chung Yoo-ra, who is an equestrian. He was sentenced to jail, but only served five months before he was freed, when an appeals court reduced and suspended his sentence. Ms Chung has also faced scrutiny, and was extradited from Denmark to South Korea last year to face questioning. Park, the country's first female leader, was also the first democratically-elected president to be impeached. But she is not the only former president to have been arrested for corruption. South Korea's presidential problem Last month former leader Lee Myung-bak was charged with corruption over allegations he took bribes while in office. Two others, Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted for treason and corruption in the 1990s. In 2009, former president Roh Moo-hyun killed himself while he was under investigation for corruption. Park's sentencing has drawn a line under what has been one of the biggest corruption scandals to rock South Korea in recent years. The scandal has created greater awareness and criticism of the longstanding close ties between the political elite and chaebols, or family-run conglomerates which dominate South Korea's economy. It has also fuelled the rise of the liberal Moon Jae-in, Park's previous political opponent who eventually replaced her as president after campaigning on a platform of a clean government. But South Koreans are divided on the verdict. Several hundred Park supporters gathered outside the court waving national flags during the ruling. Some sat in tears after the conviction, with others started a protest march. ""The rule of law in this country is dead today,"" said one pro-Park demonstrator.

Young 'to get biggest sugar tax boost',"The health of children will benefit most from the sugar tax on the UK soft drinks industry, according to a study. It predicted if sugar was cut in the sweetest drinks in response to the tax, levels of tooth decay, obesity and type 2 diabetes would fall, particularly among the high-consumption under-18s. Researchers said the overall effect of the tax - due to start in April 2018 - would be modest but significant. Soft drinks firms say there is no evidence a tax would cut obesity. The tax will be applied depending on the sugar content of drinks, so there will be no tax on diet drinks, a lower tax on mid-sugar drinks and a higher tax on high-sugar drinks. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates the levy could add 18p to 24p to the price of a litre of fizzy drink if the full cost is passed on to the consumer. This amounts to an extra 6p on a regular can of Fanta and Sprite, and an extra 8p on a regular can of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Irn-Bru. The study,external, published in the Lancet Public Health Journal, modelled different ways that the soft drinks industry could respond to the tax and then estimated what the likely impact would be on the health of the UK population. The study estimated that reducing sugar content in the sweetest drinks by a third and mid-sugar drinks by 15% could result in more than 140,000 fewer children and adults with obesity, out of a UK total of more than 15 million. This move could also lead to 269,000 fewer cases of decaying teeth and 19,000 fewer cases of type 2 diabetes every year, the study said. Passing on half of the cost of the levy to consumers, leading to a 20% increase in the price of high and mid-sugar drinks, was predicted to reduce the number of obese adults and children by 81,600, cases of diabetes by 10,800, and decaying teeth by 149,000. This would impact children the most because they are the largest consumers of sugary drinks. And it would result in an average reduction in sugar intake of 5kcal per person per day - equivalent to a third of a teaspoon of sugar. Reality Check: Would the tax cost 4,000 jobs? Sugar tax: How will it work? But Prof Tom Sanders, professor emeritus of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, said this was ""a very small reduction in energy intake"". ""It's equivalent to the amount of energy expended by one minute of brisk walking."" The industry is likely to react to the tax by using a combination of all three responses, the study said. Dr Adam Briggs, lead author of the study and from the University of Oxford, said: ""We must therefore be vigilant to ensure the food industry acts to remove sugar from soft drinks, and that where the tax is passed on to consumers, it increases the price of targeted products only - drinks with high levels of sugar."" Prof Susan Jebb, co-author, from the University of Oxford, said the levy on soft drinks would not be enough on its own to solve the obesity problem. ""We need to consider how to take effective action to reduce other sources of sugar in children's diets, notably confectionery, which has so far been relatively overlooked."" Gavin Partington, director general of The British Soft Drinks Association, said there was no evidence that a tax on soft drinks would have an impact on levels of obesity. ""The problem with this modelling is that it is based on the flawed concept that obesity can simply be attributed to calorie or sugar intake per se and consumption of one product in  particular, rather than overall lifestyle and diet. ""This error is plain to see given that sugar intake from soft drinks has been declining for several years now, down 17% since 2012.""

Sugar tax is already producing results,"It will be a major change in health and tax policy. On 6 April the UK will join the small number of countries which have introduced a tax on sugary drinks as part of an anti-obesity policy. Shoppers will pay 18p or 24p per litre extra depending on how much extra sugar has been added to the drink. So are retailers and manufacturers in revolt and is the Treasury looking forward to a tax windfall to help prop up the public finances? The answer, intriguingly, is no to both questions. Rather than waiting to see how customers react to the tax - known officially as the soft drinks industry levy - companies have already started altering their recipes. UK pushes ahead with sugar tax Sugar tax: How will it work? Sugar tax: Drinks becoming pricier and in smaller bottles What happens to money raised by sugar tax? The fine print of Treasury budget documents reveals that the revenue from the levy will be a lot less than was first forecast. The simple explanation is that there will be fewer drinks than anticipated on sale above the threshold for paying the levy. When the Chancellor at the time George Osborneannounced in 2016,externalthere would be a tax on sugary drinks, the expected revenue was about Â£500m a year. A year later the expected yield had fallen to Â£385m. In the Budget documents in November 2017 the anticipated figure had dropped again to Â£275m per year from the launch date in April this year. Treasury mandarins might be expected to be frustrated that their anticipated tax take has fallen. But in this case it is being hailed as a success as it reflects the fact that companies have been cutting the sugar content of their products. The aim of the policy is to reduce consumption of sugar and if companies can do that by changing drink recipes ahead of the levy taking effect then that, so the argument goes, is a good outcome. Irn Bru will contain less sugar The maker of the iconic Scottish drink Irn Bru hasstopped making the original full-sugar version. The sugar content will be cut to just below the levy threshold as part of what the company AG Barr said was part of a ""long-standing sugar reduction programme"". The company said it expected 99% of its drinks range, including other brands, to be below the threshold by the time it comes into force. There has been adverse reaction to the new Irn Bru, however, from some customers who have been stockpiling the original product. Britvic is another manufacturer to have cut added sugar across its product range. The company, whose product range includes Robinson's, J2O and Fruit Shoot, has pursued this policy since 2013 and says that by 6 April, 94% of its brand portfolio will be exempt from the sugar levy. Ribena and Lucozade, owned by the Japanese company Suntory, has also moved to cut sugar. Peter Harding, chief operating officer, said: ""Over the past 16 months, we have reduced the sugar content of our core portfolio by 50%. ""Our nutritionists and research and development team have been working extremely hard to ensure our products still taste great, while containing significantly less sugar."" In simple terms these companies are reacting to their markets. They don't want their customers to have to fork out more for their favourite soft drinks from 6 April and they also sense people need help doing the ""right thing"" when shopping for their families. If shoppers want healthy options then it is in the interest of retailers and manufacturers to supply them. All this comes at a time of shifting opinion in Downing Street. Theresa May was instinctively against the idea of policies which might be seen as ""anti-business"" when she became prime minister in July 2016. The government'schildhood obesity strategy,externalwas watered down under Mrs May and waswidely criticisedwhen it was unveiled in August of that year. Restrictions on TV advertising of high calorie food and supermarket promotions were not included in the strategy. But the prime minister and her Downing Street advisers are now understood to be more sympathetic to a bolder anti-obesity plan. Advertising restrictions are back on the agenda and are being considered - there may be announcements this summer. Food manufacturers have signed up to a voluntary sugar reformulation plan and accepted a calorie reduction target without complaint and that has emboldened ministers. How consumers react when full sugar drinks go up in price from 6 April remains to be seen. But what is already clear is that the proposed levy has had an impact on the content. And that may spur the government into more action on obesity. Sugar tax: How will it work?

Watchdog probes Gaia Pope police response,"Gaia Pope's body was found 11 days after she went missing on 7 November The response to the disappearance and subsequent searches for teenager Gaia Pope is to be investigated by the police watchdog. The 19-year-old's body was found in undergrowth on the cliff top near Swanage, Dorset, 11 days after she was reported missing on 7 November. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it would examine ""actions and decisions"" of Dorset Police officers. Miss Pope's family welcomed the probe. Her sister Clara Pope-Sutherland said the family ""won't stop until we get answers"". ""I did feel that it did take a long time to find her,"" she added. ""I'm very hopeful the investigation turns out some useful and truthful information. ""It's too late for Gaia but I'm not having anybody else go though what our family has gone through, it just can't happen."" Following Miss Pope's disappearance, searches by police, the coastguard and police helicopter - along with hundreds of volunteers - were carried out in the Swanage area. Her body was found by police at 15:00 GMT on 18 November near a coastal path and field between Dancing Ledge and Anvil Point, close to where items of her clothing had been found two days earlier. Gaia Pope 'died from hypothermia' Watch: Gaia's father pays emotional tribute Arrested family want Gaia police apology The IOPC said the case had been referred to the watchdog following an internal review by Dorset Police. Director Catrin Evans said: ""We are examining the actions and decisions of Dorset Police when dealing with the missing person report made in respect of a vulnerable young woman. ""We will also consider whether the force appropriately risk assessed, resourced and reviewed the missing person report."" Search and rescue teams scoured the open space above the cliffs near Swanage in the hunt for Gaia Pope Tests showed Gaia who had severe epilepsy and mental health issues had died from hypothermia. An inquest into her death, which was adjourned until May, heard there were no suspicious circumstances or signs of third party involvement. A Dorset Police spokesperson said: ""We have an obligation to review incidents involving death or serious injury following police contact.

Pension increases a 'harsh jolt' for many,"Millions of workers face a ""harsh jolt"" to their incomes this month, as the amount they have to pay into their pensions triples in value. From the start of the new tax year on Friday, workers in auto-enrolment pensions will see minimum contributions rise from 1% of their income to 3%. One accountancy firm is warning that pay packets will suffer as a result. But other experts say the contributions are easily affordable and will mean higher incomes in retirement. ""The increase in monthly auto-enrolment pension contributions may result in a decrease in take-home pay for some workers,"" said Rebecca Goldring, a tax manager at accountancy firm Blick Rothenberg. ""For many, this increase will feel like a harsh jolt."" A pension of Â£1,000 or Â£18,000: The auto-enrolment dilemma April tax changes: Will I be better or worse off? But Nathan Long, senior pension analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, believes most workers will shrug off the increases relatively easily. ""Workers can now look forward to retirement with more confidence,"" he said. ""Without this jump in contributions, retirement would be unaffordable for many, and an entire lifetime spent working could become the reality."" Auto-enrolment pensions began with modest contributions: 1% from the employee - including tax relief - and 1% from the employer. But to afford a decent retirement, the government has always said that rates need to rise. So from Friday, employees will pay a minimum of 3%, while employers will pay 2%. From April next year, the rates will rise again: 5% from the employee, and 3% from the employer. Someone earning an average salary of Â£27,000 - and currently paying in 1% - will have to pay an extra Â£350 or so this year. However, after contribution rates rise next April, that will rise to an extra Â£700 a year. Someone earning the minimum amount to qualify for an auto-enrolment pension - Â£10,000 a year - will pay an extra Â£78, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Former pensions minister Steve Webb has argued that millions of people receive an annual pay rise in April, which will help soften the blow. This month, more than two million people on the National Minimum Wage will see their pay rise by up to 5.3%. Figures produced for the BBC suggest that someone who pays into an auto-enrolment pension from the age of 25 could eventually earn an annual income of up to Â£18,000 a year, on top of the state pension. This assumes they use their pension pot to buy an annuity that does not increase with inflation. It also assumes that auto-enrolment pensions will soon be calculated on the whole of a person's salary. At the moment, contributions are only compulsory on earnings above Â£5,876. A worker who starts paying contributions at the age of 35 could expect a retirement income of as much as Â£11,726. Workers now have three choices: Continue paying in at the new, higher, rate Opt out of a pension altogether Opt to continue paying in at the old rate. The last option is known as ""opting down"". As far as the rules are concerned, this means that your employer is no longer obliged to make any contribution at all. However in such circumstances the Treasury would still provide tax relief. Someone who decides to do this at the age of 25 could receive as little as Â£2,000 a year in retirement. The Pensions Advisory Service hasmore advice here,external.

Student loan repayment threshold rises,"Former students will be able to earn more before they have to start paying back their tuition fee loans. English and Welsh students who took out loans from September 2012 onwards - when fees in England rose to up to Â£9,000 a year - will now start to pay back when they earn Â£25,000 a year instead of Â£21,000. The government says the move could save graduates up to Â£360 a year. The National Union of Students said the change was ""welcome relief"" for many. Are you paying off a student loan? Join BBC News's Affordable Living Facebook group here.,external The Department for Education says some 600,000 graduates will benefit over the next financial year alone. Previously, the repayment threshold for post-September 2012 loans had been frozen at Â£21,000 until 2020-21, but last autumn Prime Minister Theresa May announced a rise in the threshold from this new financial year. The change will also lower the repayments of those earning over Â£25,000, as the percentage of salary paid back will be on a smaller amount. 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees May rules out scrapping tuition fees The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't Research carried out by the Institute for Fiscal Studies,externalfound raising the repayment threshold to Â£25,000 benefits middle-earning graduates the most, saving them up to Â£15,700 in repayments over their lifetimes. Lower-earning graduates, who are likely to earn below the threshold for a significant part of their career, will see a smaller reduction in lifetime repayments, the IFS calculates. While high-earning graduates - who would repay their loans in full - will see a reduction in yearly repayments, this will merely extend the period of time for which they have to repay and so will make little difference to their lifetime repayments. IFS economist Laura van der Erve said: ""Overall, repayments will fall by around Â£10,000 for the average graduate as a result of the threshold increase. ""This will significantly increase the long-run cost to the government of providing higher education. The long-run cost to the government will increase by more than Â£2bn a year, an increase of nearly 40%."" No. Graduates living in the UK will not have to do anything to receive the saving. Repayments will be calculated automatically by employers for those paid on a PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) basis or as part of the self-assessment return to HM Revenue and Customs. Yes, although the benefits are not quite so significant. For English and Welsh students who took out loans before 2012, as well as students from Scotland and Northern Ireland, the threshold rises each year in line with inflation. This year the repayment threshold will rise to Â£18,330 - up from Â£17,775 - in line with inflation at 3.1%. NUS vice-president for higher education Amatey Doku said: ""This change will be a welcome relief for many of the lowest-earning graduates. ""In recent years the expected repayment for the lowest-earning graduates has increased by 30%, thanks to the freezing of the cap at Â£21,000 instead of rising slightly each year. ""However in making this change, the government has at least acknowledged that there are serious flaws in how we fund higher education in this country. ""I hope that this will not preclude a more in-depth consideration as part of the upcoming review into post-18 funding, lest this becomes patching up the holes on a sinking ship"". But Mr Doku said the change for tuition fee loans did not address the issue of living costs. ""This will not change the fact that our maintenance model is fundamentally regressive - students from the lowest income families accrue Â£57,000 of debt, compared to Â£42,000 for their more privileged peers."" Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says the rise in the post-2012 student repayment threshold is a ""key milestone"" and shows the government is trying to support those in higher education. ""We are seeing more 18-year-olds than ever before attend university, including the highest ever number from disadvantaged backgrounds and we want to give these students a fair deal, both during their studies and afterwards too. ""Not only will it benefit hundreds of thousands of graduates in the next financial year alone, but millions in the years to come."" Mrs May announced the tuition fee loanrepayment threshold increaseon 1 October last year, four months after failing to keep her majority in the general election. At the same time, she said she had listened to voters and the fees themselves would be frozen at Â£9,250 a year in England, after a series of rises by universities. In February, Mrs Maylaunched a review of tuition feesand university funding,  saying students in England faced ""one of the most expensive systems of university tuition in the world"".

Brits to give bronze disc to new artists,"Queen are among the most-awarded artists under the current system The music industry is relaunching its gold, silver and platinum disc awards - with a twist. A new bronze disc will be awarded to ""breakthrough"" artists the first time one of their albums sells 30,000 units. The BPI, which represents the industry, said the award would benefit independent artists at the start of their career. The move reflects falling album sales in the streaming era, where fans are more likely to listen to single tracks. Cilla Black, Cliff Richard and Lulu received prototype gold discs from Disc and Music Echo magazine in 1970 Gold, silver and platinum discs were first handed out by the music industry in 1973 - although music magazine Disc and Music Echo has been presenting its own gold discs to popular artists since the 1960s. Among the very first singles to be BPI certified were Slade's Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me, The Rolling Stones' Angie, and Sorrow by David Bowie. Elton John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was the first album to be awarded a gold disc on 1 October 1973. Since then, more than 14,000 artists have received one of the coveted awards, with Queen's Greatest Hits album getting the greatest number of accolades - 20 platinum discs, representing six million sales. Elton John received the first ever gold disc, while his single Candle in the Wind has a record nine platinum discs However, albums have suffered a dramatic decline in popularity since Queen's collection hit the shelves in 1981. Last year 135 million albums were sold - a figure that includes stream-equivalent albums, where 1,000 streams count as one ""sale"" - down from a peak of 164 million in 2004. As a result, more singles are achieving sales awards. The BPI said it did not plan to revise certification levels to reflect lower album sales, but that they would be under ""regular review to ensure they remain relevant."" US pop star Camila Cabello is one of the first artists to receive a new Brit-certified gold disc Alongside the introduction of the new bronze disc, the whole certification system is being rebranded. The discs will now be known as Brit-certified awards, linking sales certifications to the industry's annual award show. Among the first singles to qualify for a Brit-certified award are Stormzy's Blinded By Your Grace Part 2 (which goes platinum), Camila Cabello's Never Be the Same (gold), and George Ezra's Paradise (silver). The Weeknd's 2016 release Starboy is the first album to receive a Brit-certified platinum disc. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

He said London must learn from the joined up approach taken byGlasgow more than a decade ago, where knife crime was treated as a public health problem.

Yulia Skripal: I'm getting stronger,"Ms Skripal and her father are in hospital in Salisbury after the attack UK police have issued a statement on behalf of Russian spy Sergei Skripal's daughter, the first since the pair were poisoned by a nerve agent in March. The statement quoted Yulia Skripal as saying her ""strength is growing daily"". Ms Skripal, 33, and her father are in hospital in Salisbury, southern England, where the attack took place. The UK Foreign Office says Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen, has not yet taken up Russia's offer of consular assistance. The Russian embassy in London said last week that it was insisting on its right to see her after it emerged that she was conscious and talking. Earlier on Thursday, Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Ms Skripal and her cousin. However, doubts have been cast on how authentic the recording is; the presenters of the programme said they had been unable to verify it and themselves had doubts about it. Mr Skripal, 66, remains critically ill but stable. The UK government has accused Russia of being behind the 4 March attack, but Russia's ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. The incident has sparked an international diplomatic crisis. The United Nations Security Council has been discussing the poisoning in a meeting called by Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the British accusations against Russia as horrific and unsubstantiated. The UK is ""playing with fire"", he said. In the statement released by the police, Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received. ""I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily,"" the statement said. ""I have many people to thank for my recovery and would especially like to mention the people of Salisbury that came to my aid when my father and I were incapacitated,"" it went on. ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" The Russian TV recording is purported to be between Ms Skripal and her cousin Viktoria, who lives in Russia. The woman described as Yulia says: ""Everything is ok. He [her father] is resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I will be discharged soon. Everything is ok."" Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK Viktoria Skripal says she hopes to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be that of Yulia tells her that no-one will give her one. Correspondents say that what Yulia says in the recording about her father ""resting"" does not chime with what we know of the Skripals' health, and the conversation about the visa is strange. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa, possibly on Thursday, and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Russian news agency Interfax also quoted the cousin as saying in an interview that they had spoken and that Yulia had told her that all was well. Viktoria expressed surprise that the phone call had come a day after she had told media that she was not allowed to speak to Yulia, Interfax reported. ""Do you believe in coincidences? I don't,"" it quoted her as saying. Viktoria is said to be one of the pair's closest living relatives after a series of family deaths. Skripal poisoning: What we know so far Full coverage of the Russian spy poisoning This video can not be played Russian news channel airs Yulia Skripal hospital 'recording' The hosts of the 60 Minute show on state-owned Rossiya 1 - Yevgeny Popov and Olga Skabeyeva - said they were unable to confirm the authenticity of the phone call. Viktoria: Hello? ""Yulia"": Hello. Can you hear me? Viktoria: Yes, I can hear you. ""Yulia"": It is Yulia Skripal. Viktoria: Oh, Yulka [diminutive of Yulia] it's you! I can tell it's you from your voice but I don't understand. So, they gave you a telephone, did they? ""Yulia"": Yes, yes. Viktoria: Thanks God! Yulyasha [diminutive of Yulia], is everything okay? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok, everything's fine. Viktoria: Look, if tomorrow I get a [British] visa, I'll come to you on Monday. ""Yulia"": Vika, no-one will give you a visa. Viktoria: Well I thought so too. Oh well. ""Yulia"": Most likely. Viktoria: If they do, I need you to tell me whether I can visit you or not, tell me that I can. ""Yulia"": I don't think so, that's the situation at the moment, we'll sort it out later. Viktoria: I know, I know. ""Yulia"": Later, we'll get it sorted later, everything's fine, we'll see later. Viktoria: Is that your phone? ""Yulia"": It's a temporary phone. Everything's fine, but we'll see how it goes, we'll decide later. You know what the situation is here. Everything is fine, everything is solvable, everyone is recovering and is alive. Viktoria: Understood. Is everything ok with your dad? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok. He's resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I'll be discharged soon. Everything is ok. Viktoria: Kisses, babes. ""Yulia"": Bye. The recording was reportedly made on the morning of 5 April The poisoning, which the UK blames on Russia, has led to worsening relations between Moscow and many Western countries, with more than 150 diplomats expelled on each side. Speaking shortly after the alleged conversation was released, Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko denied statements by UK officials that Russia did not respond to the poisoning allegations immediately. He read out a letter which he said Russia had sent denying involvement, adding that claims that Russia had a nerve agent stockpile were not true.

Trump threatens $100bn more China tariffs,"This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. US President Donald Trump has instructed officials to consider a further $100bn (Â£71.3bn) of tariffs against China, in an escalation of a tense trade stand-off. These would be in addition to the $50bn worth of US tariffs already proposed on hundreds of Chinese imports. China's Ministry of Commerce responded, saying China would ""not hesitate to pay any price"" to defend its interests. Tit-for-tat trade moves have unsettled global markets in recent weeks. The latest US proposal came after China threatened tariffs on 106 key US products. In response to Mr Trump's latest announcement, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said: ""China and the US as two world powers should treat each other on a basis of equality and with respect. ""By waving a big stick of trade sanctions against China, the US has picked a wrong target."" Ministry of Commerce Spokesman Gao Feng said: ""We do not want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight a trade war."" He said that if the US side ignores opposition from China and the international community and insists on ""unilateralist and protectionist acts,"" then China will ""not hesitate to pay any price, and will definitely strike back resolutely... [to] defend the interests of the country and its people."" Analysts have warned of the risk of a full-blown trade war for the global economy and the markets, and believe ongoing behind-the-scenes negotiations between the two giants are crucial. Market reaction in Asia on Friday suggested investors were relatively untroubled by the latest twist in the trade row.  Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose more than 1% while Japan's Nikkei index edged lower. Earlier this year, the US announced it would impose import taxes of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. The tariffs were to be wide-ranging and would include China. China responded last month with retaliatory tariffs worth $3bn of its own against the US on a range of goods, including pork and wine. Beijing said the move was intended to safeguard its interests and balance losses caused by the new tariffs. Then the US announced it was imposing some $50bn worth of tariffs on Chinese-made goods, blaming what it described as unfair Chinese intellectual property practices, such as those that pressured US companies to share technology with Chinese firms. Mr Trump argues that because Beijing forces any US firms setting up shop in China to tie up with a Chinese company, US ideas are left open to theft and abuse. Mr Trump reiterated in his statement on Thursday that China's ""illicit trade practices"" had been ignored by Washington for years and had destroyed ""thousands of American factories and millions of American jobs"". The draft details of the $50bn to $60bn worth of tariffs were released last week,externalwhen Washington set out about 1,300 Chinese products it intended to hit with tariffs set at 25%. China responded this week by proposing retaliatory tariffs, also worth some $50bn, on 106 key US products, including soybeans, aircraft parts and orange juice. This set of tariffs was narrowly aimed at politically important sectors in the US, such as agriculture. In Mr Trump's Thursday statement he branded that retaliation by Beijing as ""unfair"". ""Rather than remedy its misconduct, China has chosen to harm our farmers and manufacturers,"" he said. ""In light of China's unfair retaliation, I have instructed the USTR (United States Trade Representative) to consider whether $100bn of additional tariffs would be appropriate... and, if so, to identify the products upon which to impose such tariffs."" He said he had also instructed agricultural officials to implement a plan to protect US farmers and agricultural interests. On the political front, Mr Trump's latest announcement has elicited a less-than-friendly reception from some fellow Republicans. They have warned that the tariffs will hurt Americans and cost jobs. They have also said relationships the US has with its other big trading partners could be hurt. US retail giants including Walmart and Target have also asked Mr Trumpto consider carefully the impact the tariffs would have on consumer prices and American families. On Thursday, Ben Sasse, a Republican Senator from the farming area of Nebraska, said Mr Trump's latest plan was ""nuts"" and that he hoped the president was ""just blowing off steam"". ""Let's absolutely take on Chinese bad behaviour, but with a plan that punishes them instead of us,"" he said. ""This is the dumbest possible way to do this."" Soybeans are one of the key US exports China said it could target with tariffs Mr Sasse's comments echo sentiment pouring out of various Republican-voting farming belts in the US. America's soybean farmers are expected to be particularly hurt by Mr Trump's tariff tactics. To get a sense of how things might play out for those farmers, the trade tit-for-tat could hit soybean producers in the US - and possibly around the world. China, which is a big producer of soybeans itself, buys about 60% of all soybeans exported by the US. It uses the product to feed farmed animals, including pigs and chickens, as well as fish. Those animals are in turn used to help feed China's enormous population. China's demand for soybeans and soybean products has buoyed the price of US soybeans for some time. Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Not a trade 'war' but a trade 'dance' Why China won't baulk at US tariff threat But Beijing's tariffs against US soybeans will mostly likely see sales to China fall off, which will in turn hurt American farmers. Meanwhile, China will need to set about sourcing the extra soybeans it needs from other countries. India is one of the world's biggest soybean producers, and analysts there have already pointed to a potential trade war between the US and China as an opportunity for its economy. Other big soybean producers are Argentina and Brazil, and some studies suggest that is where China will turn to should the current set of proposed tariffs come into force. But it could end up paying more than it currently does, ultimately forcing up the price of those animals which eat soybean products. So that would mean pork, for example, China's most popular meat, could get more expensive. And food price inflation is something that will worry Beijing. China has initiated a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the US tariffs, in what analysts say is a sign that this will be a protracted process. The WTO circulated the request for consultation to members on Thursday, launching a discussion period before the complaint heads to formal dispute settlement process. Meanwhile, under US law, the proposed set of tariffs against about 1,300 Chinese products must now go under review, including a public notice and comment process, and a hearing. The hearing is scheduled at the moment for 15 May, with post-hearing filings due a week later. So, it could be some months before the USTR will announce its final findings or any decision on whether or not it will move ahead with the proposed tariffs.

Former SA President Zuma to go on trial,"This video can not be played Jacob Zuma in the Durban courthouse South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has been charged with corruption linked to a 1990s arms deal. After the 75-year-old's 15-minute appearance at the High Court in Durban, the case was adjourned until 8 June. He faces 16 counts of corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering, which dogged his presidency and were reinstated in 2016. Mr Zuma, who was forced out of office in February, denies any wrongdoing. His supporters descended on the city to rally for him, while his critics think court action is long overdue. After the hearing, Mr Zuma addressed the crowds who had come to stand alongside him at the court in his home province. ""I have never seen it before where someone is charged with a crime, those charges are dropped and then years later those same charges are re-instated,"" he said, speaking in Zulu. ""This is a just a political conspiracy,"" He then led the crowd in song and dance. Africa Live: latest updates The arms deal that landed Zuma in court Jacob Zuma - the survivor whose nine lives ran out The many trials of Jacob Zuma The arms deal took place in 1999, the year Mr Zuma moved from being a provincial minister to deputy president. He is accused of accepting 783 illegal payments. His financial adviser, Schabir Shaikh, was found guilty of trying to solicit bribes on his behalf from a French arms firm and was jailed in 2005. The case against Mr Zuma was dropped shortly before he ran for president in 2009. A woman representing French arms manufacturer Thales was also in the Durban courthouse on Friday, as the company faces corruption charges too. By Pumza Fihlani, BBC News, Durban The Zuma of old is still here - the crowd pleaser, the charmer and tactical politician. This is the Jacob Zuma who boldly addressed crowds outside the courthouse, minutes after his brief hearing. A sure, perhaps even defiant, Zuma told crowds he was being targeted by political foes both within his party, the ruling African National Congress (ANC), and opposition parties who were against his attempts to bring economic empowerment to black people. Here in his home province he remains a hero who brought development to forgotten corners of this vast and largely rural province. On the face of it, he appears to be unperturbed by the latest controversy, having survived many a scandal. ""I keep asking what has Zuma done and no one has an answer for me,"" he told the crowds. And with that in mind, Mr Zuma fights on. Zuma's supporters drown out corruption charges in song The BBC's Andrew Harding says the former president appearing in court on corruption charges is hugely symbolic for South Africa's young democracy. Many, he reports, see it as an era of impunity coming to an end. The ANC, led by new president Cyril Ramaphosa, is keen to distance itself from the controversy as it prepares to contest the national elections in a year's time. Mr Ramaphosa came in on a ticket of clean governance and his party cannot afford another scandal. The ANC asked Mr Zuma's supporters not to wear its colours outside court on Friday but many did not follow this advice and were seen dressed in black, green and yellow. Hundreds of police officers were dispatched to provide security in Durban Mr Zuma's opponents had long fought for him to be charged over the 1990s bribes. The charges were reinstated in 2016 as his grip on the ANC weakened. He was facing his ninth vote of no-confidence in parliament before he left office, forced out by the ANC. His rule was beset with a series of scandals, including claims of state looting. This video can not be played The Zuma presidency: Scandals and successes In 2016, a court ruled that he had breached his oath of office by using government money to upgrade a private home in the rural area of Nkandla. He later repaid the money. Last year he was also accused of profiteering from a relationship with the wealthy Gupta family - allegations that both parties have denied. In February,Mr Zuma resigned following intense pressure from the ANC party. He had been told to step down or face another vote of no-confidence in parliament. Six reasons why S Africa's president quit Mr Zuma's remaining supporters argue that he is being targeted for backing a radical economic reform agenda. A battle is also brewing over whether the state should keep paying his legal bills.

"LiveThe Masters - Garcia hits five in water on 15, Spieth leadsFollow live text commentary from day one at the Masters, as Tiger Woods posts a one-over-par 73, while defending champion Sergio Garcia takes 13 on one hole.","American Jordan Spieth leads on -6 -4 Finau, Kuchar -3, McIlroy, Cabrera-Bello, Stenson, Reed, Hoffman, Hadwin, Li -2 Mickelson, Fowler, Wiesberger, Z Johnson, Leishman -1 Oosthuizen, Level Rose, +1 Woods, D Johnson Champion Sergio Garcia +9 after a 13 on the 15th Alex Bysouth and Jonathan Jurejko Time for us to head back into the BBC Sport clubhouse and recharge our batteries before tomorrow. But if you're not ready to go to bed yet, here are a few Masters-related things to keep you entertained....  We'll be back from 13:30 BST tomorrow - see you then! Spieth -6 Leader Jordan Spieth was asked if yesterday was his finest round at Augusta:""It was up there, I birdied 17 and I told (caddie) Michael we got a chance to tie our record. It's up there with the top three rounds I've played here,"" he replied. ""I like that I am going off earlier tomorrow, we caught a really good break today with no wind. I told Michael I wanted to shoot three under every day but that's not going to be easy with the way the course has of bringing everybody back."" Iain CarterBBC Sport commentator at Augusta National There was a little bit of concern that we'd over-hyped the Masters but the way it panned out with the latter groups, particularly with Spieth's run of five birdies, and the big name players coming through, it's set up nicely. -6J Spieth (US) -4T Finau (US), M Kuchar (US) -3R Cabrera-Bello (Spa), A Hadwin (Can), C Hoffmann (US), Haotong Li (Chi), R McIlroy (NI), P Reed (US), H Stenson (Swe) J Rose E, D Johnson +1, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (18) A sly fist-pump from Cabrera-Bello before signing his card on the final green shows how happy he is with his opening round. The three-under 69 is the Spaniard's best round at Augusta in his third Masters. J Rose E, D Johnson +1, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (18) Rafa Cabrera-Bello leaves himself with a bit of work to do, but handily gives Justin Rose a guide to the hole. In-between the Spaniard's ball marker and Dustin Johnson's will do just nicely. Rose guides it through the gates and into the hole, signing off with a birdie and for a level-par 72. J Rose +1, D Johnson E, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (17) Oh dear, oh dear. Dustin Johnson's chip on from the side ends up on the lower tier of the green, leaving him with a horror putt to save par. Not a bad effort to be fair, just coming up a feet or three short. J Rose +1, D Johnson E, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (17) Justin Rose has a sniff of a birdie with an 18-foot putt on the last, sinking that will leave him level-pegging with Augusta. Dustin Johnson is not faring as well, booming out a loud ""Fore!"" as he ball squirts left. J Rose +1, D Johnson E, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (17) None of the lads behind can catch Spieth, although Rafa Cabrera-Bello could still take a share of second place. The Spaniard is sitting pretty in the centre of the 18th green for two, but must convert a 53-foot putt if he is to record only the 10th birdie of the day on the last. J Spieth -6 (18) Ahhh, another stunner from Jordan Spieth. A gentle, precise swing of the wedge from the left side of the green leaves him with a simple tap-in. He escapes with a bogey on the last, signing for a six-under 66. The 2015 champion is our overnight leader, two shots clear of fellow Americans Tony Finau and Matt Kuchar. That's the third time in four years that Spieth has been the overnight leader after day one at Augusta. Rory McIlroy signed for a three-under-par 69 - his best opening round since 2011. He said: ""I played a solid round, not many mistakes. I birdied three of the four par fives, four birdies, one bogey overall and to shoot something in the 60s, I'm really happy with that."" On his birdie on the par-five 13, after landing in a greenside bunker with his second shot, he said it was the ""best up and down I've made all year"". He added: ""If you shortside yourself, you're in trouble. They (tournament officials) turn something on overnight because those greens are firmer and faster than what we were practicing on."" J Rose +1, D Johnson E, R Cabrera-Bello -3 (17) Nothing is dropping for Dustin Johnson today. The world number one is getting himself into positions, but can't convert with the short stick. Another birdie chance slides by on 17, while Justin Rose drops back with a bogey. Rafa Cabrera-Bello is the in-form man among this trio, three birdies in four holes putting the Spaniard into that seven-strong pack in tied fourth. J Spieth -7 (17) Spieth has a fairway wood in hand and gives his ball a good old wallop as he chases the 18th green. But he's pulled it left and sends patrons scurrying. A dropped shot at least looks to be on the way... J Spieth -7 (17) You know I was only joking when I asked if any bookies were paying out? Right? Spieth's ball has landed behind a bush... no getting over that. He has to knock out sidewards onto the fairway, leaving him 219 yards short of the green. ""Up and down Jordan, up and down,"" says one encouraging, if very hopeful, voice from the crowd. J Spieth -7 (17) But wait! Jordan Spieth has hooked his tee shot on the last into the trees on the left. Big bother for the leader... McIlroy -3 (18) Rory McIlroy tugs his approach on the last left, knocking a precise chip back to within a few feet. Some top-drawer scrambling from the four-time major winner today. He knocks that in to complete a very tidy card - four birdies and just the one bogey. He said he wanted a fast start and that's only his second sub-70 opening round at Augusta. Unfortunately for him, Jordan Spieth is sprinting out ahead in front of him. J Spieth -7 (17) Here's one stat fans: Jordan Spieth has never birdied the 17th at Augusta. Neither have I. Guess what? Spieth has a golden chance of putting one over me here. The ice-veined Texan drills a seven-foot putt straight down the middle, that's a career-best fifth birdie on the bounce in a major. Any bookies paying out yet? P Mickelson -2, R Fowler -2, M Kuchar -4 (18) Matt Kuchar rounds off a brilliant back nine by sinking his fifth birdie, propelling him into a share of second spot with Tony Finau. His compatriots Mickelson and Fowler can't add to their tallies on the last, nevetheless these three will be happy with their work when they chat about their rounds over an ice-cold bev. J Rose E, D Johnson E (12) Justin Rose's charge has stalled a little with successive pars on 14 and 15, while Dustin Johnson also impressively pars the 15th after plopping his second shot in the drink. R McIlroy -3 (17) McIlroy's putter has been as hot as a poker on this back nine too. Not quite as red as Spieth's, but still. Chasing the Rory Slam remember, he saves a sandy par after finding the trap at the front of the green and needing his putter to rescue a seven footer. Â© 2025 BBC.
