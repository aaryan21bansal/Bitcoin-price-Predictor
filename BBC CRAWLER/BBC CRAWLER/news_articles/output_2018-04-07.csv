Canada 'in shock' at ice hockey bus crash,"A photo posted to the team's Twitter feed on 24 March after a play-off win Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says ""an entire country is in shock and mourning"" in the wake of a deadly bus crash in the province of  Saskatchewan. There was an outpouring of grief across Canada at news of the collision between a bus carrying a junior ice hockey team and a semi-trailer. The Humboldt Broncos team, which has members aged between 16 and 21, were en route on Friday to a play-off game. At least 15 people have been confirmed dead in the crash. Details have been slow to trickle out in the wake of the tragedy, and the identities of the deceased have not yet been released by authorities. Tom Straschnitzki said his son Ryan is in hospital in Saskatoon with a serious back injury, and told his father that he can't feel his legs. The family flew to his bedside on Saturday to be with him. ""He keeps asking about his team and coaches. I say: I don't know son,"" he told the BBC from his home in Airdrie, Alberta. Community members are leaving flowers and notes outside the arena where the teams plays Mr Trudeau said in a statement that ""our national hockey family is a close one, with roots in almost every town - small and big - across Canada"". He has received calls of condolences from other world leaders, including US President Donald Trump. Rob Muench, mayor of the 6,000-population city of Humboldt where the team are based, said it will take years for the community to come to grips with the tragedy. ""Throughout Canada we see teams going out into the Canadian winters on buses all the time and it's always a thought in parents' and fans' minds about what could happen,"" he said. ""There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this."" Families, friends and supporters of the Humboldt hockey team gathered in Nipawin's Apostolic Church The Humboldt Broncos, who play in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, were travelling to a game against the Nipawin Hawks. Nipawin Apostolic Church lead pastor Jordan Gadsby told the BBC he opened his church to families shortly after learning of the crash. ""The worst part of the night was sitting with and watching parents cry as they waited to find out if their son was alive or not,"" he said. ""It's an awful tragedy. I wish we could re-do yesterday. But we can't. We have tomorrow instead."" Local media showed pictures of the scene, as rescue efforts continued overnight The lorry and bus collided on Friday at around 17:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Highway 35, north of Tisdale. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said 29 people including the driver were on the bus at the time, and that15 people were killed. The other 15 passengers have been taken to hospital. Two remain in critical condition. The lorry driver was not injured in the collision. Police said on Saturday they have yet to determine the cause of the crash. Myles Shumlanski, father of one of the Broncos players, described the scene as a ""disaster"" to the Saskatoon Star Phoenix paper. ""We had a crane lifting the bus,"" he said. It is not yet known who has died. There were ice hockey coaches on the bus in addition to team members. Photographs on social media showed several of the players comforting each other in hospital.

Canada has experienced similar tragedies before. In 1986, on a frigid and blustery late December day, a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos junior hockey team hit a patch of black ice on a Saskatchewan stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway, killing four players. Since 1987, Western Hockey League team uniforms have been adorned with a clover patch in remembrance of the young men killed that day. A roadside monument was erected at the crash site 30 years later. Did you witness the crash? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Northern Irishman McIlroy, who will become the sixth man to win the career Grand Slam of golf's four majors if he wins at Augusta, is second on 11 under. Two ahead overnightto lead outright for the first time in a major, world number 24 Reed made two eagles in a 67. Rickie Fowler (65) is third on nine under, one ahead of Jon Rahm (65). The last four champions at Augusta had already won in that season, but of those within six of the lead after two rounds this year, only McIlroy, world number one Dustin Johnson and number two Justin Thomas have tasted victory so far in 2018. The Cut; BBC Radio 5 live's golf podcast from round three McIlroy made par from this picturesque, if daunting position McIlroy made a superb start playing alongside Henrik Stenson in the penultimate group. He birdied three of the first six holes and then a chip from the undulations off to the right of the eighth green hit the flag and rattled into the cup for an eagle to give him a share of the lead on nine under. This video can not be played Masters Memories 2018: McIlroy 'roaring' after stunning eagle chip It was a five-under front nine from the world number seven, his lowest at Augusta National. At the 13th, as torrential rain began to fall, his second plummeted into the brightly coloured azaleas to the left of the green and he did well to salvage par. He birdied the par-five 15th and then holed from 17 feet for another at the last to equal his lowest Masters round and ensure he will partner Reed in Sunday's final round at 19:40 BST - which you can watch, live and uninterrupted on BBC Two and the BBC Sport website from 18:30. The four-time major winner has history against American Reed, having been edged out by one hole in aclassic Ryder Cup duelat Hazeltine in 2016. A defiant McIlroy said: ""Patrick has a three-shot lead but I feel like all the pressure is on him. He has got to protect that and he has some pretty big-time players behind him."" This video can not be played 'Extraordinary' Reed retains Masters lead Three of the last four winners at Augusta were ahead at the halfway stage and Reed calmly moved clear again with his fifth run of three consecutive birdies this week. He dropped a shot at the short 12th but coaxed a downhill putt in at the next for his first eagle of the tournament, before swiftly adding another at the 15th by holing a magnificent chip over a greenside bunker - and was five in front at that stage. Reed, runner-up in last year's PGA but yet to land a major title, missed a short putt to bogey the 16th and a seven-foot birdie chance at the last, but is the first man since Lee Westwood in 2010 to play his first three rounds under 70 at the Masters. When asked about McIlroy saying the pressure was all on him, Reed replied: ""I am leading, so I guess so. But at the same time, he's trying to go for the career Grand Slam. You can put it either way. ""It's going to be electrifying. The fans are going to be ready to go, they are going to be ready to cheer for whoever is making putts, whoever is making birdies or pulling off shots."" However, since 2010, South African Charl Schwartzel is the only man outside the world's top 20 to claim the coveted Green Jacket. This video can not be played Round of the Day: Jon Rahm's superb seven under par The forecasted storms did not prove as dramatic as predicted on a third day that featured 11 sub-70 rounds. One of those was put together byRahm.The Spaniard, who was three over after Thursday's opening round, made his second eagle of the week on Saturday and added five birdies to move to eight under. The powerfully-built 23-year-old finished in a tie for 21st on his Masters debut last year. EnglishmanTommy Fleetwood,who missed the cut on his first appearance at the event 12 months ago, produced his first sub-70 round with a superb 66. This video can not be played Masters 2018: Tommy Fleetwood hails 'brilliant' day at Augusta He was level par at the halfway stage and nine shots off the pace, but leapt up the leaderboard with five successive birdies on the back nine. However, the 27-year-old from Southport three-putted the final green for a 66 to drop back to six under. Asked about his score he said: ""I need to go out and do the same on Sunday. All I can do is try shoot the same score again. If I can get going on that front nine, having watched so many Masters Sundays, it will be a joy to be part of one."" Fowler,still seeking his first major, displayed some masterful touches on the notoriously daunting greens and made five birdies and an eagle in his bogey-free round, while two-time champion Bubba Watson shares sixth place after seven birdies in a 68. Former world number oneJordan Spieth,the 2015 Masters champion, began the third round level with McIlroy at four under but dropped two shots on the front nine, before birdies at inward par fives took him to five under, alongside close friendThomas,the PGA champion, who had three birdies in a 70. Dustin Johnson'schallenge was checked by driving into the trees and making a double bogey at the 11th and he is one further back. Four-time championTiger Woods,playing alongsideIan Poulterin the fifth group of the morning, bogeyed the first two holes but made three birdies in a 72 to remain at four over. It was an eventful day for three-time winnerPhil Mickelson,who took a triple bogey seven at the first hole after some trouble with low-lying limbs of a tree, but chipped in for an eagle en route to a 74 and a seven over total. World number fiveJustin Rose,twice runner-up at Augusta in the last three years, is 11 shots off the lead after adding a 71 to rounds of 72 and 70. Rose compiled four birdies and said optimistically: ""It's a golf course you can have a big comeback on and on the Sunday the pins offer an opportunity to shoot in the low 60s. ""I'm surprised more guys haven't had comebacks here - let's hope that starts tomorrow."" Former US Amateur championMatt Fitzpatrick,the 23-year-old from Sheffield, had four birdies and an eagle in a fine 67 to reach level par, whilePaul Casey,playing with a marker in the first group of the day, returned a round of 69 and a two-over total. World number 15Tyrrell Hattonfinished with two bogeys for a 73 and is six over, one ahead of Poulter, who had five bogeys in a 74.

Facebook suspends Brexit campaign data firm,"The British Columbia-based company denies ever being part of Cambridge Analytica or its parent company SCL Facebook has suspended a Canadian data firm that played a key role in the campaign for the UK to leave the EU. The social media giant said AggregateIQ (AIQ) may have improperly received users' data. It cites reported links with the parent company of Cambridge Analytica (CA), the consultancy accused of improperly accessing the data of millions. AIQ denies ever being part of CA, its parent company SCL or accessing improperly obtained Facebook data. The Vote Leave campaign paid AIQ Â£2.7m ($3.8m) ahead of the 2016 EU referendum. An ex-volunteer with the campaign has also claimed Vote Leave donated Â£625,000 to another group to get around campaign spending limits, with most of the money going to AIQ. Vote Leave has denied any wrongdoing. AIQ's website once quoted Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings saying: ""Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn't have done it without them."" The quote has since been removed. In total, AIQ was given Â£3.5m by groups campaigning for Brexit, including Vote Leave, the Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain.The UK's Electoral Commission reopened an investigationinto Vote Leave's campaign spending in November. Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook Facebook scandal 'hit 87 million users' Can targeted online ads really change a voter's behaviour? ""In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. ""Our internal review continues, and we will co-operate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities."" In a message posted to its website, AIQ says it is ""100% Canadian owned and operated"" and ""has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL"". It adds: ""Aggregate IQ has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica."" This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded It also denied ever employing Chris Wylie, the Canadian whistleblower who alleged that the data of 50m people was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.Facebook has since said the number of people affected could be closer to 87m.CA says it obtained the data of no more than 30m people and has deleted all of it. Analysis by technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones It was three weeks ago that Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica just hours before a whistleblower's revelations to the Observer newspaper triggered the current scandal over improper use of data. Christopher Wylie insisted that Aggregate IQ was closely linked to Cambridge Analytica, and supplied documents to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee which he said proved it. Now Facebook's decision to suspend the Canadian firm from its platform appears to give further validation to Mr Wylie's claims. It also throws the spotlight back onto the potential use of Facebook data during the Brexit campaign. Facebook says it is looking into whether the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired improperly from as many as 87 million people - 1 million of them in the UK - ended up with Aggregate IQ. The firm worked for both Vote Leave and BeLeave during the EU referendum campaign, but has always insisted it has never been a part of Cambridge Analytica, and has not had access to any of its Facebook data. AIQ is a small company operating out of Victoria, British Columbia. It uses data to help micro-target voters and was founded by two Canadian political staffers. Apart from its Brexit work the company has also been accused by Mr Wylie of distributing ""incredibly anti-Islamic"" content on social media ahead of the 2015 Nigerian presidential election to discredit Muslim opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari, who went on to win the contest. The BBC has approached AIQ for a response to the Nigeria allegations. Mr Wylie has said that AIQ was referred to among Cambridge Analytica staff as ""our Canadian office"". He told the Guardian he helped to set up the firm as a ""Canadian entity for people who wanted to work on SCL projects who didn't want to move to London"" and that he had known the firm's co-founder, Jeff Silvester, since he was 16. AIQ says it ""has never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" and that ""Chris Wylie has never been employed by AggregateIQ"". Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum.

Vatican ex-diplomat held for 'child porn',"Vatican gendarmes are reportedly holding Monsignor Capella in their barracks after the arrest Police at the Vatican have arrested a priest who previously worked at the Holy See's US embassy on suspicion of possessing child pornography. Carlo Alberto Capella was taken into custody after an investigation. Monsignor Capella was recalled from the US in September 2017 after US authorities told the Vatican about a possible violation of child pornography laws by one of its diplomats. He was ordained in 1993 and joined the Vatican's diplomatic corps in 2004. The arrest could draw fresh attention to Pope Francis's efforts to snuff out child abuse in the Catholic Church. He has pledged zero tolerance but critics say he has not done enough to hold to account bishops who allegedly covered up abuse. Pope renews anti-sexual abuse panel Pope Francis: 'Decisive' action on child abuse needed Monsignor Capella's career took him to India and Hong Kong before his brief stint in the US, which lasted less than a year. After US authorities contacted the Vatican about the diplomat, he was moved home. The Vatican said it would investigate the case. A state department official told the Washington Post,externalthat the US government had asked for Monsignor Capella's diplomatic immunity be waived so he could be prosecuted in the US, but the request was refused. After Monsignor Capella was recalled from the US, police in Canada  issued a warrant for his arrest on suspicion of possessing and distributing child pornography online. Pope Benedict XVI had made Mr Capella a Monsignor in 2008, granting him the rank ""Chaplain of his Holiness"".

Lula supporters stop him surrendering,"This video can not be played Supporters blocked Lula's car Supporters of ex-Brazilian President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva have stopped him surrendering to police after he agreed to end a stand-off over his prison sentence. Scores of them blocked his car leaving the trade union building near Sao Paulo where he has been staying. He says he will give himself up despite saying he is innocent of the corruption charges of which he was convicted. Two last-minute appeals to have his arrest warrant suspended had failed.

Lula was the frontrunner for October's presidential election but his jailing will leave the race wide open. The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He was the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. The crowd had gathered for a Mass to commemorate the former leader's late wife, Marisa Leticia. On Saturday, flanked by his impeached successor as president, Dilma Rousseff, the 72-year-old delivered an impassioned 55-minute speech.

Promising to come out of his legal troubles ""bigger and stronger"", he said: ""I was born with a short neck so I can keep my head high."" When he left the stage, he was carried on the shoulders of delighted supporters chanting ""Free Lula!""

A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Read more about Lula Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president again. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. Lula posters were hung on fencing at the union building The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. ""I'm the only person being prosecuted over an apartment that isn't mine,"" Lula said on Saturday. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Lula's opponents protested outside the federal police headquarters where he was meant to surrender. The sign reads: ""Lula, the place for a thief is prison."" Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the Superior Court was declined. The two courts did not re-examine Lula's conviction, only whether legal procedures were followed correctly and his constitutional rights were observed. Allow Twitter content?

Ordering his surrender on Thursday, Judge Moro said the former president would have a separate cell with its own toilet in Curitiba. He would not be handcuffed if he came quietly, the judge promised. As a convict, Lula would normally be barred from standing for election in October but Brazil's top electoral court reserves the final decision if and when he submits his candidacy. Lula was convicted last Julyand originally sentenced to nine and a half years in prison. He lost his first appeal against the sentence in January, when the appeals court not only upheld his conviction, but increased the sentence to 12 years. Until recently, defendants in Brazil were allowed to remain free until their final appeal had been exhausted but a 2016 ruling from a lower court allowed for defendants to be sent to jail after a failed first appeal.

Mayor urges 'targeted' stop and search,"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""When stop-and-search is used properly, it's an invaluable tool to the police"" Police officers should be ""confident"" to stop and search someone they suspect of carrying an offensive weapon, London's mayor has told the BBC. Sadiq Khan backed the use of ""targeted"" stop-and-search in the capital, after six people were killed in shootings and stabbings in the past seven days. An extra 300 officers are being deployed in areas of London. Metropolitan Police CommissionerCressida Dick denied her officers had lost control of the streets. Mr Khan said stop-and-search was an ""invaluable tool"" for police when used properly - calling for ""more targeted, intelligence-led"" use of the power. He said that local communities should play a role in protecting the public. ""You could be a mum or dad, big brother, big sister, a friend, girlfriend or boyfriend - who knows somebody carrying a knife,"" he said. London killings: Why are they happening and what can be done? The faces of those killed in London No easy answers to capital's killings Met 'has not lost control of streets' The mayor, who has faced criticism for not acting quickly enough to stop the killings, said budget cuts to policing and youth centres had harmed efforts to prevent the ""evil"" of violent crime. But he added: ""I'm not excusing criminality."" The Home Office said stop-and-search powers should be used in a ""targeted way"" and it was taking action to restrict weapons.

""It's become a culture now"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to go back for revenge [but] said to myself: would my brother want me to?"" Chief Constable Sara Thornton, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said stop-and-search should not be used randomly but could work in crime hotspots. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, she said officers were reluctant to use the powers because of what she described as the ""chill effect"" of political correctness. She said policing ""cannot address the social conditions that lead to violence"" but while ""stop and search or arrests are not a silver bullet, they are an important tool in helping to protect the public from violent crime"". But Ken Hinds, chairman of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Monitoring Group, said stop-and-search too often focused on looking for drugs and he wanted more resources put into detecting knives and guns.

Doreen Lawrence calls for Met 'honesty',"Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993 The mother of Stephen Lawrence has called for the police to ""be honest"" about the likelihood that anyone else will be convicted over his murder. Doreen Lawrence told theDaily Mail,externalshe believed detectives had run out of lines of inquiry but were worried about her reaction if they close the case. Two people have been convicted over Mr Lawrence's killing in Eltham, south-east London, on 22 April 1993. A Met spokesman said ""the investigation remains live"". In 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of murder and jailed for life. Gary Dobson and David Norris were each jailed for more than 14 years However, police believe Mr Lawrence was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white men in an unprovoked racist attack as the 18-year-old waited at a bus stop with a friend. Baroness Lawrence said: ""They should be honest - say they've come to an end and stop."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Profile of teen Stephen Lawrence Stephen Lawrence inquiry probe delayed ""I think they're carrying on pretending everything's fine because they don't want to hear what I'll say if it is stopped,"" she said. Six years on from the Dobson and Norris' convictions, Baroness Lawrence said she was aware of the cost to the taxpayer of continuing the investigation. Baroness Lawrence has called on the Met to ""say they've come to an end"" of the inquiry ""I've been on the go for 25 years. I haven't stopped. I don't think I've even completely grieved for Stephen"", she told the newspaper. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan described Baroness Lawrence as a ""crusader"" whose work had led to laws being changed and two men responsible for her son's death being put behind bars. Speaking about her comments he said it was an ""operational matter for the police"" but expected detectives to ""speak to Doreen and the family before taking any steps going forward."" A Scotland Yard spokesman said the investigation into the murder ""remains in an active phase"" and the force ""continues to hold regular meetings to update the family.""

Lula posters were hung on fencing at the union building The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption.

"Facebook suspends Brexit campaign data firmAIQ, which denies links to Cambridge Analytica, may have improperly received users' data, Facebook says.","The British Columbia-based company denies ever being part of Cambridge Analytica or its parent company SCL Facebook has suspended a Canadian data firm that played a key role in the campaign for the UK to leave the EU. The social media giant said AggregateIQ (AIQ) may have improperly received users' data. It cites reported links with the parent company of Cambridge Analytica (CA), the consultancy accused of improperly accessing the data of millions. AIQ denies ever being part of CA, its parent company SCL or accessing improperly obtained Facebook data. The Vote Leave campaign paid AIQ Â£2.7m ($3.8m) ahead of the 2016 EU referendum. An ex-volunteer with the campaign has also claimed Vote Leave donated Â£625,000 to another group to get around campaign spending limits, with most of the money going to AIQ. Vote Leave has denied any wrongdoing. AIQ's website once quoted Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings saying: ""Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn't have done it without them."" The quote has since been removed. In total, AIQ was given Â£3.5m by groups campaigning for Brexit, including Vote Leave, the Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain.The UK's Electoral Commission reopened an investigationinto Vote Leave's campaign spending in November. Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook Facebook scandal 'hit 87 million users' Can targeted online ads really change a voter's behaviour? ""In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. ""Our internal review continues, and we will co-operate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities."" In a message posted to its website, AIQ says it is ""100% Canadian owned and operated"" and ""has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL"". It adds: ""Aggregate IQ has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica."" This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded It also denied ever employing Chris Wylie, the Canadian whistleblower who alleged that the data of 50m people was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.Facebook has since said the number of people affected could be closer to 87m.CA says it obtained the data of no more than 30m people and has deleted all of it. Analysis by technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones It was three weeks ago that Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica just hours before a whistleblower's revelations to the Observer newspaper triggered the current scandal over improper use of data. Christopher Wylie insisted that Aggregate IQ was closely linked to Cambridge Analytica, and supplied documents to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee which he said proved it. Now Facebook's decision to suspend the Canadian firm from its platform appears to give further validation to Mr Wylie's claims. It also throws the spotlight back onto the potential use of Facebook data during the Brexit campaign. Facebook says it is looking into whether the data that Cambridge Analytica acquired improperly from as many as 87 million people - 1 million of them in the UK - ended up with Aggregate IQ.

"Facebook suspends Brexit campaign data firmAIQ, which denies links to Cambridge Analytica, may have improperly received users' data, Facebook says.4h4 hours agoTechnology","The British Columbia-based company denies ever being part of Cambridge Analytica or its parent company SCL Facebook has suspended a Canadian data firm that played a key role in the campaign for the UK to leave the EU. The social media giant said AggregateIQ (AIQ) may have improperly received users' data. It cites reported links with the parent company of Cambridge Analytica (CA), the consultancy accused of improperly accessing the data of millions. AIQ denies ever being part of CA, its parent company SCL or accessing improperly obtained Facebook data. The Vote Leave campaign paid AIQ Â£2.7m ($3.8m) ahead of the 2016 EU referendum. An ex-volunteer with the campaign has also claimed Vote Leave donated Â£625,000 to another group to get around campaign spending limits, with most of the money going to AIQ. Vote Leave has denied any wrongdoing. AIQ's website once quoted Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings saying: ""Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn't have done it without them."" The quote has since been removed. In total, AIQ was given Â£3.5m by groups campaigning for Brexit, including Vote Leave, the Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain.The UK's Electoral Commission reopened an investigationinto Vote Leave's campaign spending in November. Zuckerberg: I'm still the man to run Facebook Facebook scandal 'hit 87 million users' Can targeted online ads really change a voter's behaviour? ""In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. ""Our internal review continues, and we will co-operate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities."" In a message posted to its website, AIQ says it is ""100% Canadian owned and operated"" and ""has never been and is not a part of Cambridge Analytica or SCL"". It adds: ""Aggregate IQ has never managed, nor did we ever have access to, any Facebook data or database allegedly obtained improperly by Cambridge Analytica."" This video can not be played How the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal unfolded It also denied ever employing Chris Wylie, the Canadian whistleblower who alleged that the data of 50m people was improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.Facebook has since said the number of people affected could be closer to 87m.CA says it obtained the data of no more than 30m people and has deleted all of it. Analysis by technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones It was three weeks ago that Facebook suspended Cambridge Analytica just hours before a whistleblower's revelations to the Observer newspaper triggered the current scandal over improper use of data. Christopher Wylie insisted that Aggregate IQ was closely linked to Cambridge Analytica, and supplied documents to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee which he said proved it. Now Facebook's decision to suspend the Canadian firm from its platform appears to give further validation to Mr Wylie's claims. It also throws the spotlight back onto the potential use of Facebook data during the Brexit campaign.

"Mayor urges 'targeted' stop and searchSadiq Khan says police should be ""confident"" to search people amid a rise in violence in London.1han hour agoLondon","This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""When stop-and-search is used properly, it's an invaluable tool to the police"" Police officers should be ""confident"" to stop and search someone they suspect of carrying an offensive weapon, London's mayor has told the BBC. Sadiq Khan backed the use of ""targeted"" stop-and-search in the capital, after six people were killed in shootings and stabbings in the past seven days. An extra 300 officers are being deployed in areas of London. Metropolitan Police CommissionerCressida Dick denied her officers had lost control of the streets. Mr Khan said stop-and-search was an ""invaluable tool"" for police when used properly - calling for ""more targeted, intelligence-led"" use of the power. He said that local communities should play a role in protecting the public. ""You could be a mum or dad, big brother, big sister, a friend, girlfriend or boyfriend - who knows somebody carrying a knife,"" he said. London killings: Why are they happening and what can be done? The faces of those killed in London No easy answers to capital's killings Met 'has not lost control of streets' The mayor, who has faced criticism for not acting quickly enough to stop the killings, said budget cuts to policing and youth centres had harmed efforts to prevent the ""evil"" of violent crime. But he added: ""I'm not excusing criminality."" The Home Office said stop-and-search powers should be used in a ""targeted way"" and it was taking action to restrict weapons.

""It's become a culture now"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to go back for revenge [but] said to myself: would my brother want me to?"" Chief Constable Sara Thornton, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said stop-and-search should not be used randomly but could work in crime hotspots. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, she said officers were reluctant to use the powers because of what she described as the ""chill effect"" of political correctness. She said policing ""cannot address the social conditions that lead to violence"" but while ""stop and search or arrests are not a silver bullet, they are an important tool in helping to protect the public from violent crime"". But Ken Hinds, chairman of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Monitoring Group, said stop-and-search too often focused on looking for drugs and he wanted more resources put into detecting knives and guns.

Supporters rally to Brazil's Lula as jail loomsBrazil's former president loses last-minute appeals to suspend the arrest warrant against him.1h43 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Dilma Rousseff (foreground) was at the side of Lula, seen here waving Former Brazilian President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has appeared on stage before supporters outside Sao Paulo as he defies a court order to begin a 12-year jail term for corruption. He emerged from the union building where he is staying to attend a Mass for his late wife, Marisa Leticia. Dilma Rousseff, his impeached successor as president, joined him on the stage along with several priests. Two last-minute appeals to have his arrest warrant suspended have failed. Lula says the case against him was politically motivated. A large crowd of supporters are surrounding the union building in the suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, where Lula built his trade union and political career. Supporters of Lula camped out at the union building The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He is the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. The authorities stress he is not being regarded as a fugitive, as everyone knows where he is. Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president in October's poll, which he had been favourite to win. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. Minutes before the deadline, his lawyers lost a bid to keep him out of jail while he appealed against his conviction. Lula posters are hung on fencing at the union building Lula's opponents protested outside the federal police headquarters where he was meant to surrender. The sign reads: ""Lula, the place for a thief is prison."" By Katy Watson, BBC News, Sao Bernardo do Campo These past 24 hours have captivated Brazil. Helicopters have been circling the metalworkers' union building where Lula is with his supporters, broadcasting every move for viewers across the country. This video can not be played Lula waves at some of his supporters, who have taken to the street As Friday went on the crowds got bigger. The deadline came and went, and the thousands of Lula fans waiting outside carried on regardless - chanting their support for a man many say was the best president Brazil ever had. What happens now though is unclear - even for a country used to complicated political sagas, this is uncharted territory. Will he go willingly, or could he - and his supporters - put up a fight? There is concern that Lula's demise could yet turn violent. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Read more about Lula The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the   Superior Court was declined. Supporters of the judge who ordered Lula's arrest are gathered outside federal police HQ The two courts did not re-examine Lula's conviction, only whether legal procedures were followed correctly and his constitutional rights were observed. Ordering his surrender on Thursday, Judge Moro said the former president would have a separate cell with its own toilet in Curitiba. He would not be handcuffed if he came quietly, the judge promised.

Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning,"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital Russian former spy Sergei Skripal is no longer in a critical condition after being poisoned by a nerve agent, doctors have said. Salisbury District Hospital said Mr Skripal is responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital for more than a month after being found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned with a toxic nerve agent called Novichok. Ms Skripal is conscious and talking in hospital. The UK government claims Russia is behind the attack but Moscow has denied all involvement, calling the accusations ""horrific and unsubstantiated"". Russia says UK is 'playing with fire' Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Meanwhile, the UK has refused to grant a visa to Yulia's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, the BBC has learned. The Home Office said the application did not comply with immigration rules. A government source told the BBC it appears Russia is ""trying to use Viktoria as a pawn"". The Russian Embassy said Sergei and Yulia Skripal ""remain hidden from the public"" as a result of the visa decision and the ""only relative"" who could reasonably expect to see them is ""kept out of the UK"". ""The stubborn refusal to cooperate, to provide transparency and to answer the numerous questions means Britain has something to hide,"" an embassy spokesman said. Viktoria later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. It comes after Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Viktoria and Yulia on Thursday. Doubts were raised over its authenticity but Viktoriahas told Newsnight she was 100% certain it was Yulia. In a statement from the hospital, medical director Christine Blanshard urged people to respect Ms Skripal's privacy ""while she continues to get better"". ""As Yulia herself says, her strength is growing daily and she can look forward to the day when she is well enough to leave the hospital,"" Dr Blanshard said. ""Any speculation on when that date will be is just that - speculation."" Viktoria Skripal gave the BBC this picture of Sergei Skripal (centre) with his daughter Yulia and late son Alexander The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said Mr Skripal's recovery meant ""we now have two individuals at the heart of this incident in Salisbury who can now speak"". He said: ""They can speak to investigators about their last movements, were there any threats, were there any other circumstances?"" Following the update on Mr Skripal's condition, the Russian Embassy tweeted: ""Good news!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The embassy later issued a statement wishing the Skripals ""get well soon"" and expressed hope that their recovery will ""contribute to the investigation"". ""We are confident that the objective probe will ultimately establish that the claims against Russia by [the] UK government are null and void,"" it added. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also called Mr Skripal's condition ""great news"" and a testament to the emergency services and NHS staff. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""very pleased"" that the Skripals were improving. ""The NHS will continue to provide ongoing care for the Skripals, both of whom are likely to have ongoing medical needs,"" the FCO said. ""Let us be clear, this was attempted murder using an illegal chemical weapon that we know Russia possesses."" By BBC Health and Science Correspondent James Gallagher Recovery from a nerve agent attack is not guaranteed, but it is not always a surprise either. Nerve agents including sarin, VX and novichok all prevent nerves functioning normally. This includes those that are necessary to breathe and keep the heart beating. They work by disrupting an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase at the junction between nerves. But over time, the nerve agent is metabolised and excreted by the body and new acetylcholinesterase is made. The question is whether doctors can keep patients alive long enough for that to happen. This would have been the focus of Sergei and Yulia Skripal's care at Salisbury District Hospital. It could have included heart and lung support, the drug atropine to counteract the effect of nerve agents and sedation to prevent brain seizures. There is still a question about the Skripals' long term recovery and whether there will be any impact on memory and brain function. Former double agent Mr Skripal, who was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain's intelligence service but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010, was being visited by his daughter Yulia when the attack happened on 4 March. The pair became ill in the centre of Salisbury after visiting The Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant. The incident sparked an escalating diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Emergency service workers in biohazard suits fix a tent over the bench where pair were found On Thursday, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzia,told the UN Security Council that Britain was ""playing with fire""and had invented a ""fake story"". Mr Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia and accused the government of waging a ""propaganda war"". Ina statement released to police on Thursday,Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received and the people of Salisbury who came to her aid. She said: ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" Britain's UN ambassador, Karen Pierce, said Russia's request for consular access to Ms Skripal has been passed on.

Russia: UK is 'playing with fire',"This video can not be played Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia: ""You are playing with fire and you will be sorry"" Russia has accused the UK of inventing a ""fake story"" and ""playing with fire"" over the Salisbury spy poisoning. At a UN Security Council meeting, Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia with ""unsubstantiated accusations"". The UK says Russia is behind the attack but Moscow denies responsibility. Britain's UN representative Karen Pierce said the UK's actions ""stand up to any scrutiny"". She likened Moscow's requests to take part in the investigation to an arsonist investigating his own fire. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Russian tensions with West 'worse than Cold War' Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on 4 March. Ms Skripal, 33, is recovering in hospital andhas released a statementsaying her ""strength is growing daily"". Her father, 66, remains critically ill but stable. Meanwhile it has emerged that when police sealed off Mr Skripal's home at the start of the investigation. there were two guinea pigs and a cat inside. The BBC understands the guinea pigs died of starvation and the cat, distressed from dehydration, was put down. Moscow called the special meeting of the Security Council in New York to discuss the attack, saying Britain had ""legitimate questions"" to answer. Mr Nebenzia said the accusations were ""horrific and unsubstantiated"", and claimed the UK was waging a ""propaganda war"" against Russia. He said Novichok - the group of nerve agent used in the poisoning - is ""not copyrighted by Russia, in spite of the obviously Russian name"" and has been developed in many countries. ""It's some sort of theatre of the absurd. Couldn't you come up with a better fake story?"" he asked. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital In his statement to the 15-member council, Mr Nebenzia questioned why Russia would eliminate someone using a ""dangerous and highly public"" method. He contrasted the use of a chemical with the ""hundreds of clever ways of killing someone"" shown in British series Midsomer Murders. Responding, the British Ambassador to the UN, Karen Pierce, accused Russia of seeking to ""undermine the international institutions that have kept us safe since the Second World War"". She said Russia came under suspicion for several reasons, saying it had ""a record of conducting state-sponsored assassinations"" and that it ""views defectors as suitable targets for assassination"". Ms Pierce told delegates that Russia's request to visit Ms Skripal had been passed on and ""we await her response"". ""Ms Skripal's own wishes need to be taken into account,"" Ms Pierce added. This video can not be played Viktoria, the cousin of Yulia Skripal, says she is 100% certain it was her cousin who rang her On Friday, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Russia's comments were a ""classic Russian attempt to obfuscate"". He said: ""They are in a very serious position because it's not just the UK that has taken action against them. In an unprecedented way, that did not even happen in the Cold War, 29 countries have withdrawn their diplomats."" He also said the UK had shared ""highly classified information"" with the other countries which was also ""unprecedented"". Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be wrong to think Russia would end up ""admitting to all terrible sins and saying 'I was wrong, please forgive me, I will now act by your rules'. Meanwhile, US representative Kelley Currie said Russia was attempting to use the Security Council ""for political gains"", adding: ""This is not a tactic that is appropriate for this body."" The escalating diplomatic crisis between Moscow and the West saw 60 expelled US envoys leave Russia on Thursday. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. The UK government has constantly maintained Russia was behind the attack, claiming there is ""no other plausible explanation"". Chemical weapons expert Hamish De Bretton Gordon said he had seen some of the intelligence in the Skripals' case and was ""100% sure"" Russia was responsible. He told BBC Radio 5 live ""we know almost 100%"" that Novichok, which requires a ""sophisticated laboratory, a lot of money, resources and expertise to make"", was made at Shikhany, a military facility ""the size of Salisbury"" in central Russia, and the agent used in the attack on the Skripals was ""military grade"". He added: ""We are talking a tiny amount [of Novichok], a quarter of an egg cup full which would be very easy to smuggle."" On Wednesday,Russia proposed a joint investigation into the poisoningbut the idea was voted down by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In a press conference, Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said it marked a vote against ""transparency"". Meanwhile on Thursday, ina statement issued through UK police, Ms Skripal thanked those who came to her and her father's aid.

Breaking|Breaking newsVan drives into pedestrians in GermanyCasualties reported in Germany as van drives into pedestrians in city of Muenster.4m4 minutes agoEurope,"The vehicle was driven, reportedly at speed, into diners in the city's old town Two people have been killed in the western German city of Muenster after a van drove into people sitting outside restaurants. The driver of the vehicle, who has not yet been officially identified, died after shooting himself at the scene. About 20 people were injured in the incident, six seriously, which occurred near the Kiepenkerl statue in the city's old town area. Authorities have said there is no indication it is an Islamist attack. How Germany van incident unfolded online State Interior Minister Herbet Reuel said investigators currently believe the perpetrator is a German citizen. Mr Reuel also said that two people had been killed by the driver, revising an earlier police figure of three. A vehicle, reportedly a grey VW van, was driven into a restaurant terrace area at 15:27 local time (14:27 BST) on Saturday. Eyewitnesses said it was driven at speed and photographs of the aftermath showed tables and chairs strewn across the popular tourist square. This video can not be played The area in Muenster's old town has been closed off while emergency services work An employee at one of the cafes told local media that she heard a bang and people screaming. ""I'm angry - it's cowardly to do something like this,"" she told German television channel N24. The suspect's motive and exact identity still remains unclear, but German media reported he was a national with mental health problems. An apartment elsewhere in the city has been searched by investigators. Daniel Kollenberg, who witnessed the aftermath, told the BBC: ""I think it is a deliberate attack because it's not allowed for cars to go in this area."" Images on social media showed furniture strewn at the scene around the city's Kiepenkerl statue He said, ""People are calm, but really shocked,"" adding that people were scared and disbelieving that such an attack could happen in Muenster. The city, in Germany's north west, has a population of about 300,000. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement she was ""deeply shaken"" by the incident. ""Everything possible is now being done to clarify the facts and to support the victims and their relatives,"" she added. The incident comes at a time of a heightened concern in Europe, following a spate of jihadist attacks using vehicles to kill pedestrians in the UK, France and Sweden. Specialist police were deployed to search the area and an apartment thought to belong to the perpetrator Local police repeatedly urged people on Saturday afternoon not to speculate about the nature of the incident and wait for official information. Germany has seen a number of jihadist attacks in recent years.In December 2016 a lorry was driven into a crowd at a Christmas market in the capital, Berlin. The attacker who hijacked the vehicle,Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri, was shot dead in Italy four days later.

Bollywood star bailed in poaching case,"The defence had contested the reliability of witnesses An Indian court has granted bail to Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, two days after he was jailed for poaching rare antelope back in 1998. The defence had questioned the testing of the animals and the reliability of witnesses, NDTV reported. On Thursday, Khan had been convicted in Jodhpur, sentenced to five years in jail and fined 10,000 rupees ($154). The court ruled Khan, 52, killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in Rajasthan while shooting a film. Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted. Khan, who spent two nights in Jodhpur jail, will appeal against his conviction at a higher court. Judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi delivered Saturday's bail decision at the Jodhpur court. The Bollywood superstar who lives dangerously Salman Khan acquitted in firearms case Huge crowds braved scorching temperatures to gather outside the building for the ruling, the BBC's Nitin Srivastava reports from the city. They started dancing and shouted slogans once they heard the result. Our correspondent says opinion had been divided on whether Khan should get bail, with animal rights activist arguing for a tougher punishment. This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain. Fans show support outside the central jail in Jodhpur In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him separately to one year and five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentences the following year, and eventually quashed both convictions in 2016. The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court. Khan was then acquitted of a third case in 2017, which was for possessing unlicensed weapons used to poach the wildlife in 1998. The original poaching complaint against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai. A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable. In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks. One of Bollywood's biggest stars, the actor has appeared in more than 100 films and has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society. His fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; Â£3.40) tickets do not come cheap. Known for his romantic roles as well as action films, Khan has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. The eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan, he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by more than 36 million fans, while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Delhi Every day in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, fans flock to Salman Khan's apartment building to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood actor. I once met a group of fans who had travelled more than five hours by bus to wait in the searing heat in the hope he would wave at them from his balcony. His films continue to draw mass audiences across urban and rural India. In a country where Bollywood is revered, Khan is one of the most worshipped. While his time in the spotlight has attracted praise and controversy in equal measure, this latest conviction is unlikely to dent his popularity or damage his career due to the cult-like status he enjoys.

David Morgan of Australia (left), Chad le Clos of South Africa and Duncan Scott of Scotland claimed the medals in the 200m butterfly final Earlier, there was better news for South Africa in the pool asChad le Closwon a third straight title in the 200m butterfly. Le Clos swam a Games record of 1:54.00 to claim his second gold and his sixth career Commonwealth title and 14th medal overall. He became the first man to win three consecutive gold medals in the same event at the Commonwealth Games.

In the men's SB8 100m breaststroke,Timothy Diskenclaimed gold for Australia, with New Zealand'sSophie Pascoewinning the women's SM10 200m individual medley. Nick Hope, BBC Sport on the Gold Coast Don't get me wrong - he is still phenomenal and clear of his opponents, but 58.84 seconds is a long way off the personal best of 57.13 and he doesn't seem to have the extra gear we're so used to seeing in the second half of that 100m race. His room-mate and close friend James Guy withdrew from the 200m butterfly tonight with dehydration and if he hasn't been well, that could have impacted on Peaty. The Englishman has admitted his focus is on swimming quicker at the Commonwealth Games and it will be interesting to see how he now performs in the 50m event.

Meet the oldest competitor in the history of the Games,"At 79 years and nine months, Robert Pitcairn is not only the oldest athlete in this year's Games - he's also the oldest in the history of the Games You've probably heard all about 11-year-old Anna Hursey, theyoungest competitorat this year's Commonwealth Games. Now, meet 79-year-oldfull bore shooterRobert Pitcairn... who's about to become your favourite story of the event. Born in 1938 â somewhat fittingly, in the same month the first Superman comic was released â Canadian Robert is not only this year's oldest competitor but he's also the proud owner of the""Oldest athlete in the history of the Games""title. So, he's apretty big deal. He's entered the history books as the oldest Commonwealth Game sathlete ever ""I feel honoured to set the new age record and grateful my health and athleticism made it possible for me to be competitive in the Gold Coast Games,"" Pitcairn said after a training session at the Belmont Shooting Centre. At 79 years and nine months old, his debut at the Games on Monday will break the record previously held by England's Doreen Flanders, who took part in lawn bowls at Glasgow 2014 a few weeks after her 79th birthday. Robert's quest to compete started in 1960 after he was introduced to shooting as an Air Force cadet. However, he was not able to be a serious contender for the Commonwealth Games until his retirement in 1998. After narrowly missing out on a spot for Manchester 2002, Robert was determined to invest more time in training for the trials for this year's Games. During the last national trial, he shot flawlessly and grabbed one of two places for the Gold Coast â an achievement he describes as ""the pinnacle of [my] long shooting career"". Now, you're probably wondering how he celebrated. Well, he replaced his 22-year-old shooting jacket with a brand new one in his beloved Canadian red and white colours. The talented marksman nabbed the Grand Aggregate Prize in Bisley, UK at the top international full bore target rifle competition in 1965 And if the fact he's almost 80 and competing in a Commonwealth Games isn't enough of a reason to get behind him, Robert used to be a commercial pilot and is well known forhis heroic past.,external In 1974, he foiled a hijacker on a 737 he was flying with 120 passengers aboard.As you do... He's even shared his expertise with his son Donald, who is also an accomplished rifle shooter. In fact, the pair both competed at the 2011 and 2015 World Long Range Rifle Championships. Robert ""enjoyed every hour"" of his 24,612 fying hours on 65 different types of plane But Robert, who turns 80 on 26 June, is not satisfied with merely being the oldest athlete in the Games' history. He wants more. ""My goal is to stand on the podium with my partner Nicole Rossignol in the pairs event, and then again for the individual event. I trained hard, I'm aiming for that, and I am going to get them,"" he said. His quest begins on Mondaywith the Queen's Prize Pairs Finals, before the medal event the following day. He will also have another chance at securing a medal when he competes in the Queen's Prize Individual on Wednesday and Thursday, which culminates in a medal event on Saturday.Good luck, Robert!

Russia requests meeting over poisoning,"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, remain in hospital The Foreign Office has described a Russian request for a meeting with Boris Johnson on the Salisbury poisoning as a ""diversionary tactic"". The Foreign Office said Russia's response had been ""unsatisfactory"", as it had been three weeks since Russia was asked to ""engage constructively"". The Russian Embassy said it was ""high time"" for a meeting on the inquiry. Current interaction between the embassy and the Foreign Office was ""utterly unsatisfactory"", it said. The Foreign Office said it would respond to the invitation for a meeting between Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko and Foreign Secretary Mr Johnson ""in due course"". It said: ""It's over three weeks since we asked Russia to engage constructively and answer a number of questions relating to the attempted assassinations of Mr Skripal and his daughter. ""Now, after failing in their attempts in the UN and international chemical weapons watchdog this week and with the victims' condition improving, they seem to be pursuing a different diversionary tactic."" The UK government says Russia is behind the attack on a Russian father and daughter - Sergei and Yulia Skripal - who were poisoned with a toxic nerve agent in Salisbury last month. Moscow has denied all involvement. Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Ina statement,external, a Russian embassy spokesman said: ""We believe that it is high time to arrange a meeting between Ambassador Alexander Yakovenko and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson."" It added that the ambassador had already sent a note to the foreign secretary, and it hoped ""the British side will engage constructively and that such meeting is arranged shortly"". The meeting request follows Russian Embassy criticism of the UK government's refusal - on immigration rules - to grant a visa to Ms Skripal's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, to visit Britain. The Russian Embassy said Sergei and Yulia ""remain hidden from the public"". ""The stubborn refusal to cooperate, to provide transparency and to answer the numerous questions means Britain has something to hide,"" the embassy said. Viktoria Skripal later told the BBC she did not have enough money in her bank account to satisfy the visa requirements. Skripal phone call: 'I have no doubt it was Yulia' Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? Mr Skripal was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain, but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010. His daughter Yulia was visiting him in the UK when the attack happened on 4 March. She is now conscious and talking in hospital. Salisbury District Hospital has said Mr Skripal, isresponding wellto treatment and ""improving rapidly"". A diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West has followed, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Russia's request for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Two days later, at a UN Security Council meeting, Moscow's UN ambassador Vasily Nebenzia said Britain's main goal had been ""to discredit and even delegitimise"" Russia with ""unsubstantiated accusations"". But Britain's UN representative Karen Pierce said the UK's actions ""stand up to any scrutiny"".

Che Donald, the vice chairman of the Police Federation, said London must learn from the way Glasgow had tackled knife crime Officers need help from other organisations to stop the UK from becoming a ""police state"", the vice chairman of the Police Federation told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Che Donald said the recent spike in violent crime had led to questions ""that the police can't answer on their own"". He said London must learn from the joined up approach taken byGlasgow more than a decade ago, where knife crime was treated as a public health problem. ""We have to look at the fundamental root causes of why people - young men in particular - are carrying knives on the street. Do they feel unsafe? Is it a cultural issue, is it a social issue, is it an ideological issue?"" he added. ""What we do not want to do is turn it into a police state, but unfortunately we are left with very little options and opportunities to address this growing crime."" In a statement, the Met said it is ""absolutely clear that we cannot tackle knife crime alone, we cannot enforce our way out of this and will do all we can to mobilise communities behind us and to help protect London"".

The BBC asked those who are dealing with the consequences of the epidemic of violence for their insights. Nequela Whittakerused to bea gang leader in south London. Now she's a youth worker. ""The youth culture seems to be falling apart at the moment. Young people don't feel like they fit in with society and there doesn't seem to be a voice for young people so at the moment there's a bit of carnage. On the streets it seems to be feuds from social media, from gang rivalry, postcode wars. At the moment it seems to be an epidemic of violence between the young people and it's getting worse. ""It's a discussion and conversation we need to have, to address what's happening and think what the community is doing. ""What is it that young people are lacking - what can we do? what opportunities can we create for young people? ""They feel that this is the life they are accustomed to - but there is a lot more out there and we need to find out what will keep them motivated. ""Due to spending cuts there has been less policing, community centres are closing. There's been not money directed at the third sector for a while and with all these cuts and reductions we've got more young people falling out on to the streets. ""Young people argue on social media over nothing. A boyfriend or girlfriend is in a feud and it escalates and you get people getting involved in situations that didn't necessarily involve that young person first hand. ""Young males are coming from homes with no fathers, no male role models. Many are lacking love. ""At the moment there are a lot of parents trying to be their children's friends rather than being the authoritarian person in their lives. When it comes to the stage of trying to impose discipline it's too late and the young person is 15 and has learnt their own way of life. ""I've got to be honest - looking back at my mindset when I was 15 or 16 - nothing would have stopped me. ""Until you've either killed someone or it's you in that body bag you're just going to get a Youth Referral Order and you'll just carry on."" Martin Griffithsis a consultant surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. ""We've seen a real sea change over the past few years, with a significant increase in the number of people who have been injured, in the number of injuries sustained per person, and the severity of those injuries. ""The youth of many of the victims and the assailants is really, really concerning. Back in the 1980s, we looked at interpersonal injuries involving knives and guns as being relatively uncommon - a niche injury. Now it's our core work. Knife and gun injury is most of what we see. We're performing major lifesaving surgery on a daily basis. ""One of my military colleagues has described the situation as like being at Camp Bastion [in Afghanistan], which is really worrying to hear. ""And we routinely have children in our care. Thirteen, 14, 15-year-olds coming in with knife and gun wounds is a daily occurrence. We used to look after people in their 20s, now children in school uniforms are being admitted. ""Some kids are involved with gangs or in the drugs trade, but more often than not it is that young people with poor impulse control who've been put into difficult situations and who don't respond well to conflict. ""I think young people are easily swayed and the lack of positive role models, mentorship, and support for young people feeds into them being led down the wrong path. ""We've seen a normalisation in attitudes toward violence globally - and also we take offence about pretty much everything. If we look at people now - things escalate on social media now about absolutely nothing. People now, when placed in conflict situations, react in a much more expressive manner. And if people who are running countries react in that manner, it's a signal for everyone to react that way. ""Members of the public who are not involved in gangs or violence let these things pass without comment. You get the society you deserve. If you ignore violence and ignore offending as a member of the public, your society will change. ""We are all responsible for what is happening right now."" Police say Jamel Boyce was involved in a ""minor scuffle"" before the stabbing Patrick Boyce's son Jamel was aged 17 when he was stabbed in Clapham in 2016. He is now in a semi-vegetative state and will never recover his brain function. ""It's a new game for the teenagers; running into one area and stabbing or shooting someone in that area and then going back to their own area. Then someone from that area will go to the other area and stab or shoot someone else. ""The tragic thing is that those they're stabbing or shooting are just innocent people who accidentally live there. ""My son was attacked after he came from college. He got stabbed in his leg and stabbed in his heart. He knew the attacker; they used to go to the same college. ""My son didn't carry a knife and he wasn't in a gang, he was just going out on the Friday afternoon after college with his friends and he got into an argument with somebody. That guy decided he wanted to kill my son. Just like that. ""These kids come from dysfunctional families, often single parents with no father around and the mother might be working 14, 16 hours a day. ""They come home and there's nobody there, so the streets become their family. They find comfort in each each other. Schools are letting them down, families are letting them down. Then they perceive that being in a gang makes them stronger, that it makes them somebody. It's a negative path for any teenager to think that is the only future they might have. ""Social media does play a part but social media does not make a teenager pick up a knife and go out on the streets with it. ""I think it's good that cuts mean community centres are closing, otherwise community centres would have more murders. Each community centre has a gang and they are going to attack each other. ""We need to get these children into a position where they can see a future, an option rather than saying they are going to pick up a knife or gun and sell drugs. And it's all down to drugs, they're killing each other because they're selling drugs."" Ken Hindsis the chairman of Haringey's Independent Stop and Search Monitoring Group. ""Stop and search,externalis playing into the hands of the violence. It needs to be used with caution or we are going to alienate the very community that is being affected disproportionately by this violence. We will alienate them into not giving intelligence to the police so they can actually find knives and guns on our streets. ""In the Haringey community what's happened now is that if you shoot me or one of my people, I am going to shoot one of your people. ""It doesn't bode well for us for this summer. ""I think we need a curfew in place for those aged 21 and under between 9pm and 7am to get a grip of what's going on across the hotspot areas, particularly in north London - the high-crime areas where the murders are happening. ""We ought to have some sort of respite and think outside the box. So if you've not got a good reason to be on the street and you're just hanging around, you should be in your home. What happens is that big groups hang about on the street or in McDonald's intimidating people. The police can't do much; if they move them on they group just goes elsewhere. ""Lots of people are not being guided, or they are being misguided. In these situations violence will happen."" Anthony Gunter (inset) researches gang violence Dr Anthony Gunter, a criminologist from the University of East London, has written a bookRace, Gangs and Youth Violence. ""The young people I spoke to felt that the gang problem was a media invention, it didn't speak about the realities of their daily lives. They believed the causes of youth violence included bad parenting, lack of youth centres, poverty, the media and status. ""They also talked about the need to have 'back-up', and the protection that comes from moving in a big group of friends. To them their experiences in their neighbourhoods represented a place of constant risk and danger. Young men in particular had to be vigilant against the constant threat of violence and robbery. ""The government has made the fatal error of assuming that all violence among young people in cities is caused by gangs. But the evidence for that is extremely thin, and much of thedata that does exist is distorted,external, London-centric, and contrived from unverified police intelligence sources and the opinions of a small group of justice professionals and senior police officers. ""The policy of austerity has had an especially large impact on those young people most affected by knife and gun violence. They no longer have access to theEducational Maintenance Allowance,external, Connexions Careers Service or housing benefits, and youth support services have been decimated. Those fortunate enough to get into university have seen tuition fees tripled, while maintenance grants for students from poorer backgrounds have been scrapped. ""The teenage years are associated with risky and problematic behaviours for everyone. But these behaviours are aggravated by poverty, inequality, school exclusions, mental illness and chaotic family circumstances. Rather than thinking of violence among young people solely as a crime problem, it should be considered a health risk, alongside drug use, smoking, drinking and unprotected sex. Then it becomes clear: the way to respond to stabbing deaths among young people is to improve their life chances and opportunities, by investing in education, health and welfare services for all. Sir Peter Fahy is a former Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahytackled violent crime during his time as Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police. He has said the police service was ""being cut in half"" due to central government spending changes. ""There's a very strong link between young people excluded from school and those who end up as offenders, often violent offenders. ""When you look at the background of most of those convicted of violent crime - sadly it is entirely predictable. ""In certain districts where there is a high level of criminality, there's a high level of social deprivation. ""In this country it's very rare for a stranger to be shot or a shooting in a robbery situation, most of it is between people with some sort of criminal association or when you get young lads involved in street gangs when they fight across territory. You see people getting shot dead for the most stupid of reasons. ""It can only be cured by good local intelligence-led policing and working with faith groups, churches, schools and community groups."" Under the Conservative and coalition governments, thenumber of police officers has fallenby somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said she was talking to the governmentabout reconsidering future funding. In response, the Home Office said it was ""undertaking a period of detailed engagement with policing partners and relevant experts"".

Doreen Lawrence calls for Met 'honesty'Stephen Lawrence's mother says she believes police have run out of lines of inquiry into his murder.1h43 minutes agoLondon,"Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993 The mother of Stephen Lawrence has called for the police to ""be honest"" about the likelihood that anyone else will be convicted over his murder. Doreen Lawrence told theDaily Mail,externalshe believed detectives had run out of lines of inquiry but were worried about her reaction if they close the case. Two people have been convicted over Mr Lawrence's killing in Eltham, south-east London, on 22 April 1993. A Met spokesman said ""the investigation remains live"". In 2012, Gary Dobson and David Norris were found guilty of murder and jailed for life. Gary Dobson and David Norris were each jailed for more than 14 years However, police believe Mr Lawrence was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white men in an unprovoked racist attack as the 18-year-old waited at a bus stop with a friend. Baroness Lawrence said: ""They should be honest - say they've come to an end and stop."" Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline Profile of teen Stephen Lawrence Stephen Lawrence inquiry probe delayed ""I think they're carrying on pretending everything's fine because they don't want to hear what I'll say if it is stopped,"" she said. Six years on from the Dobson and Norris' convictions, Baroness Lawrence said she was aware of the cost to the taxpayer of continuing the investigation. Baroness Lawrence has called on the Met to ""say they've come to an end"" of the inquiry ""I've been on the go for 25 years. I haven't stopped. I don't think I've even completely grieved for Stephen"", she told the newspaper. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan described Baroness Lawrence as a ""crusader"" whose work had led to laws being changed and two men responsible for her son's death being put behind bars. Speaking about her comments he said it was an ""operational matter for the police"" but expected detectives to ""speak to Doreen and the family before taking any steps going forward.""

Stand-off as Lula arrest deadline passesThe ex-president of Brazil is holed up in a union building after failing to surrender to police.7h7 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean,"Dilma Rousseff (foreground) was at the side of Lula, seen here waving Former Brazilian President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has appeared on stage before supporters outside Sao Paulo as he defies a court order to begin a 12-year jail term for corruption. He emerged from the union building where he is staying to attend a Mass for his late wife, Marisa Leticia. Dilma Rousseff, his impeached successor as president, joined him on the stage along with several priests. Two last-minute appeals to have his arrest warrant suspended have failed. Lula says the case against him was politically motivated. A large crowd of supporters are surrounding the union building in the suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, where Lula built his trade union and political career. Supporters of Lula camped out at the union building The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He is the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. The authorities stress he is not being regarded as a fugitive, as everyone knows where he is. Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president in October's poll, which he had been favourite to win. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. Minutes before the deadline, his lawyers lost a bid to keep him out of jail while he appealed against his conviction. Lula posters are hung on fencing at the union building Lula's opponents protested outside the federal police headquarters where he was meant to surrender. The sign reads: ""Lula, the place for a thief is prison."" By Katy Watson, BBC News, Sao Bernardo do Campo These past 24 hours have captivated Brazil. Helicopters have been circling the metalworkers' union building where Lula is with his supporters, broadcasting every move for viewers across the country. This video can not be played Lula waves at some of his supporters, who have taken to the street As Friday went on the crowds got bigger. The deadline came and went, and the thousands of Lula fans waiting outside carried on regardless - chanting their support for a man many say was the best president Brazil ever had. What happens now though is unclear - even for a country used to complicated political sagas, this is uncharted territory. Will he go willingly, or could he - and his supporters - put up a fight? There is concern that Lula's demise could yet turn violent. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Read more about Lula The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the   Superior Court was declined. Supporters of the judge who ordered Lula's arrest are gathered outside federal police HQ The two courts did not re-examine Lula's conviction, only whether legal procedures were followed correctly and his constitutional rights were observed. Ordering his surrender on Thursday, Judge Moro said the former president would have a separate cell with its own toilet in Curitiba. He would not be handcuffed if he came quietly, the judge promised.

Bollywood star bailed in poaching caseSalman Khan had been jailed just two days ago for five years for poaching rare antelope.2h2 hours agoIndia,"The defence had contested the reliability of witnesses An Indian court has granted bail to Bollywood superstar Salman Khan, two days after he was jailed for poaching rare antelope back in 1998. The defence had questioned the testing of the animals and the reliability of witnesses, NDTV reported. On Thursday, Khan had been convicted in Jodhpur, sentenced to five years in jail and fined 10,000 rupees ($154). The court ruled Khan, 52, killed the two blackbucks, a protected species, in Rajasthan while shooting a film. Four other actors who starred with him in the movie and were also charged with the offence have been acquitted. Khan, who spent two nights in Jodhpur jail, will appeal against his conviction at a higher court. Judge Ravindra Kumar Joshi delivered Saturday's bail decision at the Jodhpur court. The Bollywood superstar who lives dangerously Salman Khan acquitted in firearms case Huge crowds braved scorching temperatures to gather outside the building for the ruling, the BBC's Nitin Srivastava reports from the city. They started dancing and shouted slogans once they heard the result. Our correspondent says opinion had been divided on whether Khan should get bail, with animal rights activist arguing for a tougher punishment. This is the fourth case filed against the actor in connection with poaching animals during the filming of the 1998 movie Hum Saath Saath Hain. Fans show support outside the central jail in Jodhpur In 2006, a trial court convicted the actor in two cases of poaching and sentenced him separately to one year and five years in prison. The Rajasthan high court suspended the sentences the following year, and eventually quashed both convictions in 2016. The state government has appealed against that order in the Supreme Court. Khan was then acquitted of a third case in 2017, which was for possessing unlicensed weapons used to poach the wildlife in 1998. The original poaching complaint against him was filed by the local Bishnoi community, who revere and worship the blackbuck. In December 2015, Khan was cleared in a 2002 hit-and-run case in which a homeless man died and four others were in injured. His car allegedly ran over them while they were sleeping on a street in the western city of Mumbai. A lower court had convicted him in May 2015. During his trial, Khan had argued that his driver had been behind the wheel, but the judge said it was the actor who had been driving under the influence of alcohol. Seven months later, the high court acquitted him. It said that key evidence - including testimony from a policeman who had since died - was not reliable. In January 2017, Khan was also acquitted in another case that charged him with using illegal firearms to kill the blackbucks. One of Bollywood's biggest stars, the actor has appeared in more than 100 films and has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society. His fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; Â£3.40) tickets do not come cheap. Known for his romantic roles as well as action films, Khan has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. The eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan, he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by more than 36 million fans, while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Delhi Every day in the Mumbai suburb of Bandra, fans flock to Salman Khan's apartment building to catch a glimpse of the Bollywood actor. I once met a group of fans who had travelled more than five hours by bus to wait in the searing heat in the hope he would wave at them from his balcony. His films continue to draw mass audiences across urban and rural India. In a country where Bollywood is revered, Khan is one of the most worshipped. While his time in the spotlight has attracted praise and controversy in equal measure, this latest conviction is unlikely to dent his popularity or damage his career due to the cult-like status he enjoys.

Wilby (59.43) was just ahead of South Africa'sCameron van der Burgh(59.44). ""It's a gold, but I wanted a 57 in there,"" said Peaty, who is unbeaten in the discipline since the 2014 Games. ""I was miles off it. That's just who I am. I didn't perform as I wanted to tonight,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""I have a high expectation of myself - that wasn't good enough from me.

Van der Burgh is a renowned quick starter but after being edged out by 0.01 by Peaty off the blocks, was unable to make up the ground. ""I'm happy with that.

Le Clos swam a Games record of 1:54.00 to claim his second gold and his sixth career Commonwealth title and 14th medal overall. He became the first man to win three consecutive gold medals in the same event at the Commonwealth Games. Le Clos won 50m butterfly gold on Friday, but his bid to win five more medals to become the all-time leading Games medallist ended when he failed to reach the podium in the 200m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle relay.

In the men's SB8 100m breaststroke,Timothy Diskenclaimed gold for Australia, with New Zealand'sSophie Pascoewinning the women's SM10 200m individual medley. Nick Hope, BBC Sport on the Gold Coast Don't get me wrong - he is still phenomenal and clear of his opponents, but 58.84 seconds is a long way off the personal best of 57.13 and he doesn't seem to have the extra gear we're so used to seeing in the second half of that 100m race. His room-mate and close friend James Guy withdrew from the 200m butterfly tonight with dehydration and if he hasn't been well, that could have impacted on Peaty. The Englishman has admitted his focus is on swimming quicker at the Commonwealth Games and it will be interesting to see how he now performs in the 50m event. Team-mate James Wilby, who claimed silver, is on the rise though and there's no doubt that training day in day out alongside Peaty has had a huge impact on his recent improvement.

Review: David Mamet's Chicago âââââ,"If you're thinking of going on a creative writing course, don't. Save your money and read David Mamet's new thriller Chicago instead. It's a whole lot cheaper and you'll learn all you need to fulfil your literary dream. Mamet can write. We know that. He's got a Pulitzer Prize to prove it. Plays and movies are where he has made his literary name. American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross, The Untouchables, The Postman Always Rings Twice: it's not a bad CV. Dialogue is his thing. He's got a reputation for it. So much so, it has its own name, Mametspeak. This novel is packed with it: dense passages of jargon-laden conversations between earthy, cynical protagonists who finish off each other's sentences, if the sentences get finished at all. The bulk of the chat in this instance is between two old-school, hard-boiled, inky journalists called Mike Hodge and Clement Parlow who work in Coffin Corner at the Chicago Tribune, so called because ""it was the place stories went to die"". Chicago Tribune newsroom, circa 1923 ""Is non-coterminous a word?"" Parlow said. ""It is if you want it to be,"" Mike said. ""Read Walt Whitman."" ""I can't. It makes me sick with envy,"" Parlow said. And so it goes. We're in Prohibition-era 1920s Chicago where the rat-a-tat speed of their conversations matches the sound of guns being fired around the mean streets and back alleys of the corrupt, violent, crime-ridden city on which they report. Contraband beer being spilled into the streets from barrels during the Prohibition era It is a story soaked in illicit whisky and the warm blood of dead mobsters. The Italians run one side of town, the Irish the other. Between the two are the Jews. Everyone is on the make; the only thing going straight are the bullets. The story takes a while to get going. The first third of the book, the set-up, is about getting the atmospherics right; dragging us back a century, filling in the characters' back-stories, hearing them bicker about journalism. ""What do you think they're paying us for?"" Crouch [the news editor] had said. ""Man bites dog,"" Mike had said. ""Bullshit."" Crouch said. ""Man bites dog is too interesting to be news."" ""Then what is news?"" Mike said. ""News,"" Crouch said, ""is that which makes its consumer self-important, angry, or sufficiently whatever the hell to turn to page twelve, and, turning, encounter the ad for the carpet sale."" Most of our time is spent hanging out in speakeasies and brothels, where new characters emerge and plot lines are planted with the subtly of a brown paper bag changing hands on a park bench. By the time the story finally kicks off, Mike has fallen in love, two local ""faces"" have been murdered, and a couple of goons wearing unusual overcoats are lurking ominously in the background like an old score about to be settled. At this point the novel morphs from being a thoroughly enjoyable period piece into a slug of genre writing that belongs to the era in which it is set. We're talking Pulp Fiction. ""They said that knowledge is power."" ""Power is power,"" Ruth said. ""People say differently don't understand power. Or knowledge. Knowledge is what gets you killed."" The pace changes. There's less chat and more action. Al Capone makes a cameo. American mobster Al Capone, makes a cameo appearance in the novel, Chicago Things turn nasty. And life gets complicated, as Mike discovers the people on whom he is relying are more unreliable than backstreet gin. It is not a perfect novel. There are some bum notes to go alongside the groovy chords Mamet creates with his rhythmic dialogue. David Mamet He undermines his character Peekaboo, the all-seeing African American madam at the Ace of Space whorehouse, by making her reveal far more information than she ever would to Mike - without getting anything in return. And there are moments, not many but some, where he overwrites in a way that the masters of the American crime novel like Raymond Chandler or Elmore Leonard, never would. That though is being picky. If you like your language dense, if you're interested to see it being toyed with by a maestro, and if you fancy a blokey whodunnit to while away the hours until some half-decent weather arrives, then you could do a lot worse than hang out in David Mamet's Chicago.

The Prince of Wales said his new title was a ""very great honour"". As part of the ceremony, he took a sip from a cup of special kava, known as Royal Kava, which was last consumed when his father, the Duke of Edinburgh visited the island in 1974. Prince Philip is worshipped as a god by one Vanuatu tribe. The visit came on the fourth day of his week-long tour of Australia where, joined by the Duchess of Cornwall for the first three days, he opened the Commonwealth Games.

"'Scammers conned me out of my holiday'Victims of holiday booking fraud are losing an average of Â£1,500 each, according to the police.11h11 hours agoBusiness","Holidaymakers are being warned about fraudsters who place false adverts on accommodation websites, conning them out of hundreds of pounds. Last year, some 4,700 travellers fell victim to such scams, which included fake airline tickets. On average those affected lost Â£1,500 each in 2017, according to the police, a 25% rise on the year before. In many cases the fraudsters hack into accommodation websites and ask to be paid directly. But as soon as payment is made, they disappear. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) is also warning about fake airline tickets that never arrive. Last year, most of the flights concerned were to Africa or Asia. Last May, legal secretary Georgia Brown tried to book a holiday in Amsterdam for herself, her partner Jamie, and some friends. She spotted an advert on an accommodation website, where the owner of the apartment was asking for a deposit of Â£915. She corresponded with the man by email, and then sent the money off by bank transfer. But she never heard from him again. ""At the time I was petrified. I thought someone had hacked into my bank account. It was really scary,"" she said. She was also critical of the booking site involved. ""I just don't understand how this person was allowed to advertise on the website."" Georgia Brown eventually got her money back through her bank. In order to avoid being conned, Abta advises holidaymakers to: Do research. Check the holiday company's credentials, and look at several reviews of the property involved Check the web address is legitimate, and has not been altered. For example from co.uk to .org Be cautious about paying directly into an individual's bank account. Bank transfers are like paying by cash, so are difficult to trace. It is safer to use a debit or credit card More than half of the victims of travel scams told Action Fraud that the experience had affected their mental health or financial well-being. Duped mum warns over fake caravan holiday scam In some cases the impact was even more serious. ""The startling emotional impact of falling victim to holiday fraud is highlighted in the latest figures, as 575 people reported that the harm to them was so severe, they had to receive medical treatment or were at risk of bankruptcy,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud. It follows earlier warnings this year about so-called ""chalet fraud"" for people booking ski-ing holidays. On average those who were tricked into sending off money to reserve a chalet lost more than Â£2,000 each.

Brothers who killed parents reunite in jailThe brothers' trial for the cold-blooded killing of their parents gripped the nation in the 1990s.,"The brothers confer during their 1995 trial The Menendez brothers, who once shocked the United States with the brutal killing of their parents, have reunited behind bars more than two decades after they were convicted for murder. The widely-watched double murder trials, including a mistrial, of Erik Menendez, 47, and Lyle Menendez, 50, gripped the country during the 1990s. They are serving life sentences for the 1989 killings. The brothers, ages 18 and 21 at the time of the killings, shot their wealthy parents Jose and Kitty Menendez at point-blank range in their Beverly Hill mansion. They reportedly ""burst into tears"" upon their first meeting on Wednesday in a San Diego prison housing unit. ""They can and do interact with each other, all the inmates in that facility,"" state corrections department spokeswoman Terry Thornton told the Associated Press on Thursday. As partners in crime, the brothers had been deliberately kept apart since the last time they saw each other in 1996. Prosecutors argued during the high-profile trial that the the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate. The brothers' defence lawyers claimed that it was revenge for sexual abuse, but no molestation was ever proven in court. Erik Menendez (left) and Lyle Menendez Their father, a 45-year-old Hollywood executive, was shot six times with a shotgun the brothers had purchased days before the attack. Their mother died after suffering 10 shotgun blasts to several parts of her body. The two told police they had returned home to find their slain parents. ""I've been in this business 33 years and I've heard of few killings as savage as this one,""then Los Angeles police chief Marvin D Iannone told the Associated Press in 1990,external. They were arrested after the girlfriend of a psychologist that had been treating Erik Menendez  went to police to say that he had physically threatened the doctor. Televising trials: What can be learned from US? Taped sessions with the doctor, in which the killings were discussed, were later ruled admissible in court by a trial judge. The trial began in 1993 and resulted in two deadlocked juries in 1994 before the case was retried in 1995. The two were separated during their detention after a detective who investigated the slayings said they may conspire to escape if housed together. In February 2018 Lyle Menendez  was moved from the from Mule Creek State Prison in Northern California to San Diego's RJ Donovan Correctional Facility, after his security level was lowered. The prison houses 3,900 male inmates, but the two were not kept in the same unit and were unable to interact with each other before Wednesday. According to Robert Rand, a journalist who has covered the case since 1989 and was a consultant for a 2017 television programme about the brothers, the pair both ""burst into tears immediately"" upon their reunion. While serving time in separate prisons, the two had been banned from talking on the phone,he told ABC News,external. But they reportedly wrote letters and played chess by sending their moves through the mail, according to Mr Rand. Lyle Menendez told ABC News in an interview,externallast year that he and his brother wrote letters and that their ""bond is really strong"". He also spoke about his mother to NBC's Today programme in September. ""I love my mother, and I still cry over my mother, and I don't forgive her,''he told NBC,external. ""Her life ended and our lives essentially ended all because of this fateful decision. There had to be a series of decisions she made of not to tell what was happening.

Texas sends troops to Mexico border,"Mr Trump's plans have sparked tensions with Mexico The US state of Texas is deploying National Guard members to the border with Mexico following a call from President Donald Trump. A Guard spokesman said 250 personnel would be sent to patrol the area within the next 72 hours. Arizona is also planning to deploy 150 troops there next week. President Trump says he wants to send up to 4,000 National Guard members to secure the border with Mexico, until his proposed border wall is built. The states of New Mexico and California have been asked to take similar action to Texas and Arizona. This video can not be played Trump: 'We will be guarding our wall with military' Also on Friday, the US president outlined plans to end a practice dubbed ""catch and release"" as part of his stricter anti-immigration policies. Mr Trump wants illegal immigrants to be held in detention while they wait to hear if they will be deported, instead of being freed. He has asked the US Department of Defense for a detailed list of military and other facilities that could perform that function. Trump sets targets on immigration cases US may tie social media to visas Mr Trump has sent several tweets over the past seven days railing against illegal immigration, and accusing Democrats of allowing ""open borders, drugs and crime"". He declared on Twitter that Republicans should ""go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws [on illegal migrants] NOW"". Mr Trump also threatened Mexico, saying the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was at risk unless it stopped the movement of migrants over the border. Allow Twitter content?

Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto has condemned what he called ""threatening or disrespectful attitudes"" from Mr Trump. This video can not be played Trump: 'These are, like, professional mountain climbers' The president has called sending troops to the Mexico border a ""big step"", but both his predecessors also dispatched the National Guard there. President Barack Obama sent some 1,200 soldiersto guard the boundary, while President George W Bush deployed about 6,000 troops to help Border Patrol in what was called Operation Jump Start. Both deployments lasted for around a year. US Defence Secretary James Mattis has approved funding for up to 4,000 National Guard troops from the Pentagon budget until the end of September, the Associated Press reports. Constructing a ""big, beautiful wall"" along the Mexican border was a signature Trump campaign promise, but so far the plan to erect a new physical barrier has been thwarted by lawmakers and appears to have stalled. A major government spending bill which he signed last month included $1.6bn (Â£1.1bn) for the border wall - far short of the $25bn the White House sought. And there were strings attached to the funding Congress did approve. Most of it can only be used to repair stretches of the border where there already is a wall, not to build new segments. Trump denies changing view on Mexico wall Six things that could topple Trump's wall Trump vents anger at child immigrant programme Last month the Pentagon confirmed Mr Trump had held ""initial"" talks with his defence secretary about using some of the Pentagon's budget to build a wall.

Ringwald 'troubled' by The Breakfast Club,"Molly Ringwald's essay asks how we should view art that comes to feel outdated or awkward with the passage of time US actress Molly Ringwald, who starred as a teen in cult 1985 high school drama The Breakfast Club, has admitted she finds some of the scenes hard to watch now. Writing in The New Yorker,external, Ringwald describes how she re-evaluated the film after her 10-year-old daughter asked to watch it. ""I worried she would find aspects of it troubling,"" she writes. ""But I hadn't anticipated that it would ultimately be most troubling to me."" The Breakfast Club, directed by John Hughes, was a critical and commercial hit. It tells the story of five very different teens forced to spend Saturday in detention together. Ringwald, now 50, said one particular scene from the film nagged at her ""after a number of women came forward with sexual assault accusations against the producer Harvey Weinstein, and the #MeToo movement gathered steam"". The hashtag #MeToo was used by both women and men to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault in the wake of the Weinstein allegations, and evolved into a movement pushing for change. ""At one point in the film,"" Ringwald writes, ""the bad-boy character, John Bender, ducks under the table where my character, Claire, is sitting, to hide from a teacher. While there, he takes the opportunity to peek under Claire's skirt and, though the audience doesn't see, it is implied that he touches her inappropriately."" Is #meToo changing Hollywood? #MeToo takes hold in South Korea Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo She notes that as a teenager, she was only ""vaguely aware of how inappropriate much of John's writing was"". ""It's hard for me to understand how John was able to write with so much sensitivity, and also have such a glaring blind spot,"" Ringwald writes of Hughes. Ringwald was among the stars of John Hughes films who paid tribute to the late director at the 2010 Oscars But she also argues that in making films that centred on the experience of teenage girls, Hughes was a trailblazing figure for his era. ""How are we meant to feel about art that we both love and oppose?"" the actress asks. The essay provoked a strong reaction on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Stand-off as Lula arrest deadline passes,"Dilma Rousseff (foreground) was at the side of Lula, seen here waving Former Brazilian President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has appeared on stage before supporters outside Sao Paulo as he defies a court order to begin a 12-year jail term for corruption. He emerged from the union building where he is staying to attend a Mass for his late wife, Marisa Leticia. Dilma Rousseff, his impeached successor as president, joined him on the stage along with several priests. Two last-minute appeals to have his arrest warrant suspended have failed. Lula says the case against him was politically motivated. A large crowd of supporters are surrounding the union building in the suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, where Lula built his trade union and political career. Supporters of Lula camped out at the union building The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He is the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. The authorities stress he is not being regarded as a fugitive, as everyone knows where he is. Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president in October's poll, which he had been favourite to win. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. Minutes before the deadline, his lawyers lost a bid to keep him out of jail while he appealed against his conviction. Lula posters are hung on fencing at the union building Lula's opponents protested outside the federal police headquarters where he was meant to surrender. The sign reads: ""Lula, the place for a thief is prison."" By Katy Watson, BBC News, Sao Bernardo do Campo These past 24 hours have captivated Brazil. Helicopters have been circling the metalworkers' union building where Lula is with his supporters, broadcasting every move for viewers across the country. This video can not be played Lula waves at some of his supporters, who have taken to the street As Friday went on the crowds got bigger. The deadline came and went, and the thousands of Lula fans waiting outside carried on regardless - chanting their support for a man many say was the best president Brazil ever had. What happens now though is unclear - even for a country used to complicated political sagas, this is uncharted territory. Will he go willingly, or could he - and his supporters - put up a fight? There is concern that Lula's demise could yet turn violent. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS. Lula is said to have accepted a flat in this block in Guaruja as a bribe A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Key words and names in Brazil's corruption cases Read more about Lula The defence says Lula's ownership of the apartment has never been proven and that his conviction rests largely on the word of the former chairman of OAS, himself convicted of corruption. Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin rejected Lula's appeal on Saturday, a day after his appeal to the   Superior Court was declined. Supporters of the judge who ordered Lula's arrest are gathered outside federal police HQ The two courts did not re-examine Lula's conviction, only whether legal procedures were followed correctly and his constitutional rights were observed. Ordering his surrender on Thursday, Judge Moro said the former president would have a separate cell with its own toilet in Curitiba. He would not be handcuffed if he came quietly, the judge promised.

Needles found on McDonald's baby table,"Jade Krotke said she was ""in shock"" after finding the needles on the baby changing table A mother found used needles on a nappy changing table she was about to use for her baby daughter in a McDonald's restaurant. Jade Krotke, 25, found the three used syringes on the surface of the pull-down table at the New George Street branch in Plymouth. She said she had ""no words"" for the person who left the needles and urged them not to put others at risk. McDonald's apologised and said the locked facility was checked frequently. Jade Krotke found the needles when she went to change her eight-month-old baby Olivia Miss Krotke was at the restaurant with family and friends when she and her husband went to change their eight-month-old baby Olivia. She said: ""While he was lifting her out of the pram I pulled the unit down and heard the clang of a metal dish. I was immediately in shock and suddenly realised the packaging was needles."" McDonald's said ""hygiene and safety"" was of ""paramount importance"" and the baby changing facility was checked frequently Miss Krotke, who alerted the manager, said she was ""disgusted"" by the person who left them there. ""There was a sanitary bin in there,"" she said. ""I'm not judging them for their habit but please don't put others at risk. ""You could have put them in the bin or even attempted to flush them. But putting them inside a baby changing unit, there are no words for you."" McDonald's said in a statement that it was ""sorry for this customer's experience"". The firm said ""hygiene and safety"" was of ""paramount importance"" and the baby changing facility was locked and checked frequently. It said that once the restaurant manager became aware of the issue the ""items were disposed of safely"".

"Deadly unrest erupts on Gaza-Israel borderPalestinian officials say ten protesters have been killed by Israeli forces and over 1,300 wounded.","This video can not be played Palestinians set tyres on fire as tear gas falls on them Ten Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces during fresh protests on Gaza's border with Israel, Palestinian health ministry officials say. The Israeli military said troops had opened fire when people attempted to breach the fence on the frontier. The protesters are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to ancestral lands that are now in Israel. But Israel says the militant group Hamas, which dominates Gaza, is staging the rallies in order to launch attacks. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres called on all parties to ""avoid confrontation and exercise maximum restraint"",externalafter 16 people were killed and hundreds of others wounded during similar unrest a week ago. Who are Hamas? Palestinian territories: Timeline One of those killed in the latest unrest was Yasser Murtaja, a journalist with the Gaza-based Ain Media agency, the health ministry in Gaza said. Piles of tyres were set on fire in an attempt to create a smokescreen to block the view of Israeli snipers, as thousands of protesters gathered at five sites along the 65km-long (40-mile) Israel-Gaza border for fresh protests on Friday. The Israeli military said protesters had thrown stones and firebombs at its troops ""Israel took everything from us, the homeland, freedom, our future,"" 27-year-old protester Samer told Reuters news agency. ""I have two kids - a boy and a girl - and if I die, God will take care of them."" Protesters threw stones and firebombs at troops deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier, the Israeli military said, andmultiple attempts were made to break through the border fence,external. ""Our forces are using riot disposal means and live fire in accordance with the rules of engagement,"" it added. The Palestinian health ministry said dozens of protesters were wounded Gaza's health ministry said a 16-year-old boy was among those killed by Israeli gunfire, and that more than 1,300 other people were wounded. The first death reportedly occurred east of Khan Yunis, in the south of the territory. Israel's Army Radio cited the military as saying a large group of people had attempted to rush the border fence and that troops had opened fire to stop them. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. Source: Haaretz Hamas and other groups organising the six-week protest campaign, dubbed the Great March of Return, say they are peacefully calling for the right of Palestinian refugees to return to land they fled from or were forced to leave in 1948, when Israel was created. The Israeli government has long ruled out any right of return and says terrorists are using the cover of the protests to try to cross illegally into its territory. Palestinians say unarmed protesters were shot last week while posing no threat, and the UN and EU have called for an independent inquiry. Israeli soldiers were deployed on berms on the Israeli side of the frontier A spokeswoman for the UN high commissioner for human rights warned that, under international law, firearms could be used only in cases of extreme necessity, as a last resort and in response to an imminent threat of death or risk of serious injury. The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem called on Israeli soldiers to refuse to open fire on unarmed demonstrators,external. The US blamed Palestinian leaders,external""who call for violence or who send protesters - including children - to the fence, knowing that they may be injured or killed"". The protesters are demanding that Palestinian refugees are given the right of return The Israeli foreign ministry has said most of those killed last week were members of Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and EU. Hamas has acknowledged that some belonged to its military wing, but said they were protesting ""side-by-side with their people"". The group has said it will pay $3,000 (Â£2,140) to the family of anyone shot dead by Israeli troops at the protests. Hamas official Mohammed Thuraya denied the group was putting a ""price tag"" on casualties,external.

Russell Crowe holds 'divorce' auction,"Gladiator memorabilia has been a big draw It's his 54th birthday, and it would have been his 15th wedding anniversary, so it was time to clear out ""stuff"". Actor Russell Crowe has held his ""Art of Divorce"" auction - a sort of parting of the wares - in Sydney. He separated from singer Danielle Spencer in 2012. His torso armour from Gladiator smashed expectations, making A$125,000 ($95,000; Â£68,000) and his Master and Commander violin sold well too. There was also fierce competition for his Cinderella Man jockstrap. It went for A$7,000, more than 10 times the estimate. But there was also some top-notch Australian art on show from artists such as Sidney Nolan and Margaret Olley. A piece called The Suitor by Charles Blackman fetched A$360,000. That far outstripped the A$135,000 paid for the Leandro Bislach violin played by Crowe's character in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. The uniform he wore in the film fetched A$135,000. The Gladiator replica chariot went for A$65,000, nearly seven times above estimate, but the neo-Nazi boots from Romper Stomper went on estimate at A$10,000. A 1986 Grammy Award presented to Johnny Cash and other music artists made $150,000. The New Zealand-born actor appeared at the sale, hearing a rendition of Happy Birthday and three cheers, and saying: ""G'day folks, how're you doing?"" He had earlier said the sale was all about moving on - a ""watershed moment"". Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World memorabilia The sale at Sotheby's was expected to reach $2.3m (Â£1.6m) Among the 227 lots of ""stuff"" (as he calls it) on sale were: A scarf and a pair of old shoes from State of Play Numerous guitars he's collected (his band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts never won much critical acclaim) A Merc used on his wedding day in 2003 A Shane Warne Test cricket jersey The cloth angel doll from The Sum of Us The leather sketchbook from 3:10 to Yuma Chain mail and other clothing from Robin Hood A Javert costume from Les Miserables Ringwald 'troubled' by The Breakfast Club Two sisters give birth in same night 'Steel butterfly' who charmed US and China Crowe tweets Crow Sheeran plays in Crowe's pub Crowe on Crowe.

"'Reclassify cancers to improve treatment'Cancers should be classed by similarities in tumour types, not by where they are formed, a study says.8h8 hours agoHealth","Cancers should no longer be categorised by where they are first formed in the body, but instead by similarities in tumour types, researchers say. A US-led study of 33 cancer types from more than 10,000 patients found they could be reclassified into 28 clusters that shared similar molecules. Reclassification would ultimately lead to better, more targeted treatments, said the researchers. ""It's time to rewrite the textbooks on cancer,"" one of the authors said. 'One-stop shops' for cancer diagnosis Rise in cancers 'caused by weight' Cancers have traditionally been classed and treated according to the part of the body from which they originate, such as the breasts or lungs. But for this new study, the Pan-Cancer Atlas, scientists carried out analysis of 23 of the most common tumour types, and also 10 rare ones, to see which similarities and differences they had on both a genetic and cellular level. They found that nearly two-thirds of cancer clusters that shared key molecular similarities were found in more than one area of the body. One tumour type was found in 25 parts of the body, meaning it would traditionally be treated differently depending on which area it was found in, the study found. They also found that common cancers, such as in the lung and breast, can be broken down into more than one cancer. Prof Christopher Benz, from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in California, told the BBC this was significant because it meant patients would not always be receiving the most effective treatment. For example, in some cases medications for one type of cancer - such as of the bladder - should be used to treat another, like lung cancer, he said. ""Patients will have the best shot at successful treatment if their tumours can first be classified according to their genomic and molecular makeup,"" said Prof Benz. Lung cancer is one area where treatment could be improved, researchers say Immunotherapy - where the body's immune system is enlisted to help fight cancer - is one treatment that could potentially be rolled out more widely, Prof Benz said. Drugs used for the treatment of other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, could also ultimately be repurposed to fight cancer. In other cases, cancers that are harder to treat might require a combination of medications. Lung and colorectal cancers are among those that would often benefit from more targeted treatment, Prof Benz said. But he explained that it could take up to a decade for new treatments to become available because of the difficulty in getting drugs approved. He called for oncology departments, which tend to focus on specific areas of the body, and drugs companies to work together better to improve care for patients. ""It's time to rewrite the textbooks on cancer, and it's time to break down the silos in clinical oncology that make it difficult for patients to take advantage of this paradigm shift in cancer classification,"" Prof Benz said. Dr Justine Alford, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""By revealing the molecular groups that cancers tend to fall into, this research opens up new possibilities for patients who would traditionally be treated based on where in the body their cancer is. ""Identifying patients most likely to benefit from a particular treatment could also help improve clinical trials. ""The real test now will be to put this knowledge into practice and find out if this way of treating patients helps save more lives,"" she added. The research was published inCell,external.

No further action after 'burglar' death,"Richard Osborn-Brooks had been held on suspicion of murder A man arrested on suspicion of murdering a suspected burglar has been released without charge. Richard Osborn-Brooksdiscovered two intruders at his home in South Park CrescentHither Green, south-east London, on Wednesday. The 78-year-old was arrested after Henry Vincent, 37, from Kent, was fatally stabbed during a struggle in the kitchen. The Met said Mr Osborn-Brooks had been released and would face no action. What are your rights in tackling burglars? Det Ch Insp Simon Harding said: ""This is a tragic case for all of those involved. ""As expected with any incident where someone has lost their life, my officers carried out a thorough investigation into the circumstances of the death."" Henry Vincent was under investigation over a separate burglary involving another elderly victim Police said they were called at about 00:45 BST to the property over reports of a burglary when they found Mr Vincent collapsed in nearby Further Green Road. A witness said an accomplice dragged Mr Vincent toward a van before leaving him for dead. A second suspect fled the scene and is still being hunted by police. When we look at the law it is all down to what is considered to be ""reasonable force"" when someone is defending their home. The law was clarified in 2013 to say if it was a highly stressful situation and if someone was under a great deal of pressure, then it would not be against the law to act using reasonable force. It's always debateable what reasonable force actually is. But there was an assumption that if someone entered your house and if you were genuinely petrified and you did take some action, such as we had in this case, then that could be considered reasonable. Mr Osborn-Brooks was held on suspicion of murder and released following a consultation between Scotland Yard and the Crown Prosecution Service. His arrest had provoked outcry from neighbours and an online fundraising campaign. Det Ch Insp Harding said: ""While there might be various forms of debate about which processes should be used in cases such as this, it was important that the resident was interviewed by officers under the appropriate legislation; not only for the integrity of our investigation but also so that his personal and legal rights were protected."" Forensic officers investigate the drains near the scene in South Park Crescent In January, Mr Vincent was named and pictured by Kent Police investigating a distraction burglary on a man in his 70s.

Stand-off as Lula arrest deadline passesThe ex-president of Brazil is holed up in a union building after failing to surrender to police.,"Dilma Rousseff (foreground) was at the side of Lula, seen here waving Former Brazilian President Luis InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has appeared on stage before supporters outside Sao Paulo as he defies a court order to begin a 12-year jail term for corruption. He emerged from the union building where he is staying to attend a Mass for his late wife, Marisa Leticia. Dilma Rousseff, his impeached successor as president, joined him on the stage along with several priests. Two last-minute appeals to have his arrest warrant suspended have failed. Lula says the case against him was politically motivated. A large crowd of supporters are surrounding the union building in the suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, where Lula built his trade union and political career. Supporters of Lula camped out at the union building The former metalworker and trade union activist is an iconic figure for the left in Latin America. He is the first left-wing leader to make it to the Brazilian presidency in nearly half a century. The authorities stress he is not being regarded as a fugitive, as everyone knows where he is. Lula says his conviction was designed to stop him from running for president in October's poll, which he had been favourite to win. In an order issued on Thursday, federal judge Sergio Moro said Lula had to present himself before 17:00 local time (20:00 GMT) on Friday at the federal police headquarters in the southern city of Curitiba. Minutes before the deadline, his lawyers lost a bid to keep him out of jail while he appealed against his conviction. Lula posters are hung on fencing at the union building Lula's opponents protested outside the federal police headquarters where he was meant to surrender. The sign reads: ""Lula, the place for a thief is prison."" By Katy Watson, BBC News, Sao Bernardo do Campo These past 24 hours have captivated Brazil. Helicopters have been circling the metalworkers' union building where Lula is with his supporters, broadcasting every move for viewers across the country. This video can not be played Lula waves at some of his supporters, who have taken to the street As Friday went on the crowds got bigger. The deadline came and went, and the thousands of Lula fans waiting outside carried on regardless - chanting their support for a man many say was the best president Brazil ever had. What happens now though is unclear - even for a country used to complicated political sagas, this is uncharted territory. Will he go willingly, or could he - and his supporters - put up a fight? There is concern that Lula's demise could yet turn violent. Lula served as president from 2003-2011. Despite a lead in opinion polls ahead of October's election, he remains a divisive figure. While he was in office, Brazil experienced its longest period of economic growth in three decades, allowing his administration to spend lavishly on social programmes. Tens of millions of people were lifted out of poverty thanks to the initiatives taken by his government and he left office after two consecutive terms (the maximum allowed in Brazil) with record popularity ratings. The charges against Lula came from an anti-corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash, which has embroiled top politicians from several parties. He was convicted of receiving a renovated beachfront apartment worth some 3.7m reais ($1.1m, Â£790,000), as a bribe from engineering firm OAS.

Facebook urged to block Nazi relic salesThe social media giant removes Third Reich memorabilia from site amid calls for tougher action.7h7 hours agoUK Politics,"Facebook has been urged to do more to prevent the sale of Nazi memorabilia on its website. Items including an SS badge, a Nazi military cross and Third Reich propaganda materials have recently been posted on Facebook's Marketplace. Facebook does not allow the sale of offensive items and removed the goods after being contacted by the BBC. Campaign groups said internet companies had a responsibility to stamp out the trade in Nazi artefacts. There is no specific UK law preventing the sale of Nazi memorabilia, but most major auction houses and online shopping sites have policies preventing it. Pub's 'Nazi-theme' German night ad banned Row over 'tasteless' auction of Nazi items According to Facebook's policy, items sold online must comply with the site's community standards which prevent the sale of anything deemed offensive. But two Nazi military badges were allowed to remain on sale despite being reported by a Facebook user in October last year. Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at campaign group Hope Not Hate, said: ""A cursory glance at something like Facebook Marketplace shows you how easy it is to still find these things. ""While social media companies, and a company like Facebook, have a real job on their hands to try and deal with something that changes as quickly as this, I think they have to do more."" He said there was a ""real danger that this market funds far-right and extremist individuals who sell and trade this content, and that's the last thing we want"". He added: ""In the last five or six months, we've seen moves in the right direction by companies like Facebook when it comes to hate content on their platform and things like this being sold, but I think there's a long way to go."" The social media giant has acknowledged mistakes were made on occasion and said it was constantly working to improve methods used to identify potential violations of its policies. Stephen Silverman, director of investigations and enforcement at the Campaign Against anti-Semitism, said: ""It is difficult to comment without knowing more about the incident. ""However, this is a far-from-straightforward issue. ""While there are perfectly legitimate reasons for acquiring Nazi memorabilia, it is also the case that such items are in demand by those who fetishise the Nazi regime or by far-right groups who publicly display them at their events. ""It is incumbent on social media companies to ensure that they only promote bona fide retailers and that they have processes in place to weed out sellers whose motives are questionable."" Online auction site eBay allows items of historical significance to be listed, including Nazi currency and stamps, but bans Nazi propaganda, elements of military uniforms or other items bearing Nazi symbols. A spokesman for eBay said: ""These items have no place on our marketplace. EBay goes beyond legal requirements to remove items that may be disrespectful to the families of those affected by the atrocities committed during the war.""

Extra police in London's violent hotspots,"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""When stop-and-search is used properly, it's an invaluable tool to the police"" Police officers should be ""confident"" to stop and search someone they suspect of carrying an offensive weapon, London's mayor has told the BBC. Sadiq Khan backed the use of ""targeted"" stop-and-search in the capital, after six people were killed in shootings and stabbings in the past seven days. An extra 300 officers are being deployed in areas of London. Metropolitan Police CommissionerCressida Dick denied her officers had lost control of the streets. Mr Khan said stop-and-search was an ""invaluable tool"" for police when used properly - calling for ""more targeted, intelligence-led"" use of the power. He said that local communities should play a role in protecting the public. ""You could be a mum or dad, big brother, big sister, a friend, girlfriend or boyfriend - who knows somebody carrying a knife,"" he said. London killings: Why are they happening and what can be done? The faces of those killed in London No easy answers to capital's killings Met 'has not lost control of streets' The mayor, who has faced criticism for not acting quickly enough to stop the killings, said budget cuts to policing and youth centres had harmed efforts to prevent the ""evil"" of violent crime. But he added: ""I'm not excusing criminality."" The Home Office said stop-and-search powers should be used in a ""targeted way"" and it was taking action to restrict weapons. A spokesman said officers ""will always have the government's full support"" when properly using the powers, describing it as a ""vital policing tool"". This video can not be played Junior, 24, says he's been stopped and search more than 400 times Chris Preddie, who mentors teenagers, and whose older brother Andrew was shot dead in Brixton in 2003, warned of a ""ripple effect"" of violence in the capital. ""It's become a culture now"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to go back for revenge [but] said to myself: would my brother want me to?"" Chief Constable Sara Thornton, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said stop-and-search should not be used randomly but could work in crime hotspots. Writing in the Daily Telegraph,external, she said officers were reluctant to use the powers because of what she described as the ""chill effect"" of political correctness. She said policing ""cannot address the social conditions that lead to violence"" but while ""stop and search or arrests are not a silver bullet, they are an important tool in helping to protect the public from violent crime"". But Ken Hinds, chairman of the Haringey Independent Stop and Search Monitoring Group, said stop-and-search too often focused on looking for drugs and he wanted more resources put into detecting knives and guns.

Seven people were stabbed in five incidents on Thursday. Two more were injured earlier - a male in his late teens or early 20s, and a 16-year-old boy who were found with stab injuries at the Whitgift Shopping Centre in Croydon, south London.

Six of the reported stabbings on Thursday happened within 95 minutes of each other. Over the past two years there have been between eight and 15 ""knife crimes with injury"" on average each day in London, according to the Metropolitan Police. There were between 243 and 476 knife crimes with injury recorded in each month between February 2016 and February 2018. Last April there were 420 such crimes, an average of 14 every day. Protesters and community leaders gathered at Hackney Central station, east London, to call for an end to the recent bloodshed. It comes after London Mayor Sadiq Khandenied police had ""lost control of crime in London""in the wake of more than 50 murders in the capital this year.

He died the following day, becoming the youngest murder victim to die in London this year. Demonstrators from local churches and community groups called for unity and peace in Hackney Speaking toBBC Newsbeatnear to where the schoolgirl died, a young man called Brandon urged his peers to ""get out"" of gangs. Brandon, who used to ""chill out"" with many gang members in the area, said: ""One day I just thought, what am I really doing here? ""People are dying that are not even in gangs. I don't know what it is, if they getting killed (by) accident, or mistaken identity, and it's just making me think, you gonna be next. ""Could it be one of my family, one of my friends. Could it be me?"" Amaan Shakoor was fatally shot and another boy stabbed in Walthamstow on Monday Israel Ogunsola was stabbed to death in Hackney on Wednesday At the Hackney protest, people huddled around the station entrance before locking fists in a wide circle in solidarity for those killed. Protest organisers Guiding A New Generation - commonly known as G.A.N.G. - asked people to share their stories and pleaded for an end to the killings over a megaphone. Activist Boogz, 40, said: ""We are trying to guide these children to let them know that their life is not going in the right direction. ""I want to say to them this is not the life. ""All the music that you listen to which glorifies this kind of thing, all the money that they see, all the cars that they see people driving, they are being sold a lie, they are being sold a false narrative - and we are here to change that narrative for them."" Crowds gathered at Hackney Central station to call for an end to the recent bloodshed People gathered in Link Street to pay their respects to Israel Ogunsola Four hours before Mr Ogunsola was stabbed on Wednesday, Hackney police were called to a bookmakers on Upper Clapton Road.

His injuries are not considered to be life-threatening. Che Donald, the vice chairman of the Police Federation, said London must learn from the way Glasgow had tackled knife crime Officers need help from other organisations to stop the UK from becoming a ""police state"", the vice chairman of the Police Federation told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Che Donald said the recent spike in violent crime had led to questions ""that the police can't answer on their own"". He said London must learn from the joined up approach taken byGlasgow more than a decade ago, where knife crime was treated as a public health problem. ""We have to look at the fundamental root causes of why people - young men in particular - are carrying knives on the street. Do they feel unsafe? Is it a cultural issue, is it a social issue, is it an ideological issue?"" he added. ""What we do not want to do is turn it into a police state, but unfortunately we are left with very little options and opportunities to address this growing crime."" In a statement, the Met said it is ""absolutely clear that we cannot tackle knife crime alone, we cannot enforce our way out of this and will do all we can to mobilise communities behind us and to help protect London"".

London killings: Why are they happening?,"Flowers at the scene of Tanesha Melbourne's death Another day, another death. Another headline about someone being killed in London. On the first Monday of this month,Tanesha Melbourne, 17, died in her mother's arms after being shot in Tottenham. On the Tuesday,16-year-old Amaan Shakoordied after being shot in the face in Walthamstow. Wednesday sawIsrael Ogunsola, 18, stabbed to death in Hackney. Three more names to add to the grim litany of fatalities in the capital. Three more bodies in the mortuary. Why is it happening? The BBC asked those who are dealing with the consequences of the epidemic of violence for their insights. Nequela Whittakerused to bea gang leader in south London. Now she's a youth worker. ""The youth culture seems to be falling apart at the moment. Young people don't feel like they fit in with society and there doesn't seem to be a voice for young people so at the moment there's a bit of carnage. On the streets it seems to be feuds from social media, from gang rivalry, postcode wars. At the moment it seems to be an epidemic of violence between the young people and it's getting worse. ""It's a discussion and conversation we need to have, to address what's happening and think what the community is doing. ""What is it that young people are lacking - what can we do? what opportunities can we create for young people? ""They feel that this is the life they are accustomed to - but there is a lot more out there and we need to find out what will keep them motivated. ""Due to spending cuts there has been less policing, community centres are closing. There's been not money directed at the third sector for a while and with all these cuts and reductions we've got more young people falling out on to the streets. ""Young people argue on social media over nothing. A boyfriend or girlfriend is in a feud and it escalates and you get people getting involved in situations that didn't necessarily involve that young person first hand. ""Young males are coming from homes with no fathers, no male role models. Many are lacking love. ""At the moment there are a lot of parents trying to be their children's friends rather than being the authoritarian person in their lives. When it comes to the stage of trying to impose discipline it's too late and the young person is 15 and has learnt their own way of life. ""I've got to be honest - looking back at my mindset when I was 15 or 16 - nothing would have stopped me. ""Until you've either killed someone or it's you in that body bag you're just going to get a Youth Referral Order and you'll just carry on."" Martin Griffithsis a consultant surgeon at Barts Health NHS Trust in London. ""We've seen a real sea change over the past few years, with a significant increase in the number of people who have been injured, in the number of injuries sustained per person, and the severity of those injuries. ""The youth of many of the victims and the assailants is really, really concerning. Back in the 1980s, we looked at interpersonal injuries involving knives and guns as being relatively uncommon - a niche injury. Now it's our core work. Knife and gun injury is most of what we see. We're performing major lifesaving surgery on a daily basis. ""One of my military colleagues has described the situation as like being at Camp Bastion [in Afghanistan], which is really worrying to hear. ""And we routinely have children in our care. Thirteen, 14, 15-year-olds coming in with knife and gun wounds is a daily occurrence. We used to look after people in their 20s, now children in school uniforms are being admitted. ""Some kids are involved with gangs or in the drugs trade, but more often than not it is that young people with poor impulse control who've been put into difficult situations and who don't respond well to conflict. ""I think young people are easily swayed and the lack of positive role models, mentorship, and support for young people feeds into them being led down the wrong path. ""We've seen a normalisation in attitudes toward violence globally - and also we take offence about pretty much everything. If we look at people now - things escalate on social media now about absolutely nothing. People now, when placed in conflict situations, react in a much more expressive manner. And if people who are running countries react in that manner, it's a signal for everyone to react that way. ""Members of the public who are not involved in gangs or violence let these things pass without comment. You get the society you deserve. If you ignore violence and ignore offending as a member of the public, your society will change. ""We are all responsible for what is happening right now."" Police say Jamel Boyce was involved in a ""minor scuffle"" before the stabbing Patrick Boyce's son Jamel was aged 17 when he was stabbed in Clapham in 2016. He is now in a semi-vegetative state and will never recover his brain function. ""It's a new game for the teenagers; running into one area and stabbing or shooting someone in that area and then going back to their own area. Then someone from that area will go to the other area and stab or shoot someone else. ""The tragic thing is that those they're stabbing or shooting are just innocent people who accidentally live there. ""My son was attacked after he came from college. He got stabbed in his leg and stabbed in his heart. He knew the attacker; they used to go to the same college. ""My son didn't carry a knife and he wasn't in a gang, he was just going out on the Friday afternoon after college with his friends and he got into an argument with somebody. That guy decided he wanted to kill my son. Just like that. ""These kids come from dysfunctional families, often single parents with no father around and the mother might be working 14, 16 hours a day. ""They come home and there's nobody there, so the streets become their family. They find comfort in each each other. Schools are letting them down, families are letting them down. Then they perceive that being in a gang makes them stronger, that it makes them somebody. It's a negative path for any teenager to think that is the only future they might have. ""Social media does play a part but social media does not make a teenager pick up a knife and go out on the streets with it. ""I think it's good that cuts mean community centres are closing, otherwise community centres would have more murders. Each community centre has a gang and they are going to attack each other. ""We need to get these children into a position where they can see a future, an option rather than saying they are going to pick up a knife or gun and sell drugs. And it's all down to drugs, they're killing each other because they're selling drugs."" Ken Hindsis the chairman of Haringey's Independent Stop and Search Monitoring Group. ""Stop and search,externalis playing into the hands of the violence. It needs to be used with caution or we are going to alienate the very community that is being affected disproportionately by this violence. We will alienate them into not giving intelligence to the police so they can actually find knives and guns on our streets. ""In the Haringey community what's happened now is that if you shoot me or one of my people, I am going to shoot one of your people. ""It doesn't bode well for us for this summer. ""I think we need a curfew in place for those aged 21 and under between 9pm and 7am to get a grip of what's going on across the hotspot areas, particularly in north London - the high-crime areas where the murders are happening. ""We ought to have some sort of respite and think outside the box. So if you've not got a good reason to be on the street and you're just hanging around, you should be in your home. What happens is that big groups hang about on the street or in McDonald's intimidating people. The police can't do much; if they move them on they group just goes elsewhere. ""Lots of people are not being guided, or they are being misguided. In these situations violence will happen."" Anthony Gunter (inset) researches gang violence Dr Anthony Gunter, a criminologist from the University of East London, has written a bookRace, Gangs and Youth Violence. ""The young people I spoke to felt that the gang problem was a media invention, it didn't speak about the realities of their daily lives. They believed the causes of youth violence included bad parenting, lack of youth centres, poverty, the media and status. ""They also talked about the need to have 'back-up', and the protection that comes from moving in a big group of friends. To them their experiences in their neighbourhoods represented a place of constant risk and danger. Young men in particular had to be vigilant against the constant threat of violence and robbery. ""The government has made the fatal error of assuming that all violence among young people in cities is caused by gangs. But the evidence for that is extremely thin, and much of thedata that does exist is distorted,external, London-centric, and contrived from unverified police intelligence sources and the opinions of a small group of justice professionals and senior police officers. ""The policy of austerity has had an especially large impact on those young people most affected by knife and gun violence. They no longer have access to theEducational Maintenance Allowance,external, Connexions Careers Service or housing benefits, and youth support services have been decimated. Those fortunate enough to get into university have seen tuition fees tripled, while maintenance grants for students from poorer backgrounds have been scrapped. ""The teenage years are associated with risky and problematic behaviours for everyone. But these behaviours are aggravated by poverty, inequality, school exclusions, mental illness and chaotic family circumstances. Rather than thinking of violence among young people solely as a crime problem, it should be considered a health risk, alongside drug use, smoking, drinking and unprotected sex. Then it becomes clear: the way to respond to stabbing deaths among young people is to improve their life chances and opportunities, by investing in education, health and welfare services for all. Sir Peter Fahy is a former Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police Sir Peter Fahytackled violent crime during his time as Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police. He has said the police service was ""being cut in half"" due to central government spending changes. ""There's a very strong link between young people excluded from school and those who end up as offenders, often violent offenders. ""When you look at the background of most of those convicted of violent crime - sadly it is entirely predictable. ""In certain districts where there is a high level of criminality, there's a high level of social deprivation. ""In this country it's very rare for a stranger to be shot or a shooting in a robbery situation, most of it is between people with some sort of criminal association or when you get young lads involved in street gangs when they fight across territory. You see people getting shot dead for the most stupid of reasons. ""It can only be cured by good local intelligence-led policing and working with faith groups, churches, schools and community groups."" Under the Conservative and coalition governments, thenumber of police officers has fallenby somewhere between 19,000 and 22,000. The Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick, said she was talking to the governmentabout reconsidering future funding. In response, the Home Office said it was ""undertaking a period of detailed engagement with policing partners and relevant experts"".

Yulia: I'm getting stronger daily,"Ms Skripal and her father are in hospital in Salisbury after the attack UK police have issued a statement on behalf of Russian spy Sergei Skripal's daughter, the first since the pair were poisoned by a nerve agent in March. The statement quoted Yulia Skripal as saying her ""strength is growing daily"". Ms Skripal, 33, and her father are in hospital in Salisbury, southern England, where the attack took place. The UK Foreign Office says Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen, has not yet taken up Russia's offer of consular assistance. The Russian embassy in London said last week that it was insisting on its right to see her after it emerged that she was conscious and talking. Earlier on Thursday, Russian TV aired a recording of an alleged phone conversation between Ms Skripal and her cousin. However, doubts have been cast on how authentic the recording is; the presenters of the programme said they had been unable to verify it and themselves had doubts about it. Mr Skripal, 66, remains critically ill but stable. The UK government has accused Russia of being behind the 4 March attack, but Russia's ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. The incident has sparked an international diplomatic crisis. The United Nations Security Council has been discussing the poisoning in a meeting called by Russia. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia described the British accusations against Russia as horrific and unsubstantiated. The UK is ""playing with fire"", he said. In the statement released by the police, Ms Skripal said she was grateful for the many messages of goodwill she had received. ""I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily,"" the statement said. ""I have many people to thank for my recovery and would especially like to mention the people of Salisbury that came to my aid when my father and I were incapacitated,"" it went on. ""I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you'll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence."" The Russian TV recording is purported to be between Ms Skripal and her cousin Viktoria, who lives in Russia. The woman described as Yulia says: ""Everything is ok. He [her father] is resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I will be discharged soon. Everything is ok."" Russian bid for joint spy probe rejected Russia asks to visit Yulia Skripal in UK Viktoria Skripal says she hopes to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be that of Yulia tells her that no-one will give her one. Correspondents say that what Yulia says in the recording about her father ""resting"" does not chime with what we know of the Skripals' health, and the conversation about the visa is strange. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa, possibly on Thursday, and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Russian news agency Interfax also quoted the cousin as saying in an interview that they had spoken and that Yulia had told her that all was well. Viktoria expressed surprise that the phone call had come a day after she had told media that she was not allowed to speak to Yulia, Interfax reported. ""Do you believe in coincidences? I don't,"" it quoted her as saying. Viktoria is said to be one of the pair's closest living relatives after a series of family deaths. Skripal poisoning: What we know so far Full coverage of the Russian spy poisoning This video can not be played Russian news channel airs Yulia Skripal hospital 'recording' The hosts of the 60 Minute show on state-owned Rossiya 1 - Yevgeny Popov and Olga Skabeyeva - said they were unable to confirm the authenticity of the phone call. Viktoria: Hello? ""Yulia"": Hello. Can you hear me? Viktoria: Yes, I can hear you. ""Yulia"": It is Yulia Skripal. Viktoria: Oh, Yulka [diminutive of Yulia] it's you! I can tell it's you from your voice but I don't understand. So, they gave you a telephone, did they? ""Yulia"": Yes, yes. Viktoria: Thanks God! Yulyasha [diminutive of Yulia], is everything okay? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok, everything's fine. Viktoria: Look, if tomorrow I get a [British] visa, I'll come to you on Monday. ""Yulia"": Vika, no-one will give you a visa. Viktoria: Well I thought so too. Oh well. ""Yulia"": Most likely. Viktoria: If they do, I need you to tell me whether I can visit you or not, tell me that I can. ""Yulia"": I don't think so, that's the situation at the moment, we'll sort it out later. Viktoria: I know, I know. ""Yulia"": Later, we'll get it sorted later, everything's fine, we'll see later. Viktoria: Is that your phone? ""Yulia"": It's a temporary phone. Everything's fine, but we'll see how it goes, we'll decide later. You know what the situation is here. Everything is fine, everything is solvable, everyone is recovering and is alive. Viktoria: Understood. Is everything ok with your dad? ""Yulia"": Everything's ok. He's resting now, having a sleep. Everyone's health is fine, there's nothing that can't be put right. I'll be discharged soon. Everything is ok. Viktoria: Kisses, babes. ""Yulia"": Bye. The recording was reportedly made on the morning of 5 April The poisoning, which the UK blames on Russia, has led to worsening relations between Moscow and many Western countries, with more than 150 diplomats expelled on each side. Speaking shortly after the alleged conversation was released, Russian ambassador Alexander Yakovenko denied statements by UK officials that Russia did not respond to the poisoning allegations immediately. He read out a letter which he said Russia had sent denying involvement, adding that claims that Russia had a nerve agent stockpile were not true.

Facebook urged to block Nazi relic sales,"Facebook has been urged to do more to prevent the sale of Nazi memorabilia on its website. Items including an SS badge, a Nazi military cross and Third Reich propaganda materials have recently been posted on Facebook's Marketplace. Facebook does not allow the sale of offensive items and removed the goods after being contacted by the BBC. Campaign groups said internet companies had a responsibility to stamp out the trade in Nazi artefacts. There is no specific UK law preventing the sale of Nazi memorabilia, but most major auction houses and online shopping sites have policies preventing it. Pub's 'Nazi-theme' German night ad banned Row over 'tasteless' auction of Nazi items According to Facebook's policy, items sold online must comply with the site's community standards which prevent the sale of anything deemed offensive. But two Nazi military badges were allowed to remain on sale despite being reported by a Facebook user in October last year. Joe Mulhall, senior researcher at campaign group Hope Not Hate, said: ""A cursory glance at something like Facebook Marketplace shows you how easy it is to still find these things. ""While social media companies, and a company like Facebook, have a real job on their hands to try and deal with something that changes as quickly as this, I think they have to do more."" He said there was a ""real danger that this market funds far-right and extremist individuals who sell and trade this content, and that's the last thing we want"". He added: ""In the last five or six months, we've seen moves in the right direction by companies like Facebook when it comes to hate content on their platform and things like this being sold, but I think there's a long way to go."" The social media giant has acknowledged mistakes were made on occasion and said it was constantly working to improve methods used to identify potential violations of its policies. Stephen Silverman, director of investigations and enforcement at the Campaign Against anti-Semitism, said: ""It is difficult to comment without knowing more about the incident. ""However, this is a far-from-straightforward issue. ""While there are perfectly legitimate reasons for acquiring Nazi memorabilia, it is also the case that such items are in demand by those who fetishise the Nazi regime or by far-right groups who publicly display them at their events. ""It is incumbent on social media companies to ensure that they only promote bona fide retailers and that they have processes in place to weed out sellers whose motives are questionable."" Online auction site eBay allows items of historical significance to be listed, including Nazi currency and stamps, but bans Nazi propaganda, elements of military uniforms or other items bearing Nazi symbols. A spokesman for eBay said: ""These items have no place on our marketplace. EBay goes beyond legal requirements to remove items that may be disrespectful to the families of those affected by the atrocities committed during the war.""
