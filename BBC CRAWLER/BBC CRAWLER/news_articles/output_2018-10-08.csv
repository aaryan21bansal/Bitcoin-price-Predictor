"Mesh 'last option' for incontinenceThe controversial treatment should only be considered when other options have failed, says watchdog.Health","The mesh implants are used to ease incontinence and to support organs Women who need treatment for urinary incontinence should only be offered mesh surgery as a last resort, new draft guidelines for the NHS advise. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) says non-surgical options, like pelvic muscle exercises, are the first to turn to. The NHS in England has already put restrictions on mesh operations after safety concerns. Many women say the implants cause agony by cutting into tissue. It is estimated that more than 100,000 UK women have had a mesh fitted. The net-like fabric can be attached into the wall of the vagina to act as a scaffold to support organs, such as the bladder, to keep them in the right place to help manage incontinence or another condition called prolapse. Hundreds sue NHS over 'barbaric' treatment Mesh led to 'excrutiating pain' What's the issue with mesh implants? This video can not be played Claire Cooper was left unable to have sex because of the pain Mesh operations have not been banned altogether during the NHS ""pause"" - carefully selected patients continue to have access in discussion with their consultant. The new guidelines for England make it clear that any woman considering having the surgery for incontinence or prolapse should be fully aware of the possible risks: pain and/or painful intercourse infection vaginal bleeding or discharge bowel problems Patients and doctors should report any complications associated with the implants to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. Details of the complications should be logged in a national registry. Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ""Where surgical mesh/tape could be an option, there is almost always another intervention recommended in our guideline, which does not involve surgical mesh/tape. If a surgeon cannot provide a full range of choices to the patient, then she should be referred to one who can."" The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and The British Society of Urogynaecology both welcomed the NICE guidelines. But Kath Sansom, from the campaign group Sling The Mesh, said the guidelines did not go far enough. ""Our ideal scenario is to see pelvic mesh stopped. Full stop. The risks are too great. It is totally unacceptable that women come out of a 'simple little operation' with shattered lives.""

"Churchill quote lands astronaut in troubleScott Kelly apologises for quoting the WW2 British PM, only to be attacked again for his apology.US & Canada","Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly's apology caused even more offence One of the unwritten rules of social media is avoid inspirational quotes. American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. But when Kelly tried to apologise for the tweet and offered to educate himself, Churchill fans attacked him for discrediting the politician's record. Kelly, whose sister-in-law isformer Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, used a famous remark by Churchill to comment ondeep divisions in American politics. Allow Twitter content?

Winston Churchill was Prime Minister in Britain from 1940 to 1945 and again 1951 to 1955 Kelly's Twitter followers also linked Churchill to a famine in Bengal, India, that killed at least three million people in 1943.

Deadly crash US limo 'failed inspection',"Erin and Shane McGowan (L) and Amy and Axel Steenburg (R) were married in June A limousine that crashed and killed 20 people had failed an inspection and should not have been on the road, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says. Mr Cuomo also told a news conference that the driver did not have the appropriate licence for it. Two newlywed couples and four sisters - ranging in age from 30 to 35 - are among the 20 people who died in Saturday's collision in New York state. Officials say the crash is the worst US road tragedy in nearly a decade. Mr Cuomo told reporters the vehicle failed a state vehicle inspection last month and the driver did not have the correct permit to operate a limo with passengers. He added, however, that officials did not yet know the cause of the accident - whether it was an issue with the vehicle or a driver error. The governor said New York would request a cease-and-desist order from the courts to prevent the company, Prestige Limo, from operating until the investigation was completed. The crash occurred near the town of Schoharie in New York state on Saturday afternoon. According to witnesses, the white SUV-style limo failed to halt at a stop sign, and was travelling at around 60mph (95km/h) when it flew through an intersection, hit an empty car outside the Apple Barrel Country Store & Cafe, and then hurtled across a drainage ditch. All 18 people on board, as well as two pedestrians, were killed outside the restaurant, which is popular among tourists who come to see the trees change colour in the autumn. Officials say it is the deadliest crash since the 2009 when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing 50 people. One victim's relative said the hired limo was a replacement for ""some kind of bus"" that was supposed to take the group on a tour of wineries and breweries for Amy's 30th birthday party. The family membertold the Washington Post,externalone of the victims sent a text before the crash, saying the limo ""appeared in terrible condition"". Amy and Axel Steenburg wed in June and were celebrating Amy's birthday when their driver lost control of the vehicle in upstate New York. Erin and Shane McGowan - who also married in June - died, too, in the tragic accident, say relatives. From left: Allison King, Abby Jackson, Mary Dyson and Amy Steenburg Tom King, 35, said his four sisters who died - Abigail Jackson, Mary Dyson, Allison King and Amy Steenburg - ""were very tight"". ""They were the Four Musketeers,"" he said, outside their parents home in Amsterdam, New York. This video can not be played The cause of the crash is unclear ""They were beautiful girls, full of life. They had their whole lives ahead of them,"" aunt Barbara Douglas said describing the four sisters. ""One just got married and that's what this was: her new husband was giving her a surprise birthday party,""she told the New York Post,external. In Mrs Steenburg's last ever Facebook post, dated on 3 October, she thanked her husband for ""being so kind and loving"". ""I just wanted to say Axel Steenburg I love you more than words can say!"" read the post. Axel's brother, Rich Steenburg, was also killed in the crash. According to an online fundraiser to cover his funeral expenses, he has one young daughter. Other victims include Robert and Mary Dyson, who were married in 2009 and have one son together. Matthew Coons, who served as a groomsman at the Steenburgs' wedding, was also killed, along with his girlfriend Savannah Bursese. Patrick Cushing, and his girlfriend of two years, Amanda Halse, have also been confirmed as among the dead. An online fundraiser for the children of Abigail and Adam Jackson, who were left orphaned by the crash, has raised over $57,000 (Â£43,000) as of Monday. ""Adam and Abby were amazing parents to these girls and taken much too soon,"" the page says, adding that the children are both under five years old. Valerie Abelingtold CNN,externalthat her niece, Erin McGowan was close friends with the Steenburgs. ""My family is just going through a lot,"" Mrs Abeling said. ""It's a horrible tragedy and there's no words to describe how we feel."" Officials have not yet said what caused driver Scott Lisinicchia to lose control, or why the accident was so deadly. Many have speculated that the limo was modified in way to make it ""stretch"", which could also have caused it to lose some safety features. After a crash in 2015 in Long Island's wineries region -which killed four bridesmaids,external- investigators in New York launched an investigation into the issue of unregulated modified limousines. Officials found that modified limousines - which are banned or more highly regulated in several European countries - are made from vehicles that are often cut in half, and then have side panels added to elongate the cab. But several safety features, such as rollover bars, reinforced doors, and side air bags, are removed in the process. The National Safety Council's Deborah Hersman told CBS News they were ""Frankenstein vehicles"".

Young people anxious from terror coverage,"Young people had high levels of worry about the risk of terror attacks Media coverage of terror attacks and extremism can leave young people anxious and with an exaggerated fear of becoming victims, say researchers. A study of the attitudes of 11 to 16-year-olds found that terrorism was seen as a bigger worry than issues such as bullying, racism, cruelty to children or worries about getting a job. More than two-thirds expressed fears about the threat of terrorism. The report suggests that children can have a ""skewed"" view of levels of risk. The report, from marketing research firm Childwise, which studies media use among children and young people, found high levels of anxiety about the threat of violence from terror, extremism or warfare. Reza Gholami, a sociologist from the University of Birmingham, said the responses, from a survey of more than 1,500 young people across the UK, showed ""staggeringly high"" levels of concern. Terror attacks have been prominent in news across all forms of media, but ""we know very little about how this impacts young people long-term,"" he said. Much of the information reaching children about terror was indirect rather than news reports - comments heard from adults or found on social media. The study found that almost four in 10 young people were afraid because they thought they themselves could be victims of terror. The apparent randomness of attacks - and as one girl responded, because ""the innocent are getting hurt"" - seemed to raise the emotional engagement among young people with such stories. Research director Helena Dare Edwards suggested young people might hear about the effects of a terror attack or hear security warnings, but lack the wider understanding that an adult might have, to put it into context. She says there can be an element of the ""fear of the unknown"". The report says that when children hear about acts of violence, but cannot them put into perspective, their fears can become ""exaggerated or skewed"". There were fears raised about using public transport or going to public events. ""Being subject to a barrage of relentless negativity can have negative consequences, invoking feelings of anxiety, sadness, fear and worry."" The findings could also have been influenced by events in the news when the fieldwork for the study took place in the spring. The researchers said it overlapped with a high-profile school shooting in the United States and the nerve agent attack in Salisbury, both of which suggested a sense of danger and risk. It was also less than a year after the Manchester Arena, Westminster Bridge and London Bridge terror attacks, with some of these being mentioned by young people in the survey. ""For these children, terrorism is real and happening right on their doorstep, it isn't a distant possibility,"" said the report.

Sturgeon: SNP offer 'hope and optimism',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is now up to us to honour those who went before and win our countryâs independence."" Nicola Sturgeon has called for ""pragmatism and patience"" from independence supporters in her SNP conference speech. The Scottish first minister said she was ""more confident than ever"" that Scotland would become independent. She added that members must ""wait for the fog of Brexit to clear"" and work to win over people who voted No in 2014. Ms Sturgeon also announced new policies on nursing, infrastructure, fair work and support for the homeless. The first minister was speaking on the final day of the SNP's three-day conference in Glasgow. She used her speech to hit out at ""unfolding calamity"" and ""despair"" at Westminster, contrasting this by painting an independent Scotland as ""a beacon of progressive values"". Brian Taylor: Sturgeon focused on politics of the possible Watch Nicola Sturgeon's speech in full Recap: How Nicola Sturgeon's speech unfolded The SNP leader kicked off the conference by announcing that the party's 35 MPs at Westminster would vote in favour of a new referendum on Brexit, were such a question to be tabled at Parliament. And she closed it with a speech also packed with constitutional arguments, describing Brexit as a ""serious problem"" and repeatedly promoting the cause of independence. Nicola Sturgeon: ""Never, ever, let anyone tell us that Scotland doesnât have the talent and resources to be a successful independent country."" Ms Sturgeon hailed the ""passion"" of independence supporters,nodding to the tens of thousands who marched through Edinburgh the day before the conference began. And she acknowledged the frustration that has been voiced by some campaigners over the fact that plans for a fresh referendum have not been forthcoming. She said: ""Our job is to take that passion and blend it with pragmatism, perseverance and patience to persuade those not yet persuaded. ""If we do that, then believe me - the momentum for independence will be unstoppable."" In essence, Ms Sturgeon was telling her party two things from an SNP point of view. One, that passion alone is insufficient to achieve their objective. They must operate with a calm, temperate approach. They must be prepared to see the alternative view - to acknowledge and understand those who dislike independence. Secondly, she was making plain that an independence referendum must be deferred - at least until there is clarity over Brexit and possibly substantially beyond that. She was addressing an audience who yearn for independence. They want it tonight, if not sooner. And yet her underlying tone was all about elongation of time scales. Read more from Brian Ms Sturgeon went on to say that ""the future relationship between the UK and the EU will determine the context in which Scotland would become independent"". She said: ""But as we wait - impatiently, at times, I know - for this phase of negotiations to conclude and for the fog of Brexit to clear, be in no doubt about this. ""The last two years have shown why Scotland needs to be independent. And I am more confident than ever that Scotland will be independent."" The UK government has placed itself in opposition to a second referendum either on independence or on Brexit. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said Scotland ""had an independence referendum four years ago and voted decisively to remain in the UK"", adding that ""now is not the time"" for a fresh vote. ""Hope"" is the theme of the SNP conference Ms Sturgeon announced some new policies in her speech, including: increased bursaries for trainee nurses, of up to Â£10,000 by 2020 more money for Social Bite to tackle homelessness a new ""fair work first"" strategy of investment in skills and training and payment of the living wage an ""advanced manufacturing fund"" to help small businesses modernise and grow She also called on the UK government to halt the rollout of Universal Credit ""now"", saying the policy was leaving people unable to eat and urging ministers to ""find some compassion"". Ms Sturgeon said the Westminster administration was a ""shambles"" which ""stumbles from disaster to disaster"", saying that ""a political system that throws up Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson as contenders for Prime Minister has clearly gone very badly wrong"". Brexit 'boosts case for Scottish independence' Sturgeon - SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote Paraphrasing Winston Churchill while decrying Brexiteer ""ideologues"", she said that ""never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few"". And she warned any parties ""itching to open up our NHS as part of a trade deal with Donald Trump"" to ""prepare for the political fight of your lives"". The march in Edinburgh is the latest in a series of events to held by All Under One Banner Earlier on Tuesday, the Scottish government's Brexit secretary, Mike Russell, also urged activists to be patient over a second independence referendum, which he said should only take place when voters are ""persuaded, ready and determined to win"". Mr Russell had earlier been confronted by an SNP councillor at a fringe event who said members were ""very frustrated with constantly being told to just wait"", saying there was ""a sense that time is slipping away"". The MSP said: ""Our job as a party and as a government is to both make sure that Scotland flourishes, no matter the circumstances but also to ensure that - at the right moment - the choice of independence can be made. ""The right moment - not the most comfortable moment or the moment that best relieves our natural impatience. The moment at which our country is persuaded, ready and determined to win."" The Scottish Conservatives said that while Ms Sturgeon had called for ""patience"" from her supporters, ""most people lost patience with the SNP a long time ago"". MSP Annie Wells said: ""Astonishingly, in a speech littered with references to independence, there was just a glancing reference to education. ""It was a staggering omission and it tells you all you need to know. Education isn't her number one priority - the only priority the SNP has is separating our country in two."" And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Ms Sturgeon had ""delivered plenty of rhetoric for the party faithful but dodged any detail on the new economic prospectus for separation"". He added: ""The so called 'Growth Commission' - in reality a cuts commission - has been the elephant in the room at the SNP conference. The first minister could not bear to tell her activists that her new plan for independence means a decade of unprecedented austerity."" Scottish Green MSP Mark Ruskell said that ""independence in the EU is the right choice for Scotland"", saying his party would ""redouble efforts to build a convincing case for this alongside the SNP"". And Lib Dem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said Ms Sturgeon ""needs to stop trying to turn Brexit into the break-up of the UK"".

Water meters 'should be compulsory',"Millions of householders in England and Wales could be forced to have water meters installed if a group of MPs gets its way. Members of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRA) say that all water companies should be allowed to introduce compulsory metering. They say that the idea is to help save water. But the MPs concede that in some cases putting in a meter might lead to ""significant"" increases in bills. At the moment about half of homes in England have meters but in most areas installation is still voluntary. Water meters increase bills for millions Increase in compulsory use of meters Water companies only have the power to force households to install meters in parts of the country subject to water shortages, such as the South East. ""We call on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to allow all water companies the power to implement compulsory metering,"" said MP Neil Parish, chair of the committee. ""Where this might lead to significant bill increases, metering should be accompanied by strengthened support for vulnerable customers."" The idea of compulsory metering is controversial, even within the industry itself. Mel Karam, chief executive of Bristol Water, told MPs that it could have a negative impact on people and may backfire. The Consumer Council for Water said that ideally customers should have a choice. However, it supported the compulsory installation of meters if it was handled sensitively and introduced over a long period of time. Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""Some customers may see a large rise in their bill, and it's critical support is put in place to financially assist those at risk of being worse off, particularly larger families and those on a low income."" Water meters help reduce demand and make it easier for companies to detect leaks. At the moment three billion litres are lost every day, enough to fill over 1,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. But while leakage has been reduced significantly, the MPs said more needed to be done. Householders who do not have meters currently pay a flat fee, according to the rateable value of their home. Those with meters pay according to how much water they actually use. So those with low rateable values, and large families, face the biggest increase in bills. The Consumer Council for Water advises that if you have more bedrooms than people living in your property, you are likely to be better off with a meter. You can usethis calculator,externalto work out whether you would be better or worse off. Those who live outside the areas where compulsory metering is already in operation have two years to decide whether they like having a meter. If not, they are free to switch back. The water industry itself also urged caution about compulsory metering. ""Continued roll out of metering is an important tool for managing demand, but how and when it is done needs to be handled carefully as part of a wider approach reflecting the needs of different customers,"" said Water UK chief executive Michael Roberts. Southern Water, which serves Kent and Sussex, has already made meters compulsory. It told the MPs that it had cut consumption by 16.5% as a result. The National Infrastructure Commission, which advises the government on major projects, has said that water meters should be compulsory from the 2030s. Water meters are not compulsory anywhere in Scotland, where households pay their bills via local authorities. The following companies can already force consumers to have water meters put in, although they have not all made use of their powers: Affinity Water (north west London and Home Counties); Anglian Water; Essex and Suffolk Water; South East Water; Southern Water; Sutton and East Surrey Water; and Thames Water.

Mexico couple 'sold victims' body parts',"Police in Mexico are investigating a couple arrested for transporting body parts in a pram in connection with at least 10 murders. At a hearing following his arrest, the man reportedly confessed to killing 20 women in a suburb of Mexico City. Investigators have found body parts in the couple's flat and at another nearby property. They were kept in buckets filled with cement and in a fridge. Prosecutors say the couple sold the body parts but it is not clear to whom. Femicides  - murders of women - are common in Mexico and often go unpunished, but the gruesome details of this case have caused outrage and triggered street protests in Ecatepec, the poor suburb in Mexico state where they occurred. Neighbours said that whenever they saw the couple they were pushing the pram in which police found the body parts. Police stopped and searched them after the disappearance in September of a local woman, 28-year-old Nancy Huitron and her two-month old baby, Valentina. Nancy Huitron disappeared along with her baby Valentina on 6 September In the hearing, the accused, whose name has been given as Juan Carlos, confessed to killing Ms Huitron and identified two other of his victims as 23-year-old Arlet OlguÃ­n and 29-year-old Evelyn Rojas. Prosecutors say he also confessed to sexually abusing some of the victims before killing them and selling off their belongings and some of their body parts. Arrests fail to drive down violence Latin America protests against gender violence Fury after woman is blamed for her death The three victims, all of them single mothers, had disappeared in recent months. Ms Huitron disappeared on 6 September with her baby after dropping her two older daughters off at school. When the two older girls were not picked up from school, a neighbour raised the alarm. Police have found baby Valentina who, they say, was sold by the couple. She has since been handed to her maternal grandmother. Investigators say the women knew Juan Carlos and his partner, Patricia, from buying clothes and food from them. According to investigators, Patricia tricked them into the property by saying she had more merchandise for them to view there. Police said that when he was arrested, Juan Carlos asked the officers whether he could shower and put on a suit before being paraded before the media ""because I'm not a dirty criminal.""

Mexico couple 'sold victims' body parts'The couple was arrested as they were transporting body parts in a pram in a suburb of Mexico City.Latin America & Caribbean,"Police in Mexico are investigating a couple arrested for transporting body parts in a pram in connection with at least 10 murders. At a hearing following his arrest, the man reportedly confessed to killing 20 women in a suburb of Mexico City. Investigators have found body parts in the couple's flat and at another nearby property. They were kept in buckets filled with cement and in a fridge. Prosecutors say the couple sold the body parts but it is not clear to whom. Femicides  - murders of women - are common in Mexico and often go unpunished, but the gruesome details of this case have caused outrage and triggered street protests in Ecatepec, the poor suburb in Mexico state where they occurred. Neighbours said that whenever they saw the couple they were pushing the pram in which police found the body parts. Police stopped and searched them after the disappearance in September of a local woman, 28-year-old Nancy Huitron and her two-month old baby, Valentina. Nancy Huitron disappeared along with her baby Valentina on 6 September In the hearing, the accused, whose name has been given as Juan Carlos, confessed to killing Ms Huitron and identified two other of his victims as 23-year-old Arlet OlguÃ­n and 29-year-old Evelyn Rojas. Prosecutors say he also confessed to sexually abusing some of the victims before killing them and selling off their belongings and some of their body parts. Arrests fail to drive down violence Latin America protests against gender violence Fury after woman is blamed for her death The three victims, all of them single mothers, had disappeared in recent months. Ms Huitron disappeared on 6 September with her baby after dropping her two older daughters off at school. When the two older girls were not picked up from school, a neighbour raised the alarm. Police have found baby Valentina who, they say, was sold by the couple. She has since been handed to her maternal grandmother. Investigators say the women knew Juan Carlos and his partner, Patricia, from buying clothes and food from them. According to investigators, Patricia tricked them into the property by saying she had more merchandise for them to view there. Police said that when he was arrested, Juan Carlos asked the officers whether he could shower and put on a suit before being paraded before the media ""because I'm not a dirty criminal.""

Met boss 'locked car door' during terror attack,"Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The Met Police's acting chief witnessed the murder of PC Keith Palmer in Westminster from a locked car, an inquest has heard. Sir Craig Mackey said it was his instinct to get out of the car when he saw Khalid Masood attack, but he stayed because he had no protective equipment. It happened as he was being driven out of the Palace of Westminster after a meeting on 22 March last year. Masood also drove into and killed four people on Westminster bridge. The 52-year-old was shot dead by armed police during the attack and his inquest is taking place at the Old Bailey in central London. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, finished last week - thecoroner ruled all five been unlawfully killed. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' Sir Craig, now deputy commissioner of Scotland Yard, had been at the House of Commons meeting then-police minister Brandon Lewis. As he was driven out of the Palace of Westminster with colleagues, he heard a ""very, very loud bang"" from the direction of Westminster tube station. He said they then locked the car's doors as they saw Masood with a large knife at the gates. ""There was quite a lot of confusion about what was going on,"" Sir Craig told the Old Bailey. ""Clearly the way that the male came in and the purposeful way he came, he was clearly a threat."" Sir Craig Mackey with current Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick, before the funeral of PC Palmer Sir Craig, who retires in December, said he saw PC Palmer suffer ""two determined stab wounds"". He said: ""I could see PC Palmer moving backwards and him going down... ""The thing that still shakes me about the attack is that it was 80-plus seconds in total. It didn't feel like that, it felt an awfully long time."" Masood was then shot by a close protection officer. When asked what his reaction was following the gunshots, Sir Craig said: ""First and foremost I was a police officer so I went to open the door to get out. ""One of the PCs, quite rightfully, said: 'Get out, make safe, go, shut the door,' which he did, and it was the right thing to do. ""That's when I thought: 'I have got to start putting everything we need in place. We have got no protective equipment, no radio, I have got two colleagues with me who are quite distressed,' so we moved out."" He added:  ""If anyone had got out, the way this Masood was looking, anyone who got in his way would have been a target."" The inquest has adjourned until Wednesday, when two close protection officers will give evidence.

Churchill quote lands astronaut in trouble,"Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly's apology caused even more offence One of the unwritten rules of social media is avoid inspirational quotes. American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. But when Kelly tried to apologise for the tweet and offered to educate himself, Churchill fans attacked him for discrediting the politician's record. Kelly, whose sister-in-law isformer Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, used a famous remark by Churchill to comment ondeep divisions in American politics. Allow Twitter content?

But Churchill is also known for quotes like""I do not admit that a wrong has been done to these people by the fact that a stronger race, a higher-grade race, a more worldly wise race to put it that way, has come in and taken their place"", in reference to indigenous populations of North America and Australia. Winston Churchill was Prime Minister in Britain from 1940 to 1945 and again 1951 to 1955 Kelly's Twitter followers also linked Churchill to a famine in Bengal, India, that killed at least three million people in 1943.

UK film and TV sees record investment,"The Crown is one of the high-end television dramas singled out as benefitting from the tax relief The British Film Institute (BFI) says the UK film and TV industry generated a record Â£7.9bn in 2016, helped by government tax reliefs. A BFI-commissioned report found that Â£632m in tax relief prompted additional spending of more than Â£3bn on the creation of films, high-end television, such as The Crown, and computer games. It said HM Revenue and Customs got more than that money back, gaining Â£2bn tax. The BFI says this proves the value of such tax reliefs to the wider economy. The report looked at the effects of tax reliefs granted across the UK's screen industries, which include film, high-end television programmes, video games and animation programmes, and children's TV. The BFI claims the money generated 137,000 jobs in 2016 alone. Another beneficiary is tourism. Films with a strong UK story, place and culture such as Harry Potter, Paddington and Kingsman have featured prominently in UK tourism campaigns. The BFI said high-end television production in the UK has also boomed since the introduction of the tax relief in 2013.  Major shows which have been hits around the world include Game of Thrones, The Crown, The Night Manager and Black Mirror. The report estimated that visitors to the UK spent almost Â£600m in film-related tourism. UK Chancellor Phillip Hammond welcomed the report, saying: ""From TV shows like The Crown, to films like Darkest Hour, and animations like Peppa Pig, our creative industries are intrinsic to the rich cultural fabric of the UK."" He said they had supported tens of thousands of jobs and helped to develop clusters of excellence across the UK, such as those in Dundee (video games), Cardiff (TV) and Church Fenton in North Yorkshire (film and TV). The BFI said it commissioned the report, called Screen Business, to provide the solid evidence of success needed to attract continued public and private investment in the screen industries. It said this would help policymakers to help create the best possible conditions for future growth.

GCSE book pulled over black stereotyping,"A publisher has said it will stop selling a GCSE textbook after it was found to contain stereotypes about Caribbean families. AQA GCSE (9-1) Sociology says Caribbean men are ""largely absent"" from family situations. The comments have been called ""really dangerous"" as there's no social or historical context. Hodder Education says it's taking concerns ""extremely seriously"" and will stop supplying the book for sale. This passage appears on page 94 of the AQA-approved exam text The paragraph in the sociology of families section of the book reads: ""In Caribbean families, the fathers and husbands are largely absent and women assume the most responsibility in childrearing. ""When men and women live together, it is usually in cohabiting or common law relationships that reproduce the traditional patriarchal division of labour."" It adds: ""The family system is also characterised by child-shifting, that is, the passing of children to other relatives or acquaintances if the parents find themselves unable to take care of them. As a result, multiple women are involved in childhood socialisation."" People on social media have called the text ""racist"". Allow Twitter content?

Tamu Thomas is from Motherhood Reconstructed, which celebrates black British mothers. ""This is a book which has been approved by an exam board that's supposed to be credible and progressive,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I couldn't imagine what it would feel like if you were a black child, sitting in class and reading a statement like that. ""I do acknowledge that the number of families with absent fathers is higher in the black community, proportionally. But when something is put forward as fact like that without explaining the historical reasons why that might be the case, without any context, that's really dangerous."" ""This textbook just implied black fathers are feckless,"" Tamu Thomas says ""If we had an educational system that actually studied and analysed the black experience, including the impact of the slave trade and racism in society, it would be different,"" Tamu says. The GCSE textbook was originally released in 2014 and an updated version, which still includes the paragraph, was published in 2017. AQA said in a statement: ""We don't agree with any stereotypes and there's nothing about Caribbean families in our actual GCSE Sociology syllabus. ""We don't produce textbooks ourselves - but we'll be speaking with the publisher of this book about these concerns, investigating thoroughly and taking any necessary action."" Publisher Hodder Education has responded: ""We are taking this feedback very seriously; we will be working with the authors and reviewing the entire textbook as a result of the concerns raised.

Save the Children staff 'harassed',"Almost one in five staff at Save the Children UK has said they experienced harassment or discrimination in the past three years. The charity ordered a review of its workplace culture following revelations about its handling of sexual misconduct claims against two former executives. It has apologised for past failures in its ""organisational culture"". But one ex-employee said ""not a lot has changed"" at the charity in terms of its leadership since she was there in 2015. The review led by ethics expert Suzanne Shale was commissioned in February after sexual abuse claims against Oxfam GB staff in Haiti became public and threw a spotlight on the entire charity sector. Sexual harassment allegations that had been made by women against Save the Children's former chief executive Justin Forsyth and its former director of policy, Brendan Cox, werelater revealed by the BBC. Both men apologised for their past behaviour but said they did not accept all the claims that had been made against them. But MrForsyth subsequently resigned from his role as deputy director of Unicef, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. Charity 'failed' on harassment claims - leaked report Save the Children chairman resigns New inquiry into Save the Children charity Some 28% of the 700 current members of staff who responded to the review said they had experienced discrimination or harassment - 19% of the charity's total 1,068 staff, not including volunteers. The most common complaint from staff was of people's opinions being ignored but some said they had experienced ""spontaneous anger"" and had felt humiliated and ridiculed. Dr Shale's report said there were ""a small number of incidents of gender harassment and unwanted sexual attention"" in the last three years although no evidence of sexual coercion. Incidents highlighted included: Some women being told they were too outspoken ""with the implication they should 'tone it down' if they wanted to progress"" A small number receiving comments on their dress at work that suggested to them that appearance was being judged as more importance than competence Unwanted sexual attention - written or verbal with comments about dress, sexual innuendo, sexualised remarks or intrusive questions about personal life or invitations to meet that had become uncomfortable Some ""suggestive gestures, staring or touching in areas such as the waist"" - sometimes associated with drinking at work events Comments about women being less reliable because of pregnancy or that they were less committed because of child care responsibilities Dr Shale said while most staff found Save the Children a ""supportive and collegiate"" employer ""any experiences of interpersonal mistreatment at work are disturbing"". The review called on the charity to provide better oversight and governance of staff. Chief executive Kevin Watkins pledged swift action on the findings, saying staff would be consulted on a new plan to ensure improvements in working culture. The charity would also aim to improve the diversity of its staff following recommendations from Dr Shale. ""Our brilliant, passionate, hard-working staff are committed to our mission of bringing hope to some of the world's most vulnerable children. They have a right to be protected against harassment of any kind,"" Mr Watkins said. He added: ""There have been failures in our organisational culture and processes, including widely reported historic cases in which there were abuses of power and authority. ""To the women affected, I unreservedly and unconditionally apologise on behalf of Save the Children. It must never happen again."" Justin Forsyth stepped down from his current job after complaints about his behaviour at Save The Children in 2015 became public Claire Rowney, an executive director of Save the Children, suggested the problems at the charity were of a comparable level to organisations such as the civil service and NHS. She told BBC Radio 4's PM programme 90% of staff felt very proud to work at Save the Children, adding: ""Progress has been made over the last three years and we have taken action to make sure staff feel more protected in the workplace, including mandatory training for all staff."" However, former Save the Children employee Alexia Pepper de Cairies, whose complaint about the culture in the charity helped sparked a review in 2015, said she was ""disappointed"" by the report, saying it had not acted on earlier recommendations. Ms de Cairies said: ""I thought it said a lot of the same things that we saw in 2015 when I worked at the charity. Not a lot has changed in terms of the leadership of the charity."" TheCharity Commission is separately investigating how Save the Childrendealt with allegations of misconduct and harassment against its staff.

Google+ shutting down after data exposed,"Google is shutting down much of its social network, Google+, after user data was left exposed. It said a bug in its software meant information that people believed was private had been accessible by third parties. Google said up to 500,000 users had been affected. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal,external, the company knew about the issue in March but did not disclose it. The WSJ quoted an internal Google memo that said doing so would draw ""immediate regulatory interest"". In a statement, the firm said the issue was not serious enough to inform the public. ""Our Privacy and Data Protection Office reviewed this issue, looking at the type of data involved, whether we could accurately identify the users to inform, whether there was any evidence of misuse, and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take in response. ""None of these thresholds were met here."" Google+ was launched in 2011, quickly becoming known as a failed attempt to compete with Facebook. Now, after several years of speculation that it was going to be shut down, Google is bringing Google+ for consumers to an end. Google said it would continue to offer private Google+ powered networks for businesses currently using the software. ""It has not achieved broad consumer or developer adoption, and has seen limited user interaction with apps,"" wrote Ben Smith, Google's vice president of engineering,in a blog post on Monday,external. In the past, the company had been reluctant to share data on how often Google+ was used, but now, facing the fall out of exposed data, the firm appears keen to play down its importance. ""The consumer version of Google+ currently has low usage and engagement: 90% of Google+ user sessions are less than five seconds."" Shares in Google's parent company Alphabet fell by 1.23%.

Water meters 'should be compulsory'Politicians say metering will save water but admit it may lead to higher bills for some homes.,"Millions of householders in England and Wales could be forced to have water meters installed if a group of MPs gets its way. Members of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee (EFRA) say that all water companies should be allowed to introduce compulsory metering. They say that the idea is to help save water. But the MPs concede that in some cases putting in a meter might lead to ""significant"" increases in bills. At the moment about half of homes in England have meters but in most areas installation is still voluntary. Water meters increase bills for millions Increase in compulsory use of meters Water companies only have the power to force households to install meters in parts of the country subject to water shortages, such as the South East. ""We call on the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to allow all water companies the power to implement compulsory metering,"" said MP Neil Parish, chair of the committee. ""Where this might lead to significant bill increases, metering should be accompanied by strengthened support for vulnerable customers."" The idea of compulsory metering is controversial, even within the industry itself. Mel Karam, chief executive of Bristol Water, told MPs that it could have a negative impact on people and may backfire. The Consumer Council for Water said that ideally customers should have a choice. However, it supported the compulsory installation of meters if it was handled sensitively and introduced over a long period of time. Tony Smith, chief executive of the Consumer Council for Water, said: ""Some customers may see a large rise in their bill, and it's critical support is put in place to financially assist those at risk of being worse off, particularly larger families and those on a low income."" Water meters help reduce demand and make it easier for companies to detect leaks. At the moment three billion litres are lost every day, enough to fill over 1,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. But while leakage has been reduced significantly, the MPs said more needed to be done. Householders who do not have meters currently pay a flat fee, according to the rateable value of their home. Those with meters pay according to how much water they actually use. So those with low rateable values, and large families, face the biggest increase in bills. The Consumer Council for Water advises that if you have more bedrooms than people living in your property, you are likely to be better off with a meter. You can usethis calculator,externalto work out whether you would be better or worse off. Those who live outside the areas where compulsory metering is already in operation have two years to decide whether they like having a meter. If not, they are free to switch back. The water industry itself also urged caution about compulsory metering. ""Continued roll out of metering is an important tool for managing demand, but how and when it is done needs to be handled carefully as part of a wider approach reflecting the needs of different customers,"" said Water UK chief executive Michael Roberts. Southern Water, which serves Kent and Sussex, has already made meters compulsory. It told the MPs that it had cut consumption by 16.5% as a result. The National Infrastructure Commission, which advises the government on major projects, has said that water meters should be compulsory from the 2030s. Water meters are not compulsory anywhere in Scotland, where households pay their bills via local authorities. The following companies can already force consumers to have water meters put in, although they have not all made use of their powers: Affinity Water (north west London and Home Counties); Anglian Water; Essex and Suffolk Water; South East Water; Southern Water; Sutton and East Surrey Water; and Thames Water.

The website behind the Skripal revelation,"British journalist Eliot Higgins founded Bellingcat in 2014 The apparent unmasking of a Russian man accused of the Salisbury poisoning has made headlines around the world, but for many the source of the revelation may still be unfamiliar. Bellingcat, a website which describes itself as ""the home of online investigations"", publishedthe bombshell piece,externalon Wednesday. It said that one of the suspects was not a civilian on a sightseeing trip, the explanation put forward by Russian President Vladimir Putin, but rather a highly-decorated military officer named Anatoliy Chepiga. British officials haven't commented, butthe BBC understands there is no dispute over the identification.Russia has dismissed the claim as ""groundless"". The website behind the story was founded in 2014 by British journalist Eliot Higgins, with the help of a crowd-funding campaign. What happened to the Skripals? At the time of its creation, he was a lone blogger known as Brown Moses who was operating out of his living room in Leicester. He had been made redundant from his job as an administrative and finance worker for a group that housed refugees and, in 2013, he began to focus on his blog full-time. Despite having no formal journalism training or experience, he quickly gained a reputation in the relatively new field of open-source, citizen journalism, in which people analyse publicly available materials to uncover new facts about major stories. His focus was conflict zones, primarily in the Middle East, and he initially looked into the use of chemical weapons in Syria by examining videos and pictures online. This video can not be played Eliot Higgins, known as 'Brown Moses', talks about his analysis of the Syria conflict ""I just enjoyed doing it so much and I was getting more and people reading it,"" he tells the BBC. ""I saw more and more people who were doing their own kind of open-source investigation and more people who were becoming interested in it."" He saw an opportunity to build something bigger than his blog, and decided to try to raise funds for Bellingcat through the funding site Kickstarter. The name comes from the idiom 'to bell the cat', which means to take on a dangerous task. In a post announcing the creation of Bellingcat,,externalMr Higgins said the website would have two main objectives. Firstly, ""[bringing] together a group of writers and activists who through using open source tools have transformed journalism"" and, secondly, ""[attracting] others to come and learn how to use these same tools"". The latter has been an ever-present feature on the site, which has a dedicated section that offers advice and information to budding citizen journalists. There is an eclectic mix of guides, ranging fromhow to identify burnt villages by satellite imagery,externaltohow to collect sources from Syria if you don't read Arabic.,external ""I intended the website originally as a place to have guides and case studies for people who could then learn how to do it themselves,"" he says. ""On the other side, I wanted our own investigations, and a place where people could share what they found interesting and post their own findings."" The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 was brought down over eastern Ukraine as conflict raged on the ground In the past few years, the website has been behind a number of high-profile investigations that have received widespread media coverage. It spearheaded an examination of the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 which came down over Ukraine in 2014, killing all 298 people on board. The West and Ukraine say pro-Russian rebels shot down the flight, while Moscow has repeatedly blamed Ukrainian forces. But in 2016,Bellingcat said it had identified Russian soldiers who were likely to have been involved. It linked personnel from the 2nd Battalion of the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade to the tragedy following an open-source investigation. Bellingcat said it then submitted all uncensored names and supporting evidence to the Dutch investigators, who are continuing their criminal inquiry into the disaster. Russia 'liable' for downing MH17 airliner Last year,Mr Higgins told the website Motherboard about the important role social media played,externalin that investigation. ""We had photographs shared online, people discussing the photographs, people tweeting about it,"" he said. ""It created ripples, and what we try to do is identify them, and understand them in the context of all the other material. That gives us a very solid case."" Other notable Bellingcat investigations have looked into the bombing of hospitals in Aleppo, Mexican drug lords and the war in Iraq. All of these hinged on using publicly available information to uncover new facts. Its work on the Skripal poisoning involved using some similar methods. Bellingcat released a photo of the man it says is Anatoliy Chepiga (left), while Russia Today named him as Ruslan Boshirov (right) Bellingcat says its investigators searched images on several online search engines, browsed photos of a military academy yearbook, searched specific terms online and scoured leaked Russian databases. It then obtained extracts from the passport file of Anatoliy Chepiga, which contained a photograph that strongly resembled the Salisbury suspect originally named as Ruslan Boshirov. ""The Skripal story has been a coalition of people from different backgrounds working together,"" Mr Higgins says. ""To be able to build that community and be part of that is something I'm proud of."" He says the reaction to the investigation has been satisfying. ""It's been really nice to actually see a Bellingcat story make such an impact [in the UK]"", he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The website has been criticised by Russia - which has disputed the Skripal investigation andpublicly questioned whether Bellingcat is an arm of the UK government.,external But Mr Higgins often responds to these allegations directly on social media and is relaxed about it. ""We're used to getting [criticism] both from the social media public and the Russian government itself,"" he says. ""It would be more surprising if they didn't react to our pieces!"" Despite what he describes as ""day-to-day internet drama"", the website has continued to grow. Mr Higgins says its funding comes from crowd-funded donations and workshops he holds on open-source investigations. There has also been a flurry of donations from the public following the release of the Skripal investigations. ""Up until about a year ago, we were mostly volunteers and I had three or four people working with me,"" he says. ""Over the last year we have expanded to 10 members of staff plus a translation team and our volunteers. So we've expanded quite significantly."" He is now aiming at expanding Bellingcat's work. ""We're focusing on a few key areas, we're looking at Yemen and Libya as areas to expand into so we're involved in a couple of projects there,"" he says. ""Everyone here is motivated because they enjoy the process rather than focusing on a particular topic,"" he adds. ""They enjoy the process of doing an investigation and finding out stuff and making discoveries."" ""I think that's the biggest motivating factor and why they enjoy it.""

Spy poisoning: What we know so far,"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

Trump: Kavanaugh assault claims 'a hoax',"This video can not be played Trump: ""The main base of the Democrats have shifted so far left we'll end up being Venezuela."" US President Donald Trump has said the sex assault claims made against his new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh were a ""hoax"" and ""all made up"". The Republican president condemned Democratic calls to impeach the judge as an ""insult to the American public"". The Democratic leadership has distanced itself from the calls by two of its rank-and-file lawmakers. Mr Trump joined Mr Kavanaugh and his family as the new justice swore an oath at the White House on Monday. President Trump hailed the ""momentous"" occasion, and started the ceremony by apologising to Mr Kavanaugh and his family for the ""campaign of personal and political destruction based on lies and destruction"" that he had been subjected to. The judge was confirmed by the Senate on Saturday, in a 50-48 vote that largely followed partisan lines. As he left the White House for an event in Florida on Monday, Mr Trump said: ""So I've been hearing that now they're thinking about impeaching a brilliant jurist. ""A man that did nothing wrong, a man that was caught up in a hoax that was set up by the Democrats using the Democrats' lawyers and now they want to impeach him."" The political fallout from the Kavanaugh vote Can we tell if Democrats will win US election? He added: ""I think it's an insult to the American public."" This video can not be played Donald Trump's nominee has been embroiled in a bitter battle over sexual assault allegations. The allegations against the nominee were ""all made up, it was fabricated and it was a disgrace,"" Mr Trump said. Speaking at a police convention in Orlando later, the president said the allegations against the justice were ""brought about by people that are evil"". It was unclear if he was referring to the accusers, their lawyers or Democratic lawmakers. Immediately following Prof Christine Blasey Ford's testimony last month about her alleged assault to the Senate, Mr Trump called her a ""compelling"" witness. But he later questioned her credibility and mocked her at a rally. Brett Kavanaugh was administered the judicial oath by outgoing justice Anthony Kennedy on Saturday evening Mr Trump says Democrats will lose in the 6 November congressional elections, which will shape the remainder of his presidency. The 53-year-old justice was sworn in on Saturday evening in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court. He will take his seat on Tuesday - on the far right of the bench, next to Justice Elena Kagan - hearing immigration and other cases. Justice Kavanaugh has followed up on his pledge to hire women to serve as his law clerks, becoming the first justice to have an all-female staff. Prof Ford - who said the judge sexually assaulted her at a house party in 1982 when they were high school students - has been unable to move back home because of ""unending"" death threats, according to one of her lawyers. Lawyer Debra Katz told MSNBC: ""It's going to be quite some time before they're able to live at home. ""The threats have been unending. ""It's deplorable. It's been very frightening."" What Trump's 'elevator screamers' tweet tells us A handful of Democratic lawmakers, including congressmen Luis Gutierrez of Illinois and Ted Lieu of California, have pressed for Justice Kavanaugh's removal. But top Democrat Nancy Pelosi has said trying to impeach the new justice ""would not be my plan"". ""Let's take it one day at a time,"" she said last week. ""We are not about impeachment."" Senator Chris Coons told NBC: ""I think that's premature... Folks who feel very strongly one way or other about the issues in front of us should get out and vote."" A petition to impeach Justice Kavanaugh has more than 150,000 signatures. Samuel Chase in 1804 was the only justice to be impeached by the House. He was acquitted by the Senate the following year. Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court On Saturday, Nancy Pelosi announced she will file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to make public a confidential FBI investigation into the claims against Justice Kavanaugh. Democrat Jerrold Nadler, who is in line to chair the House Judiciary Committee if his party wins a majority in the mid-terms, said that he would be prepared to open an investigation into the top judge. Mr Nadler did not address the impeachment question,telling the New York Times,externalthe investigation would look into whether Senate Republicans had ""whitewashed"" the FBI inquiry. Justice Kavanaugh also faces more than a dozen judicial misconduct complaints over his public statements as a nominee to the Supreme Court. And the American Bar Association has reopened its evaluation of Justice Kavanaugh's temperament. Can we tell yet who has the edge?

Second Skripal Salisbury suspect named,"The suspect identified by police as Alexander Petrov is actually named Alexander Mishkin, Bellingcat says The name of the second suspect in the Salisbury case is actually Alexander Mishkin, the BBC understands. The Bellingcat investigative website says the man who travelled under the alias Alexander Petrov is in reality a military doctor working for Russian intelligence, the GRU. Last month, Bellingcat named the first suspect as Anatoliy Chepiga, a claim rejected by Russia. When asked about the naming of Mr Mishkin, the Kremlin would not comment. More details about how it uncovered the identity will be released on Tuesday. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in March. The British open-source website said it had identified the suspect using testimonies from people the suspect knew,externaland a scanned copy of his passport. It said both his real passport and the false passport he travelled to the UK on in the name of Alexander Petrov carried the same date of birth. Bellingcat claims he was recruited by Russian intelligence while he was completing his medical studies, and made several trips to Ukraine, including during the 2013 unrest. Skripal suspect was 'honoured by Putin' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far The website behind the Skripal revelation Bellingcat has issued three photos of the man identified as Alexander Mishkin, including his passport image Police issued CCTV of the two suspects in Salisbury on the day of the attack on Sergei Skripal By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent It took longer for investigators at the Bellingcat website to identify Alexander Mishkin as he has an even sparser digital footprint than the first man to be named, Anatoly Chepiga. But using databases and passport details they concluded that this was the real name of the man who came to Salisbury as Alexander Petrov. Facial recognition experts were asked to examine two photos 15 years apart and use techniques of simulated age progression to establish the match. Last Thursday,four GRU officers were exposed for trying to hack into communications of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin the Netherlands at the time it was investigating the Salisbury poisoning. Mishkin's identification will raise more questions about how easy it has been to expose supposedly undercover intelligence officers and undermine Russia's official account that the two men who came to Salisbury were there to see the Cathedral spire. Recent reports in the Russian media suggest that Vladimir Putin - himself a former spy chief - is unhappy with the GRU's performance - and that a purge could be on the way. A spokesman for the Home Office said it would not comment as it was a police investigation. The Metropolitan Police said they would not comment on the ""speculation"". However, officials are not disputing Bellingcat's identification of the men. Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. The suspects are alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on a door handle of his home in Salisbury. The attack left Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia critically ill, but Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. This video can not be played A BBC team showed photographs to residents in Anatoliy Chepiga's old village, to see if they could identify him Conservative MP Bob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said: ""It is appalling that a medical doctor appears to have been part of a team of GRU operatives... ""Whilst this operation has been a botched embarrassment for the Kremlin from beginning to end, it's worth remembering that we may not know about the GRU's successful operations."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The Russian side has asked the British, from the start, to provide information on the case, and details. ""We've got nothing through official channels. ""We won't explain or comment on topics that are leaked through the media."" This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? The GRU, also known as the Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military. It is different to the former KGB (now known as the SVR and FSB) as it conducts undercover military operations and collects intelligence around the globe. In recent years the GRU has been accused of undercover involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, which saw Russia annex Crimea in 2014. Following the attempted poisoning in Salisbury, UK investigators said one of the two suspects had been travelling under the name Ruslan Boshirov. In September, Bellingcat revealed he was actually a military intelligence officer named Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. He served in Chechnya and Ukraine and was made a ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" in 2014, the website said. Bellingcat was founded in 2014 by British journalist Eliot Higgins, with the help of a crowd-funding campaign. Describing itself as ""the home of online investigations"", Bellingcat says it uses open-source computer software and social media as part of its work. The website has also carried out investigations into the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Ukraine, the wars in Syria and Iraq, and Mexican drug lords.

Meet the Supremes,"The Justices of the US Supreme Court in October 2022 The US Supreme Court often has the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years, the court has ruled on the national right to an abortion, on gun laws and how elections are run. Who sits on the court therefore matters. Six of the nine justices were appointed by Republican presidents, including three when Donald Trump was in the White House. The other three were picked by Democratic presidents. The current court has been called the most conservative-leaning in modern US history. Here is a closer look at the justices, their career history and legal philosophy. On the court since:23 October 1991 How he got to the court: Thomas was born in a small town in Georgia, and was one of the few African-Americans in attendance during a short stint in seminary and then at Holy Cross College. But unlike Justice Sotomayor, those experiences made him distrustful of affirmative action policies. After finishing Yale Law, he worked in Missouri government and in Washington DC before being named chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency that responds to discrimination claims in the workplace. After a bruising confirmation hearing - in which a former employee accused him of sexual harassment - Thomas was narrowly confirmed to Supreme Court, at the relatively young age of 43. Whoisheas a justice?Thomas' originalism is exacting, including a disregard forstare decisis, respect for prior court rulings and precedence. Thomas has also not asked a question during oral arguments in nine years. He has previously said he doesn't care for the question-heavy arguments, sometimes already drafting opinions based on written briefs before any lawyer gets up to argue. Thomas often files entirely separate dissents rarely joined by others, but Coyle says he is influential in other ways, including during conferences only justices attend, and in ""difficult decisions"" in areas that don't get a lot of press - like intellectual property and tax law. Thomas replaced the first African-American justice on the court - Thurgood Marshall. On the court since:3 October 2022 How she got to the court:The first black woman to sit on the court in its 233-year history is also the first justice since 1967 to come to the court with extensive experience as a criminal defence attorney. Before the US Supreme Court, the Washington DC native served on the influential US court of Appeals for the DC circuit. She has two degrees from Harvard University and once served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Ms Jackson has said she has a ""methodology"" to deciding cases but not an overarching philosophy.Â Some conservatives have accused her of being ""soft"" on criminals, pointing to her experience as a public defender and willingness as a federal judge to issue prison sentences below federal guidelines. Her confirmation came after President Biden pledged during his presidential campaign to appoint a black woman to the top court. On the court since: 31 January 2006 Howhe got to the court: Alito grew up in New Jersey in an Italian immigrant family. While at Princeton University, he was involved in conservative and libertarian groups, as well as the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps. After Yale law school, he was a prosecutor in New Jersey and served in the Reagan administration in the justice department, including as assistant to the solicitor general, where he argued before the Supreme Court. President George HW Bush named him to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in 1990, where he stayed until his nomination to The Supreme Court. Who is he as a justice?Alito is a conservative justice, but one who does not hew as often to originalism as fellow conservatives Scalia and Thomas. He is not always talkative in oral arguments  but his questions are sharp, aiming to pick apart an argument's logic. Alito has a low public profile despite being a large part of the court's rightward shift on business, campaign finance and racial issues over the past decade. The former prosecutor has been ""very pro-government"" in criminal cases, Coyle says, and has shown less willingness than his conservative colleagues to protect free speech in cases where it is harmful or hateful. On the court since: 7 August 2010 Howshegot to the court: Kagan grew up in New York City. At the age of 12, she convinced her rabbi to hold the synagogue's first formal bat mitzvah, the rite of passage for young women. After law school at Harvard, she clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall. After a successful stint as the first female dean of Harvard Law School, she was briefly US solicitor general - the federal government's top representative at the US Supreme Court, before being nominated by President Barack Obama for the high court. Who is she as a justice?Kagan is the first justice in decades not to previously serve as a judge. She is part of the court's left-leaning wing, but has been the author of many of recent unanimous or near unanimous decisions. Her writing is often easy for a layperson to understand without sacrificing legal analysis, and she is an aggressive questioner during oral arguments. Kagan first took her seat at the bench at the age of 50 and could potentially be a force on the court for decades. Lithwick says Kagan is ""much more inscrutable"" on issues than other recent additions to the court. ""She's very close to the vest,"" she says. On the court since: 29 September 2005 How he got to the court: Born in New York and raised in Indiana, Roberts attended a boarding school as a teenager but also spent summers working in a steel mill. After considering becoming a historian at Harvard, he went to law school there instead, eventually clerking for then-Associate Justice Rehnquist. He spent many years as a lawyer in the Reagan administration then entered private practice, arguing before the high court and serving as one of several legal advisers to George W Bush in the Florida presidential recount case. Originally nominated to fill the spot left by retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Roberts was re-nominated for the chief justice position after Chief Justice Rehnquist died between terms, and his nomination was fast-tracked. Who is he as a justice: A conservative justice, Roberts is the third-youngest Chief Justice in the court's history, confirmed at 50 years old. Last year's term saw more than half its cases decided unanimously, something many court watchers cite as the outcome of Roberts' desire to foster agreement through narrower rulings. He also notably wrote the 5-4 opinion that shot down a major challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law. ""I think he cares deeply about how the 'Roberts court' looks,"" Lithwick says, and knows he can move the court slowly over decades. ""He doesn't want huge swings, except in areas he feels very strongly about,"" Coyle says, like government's role in racial issues, campaign finance's relation to free speech and the structure of constitution. Roberts also looks to keep decorum on the bench during oral arguments. On the court since: 8 August 2009 Howshe got to the court: Sotomayor was born to Puerto Rican parents in the Bronx. As a student at Princeton University, she fought for hiring more Latino professors and admitting more Latino students. After Yale Law school, she became a prosecutor in New York and was later named to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The federal appeals courts are often the final step before the Supreme Court for cases. In the second circuit, Sotomayor authored more than 150 majority opinions - including a few that were ultimately overruled by the higher court. Who is she as a justice?Sotomayor is the first Hispanic justice. She's also been one of the most public facing - her memoir appeared on the New York Times' best-selling list, she appeared twice on Sesame Street, once to adjudicate a dispute between Goldilocks and Baby Bear, and she helped drop the ball in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2013.  ""She's trying really hard to demystify the court, showing 'You can be a justice too',"" Lithwick says. Her former experience as a prosecutor and trial judge often leads her to challenge lawyers on the facts of a case, says Marcia Coyle, the chief Washington correspondent for the National Law Journal. ""She knows how criminal trials operate,"" Coyle says. On the court since:10 April 2017 How he got to the court: At 49, Gorsuch was the youngest nominee in a quarter of a century when he was approved in 2017. The Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. He began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, and worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Whoisheas a justice?Gorsuch succeeded the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and was welcomed by conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law. In his first year on the court he has cemented the 5-4 conservative advantage, and that's been seen in a series of rulings on contentious issues such as the Trump travel ban, trade union fees and gerrymandering. On the court since:6 October 2018 How he got to the court: Kavanaugh served on the influential Court of Appeals for the District of Colombia Circuit and was formerly a White House aide under George W Bush. He previously worked for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. His confirmation process was one of the most controversial in recent years amid allegations of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, which he denied. After a hearing in which one of his accusers gave a dramatic testimony of the alleged incident and Kavanaugh fiercely defended his record, he was approved by the Senate by 50-48. Born in Washington, DC in 1965, Kavanaugh studied at Georgetown Preparatory School an all-boys school in Bethesda, Maryland, and graduated from Yale College and Yale Law School. Whoisheas a justice?He succeeded Anthony Kennedy, who was the Supreme Court's swing vote, often casting the deciding opinion in 5-4 cases, consolidating a conservative majority at the top court. Some Democrats fiercely opposed to his name for his views on delicate issues such as abortion. His views on the environment and gun rights have also raised concerns among environmentalists and gun control activists. On the court since:27 October 2020 How she got to the court:Born in New Orleans of Irish and French ancestry, Barrett was the eldest of seven children in a devoutly Catholic family and is now herself a mother of seven. She was the student body vice-president at her all-girls Catholic high school. After graduating first in her class at Notre Dame Law School, in Indiana, she clerked for Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon, and later worked on George W Bush's election lawsuit in 2000. Barrett also became a distinguished law professor at her alma mater. She was picked for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 by President Donald Trump and was nominated to the high court less than three years later. Who is she as a justice?Often considered a protege of Justice Scalia, Barrett is a proponent of textualism, the view that judges should apply the law as written and interpret the US Constitution as it was originally intended. In her acceptance speech at the White House, Barrett said: ""Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they may hold."" She has said her Catholic faith does not influence her rulings. Past legal opinions and remarks on abortion and gay marriage have made her popular with the religious right, but have earned her vehement opposition from the left. She drew scrutiny for her reported leadership role, with the title of ""handmaid"", in the People of Praise, a tight-knit, Christian faith-based group.

Trump's 'elevator screamers',"Donald Trump has run hot and cold in his attitude toward the controversy swirling around his appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court. With a few notable exceptions, he has displayed restraint in attacking Mr Kavanaugh's accusers and those who believe them. One of those exceptions, however, came via Twitter on Friday morning, just before the Senate began a series of votes that will determine Mr Kavanaugh's fate. There's a lot to unpack in this tweet, so let's break it down. In this tweet, Mr Trump takes aim at Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher, the two women who cornered Senator Jeff Flake in a lift last Friday and accused him of ignoring women like them, who are victims of sexual assault. Archila and Gallagher are widely credited for helping to convince the Arizona senator, who had said he would vote for Mr Kavanaugh, into asking for the one-week delay in voting to accommodate an expanded FBI investigation into the accusations. ""I was sexually assaulted and nobody believed me,"" Gallagher told Mr Flake. ""I didn't tell anyone, and you're telling all women that they don't matter."" This video can not be played Republican Senator Jeff Flake is challenged by a sexual assault survivor. Now Mr Trump appears to be attempting to not only belittle the two women by labelling them ""elevator screamers,"" but also to question their motivations. Archila is the co-executive director of the New York-based community organising group Center for Popular Democracy. Gallagher, who says she has never been involved in a protest before, is a recent college graduate from New York who currently lives in Washington state. Who were the women confronting Flake? Shortly after Mr Trump fired off his tweet, Archila offered her response. ""No one can pay for someone's lived experiences,""she wrote on Twitter,external. ""The pain, the trauma and the rage that I expressed when I spoke with Senator Jeff Flake in an elevator were my own, and I held it for more than 30 years to protect the people I love from it."" Accusing one's opponents of making organised protests look like a grass-roots movement is a tried and true political tactic. The anti-Kavanaugh protests that have rolled through Washington over the past week have been organised by a variety of liberal advocacy groups, including Move On and Ultraviolet - organisation that includes providing pre-printed signage. This video can not be played Women from both sides of the debate had pre-printed signs Pro-Kavanaugh demonstrators have had their own demonstrations, with their own pre-printed signs. Mass protests very rarely happen organically - they require logistics and planning, and that requires time and money. Tens of millions of dollars has been directed at the Kavanaugh confirmation battle from both sides, a sign of exactly how important a lifetime seat on a sharply divided Supreme Court is to the direction of the US for decades to come. â¢The supreme showdown for Trump's America Here Mr Trump references that long-time bogeyman for the right, billionaire financier George Soros. Like the Koch Brothers for liberals, Soros for conservatives is the incarnation of the deep-pocketed sinister force behind all their opponents' actions. Most Americans probably don't know who Soros is, but for those on the right - particularly those with a predilection for conspiracy-theorising - he's a regular topic of conversation. In fact, Soros does fund numerous progressive causes - to the tune of $10m to political action committees in 2018 alone.It puts him in the higher echelon of political donors,external, although still distant to conservative Sheldon Adelson and progressive Tom Steyer. Soros drew Mr Trump's attention in this case perhaps because he supports the Center for Popular Democracy and Ultraviolet, which not only helped put together the protest but also (in a press release that has since been deleted from their website,external) claimed Archila and Gallagher as members. Profile of George Soros The president closes with another shot at the sign-making proclivities of his opponents. (Twitter's expanded 280-character limit strikes again.) Mr Trump himself has a somewhat complicated relation with the use of paid supporters.His presidential campaign reportedly offered actors $50,externalto cheer at his June 2015 Trump Tower announcement speech. (The campaign apparently also had a pile of ""homemade"" signs to hand out before the event.) At some point, however, Mr Trump's presidential campaign took on a life of its own. It was not uncommon to see roughly-drawn signs and t-shirts at his rallies, while hand-lettered yard displays and billboards dotted the American countryside. This video can not be played 'Ford is a liar': Trump supporters' unequivocal backing for Kavanaugh It was then that candidate Trump first started going after protesters and opponents for having manufactured signs, instead of ones like those presumably made lovingly in basements by his supporters. Now, with this Friday morning fusillade, the president is stoking the fire that has fuelled his base for the past few years. With just over a month until the mid-term elections, Mr Trump has been searching for ways to motivate his supporters in the face of an active and engaged Democrat opposition. Tweeting about unruly protesters funded by shady liberal billionaires who threaten to derail his - and their - political hopes and dreams may be part of his electoral strategy. In 2018, as it was in 2016, it's us-against-them. Deploying the Clinton and Trump playbook Mr Trump has an uncanny ability to come up with memorable labels for his political opponents. He ends his tweet by dusting off ""troublemakers"" - a word last used to describe counter-protesters who clashed with white nationalist demonstrators in the Charlottesville last year. The hashtag is already getting hijacked by women's rights activists, who appear to be embracing the term.

Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe',"This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures. Theirdramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C,externalsays the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C. Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open. After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C. What could be wiped out by temperature rise What is climate change? The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external ""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC. ""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation."" ""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have."" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030. We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever. This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems: energy â¢ land use â¢ cities â¢ industry But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and morelocally sourced seasonal food- and throw less of it away â¢ driveelectric carsbut walk or cycle short distances â¢ taketrains and busesinstead of planes â¢ usevideoconferencinginstead of business travel â¢ use awashing lineinstead of a tumble dryerâ¢ insulatehomes â¢ demandlow carbonin every consumer product Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair. ""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved."" ""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use. ""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia) Global net zero emissions by 2050 It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035. Experts believe this number needs to be put in context. ""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century. ""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two."" Five things we have learned from the report Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Vietnam's children and the fear of climate change 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world. You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming. Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding. There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. ""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire."" Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close. By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed: a shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century coal phased out far sooner than previously suggested vast tracts of land given over to forests It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets. Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong. The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees. But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific. ""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity."" Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road. ""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea. ""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face."" Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate. ""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.""

Second Skripal suspect named by Bellingcat,"The suspect identified by police as Alexander Petrov is actually named Alexander Mishkin, Bellingcat says The name of the second suspect in the Salisbury case is actually Alexander Mishkin, the BBC understands. The Bellingcat investigative website says the man who travelled under the alias Alexander Petrov is in reality a military doctor working for Russian intelligence, the GRU. Last month, Bellingcat named the first suspect as Anatoliy Chepiga, a claim rejected by Russia. When asked about the naming of Mr Mishkin, the Kremlin would not comment. More details about how it uncovered the identity will be released on Tuesday. Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned in March. The British open-source website said it had identified the suspect using testimonies from people the suspect knew,externaland a scanned copy of his passport. It said both his real passport and the false passport he travelled to the UK on in the name of Alexander Petrov carried the same date of birth. Bellingcat claims he was recruited by Russian intelligence while he was completing his medical studies, and made several trips to Ukraine, including during the 2013 unrest. Skripal suspect was 'honoured by Putin' Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far The website behind the Skripal revelation Bellingcat has issued three photos of the man identified as Alexander Mishkin, including his passport image Police issued CCTV of the two suspects in Salisbury on the day of the attack on Sergei Skripal By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent It took longer for investigators at the Bellingcat website to identify Alexander Mishkin as he has an even sparser digital footprint than the first man to be named, Anatoly Chepiga. But using databases and passport details they concluded that this was the real name of the man who came to Salisbury as Alexander Petrov. Facial recognition experts were asked to examine two photos 15 years apart and use techniques of simulated age progression to establish the match. Last Thursday,four GRU officers were exposed for trying to hack into communications of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weaponsin the Netherlands at the time it was investigating the Salisbury poisoning. Mishkin's identification will raise more questions about how easy it has been to expose supposedly undercover intelligence officers and undermine Russia's official account that the two men who came to Salisbury were there to see the Cathedral spire. Recent reports in the Russian media suggest that Vladimir Putin - himself a former spy chief - is unhappy with the GRU's performance - and that a purge could be on the way. A spokesman for the Home Office said it would not comment as it was a police investigation. The Metropolitan Police said they would not comment on the ""speculation"". However, officials are not disputing Bellingcat's identification of the men. Sergei Skripal - who sold secrets to MI6 - and his daughter Yulia survived being poisoned with Novichok on 4 March. The suspects are alleged to have smeared the nerve agent on a door handle of his home in Salisbury. The attack left Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia critically ill, but Dawn Sturgess, 44, was later exposed to the same nerve agent and died in hospital. The event sparked a series of accusations and denials between the UK and Russian governments, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. This video can not be played A BBC team showed photographs to residents in Anatoliy Chepiga's old village, to see if they could identify him Conservative MP Bob Seely, a member of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said: ""It is appalling that a medical doctor appears to have been part of a team of GRU operatives... ""Whilst this operation has been a botched embarrassment for the Kremlin from beginning to end, it's worth remembering that we may not know about the GRU's successful operations."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""The Russian side has asked the British, from the start, to provide information on the case, and details. ""We've got nothing through official channels. ""We won't explain or comment on topics that are leaked through the media."" This video can not be played What do we know about the Russian intelligence organisation, the GRU? The GRU, also known as the Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military. It is different to the former KGB (now known as the SVR and FSB) as it conducts undercover military operations and collects intelligence around the globe. In recent years the GRU has been accused of undercover involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, which saw Russia annex Crimea in 2014. Following the attempted poisoning in Salisbury, UK investigators said one of the two suspects had been travelling under the name Ruslan Boshirov. In September, Bellingcat revealed he was actually a military intelligence officer named Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga. He served in Chechnya and Ukraine and was made a ""Hero of the Russian Federation"" in 2014, the website said. Bellingcat was founded in 2014 by British journalist Eliot Higgins, with the help of a crowd-funding campaign. Describing itself as ""the home of online investigations"", Bellingcat says it uses open-source computer software and social media as part of its work. The website has also carried out investigations into the shooting down of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Ukraine, the wars in Syria and Iraq, and Mexican drug lords.

Churchill quote gets astronaut a rocket,"Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly's apology caused even more offence One of the unwritten rules of social media is avoid inspirational quotes. American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. But when Kelly tried to apologise for the tweet and offered to educate himself, Churchill fans attacked him for discrediting the politician's record. Kelly, whose sister-in-law isformer Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, used a famous remark by Churchill to comment ondeep divisions in American politics. Allow Twitter content?

Winston Churchill was Prime Minister in Britain from 1940 to 1945 and again 1951 to 1955 Kelly's Twitter followers also linked Churchill to a famine in Bengal, India, that killed at least three million people in 1943.

Facebook reveals Portal video chat screens,"This video can not be played WATCH: Dave Lee tries out Facebook's Portal+ Facebook is launching two video call machines for the home in the midst of its latest data breach scandal. The Portal products automatically zoom in on users and follow them as they move, to offer a superior experience to existing smartphone and tablet apps. The devices rely on Facebook Messenger to make and receive calls and also feature Amazon's Alexa smart assistant. But consumers may have privacy concerns and a rival device-maker suggested the very concept was ""tech clutter"". The devices are triggered with voice commands beginning ""Hey Portal"" ""It's staggeringly unfortunate timing,"" commented Jeremy White, product editor at Wired UK magazine. ""News of the accounts being hacked broke the day before [Facebook's] product briefings. ""The question is whether people will ignore security concerns for the sake of a really convenient device."" Andrew Bosworth, the executive responsible for the launch, acknowledged the issue. Portal+ can be used with its screen in either landscape or portrait view ""We understand that inviting a camera and microphone into your home is the kind of thing that will give a consumer pause, especially for a new category of products around video calling that haven't been really common for consumers to have access to,"" he told the BBC. ""And so not one week ago nor six months ago, but two years ago we started on a privacy-first plan for this product."" Read more from the Bosworth interview The devices will go on sale in the US in November. Facebook intends to release them elsewhere but has yet to say when. The smaller of the two Portals has a lower resolution display The chief executive of Sonos - which makes voice-controlled speakers - is among those to have questioned whether there is an appetite for Portal or other similar products. ""At this point I'm pretty sceptical that consumers need another screen in their homes,"" Patrick Spence told the BBC. Facebook probe launched by Irish watchdog Up to 50 million Facebook accounts attacked Seven smart speakers put to the test Both of the Portals are designed to be used from a distance of between 5ft to 10ft (1.5m to 3m) - further than video calls are typically made from using smartphones and other computers. They use a 140-degree 12 megapixel camera to capture a relatively wide field-of-view, providing scope for on-device software to zoom in and track the users' movements. Facebook says its wide-angle camera and four-microphone array provide a better experience than using a tablet In SmartCamera mode, the machines automatically reframe the image to take account of additional people entering the room. But by tapping on a person's face, the user on the other end of the call enters Spotlight mode. This allows them to focus on an individual of their choosing, letting - for example - a grandmother follow her grandson even if his parent is the one talking. Augmented reality graphics can be overlaid on to the image. Some are for comedic effect - for instance putting cat hats on people's heads. But the tech is also used for a selection of stories, which a parent can read from afar while relevant visual effects appear. Augmented reality graphics are used within the Story Time mode Users can also trigger songs from Spotify or Pandora to be played simultaneously on both their own Portal and the one receiving the call without causing an echo effect. In addition to one-on-one calls, up to seven Portals can take part in group chats. Calls can also be routed to the Messenger app on other kinds of devices although some functionality is lost. The flagship device - the Portal+ - features a 15.6in (39.6cm) 1080p display that can be rotated on its stand to appear in landscape or portrait mode. It is priced at $349 (Â£270). The same song can be set to play locally at both ends of a video call The lower-end model - which is just called Portal - has a 10.1in 720p display and less powerful speakers. It costs $199. Both support up to four accounts, allowing family members to maintain separate contacts and call records that can be password-protected. Tapping the top of the devices allows users to switch off their microphones and cameras. In addition, a plastic camera cap is included to ensure no images are recorded when owners just want to use voice commands. The machines are sold with a cap for their cameras Facebook says it does not record, listen to, view or otherwise analyse the content of calls on its servers, and the data involved is encrypted. But it does log metadata, including who called who, the length of the calls and any performance issues. And while the call data is digitally scrambled to make it difficult to hack, the encryption method used is not ""end-to-end"". This means, in theory, that Facebook could allow the authorities to tap into a call if ordered to do so. ""It would be better if this had end-to-end encryption, and you have to wonder why it doesn't when you recognise that WhatsApp - another part of the Facebook empire - uses it,"" said Wired's Mr White. Facebook did reveal that it was investigating whether to offer WhatsApp as an alternative to Messenger. ""WhatsApp would certainly help a lot with an international launch,"" said Mr Bosworth. Different family members can maintain distinct contacts lists on the same device Last month, it emerged US law officers had recently tried and failed to force Facebook to let them wiretap a criminal gang'sMessenger voice calls,external. At launch, there will only be a small number of apps available, including: Facebook's video show service Watch recipes from the Food Network video news updates from Newsy For now, the firm has opted not to provide access to its Facebook or Instagram News Feeds or to provide an app store for other third-party products. Facebook believes food recipes will be one popular use of Portal beyond video calls It also says adverts are not on its roadmap, although it acknowledged that in time on-device software could, for example, trigger a cat food promotion if it spotted a pet in shot. ""We're not doing anything today and we'll be very transparent and clear publicly if we do start to do something beyond that,"" said a spokesman. Portal owners can take part in a group call involving up to six other devices Amazon's Echo and Google's Home smart speakers have been surprise hits. A recent survey by Adobe indicated that,external32% of US homes own such a device, and predicted 50% would by the year's end. But the appetite for video-enabled equivalents is still unclear. Amazon already sells two screen-based versions of its Echo speaker Sonos's chief is among those who are unconvinced. ""The industry is in that tech clutter phase where it's like: 'What else can we do? We've got a screen and we've got a speaker, let's put them together and put them in your house',"" said Mr Spence. ""What we've seen is that people are getting a bit of screen fatigue and instead are looking for the technology industry to be more thoughtful about how their existing screens might work with other devices in their home, as opposed to putting another screen in another room."" But one industry watcher was more positive. The devices can show photo slideshows and birthday reminders ""Facebook is pricing these Portals at a level that should certainly appeal to a large number of households and individuals,"" said Jonathan Collins, from the consultancy ABI. ""What is key to adoption is the network effect of knowing that there are people and homes that can be called by the device if one opts to invest.""

"Churchill quote gets astronaut a rocketScott Kelly apologises for quoting the WW2 British PM, only to be attacked again for his apology.","Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly's apology caused even more offence One of the unwritten rules of social media is avoid inspirational quotes. American astronaut Scott Kelly put that to the test on Sunday when his use of Winston Churchill quotes landed him in hot water with people who oppose the wartime British prime minister's views on empire and race. But when Kelly tried to apologise for the tweet and offered to educate himself, Churchill fans attacked him for discrediting the politician's record. Kelly, whose sister-in-law isformer Democrat Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, used a famous remark by Churchill to comment ondeep divisions in American politics. Allow Twitter content?

"Jaguar Land Rover plans two-week shutdownBritain's biggest carmaker will shut its Solihull plant due to weak demand, but says no jobs will be lost.Business","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is planning a two week shutdown of its Solihull plant at the end of October. Britain's biggest carmaker blamed weakening global demand, especially in China, and has faced falling diesel sales in recent months. JLR said employees at the West Midlands plant would be paid for the duration of the shutdown and no jobs would be lost. The Unite union called the news deeply troubling, and said government policies were to blame. Unite national officer Des Quinn said: ""Government ministers' trashing of diesel, despite the UK making some of the cleanest engines in the world, combined with their shambolic handling of Brexit is damaging the UK car industry and the supply chain. ""Add into the mix the government's half-hearted support for the transition to electric and alternatively powered cars and you have a triple whammy facing the UK's car workers."" BMW to shut Mini plant for month post-Brexit JLR cuts Land Rover production In a statement on Monday, parent company Tata Motors said total sales at the firm fell 12.3% in September to 57,114 vehicles. It blamed a 46% slide in China, its biggest market, where rising competition ongoing trade tensions held back demand. ""As part of the company's continued strategy for profitable growth, Jaguar Land Rover is focused on achieving operational efficiencies and will align supply to reflect fluctuating demand globally as required,"" the firm said in a statement. ""The decision to introduce a two-week shutdown period later this month at Solihull is one example of actions we are taking to achieve this. ""Customer orders in the system will not be impacted and employees affected will be paid for the duration of the shutdown."" The Solihull plant, where the firm makes Range Rover and Jaguar models, will close from 22 October. It follows a move to a three day week for 2,000 workers at the firm's Castle Bromwich plant and an announcement in April to lay off 1,000 workers across its West Midlands' plants. The UK car industry has been struggling in recent months, as diesel sales fall and carmakers face tougher new emissions standards. New car sales plunge 20% in September JLR cuts Land Rover production The number of new cars registered in the UK dived by 20.5% in September, according to industry figures, following an unusually strong August and a turbulent first eight months of the year. Manufacturers are also increasingly vocal about the potential risks of Brexit. They fear that an end to frictionless trade would disrupt their ""just-in-time"" supply chains, hurting production. In the last few weeks, Japanese carmakers Nissan, Toyota and Honda have warned that a no-deal Brexit could hit output and profits. And in September, BMW said it would have to shut the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit if the UK failed to secure a trade deal with the bloc.

'Stolen babies' doctor escapes punishment,"This video can not be played Dr Vela was confronted by the BBC's Katya Adler in 2011. A Madrid court has let off a former doctor over stealing newborn babies from their mothers and supplying them to infertile couples. The court found gynaecologist Eduardo Vela, 85, had committed the crimes but could not legally be convicted because too much time had elapsed. He was the first person to go on trial for illegal adoptions that took place during and after the fascist dictatorship of General Franco. Thousands more cases are suspected. After Franco's triumph in Spain's 1936-1939 civil war, many children were removed from families identified by the fascist regime as left-wing and given to families considered more deserving. InÃ©s Madrigal was abducted and illegally adopted as a baby in 1969. She took a case against Vela in April 2012. Her adoptive mother, InÃ©s PÃ©rez, said before her death that Vela had given her the baby as ""a gift"", because she and her husband could not have children. DNA testing has shown that Ms Madrigal is not related to her late parents. However, because Ms Madrigal failed to take the case for 25 years after she first became an adult - in 1987 - it fell foul of the statute of limitations, which is 10 years. When the case first reached the court, it ruled that a decision would be taken as to whether the timeline fell outside the statute of limitations as part of the verdict. Doctor on trial over Spain 'stolen babies' scandal Facing jail: Spanish 'stolen baby' who searched for her mother Spain's stolen babies Ms Madrigal was in court for the verdict but Vela was absent. She and her lawyer say she will appeal to the Supreme Court so the doctor's crimes do not remain unpunished. InÃ©s Madrigal (centre) met other aggrieved families at the trial Prosecutors had sought an 11-year jail term for Vela. The Madrid provincial court found he had committed three crimes - abduction, fraud over pregnancy and forgery of documents. By Bruno Boelpaep, BBC News, outside the court Ms Madrigal entered the court with her lawyer and came out an hour later with mixed feelings. ""I'm happy because it's been proven that I was stolen, Dr Vela stole me,"" she said. But she was also disappointed that the doctor was now free: ""It's a little hard to take that there would be a limitation on this crime."" She thanked and hugged her supporters, a handful of women also looking for missing children. One was Cristina, who gave birth in Madrid 1984: ""We are really disappointed - it's like being slapped in the face. We need to change the laws so there would be no statute of limitations for these crimes."" Spain's stolen babies scandal went on for decades, from Franco's early years in power to the 1990s. It took a long time to surface because the Roman Catholic Church and medical profession are highly respected, and Spanish law did not require the biological mother's name on the birth certificate. Vela - in wheelchair - was not in court for the verdict The scandal is closely linked to the Church, which under Franco assumed a prominent role in Spain's social services including hospitals, schools and children's homes. Nuns and priests compiled waiting lists of would-be adoptive parents, while doctors are said to have lied to mothers about the fate of their children. Democracy is well established now but the Franco era still haunts Spain. There was an unwritten ""pact of forgetting"" during the democratic transition in the late 1970s. An amnesty law adopted in 1977, aimed at smoothing the transition to democracy, made it difficult to look into baby trafficking as courts and politicians refused to investigate it. In 2008 investigating judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n estimated that 30,000 children had been stolen from families considered politically suspect by the Franco regime Some 3,000 reported cases of alleged stolen children have been reported, but prosecutors have closed all but a handful of investigations In 2013 MarÃ­a GÃ³mez Valbuena, an 87-year-old nun facing two charges of kidnapping and falsifying documents, died before going on trial In 2017the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions called on Spain to be more proactive,externalin attending to victims by creating a special prosecutor and a public DNA bank, and urged the Catholic Church to open its archives to shed light on Franco-era adoptions. UPDATE 12 July 2019: It emerged that InÃ©s Madrigal had not been stolen but had been given up for adoption voluntarily by her biological mother. Prosecutors decided that the court's decision that Eduardo Vela had committed crimes should no longer be considered valid.

Washed-up bottle looks 'almost new' after decades,"The ""almost new"" looking bottle was washed up on Brean Beach during last week's high tides A plastic washing-up liquid bottle that is at least 47 years old has been found on a beach in Somerset. The Fairy Liquid bottle was washed up on Brean Beach during last week's high tides. Up to 400 tonnes of rubbish ended up on the beach. Burnham Coastguard said: ""This bottle still looks almost new - it's shocking how long rubbish can survive."" Marked 4d off, the bottle dates back to before decimalisation in Britain in 1971. Guide: Why is plastic a problem? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem ""There was about 300 to 400 tonnes of stuff that had been washed up overnight,"" said Dave Welland, coastguard station officer. ""I've been part of the coastguard for years but I can't remember seeing that amount of rubbish on the beach before. It was mental."" Dave Welland said he could not remember seeing ""that amount of rubbish"" on the beach More than eight million tonnes of plastic enter the world's oceans each year.

School funding 'exaggerated' by ministers,"The dispute over funding figures followed a protest by head teachers School funding claims made by the Department for Education used ""misrepresented"" and ""exaggerated"" figures, says the UK's statistics watchdog. The UK Statistics Authority, in a letter to Education Secretary Damian Hinds on Monday, says it had ""serious concerns"" about the department's ""presentation and use of statistics"". The DFE was urged to improve how it presented information, to ensure that it ""does not mislead"". ""For a department that is in charge of the nation's numerical skills, this is getting embarrassing,"" said Sir David Spiegelhalter, president of the Royal Statistical Society. ""Ministers need to get a grip,"" said Sir David. The statistics watchdoglaunched an investigation into education ministers' claims for high levels of school funding by international standards- when it emerged from BBC reports that spending figures included other non-school and non-government spending. The statistics watchdog says the claim -  which was found to includethe money spent by university students on tuition feesandparents on private school fees- was likely to have been misunderstood by the public as referring to spending on schools. It warns that another figure on school spending in England did not show the evidence clearly enough on per pupil funding and changes in education budgets. The fees paid by students had been included in spending claims The reprimand also accuses ministers of making incorrect claims about improvements in international tests. The dispute over school funding followed a protest by head teachers in Westminster. Their claims to face budget shortages were rejected by ministers, who said the UK was the third biggest spender on education in the world. Radio 4's More or Less programme examines whether funding claims stack up The context of how this figure was used - which was not really about the state funding of schools - was likely to give the public a more ""favourable"" impression than it merited, says the watchdog. Mr Hinds said he would reply in due course with a more detailed response to the letter from Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority. But he said there were other international comparisons showing a high level of school spending. The education secretary said that he had publicly recognised that ""schools are facing cost pressures"", but that funding would rise to Â£43.5bn by 2019-20. Mr Hinds said his department was keen to work closely with the UK Statistics Authority to ensure that all its statistics were ""factually accurate and used in the right context"". But the statistics watchdog told the department that the examples of the misuse of statistics ""do not help to promote trust and confidence in official data, and indeed risk undermining them"". If the DFE fails to improve the quality of the information, the watchdog says, the department could lose its right to produce officially-recognised national statistics. Schools say their budgets have not kept pace with rising costs Jules White, the Sussex head teacher who has organised protests over school funding shortages, said school leaders were ""dismayed and angered"" by the DFE's lack of an apology for a ""very heavy reprimand"". ""There is not even a hint of an apology or even an acknowledgement of wrongdoing,"" said Mr White. ""It is inconceivable that head teachers would not apologise if they were censured in such a way. "" Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner described the criticism as a ""humiliating rebuke"" for ministers. ""They need to come clean and stop deceiving the public in a desperate attempt to cover up their shocking record,"" she said.

'Hopeful' signs on 1.5C target,"Dutch scientist Dr Heleen de Coninck is one of the co-ordinating lead authors of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on 1.5C which will be released next Monday in South Korea. Speaking to the BBC before the start of the negotiations in Incheon, she explained what her role involves and why, despite the enormous climate challenge facing the world, she believes there are some hopeful signs. How did you become an IPCC scientist and what do you do? You become one when you are nominated by your own government. So in my case I was nominated by the Netherlands government and the European Commission. There is a selection process with the IPCC because they want a certain mix of nationalities and science backgrounds, and they want different disciplines represented. It's basically added responsibility to your normal job of teaching or doing research or work in an NGO or in a company You read all of the scientific literature. You discuss with your other authors how you like to represent the literature in a chapter and you write the chapter. The chapters are sent out to other experts for comments, and you have to answer all those. 'Life changing' climate report under debate What does 1.5C mean in a warming world? In the last round we had 4,400 comments on the chapter that I'm in, and we have to respond to every individual. That's a lot of work! And you do all this and you don't get paid for it? For most of us, our institutions think it's important that's why we do this work, so my university in the Netherlands helped with getting other people to do part of my teaching for instance. But yes it's a bit of challenge. Why does it take so long? We've actually put this report together at record speed! This report took a year and a half between when the authors first met to this meeting in Korea. Scientists and government representatives are meeting in South Korea to hammer out a special report on 1.5C What you will be doing in Korea and why is it important? We have produced a short overall summary of our report called the Summary for Policymakers - this 20 page document is a distillation of 6,000 research papers! The government representatives who we will meet with in Korea, will want to change some things and our role is to make sure that the changes they are making are consistent with the underlying report and that they do reflect really what the science is saying about behavioural change or innovation or everything related to 1.5C So are the governments the boss when it comes to your report? Yes and no. The governments approve an outline, and we have to follow those bullet points. We, as authors however determine what we write in the report and they review it and we take their comments very seriously as they improve the quality of the final product. In Korea, we will go through the short Summary for Policymakers, line by line. The summary is negotiated by the governments, we write a draft but they actually determine the final outcome of that, unless it is not consistent with the underlying report, then we as authors should speak up. Many people think that perhaps we can tackle climate change with technology - do you think that's something that will be needed in the future? If we go on the way the way we are living at the moment with our high-energy usage, high consumption lifestyles, it is hard to stay consistent with the 1.5C temperature scenarios, that's very clear. So we will need all kinds of changes, and technological changes are part of that. If temperatures rise beyond 1.5C many parts of the developing world will be hit very hard One thing that is in the news is negative emissions technology, at some point we should not only prevent the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, we may have to remove these gases from the atmosphere. That's fairly new technology, so we are not there yet. Can we keep temperatures down if everyone goes vegan? Can we do it with lifestyle changes. It won't be enough by itself. Agriculture is a huge part of global emissions, not only through the farts and burps of cattle but also through the land use change to grow food for those cattle - lots of the soya produced in countries with high deforestation rates is for feeding animals for meat and dairy. If you go completely vegan you would still have a lot of emissions from energy use and transport and electricity production. We don't have that thought experiment in the report but my hunch would be that it would still be enough to go past 1.5C - but going vegan would help a lot! Some people might argue that keeping temperatures below 1.5C is all down to governments and has nothing to do with me? There's always an interaction between what individuals do and what governments do and private companies do - governments can make policies that influence individuals, you can see that very clearly if you compare emissions per person in the United States with Europe - countries with similar levels of income and development but very different lifestyles in terms of car ownership and even diet. Lifestyle matters! How will this report impact the lives of younger people? What do you think would be the potential impact on young people? A report of course does not change the world, but if, as a consequence of this governments agreed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C that would mean a completely different way of transporting ourselves in rich and poor countries, it would mean a completely different way of using energy in households, of generating electricity, how we make our products, how much plastic would be used, and how we feed ourselves. The decisions we make now about whether we let 1.5 or 2 degrees or more happen will change the world enormously. But our lives when keeping it below 1.5C with projected population rise and economic growth will also look differently. The lives of people will never be the same again either way, but we can influence which future we end up with. Are there reasons to be optimistic? Personally I am hopeful. We're seeing some countries making serious plans to be consistent with 1.5C, we are seeing costs of renewable energies drop. Many people are adopting low-emission lifestyles, and for instance don't fly anymore. Even the costs of some negative emission technologies are dropping so we are seeing some hopeful signs. The IPCC also tries to be more solution-oriented rather than only flagging and analysing problems. There's really good reasons to really start working now! I'm not sure about optimism, but I think that losing hope is never a good idea.

Newlyweds among 20 dead in US limo crash,"Erin and Shane McGowan (L) and Amy and Axel Steenburg (R) were married in June A limousine that crashed and killed 20 people had failed an inspection and should not have been on the road, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says. Mr Cuomo also told a news conference that the driver did not have the appropriate licence for it. Two newlywed couples and four sisters - ranging in age from 30 to 35 - are among the 20 people who died in Saturday's collision in New York state. Officials say the crash is the worst US road tragedy in nearly a decade. Mr Cuomo told reporters the vehicle failed a state vehicle inspection last month and the driver did not have the correct permit to operate a limo with passengers. He added, however, that officials did not yet know the cause of the accident - whether it was an issue with the vehicle or a driver error. The governor said New York would request a cease-and-desist order from the courts to prevent the company, Prestige Limo, from operating until the investigation was completed. The crash occurred near the town of Schoharie in New York state on Saturday afternoon. According to witnesses, the white SUV-style limo failed to halt at a stop sign, and was travelling at around 60mph (95km/h) when it flew through an intersection, hit an empty car outside the Apple Barrel Country Store & Cafe, and then hurtled across a drainage ditch. All 18 people on board, as well as two pedestrians, were killed outside the restaurant, which is popular among tourists who come to see the trees change colour in the autumn. Officials say it is the deadliest crash since the 2009 when Colgan Air Flight 3407 crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing 50 people. One victim's relative said the hired limo was a replacement for ""some kind of bus"" that was supposed to take the group on a tour of wineries and breweries for Amy's 30th birthday party. The family membertold the Washington Post,externalone of the victims sent a text before the crash, saying the limo ""appeared in terrible condition"". Amy and Axel Steenburg wed in June and were celebrating Amy's birthday when their driver lost control of the vehicle in upstate New York. Erin and Shane McGowan - who also married in June - died, too, in the tragic accident, say relatives. From left: Allison King, Abby Jackson, Mary Dyson and Amy Steenburg Tom King, 35, said his four sisters who died - Abigail Jackson, Mary Dyson, Allison King and Amy Steenburg - ""were very tight"". ""They were the Four Musketeers,"" he said, outside their parents home in Amsterdam, New York. This video can not be played The cause of the crash is unclear ""They were beautiful girls, full of life. They had their whole lives ahead of them,"" aunt Barbara Douglas said describing the four sisters. ""One just got married and that's what this was: her new husband was giving her a surprise birthday party,""she told the New York Post,external. In Mrs Steenburg's last ever Facebook post, dated on 3 October, she thanked her husband for ""being so kind and loving"". ""I just wanted to say Axel Steenburg I love you more than words can say!"" read the post. Axel's brother, Rich Steenburg, was also killed in the crash. According to an online fundraiser to cover his funeral expenses, he has one young daughter. Other victims include Robert and Mary Dyson, who were married in 2009 and have one son together. Matthew Coons, who served as a groomsman at the Steenburgs' wedding, was also killed, along with his girlfriend Savannah Bursese. Patrick Cushing, and his girlfriend of two years, Amanda Halse, have also been confirmed as among the dead. An online fundraiser for the children of Abigail and Adam Jackson, who were left orphaned by the crash, has raised over $57,000 (Â£43,000) as of Monday. ""Adam and Abby were amazing parents to these girls and taken much too soon,"" the page says, adding that the children are both under five years old. Valerie Abelingtold CNN,externalthat her niece, Erin McGowan was close friends with the Steenburgs. ""My family is just going through a lot,"" Mrs Abeling said. ""It's a horrible tragedy and there's no words to describe how we feel."" Officials have not yet said what caused driver Scott Lisinicchia to lose control, or why the accident was so deadly. Many have speculated that the limo was modified in way to make it ""stretch"", which could also have caused it to lose some safety features. After a crash in 2015 in Long Island's wineries region -which killed four bridesmaids,external- investigators in New York launched an investigation into the issue of unregulated modified limousines. Officials found that modified limousines - which are banned or more highly regulated in several European countries - are made from vehicles that are often cut in half, and then have side panels added to elongate the cab. But several safety features, such as rollover bars, reinforced doors, and side air bags, are removed in the process. The National Safety Council's Deborah Hersman told CBS News they were ""Frankenstein vehicles"".

Brexit 'boosts Scots independence case',"Ian Blackford was speaking at the SNP conference in Glasgow Brexit is a ""democratic outrage"" which is boosting the case for Scottish independence, the SNP's Westminster leader has told the party's conference. Ian Blackford opened the second day of the party's conference in Glasgow. He told delegates that the Conservative government was ""completely in thrall to the hardline Brexiteers"". And he said Brexit was ""crystallising the case for Scotland having full control over its own affairs"" via independence. SNP members have gathered in Glasgow for the three-day event, which will climax with a speech from party leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, on Tuesday. The second day of the event included policy debates on child tax credits, international trade and nuclear weapons and speeches from Ms Sturgeon's party deputy Keith Brown and her deputy first minister, John Swinney. Follow live coverage of the SNP conference on the BBC's Parliament channel Sturgeon - SNP MPs would back new Brexit vote Plaid Cymru MPs would back EU referendum vote Brian Taylor blog: Sturgeon is doing the referendum dance Mr Blackford's speech focused on constitutional issues, hitting out against Brexit while promoting the cause of Scottish independence. The UK is due to leave the EU in March, but the SNP highlight the fact that voters in Scotland backed remain by a margin of 62% to 38%. The MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said: ""Time and time again, the SNP and others have fought to ensure that Scotland's remain vote is respected in the EU negotiations - but the Tory cabinet is completely in thrall to the hardline Brexiteers who could not care less about jobs, living standards and public services in Scotland. ""The democratic outrage of Brexit is crystallising the case for Scotland having the full control over its own affairs. This video can not be played On a second EU vote, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""I think, [it would] be odd for us not to grasp an opportunity for Scotland to reaffirm its vote to remain in the EU."" ""With the full powers of independence we can ensure that Scotland's enormous human and natural resources can make Scotland the fair and prosperous nation that it deserves to be."" In June, Mr Blackford was ejected from the Westminster chamber while protesting against what he called a ""power grab"" in UK Brexit legislation,sparking a walkout of SNP members. Referring to this at a fringe meeting on Monday evening, he said SNP MPs would use ""any means necessary"" to oppose a bad Brexit deal when MPs have a ""meaningful vote"" later in the year. He promoted the idea of another Brexit referendum - the so-called ""People's Vote"" - as a viable ""alternative"" to having a bad deal or no deal at all. His views have been backed up by the first minister,who - in a series of BBC interviews - has said SNP members would ""undoubtedly"" vote in favour of a fresh referendum. Ms Sturgeon told the BBC's Scotland editor Sarah Smith: ""The reason I said SNP MPs will vote for another EU referendum - if that comes before the House of Commons I don't know whether it will - is if that opportunity presents itself, I don't think it would be right for us to stand in the way of people elsewhere in the UK getting the chance to change their minds and it would also, I think, be odd for us not to grasp an opportunity for Scotland to reaffirm its vote to remain in the EU."" The SNP leader, who was being interviewed on the second day of her party's conference, added: ""I will be very frank, it doesn't necessary resolve the problems Scotland found itself in, yes we can look at options that might protect Scotland's position, but fundamentally the only real protection for Scotland against having decisions imposed on us against our will is for Scotland to become independent. ""That is one of the advantages of independence, of course that also gives us the opportunity to steward our own resources and build the better fairer society we want to see."" Ian Blackford told the SNP conference that Brexit was a ""democratic outrage"" The party's Brexit minister Mike Russell was pressed by members at a fringe event on when a new vote on independence might be called - and said the timing of a new vote ""is not in our gift"". One delegate told the MSP that ""we're very frustrate with constantly being told to just wait"" for a new referendum campaign, saying ""there's a sense that time is slipping away"". Mr Russell said he felt frustration too, but said: ""The why of independence is more important than the when of independence the moment, because the when is not in our gift. We have a devolved settlement which makes the when very difficult to achieve."" Prime Minister Theresa May has opposed fresh referendums on either independence or Brexit. Her official spokeswoman said Scotland ""had an independence referendum four years ago and vote decisively to remain in the UK"", adding that ""now is not the time"" for a fresh vote. Labour have not ruled out support for a so-called ""People's Vote"", while the Lib Dems are actively campaigning for it. Mrs May told the Conservative Party conference that ""we had the people's vote, and the people voted to leave"". And the Scottish Conservatives say the SNP is ""the party of the neverendum - not just in Scotland, but across the UK too"". Elsewhere at the conference, Mr Swinney mounted a defence of standardised assessments for primary one pupils. The education secretary is to make a statement to MSPs after the October recess in the wake of a Holyrood defeat which urged ministers to ""halt"" the tests. The government has promised to ""reflect"" on this - but Mr Swinney told a fringe event that the vote was a ""disgrace"" which was focused on politics rather than pupils.

Acting Met boss witnessed Westminster attack,"Clockwise from top left: PC Keith Palmer, Aysha Frade, Leslie Rhodes, Andreea Cristea and Kurt Cochran all lost their lives The Met Police's acting chief witnessed the murder of PC Keith Palmer in Westminster from a locked car, an inquest has heard. Sir Craig Mackey said it was his instinct to get out of the car when he saw Khalid Masood attack, but he stayed because he had no protective equipment. It happened as he was being driven out of the Palace of Westminster after a meeting on 22 March last year. Masood also drove into and killed four people on Westminster bridge. The 52-year-old was shot dead by armed police during the attack and his inquest is taking place at the Old Bailey in central London. The inquest into the deaths of PC Palmer, 48, Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, finished last week - thecoroner ruled all five been unlawfully killed. Victims of the Westminster terror attack Who was attacker Khalid Masood? Westminster attacker 'told children he would die' Sir Craig, now deputy commissioner of Scotland Yard, had been at the House of Commons meeting then-police minister Brandon Lewis. As he was driven out of the Palace of Westminster with colleagues, he heard a ""very, very loud bang"" from the direction of Westminster tube station. He said they then locked the car's doors as they saw Masood with a large knife at the gates. ""There was quite a lot of confusion about what was going on,"" Sir Craig told the Old Bailey. ""Clearly the way that the male came in and the purposeful way he came, he was clearly a threat."" Sir Craig Mackey with current Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick, before the funeral of PC Palmer Sir Craig, who retires in December, said he saw PC Palmer suffer ""two determined stab wounds"". He said: ""I could see PC Palmer moving backwards and him going down... ""The thing that still shakes me about the attack is that it was 80-plus seconds in total. It didn't feel like that, it felt an awfully long time."" Masood was then shot by a close protection officer. When asked what his reaction was following the gunshots, Sir Craig said: ""First and foremost I was a police officer so I went to open the door to get out. ""One of the PCs, quite rightfully, said: 'Get out, make safe, go, shut the door,' which he did, and it was the right thing to do. ""That's when I thought: 'I have got to start putting everything we need in place. We have got no protective equipment, no radio, I have got two colleagues with me who are quite distressed,' so we moved out."" He added:  ""If anyone had got out, the way this Masood was looking, anyone who got in his way would have been a target."" The inquest has adjourned until Wednesday, when two close protection officers will give evidence.

Second Pret allergy-link victim namedCelia Marsh is thought to have had an allergic reaction to a flatbread from the Bath branch of store.Bristol,"Celia Marsh died after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" A second customer who is believed to have died after an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger product has been named. Celia Marsh, 42, from Melksham, Wiltshire, died in December after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"". Her relatives said they ""just want the answers to why she died after eating lunch with her family"". Pret claimed it was mis-sold a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt. Supplier Coyo denies its yoghurt is to blame for the death. Pret said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Celia Marsh and we will seek to assist them in any way we can."" Mrs Marsh's name has been released by the Avon coroner after she died at Bath's Royal United Hospital. News of her death followed the inquest of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,who died after eating a Pret baguette. Mrs Marsh's family said: ""We have kept a dignified silence since the death of Celia in December last year as the family has come to terms with her sudden and unexpected death. ""We are also awaiting the outcome of the investigations into how she died. ""She was a much-loved mother, daughter, sister and wife. We miss her greatly and we just want the answers to why she died after eating lunch with her family."" Celia Marsh bought a flatbread from a Pret store in Bath Mrs Marsh's funeral took place in January but an inquest has yet to be held. A spokesman for the coroner said they were still waiting for the results of pathology tests. Pret said the yoghurt in the product was supplied by Coyo - a coconut milk brand which is stocked in shops and supermarkets across the UK. But Coyo has denied its product is to blame and said the ""true cause"" of Mrs Marsh's death has not been established. ""The dairy-free product we provided to Pret in December 2017, at the time of this tragedy, is not linked to the product we recalled in February 2018,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Pret's inability to provide us with a batch code, despite several requests, has severely limited our ability to investigate this further."" Second death linked to Pret sandwich Pret to label products after allergy death Pret death prompts food label law review Pret ended its relationship with Coyo and says it is in the process of taking legal action. The chain said it withdrew all affected products as soon as it was made aware of the incident by Bath and North East Somerset Council. A Pret spokesman said subsequent testing by the firm and two independent authorities found the Coyo dairy-free yoghurt contained traces of dairy protein. Council leader Tim Warren said: ""Bath and North East Somerset Council is aware of a death in Bath on 27th December 2017. ""The council has been conducting a thorough investigation into the incident which has not yet concluded.""

Tesco ditches more 'best before' dates,"Tesco is removing ""best before"" dates from another 116 fruit and vegetable products in a move the supermarket says will help consumers cut food waste. In May, the UK's biggest grocersuccessfully trialled removing labelsfrom 70 pre-packaged fresh food lines. Among the produce being added to the list are apples, oranges, cabbages and asparagus. Tesco said research showed scrapping best-before dates helped consumers keep ""perfectly good food"" for longer. However, its yellow sticker promotions, where prices are marked down, will continue in all stores. Tesco employees will use their own judgement to decide when to mark down the products with yellow stickers, Tesco said. The yellow sticker hunters Staff have been given training to help identify when produce prices should be reduced. A survey of 2,010 people conducted by independent market research agency Walnut Unlimited in August found that 53% of customers felt scrapping best before dates made a difference and helped them to keep fresh food for longer. Labelling on fresh products such as meat, fish, dairy or poultry will remain the same. While fruit and vegetables come with best before dates, meat-based products come with ""use by"" dates. The key difference is that use by dates mean that it is unsafe to consume the product after the date specified. Best before dates are the supermarket's estimation of when you should eat a product by and is more of a guideline. Tesco is working with its suppliers to find ways to use as much of their crop as possible, as well as creating new products from produce that might otherwise have gone to waste. For example, if an avocado has passed its best, it could still be sent to a UK supplier to make guacamole, which can then be sold to consumers.

Race review after two runners die,"The race began outside Cardiff Castle on Sunday morning Organisers of the Cardiff Half Marathon say they are ""100% satisfied"" in their medical plan after two runners died at Sunday's event.

Doctor set free in 'stolen babies' case,"This video can not be played Dr Vela was confronted by the BBC's Katya Adler in 2011. A Madrid court has let off a former doctor over stealing newborn babies from their mothers and supplying them to infertile couples. The court found gynaecologist Eduardo Vela, 85, had committed the crimes but could not legally be convicted because too much time had elapsed. He was the first person to go on trial for illegal adoptions that took place during and after the fascist dictatorship of General Franco. Thousands more cases are suspected. After Franco's triumph in Spain's 1936-1939 civil war, many children were removed from families identified by the fascist regime as left-wing and given to families considered more deserving. InÃ©s Madrigal was abducted and illegally adopted as a baby in 1969. She took a case against Vela in April 2012. Her adoptive mother, InÃ©s PÃ©rez, said before her death that Vela had given her the baby as ""a gift"", because she and her husband could not have children. DNA testing has shown that Ms Madrigal is not related to her late parents. However, because Ms Madrigal failed to take the case for 25 years after she first became an adult - in 1987 - it fell foul of the statute of limitations, which is 10 years. When the case first reached the court, it ruled that a decision would be taken as to whether the timeline fell outside the statute of limitations as part of the verdict. Doctor on trial over Spain 'stolen babies' scandal Facing jail: Spanish 'stolen baby' who searched for her mother Spain's stolen babies Ms Madrigal was in court for the verdict but Vela was absent. She and her lawyer say she will appeal to the Supreme Court so the doctor's crimes do not remain unpunished. InÃ©s Madrigal (centre) met other aggrieved families at the trial Prosecutors had sought an 11-year jail term for Vela. The Madrid provincial court found he had committed three crimes - abduction, fraud over pregnancy and forgery of documents. By Bruno Boelpaep, BBC News, outside the court Ms Madrigal entered the court with her lawyer and came out an hour later with mixed feelings. ""I'm happy because it's been proven that I was stolen, Dr Vela stole me,"" she said. But she was also disappointed that the doctor was now free: ""It's a little hard to take that there would be a limitation on this crime."" She thanked and hugged her supporters, a handful of women also looking for missing children. One was Cristina, who gave birth in Madrid 1984: ""We are really disappointed - it's like being slapped in the face. We need to change the laws so there would be no statute of limitations for these crimes."" Spain's stolen babies scandal went on for decades, from Franco's early years in power to the 1990s. It took a long time to surface because the Roman Catholic Church and medical profession are highly respected, and Spanish law did not require the biological mother's name on the birth certificate. Vela - in wheelchair - was not in court for the verdict The scandal is closely linked to the Church, which under Franco assumed a prominent role in Spain's social services including hospitals, schools and children's homes. Nuns and priests compiled waiting lists of would-be adoptive parents, while doctors are said to have lied to mothers about the fate of their children. Democracy is well established now but the Franco era still haunts Spain. There was an unwritten ""pact of forgetting"" during the democratic transition in the late 1970s. An amnesty law adopted in 1977, aimed at smoothing the transition to democracy, made it difficult to look into baby trafficking as courts and politicians refused to investigate it. In 2008 investigating judge Baltasar GarzÃ³n estimated that 30,000 children had been stolen from families considered politically suspect by the Franco regime Some 3,000 reported cases of alleged stolen children have been reported, but prosecutors have closed all but a handful of investigations In 2013 MarÃ­a GÃ³mez Valbuena, an 87-year-old nun facing two charges of kidnapping and falsifying documents, died before going on trial In 2017the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions called on Spain to be more proactive,externalin attending to victims by creating a special prosecutor and a public DNA bank, and urged the Catholic Church to open its archives to shed light on Franco-era adoptions. UPDATE 12 July 2019: It emerged that InÃ©s Madrigal had not been stolen but had been given up for adoption voluntarily by her biological mother. Prosecutors decided that the court's decision that Eduardo Vela had committed crimes should no longer be considered valid.

Google iPhone data privacy case blocked,"An attempt to tackle Google over data tracking has been blocked by the courts The High Court has blocked a bid to sue Google for allegedly unlawfully taking data from 4.4 million UK iPhone users. The legal case was mounted by a group called Google You Owe Us, led by former Which director Richard Lloyd. It sought compensation for people whose handsets were tracked by Google for several months in 2011 and 2012. Mr Lloyd said he was ""disappointed"" by the ruling and his group would appeal, but Google said it was ""pleased"" and thought the case was ""without merit"". The campaign was believed to be the first mass legal action of its kind in the UK. Mr Justice Warby who oversaw the case explained that it was blocked because the claims that people suffered damage were not supported by the facts advanced by the campaign group. Another reason for blocking it, he said, was the impossibility of reliably calculating the number of iPhone users affected by the alleged privacy breach. Mr Lloyd said in a statement: ""Today's judgement is extremely disappointing and effectively leaves millions of people without any practical way to seek redress and compensation when their personal data has been misused."" He added that he would seek permission to appeal against the verdict on behalf of the 20,000 people who signed up to the campaign. 'More than 600 apps had access to my iPhone data' Google faces mass legal action in UK over data snooping In response to the court ruling, Google said: """"The privacy and security of our users is extremely important to us. This claim is without merit, and we're pleased the court has dismissed it."" The case revolved around how Google used what are known as cookies - small computer text files that log information as people browse the web and use online services. The complaint made by Google You Owe Us alleged that the cookies were used by Google to track people and get around settings on Apple's Safari browser that blocked such monitoring. Ads were sold on the basis of the personal information gathered by Google's cookies. The Safari workaround was used by Google on lots of different devices but the UK case centred on iPhone users. The group hoped to win Â£1bn ($1.3bn) in compensation for affected users. The first stage of the legal case was getting the UK courts to recognise that the group had a legitimate complaint. In an earlier court appearance, Google argued that the type of action being brought by Mr Lloyd was unsuitable and should not be given the go-ahead. Google has paid $39.5m in the US to settle earlier claims against it over similar data-gathering claims.

RSPCA 'troubled' by dog ban on pitches,"This video can not be played Dog walkers argue planned open spaces ban An animal charity has said it is ""troubled"" by plans which could see dogs banned from sports pitches. RSPCA Cymru has criticised Cardiff Council's plans to bring in a public space protection order (PSPO) against dog owners using marked pitches. The proposals aim to tackle dog fouling in the city but more than 2,500 people have signed a petition against the ban. Over the last five years the council has issued 142 fines after rangers saw owners failing to pick up dog mess. Its proposal would also see on-the-spot fines of up to Â£100 for dog walkers who let their animals on marked sports pitches, as well as in play areas and school grounds. 'Dog poo cost me my leg' Councils pick up 'poo-shaming' map guide Currently, dog owners can be charged up to Â£80 for failing to clean up mess left in public places, but the move would see penalties issued even if the dog does not defecate on the pitch or it has been picked up. A number of dog owners are opposing the plan, which has been put out forconsultation,external, saying it would limit where they could walk their pets. Lesley Brown walks her two Labradors at Pontcanna fields Lesley Brown, 60, from St Fagans, said that the move would be ""irresponsible"" of the council. She walks her two black Labradors in Pontcanna fields three times a week at various times of the day. It is a fenced-off area of Cardiff with sports pitches and would be affected by the plans. ""What's the point in having a dog? A dog needs to be healthy and you have the responsibility to keep it exercised,"" she said. Ms Brown is also worried that the ban would have an impact on the social benefits of walking her dogs as ""it helps people meet one another"". Ben McManus, 33, who runs Pontcanna dog-walking business WalkWagPlay with his wife, said their business could go under if the council plan went ahead. He walks a number of dogs off their leads at Pontcanna fields every day. ""It would have a detrimental impact on every dog we work with,"" he said. Pitches like these at Pontcanna fields could be covered by a dog ban RSPCA Cymru spokesman Paul Smith said: ""We are troubled by any moves from Cardiff Council to ban dogs from marked sports pitches. ""We're proud to work closely with Cardiff Council and urge them not to forbid dogs from marked sports playing pitches, particularly where adequate space for exercise may not be available nearby."" Meanwhile, sports clubs using public pitches have taken to social media to showinstances of dog foulingand how they have to clean up before games can take place. ""A small minority of dog owners are utterly selfish,"" said Ian Titherington after mess was left on a rugby pitch in Cardiff before a under-13 Clwb Rygbi match. Dog ban plan for Cardiff open spaces Council issues Â£22k dog foul fines Clwb Rygbi president John Parry-Jones said: ""We recognise as a club that the council do as much as they can, and that the majority of dog owners do their best to help avoid allowing their dogs onto the playing areas. ""Our concern is for our players and the significant numbers of our junior section who are on Pontcanna each Sunday. It isn't isolated to Cardiff. I think all our opponents in the area have similar problems."" A Cardiff Council spokeswoman said: ""Every year we receive a significant number of complaints about dog fouling and out-of-control dogs in public places and while the majority of dog owners are responsible and do the right thing by cleaning up after their dog and keeping them under control there is a minority who cause significant problems. ""The introduction of a PSPO would allow the council to tackle this nuisance so that our public open spaces can be enjoyed safely by everyone.""

'Third of girls' harassed in school uniform,"One in three girls in the UK has been sexually harassed in public when wearing school uniform, a new report has suggested. And two-thirds of girls say they have experienced unwanted sexual attention in public, it adds. The figures come from a report by children's charity Plan International UK, which said many girls feel street harassment is ""all part of growing up"". It is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it. The charity commissioned,externalan opinion poll by Opinium of 1,000 teenagers and young women aged 14 to 21 across the UK in June 2018, and also carried out interviews with girls and academics. It found: 66% of girls in the UK said they had experienced unwanted sexual attention or sexual or physical contact in a public place 35% of girls reported receiving unwanted sexual contact such as being touched, groped or grabbed Girls as young as eight years old described witnessing or experiencing harassment More than one in three girls received unwanted sexual attention such as being groped, stared at, catcalled and wolf-whistled while wearing school uniform One-quarter of girls said they had been filmed or photographed by a stranger without permission The report features stories from several young women, including 19-year-old Malikah, from Birmingham, who said she was followed by someone in a car while walking alone. ""My phone was upside-down, but I pretended to be on the phone and was trying to make out like my dad was coming to pick me up,"" she said. ""Now my parents are more cautious about when I'll be home and going out after dark."" One 18-year-old said she felt street harassment was ""part of the 'bro culture'"" and her dad had told her: ""You know what men are like."" And another girl, aged 17, said: ""It's just become normal."" Hollaback! - an international movement tackling harassment - says there is no right or wrong way to respond. But if you choose to speak directly to the assailant, it offers the following advice: Be firm:Look them in the eye and denounce their behaviour with a strong, clear voice. Say what feels natural:The important thing is that you are not apologetic in your response. Don't engage:Harassers may try to argue with you or dismiss you through further conversation or by making fun of you. As tempting as it may be get into a verbal war with them, it is not recommended. The attention may further feed their abusive behaviour. Keep moving:Once you've said your piece, keep moving. Harassers do not deserve the pleasure of your company. The charity is calling on the government to recognise street harassment as a type of ""gender-based violence"". It has made several recommendations, including: Public awareness campaigns to spread the message that street harassment ""is not OK"" Offer training for bystanders on how to safely intervene Support boys and men to change their attitudes and challenge harassment Provide relationship and sex education to young people Training for workers in public places (shop staff, bus drivers) on spotting harassment and reporting it The chief executive of Plan International UK, Tanya Barron, said it was ""shocking and deeply concerning"" that girls who are clearly of school age are being sexually harassed. ""It's simply not acceptable that girls as young as 12 are being wolf-whistled at in public, touched against their will, stared at or even followed,"" she said. ""This disgraceful behaviour needs to be called out and stopped.""

Race bosses 'satisfied' with medical plan,"The race began outside Cardiff Castle on Sunday morning Organisers of the Cardiff Half Marathon say they are ""100% satisfied"" in their medical plan after two runners died at Sunday's event. The pair, aged 25 and 32, went into cardiac arrest after crossing the finishing line within three minutes of each other, at about 12.25 (GMT). The men have not been named but their next-of-kin have been notified. Race organisers Run 4 Wales say they are ""devastated"" and will carry out a full review. The men were treated after crossing the line, before being taken to Cardiff's University Hospital Wales. Chief executive Matt Newman said: ""The whole team is devastated and our priority is the families involved. The two runners were taken to University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, but later died ""We had a doctor and medical team at the finish line and were in attendance within seconds of the gentlemen collapsing. ""They were able to take both to the primary medical centre 20 metres from the finish line and quickly transferred to hospital."" About 20,000 people took part this year, on the race's 15th anniversary. A review will now be carried out by race organisers, as is standard practice each year. Mr Newman said: ""We are 100% satisfied that there was nothing more that could be done by the team at Run 4 Wales or the medical professionals in place on the day. Almost 120,000 runners have completed the Cardiff Half Marathon since its inception in 2003 ""We have a team of 10 doctors in place and a huge deployment of medics and St John's Ambulance around the 13.1-mile course.

French Connection says it could be sold,"Shares in struggling fashion chain French Connection have risen 25% to 55p after it said it may be up for sale. Following speculation at the weekend, it said it was""reviewing all strategic options"",externalincluding the potential sale of the firm. It adds, though, there is no certainty an offer will be made for the company. Sports Direct and House of Fraser owner Mike Ashley has a 27% stake in the chain, which is 40% owned by founder Stephen Marks. French Connection, which has made a loss for each of the five most recent years, also sells homewares and perfumes. It owns the brands Great Plains and YMC and formerly owned upmarket fashion label Nicole Farhi, with whose eponymous owner he had a close partnership. The company's customers are aged between 18 and 35. It has almost 400 stores in 50 countries around the world, 130 of them in the UK. French Connection's statement confirmed speculation previously reported by Sky News. Last year, the firm appointed two new independent directors after facing pressure from investors to make top-level changes. Mr Marks, who founded the company 50 years ago, is both chairman and chief executive, a concentration of power that is frowned upon by UK investors. He has been sharply criticised for having too much control over the board. Born in 1946 in Harrow, North London, his father was a hairdresser. His first fashion job was at Louis Feraud, whose clothes were worn by Brigitte Bardot. After starting on his own in the late 1960s, he had some success with a consignment of hot pants and then French Connection, launched on the back of a consignment of cheesecloth shirts. He was a successful schoolboy tennis player, winning a prize at Junior Wimbledon. He founded the fc** tennis academy which helped the careers of British players, including Jo Durie and Elena Baltacha. He has backed Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch: both films featured French Connection clothing. In another British gangster film, Layer Cake, a mocked-up French Connection-branded range of cocaine and ecstasy was featured. Stephen Marks was the film's executive producer French Connection often shortens its name to fcuk, which it launched as an advertising slogan in 1997. Its campaign ran under the line ""fcuk fashion"" and then, ""fcuk advertising"", but it had to tone it down after numerous complaints were made to advertising watchdogs. The controversy was so great that the UK's Advertising Standards Authority asked to see all the company's poster campaigns in advance.

'Life changing' climate report,"People who live on some Pacific islands are worried they will lose their homes to the sea if temperature rise exceeds 1.5C It is likely to be the most critical and controversial report on climate change in recent years. Leading scientists are meeting in South Korea this week to see if global temperatures can be kept from rising by more than 1.5C this century. The world has already passed one degree of warming as carbon emissions have ballooned since the 1850s. Many low-lying countries say they may disappear under the sea if the 1.5C limit is breached. After a week of deliberations in the city of Incheon, the researchers' new report is likely to say that keeping below this limit will require urgent and dramatic action from governments and individuals alike. One scientist told BBC News that our lives would never be the same if the world changed course to stay under 1.5C. 'Nature-based' plan to beat climate change 'Climate change moving faster than we are' Worries over China coal power boom 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The new study is being produced by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external(IPCC), a body set up to provide a clear scientific view for governments on the causes, impacts and solutions to rising temperatures. When the Paris climate agreement was signed in December 2015, there was delight and surprise among many delegates that countries had agreed that the long-term goal of the pact should be to keep global temperatures ""well below two degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C"". To examine the challenges and impacts of keeping temperatures below the 1.5C limit, the UN asked the IPCC to produce a special report, which the scientific body has delivered in record time. This week in Incheon, the scientists and government delegates will go through the final, short, 15-page Summary for Policymakers, the key distillation of the underlying scientific reports. This will be done word by word, to ensure everyone - scientists and governments alike - are in agreement on the text. The report will be the guiding light for governments as they decide how to develop their economies in the face of rising temperatures over the coming decades. ""The decisions we make now about whether we let 1.5 or 2 degrees or more happen will change the world enormously,"" Dr Heleen de Coninck, one of the co-ordinating lead authors of the report, told BBC News. ""But our lives, when keeping it below 1.5C with projected population rise and economic growth, will also look differently."" ""Lives of people will never be the same again either way, but we can influence which future we end up with."" Right now, the world has passed one degree of warming above the global temperatures that pertained around 1850, before widespread industrialisation. Leaked drafts of the new report suggest that global warming is on track to break the 1.5C mark by around 2040. This is potentially very bad news for low-lying island states and some of the least developed countries in the world who fear that 1.5C will cause sea-level to rise and threaten their survival. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Slowly and quite carefully. TheIPCC has been in existence for 30 years,externaland produces detailed assessments of the state of the climate every six or seven years. This special report has been almost three years in the making. The authors are all scientists who have been nominated by governments and international institutions. Droughts and heatwaves have struck several parts of the world in 2018, leading many people to question just how much impact climate change is having In this case, there are 86 lead authors from 39 countries, of which 39% are female. These researchers, who are unpaid, have reviewed the available scientific literature on the feasibility, impacts and costs of staying under 1.5C. They have then put together draft versions of their report, after having reviewed some 6,000 references all told. These draft reports were sent out to other experts and governments for review. In total, this report has had over 40,000 review comments. Because so many people are involved, and all these review comments have been taken on board, the IPCC has a reputation for being rather conservative, producing reports that have a very broad consensus. Those involved say the wide range of literature and the large number of authors involved is a key strength of the body. ""We don't base our reports on a single article that has an extreme conclusion, that contrasts with the available literature,"" said Dr Carolina Vera, a member of the IPCC bureau. ""The collective view of the available literature is the most robust contribution that we can provide to the governments."" If you add up all the promises to cut carbon made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, it would see the world warm by more than 3C by the end of this century. For some scientists, there is not enough time left to take the actions that would keep the world within the desired limit. ""If you really look seriously at the feasibility, it looks like it will be very hard to reach the 1.5C,"" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London and a former IPCC member. ""I am relatively sceptical that we can meet 1.5C, even with an overshoot. Scientists can dream up that is feasible, but it's a pipedream."" Hoesung Lee is the chairman of the IPCC As well as the science, there is also the politics. For some countries, especially those who are major exporters of fossil fuels, limiting carbon emissions more rapidly than at present is a challenge. ""The overall big question in this report is how we can still get to that 1.5C goal? What does it take?"", said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace. ""There are those for whom 1.5C is a matter of life or death and they want the message to be clear. Others might want to suggest that there is not scientific certainty and the messages, for example on rapid fossil-fuel phase-out, should not be so straightforward."" The challenge of keeping temperatures below 1.5 is considerable. But, if it is accepted by the governments, the report is likely to say that it can be done, if the world is willing to take some very tough steps. These are likely to involve an intensification of cuts to CO2 emissions, a rapid move to renewable energy and quite possibly, the deployment of technologies to suck greenhouse gases from the air. This last option is seen as highly controversial. The report is also likely state that lifestyle and dietary choices can make a significant difference - but there are no simple or cheap solutions. ""There is no easy answer; it is a much more complicated answer,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs one of the IPCC working groups. ""It has physical elements, it has social elements, it has political elements. The report, as it is scoped, allows us to go into these issues, but a crisp answer I don't think is what we were asked for by governments."" There has been quite a bit of speculation that the scientists are being forced to soften the contents of the report, or ""pull their punches"", on some of the major conclusions. What's happened is that there have been notable changes between different draft versions of the short Summary for Policymakers, which will be released officially on Monday 8 October. Researchers believe that wildfires in many locations have been impacted by rising temperatures This has led some critics to conclude that important aspects are being downplayed to suit the interests of countries with major fossil fuel industries, such as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia. But members of the IPCC say that they will not allow their conclusions to be watered down during the next few days when the Summary is gone through, line by line. ""What is really important for the work of the IPCC is the respect for the integrity and scientific rigour of the authors - that is at the heart of the work of the author teams,"" said ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, a co-chair of the body. ""If one can imagine the governments holding the hands of the scientists, this means you don't know how science works!"" Quite likely, yes! IPCC sessions are closed from the public, to allow governments and scientists to speak freely. Governments often seek to make changes to the text - the scientists are there to ensure that if changes are made, they are consistent with the research. ""I've never been to an approval session that didn't go well after hours; it's kind of IPCC working practice now,"" said Prof Skea. ""Absolutely it will be a robust session and we are well geared up for it.""

Second Pret allergy-link victim named,"Celia Marsh died after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"" A second customer who is believed to have died after an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger product has been named. Celia Marsh, 42, from Melksham, Wiltshire, died in December after eating a ""super-veg rainbow flatbread"". Her relatives said they ""just want the answers to why she died after eating lunch with her family"". Pret claimed it was mis-sold a guaranteed dairy-free yoghurt. Supplier Coyo denies its yoghurt is to blame for the death. Pret said: ""Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of Celia Marsh and we will seek to assist them in any way we can."" Mrs Marsh's name has been released by the Avon coroner after she died at Bath's Royal United Hospital. News of her death followed the inquest of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15,who died after eating a Pret baguette. Mrs Marsh's family said: ""We have kept a dignified silence since the death of Celia in December last year as the family has come to terms with her sudden and unexpected death. ""We are also awaiting the outcome of the investigations into how she died. ""She was a much-loved mother, daughter, sister and wife. We miss her greatly and we just want the answers to why she died after eating lunch with her family."" Celia Marsh bought a flatbread from a Pret store in Bath Mrs Marsh's funeral took place in January but an inquest has yet to be held. A spokesman for the coroner said they were still waiting for the results of pathology tests. Pret said the yoghurt in the product was supplied by Coyo - a coconut milk brand which is stocked in shops and supermarkets across the UK. But Coyo has denied its product is to blame and said the ""true cause"" of Mrs Marsh's death has not been established. ""The dairy-free product we provided to Pret in December 2017, at the time of this tragedy, is not linked to the product we recalled in February 2018,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Pret's inability to provide us with a batch code, despite several requests, has severely limited our ability to investigate this further."" Second death linked to Pret sandwich Pret to label products after allergy death Pret death prompts food label law review Pret ended its relationship with Coyo and says it is in the process of taking legal action. The chain said it withdrew all affected products as soon as it was made aware of the incident by Bath and North East Somerset Council. A Pret spokesman said subsequent testing by the firm and two independent authorities found the Coyo dairy-free yoghurt contained traces of dairy protein. Council leader Tim Warren said: ""Bath and North East Somerset Council is aware of a death in Bath on 27th December 2017. ""The council has been conducting a thorough investigation into the incident which has not yet concluded.""

Far-right candidate wins first round in Brazil,"Jair Bolsonaro (left) and Fernando Haddad will face each other in a run-off A far-right candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, has won the first round of Brazil's presidential election. He will face the left-wing Workers' Party candidate, Fernando Haddad, in the second round on 28 October after he failed to win the 50% of valid votes needed to win outright. With almost all the votes counted, Mr Bolsonaro had 46% and Mr Haddad 29%. Opinion polls conducted before the election predicted that in a second round the two candidates would be tied. A Trump for the Tropics? The man who would be Lula Basics on Brazil Mr Bolsonaro's once insignificant Social Liberal Party (PSL) is poised to become the largest force in Congress following legislative elections held alongside the presidential vote, in what analysts have described as a seismic shift in Brazilian politics. The politician and the PSL have ridden a wave of rising anger at the Workers' Party, which their supporters blame for a prolonged recession, rising violent crime and widespread corruption in South America's largest economy. In his victory speech, broadcast live on Facebook and uploaded on to Twitter,external, he said Brazilians could take the path of ""prosperity, liberty, family, on God's side"" or the path of Venezuela. Brazil's socialist-led neighbour is mired in a deep economic and political crisis which has driven more than two million people to leave. Across Latin America this has become a popular campaign strategy: don't vote for the left or you will end up like Venezuela. This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential election. But who is he? The former army captain has made provocative statements on a huge range of issues. He has pledged tough punishments for offenders and the relaxing of gun ownership. He has also spoken of torture as a legitimate practice and wants to restore the death penalty. His hard-line approach to law and order has brought back memories of the two-decade military dictatorship, and earned him backing from the military and those demanding greater safety ina country with rising levels of violent crime. Jair Bolsonaro has strong support within the armed forces Misogynistic and homophobic rhetoric has prompted outrage and protests, and he has taken a strong anti-abortion stance. Like Mr Trump, Mr Bolsonaro has criticisedthe Paris climate agreement, and he has vowed to make Brazil great again. Economically, he favours a smaller state. He has announced plans to lower taxes, privatise state companies and limit foreign ownership of natural resources. The candidate believes selling off companies will help fight government corruption - one of the focuses ofOperation Car Wash, a massive corruption investigation. Mr Bolsonaro was stabbed on the campaign trail, drawing intense media attention to him and his policies. Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent Jair Bolsonaro expected to win the presidency in this first round, even if the polls said otherwise. ""On the 28th October, we can all go to the beach,"" he said, as he turned up to vote on Sunday. His supporters had been saying for weeks that their candidate would win this straight out. Mr Bolsonaro may have soared in the polls recently but Brazilians are going to have to wait another three weeks to find out whether it'll be him or Fernando Haddad as Brazil's new leader. Brazil feels very divided - and fragile. You could feel it when you talked to voters. So many people have told me they would be voting for the ""least worst"" candidate. On one side, there are those determined never to allow the Workers' Party to rule again; on the other, those desperately trying not to allow a far-right candidate to rule this young democracy. A feeling of nervousness hangs over Brazil - and will do for the next few weeks as both candidates ramp up their campaigning once again. The future of Brazil will vary greatly, depending on who eventually wins. He has won over many Brazilians who think his law-and-order stance will make Brazil safer. A Roman Catholic, he has also attracted the support of millions of evangelical Christians by saying he will defend traditional family values. Supporters of Jair Bolsonaro celebrated outside his home in Rio de Janeiro Several prominent Brazilian footballers have endorsed his candidacy including World Cup winner Ronaldinho,  Palmeiras midfielder Felipe Melo and Tottenham Hotspur winger Lucas Moura. Results showed Mr Bolsonaro dominating Brazil's two biggest states, SÃ£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. However, the country's north-east showed more loyalty to the Workers' Party, having benefited from its social policies. Centre-left presidential candidate Ciro Gomes got the most support in the state of CearÃ¡, where he has lived for most of his life. In Sao Paulo, Mr Bolsonaro's son Eduardo was re-elected as a state deputy, receiving more votes than any other lower-house candidate in Brazil's history. Eduardo Bolsanaro has previously tweeteda photo of himself and former chief strategist to US President Donald Trump, Steve Bannon,external- who, he says, is ""in touch"" with his father's campaign to help fight ""cultural Marxism"". Mr Bolsonaro said that he was certain that if there had not been ""problems"" with the electronic voting system used in Brazil, he would have won outright. Brazil's electoral authorities have said the vote went ahead peacefully and without any major problems. Fernando Haddad was visibly relieved that there would be a second round He has portrayed himself as a trusted candidate for those who baulk at Mr Bolsonaro's style and rhetoric. After reaching the second round, he said he and the Workers' Party would ""only use arguments, we don't use any guns"". Referring to Mr Bolsonaro's lead, he said he felt ""challenged by the results, which alert us to the risks Brazilian democracy is facing"". ""We need to approach this with a sense of responsibility,"" he told his cheering supporters. ""We want to unite the democrats of this country, to reduce inequality and to achieve social justice."" He said he and his party had been presented with ""a golden opportunity"" by making it into the second round.

Japan says UK could join trade pact post-Brexit,"Theresa May met Shinzo Abe on an official visit to Japan last year Britain would be welcomed into the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal with ""open arms"" after it leaves the EU, Japan's prime minister has said. While the UK would lose its role as a gateway to Europe after Brexit, it would retain its ""global strength"", Shinzo Abetold the Financial Times,external. He also urged the UK and EU to use ""wisdom"" to avoid a no-deal scenario. The TPP is a trade agreement between 11 countries, including Japan, Canada, Australia and Malaysia. US President Donald Trump withdrew his country from the agreement last year, soon after entering the White House. What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Could the UK really join TPP?

The UK would only be able to join the bloc if it left the EU customs union and was able to set its own tariffs. In the interview Mr Abe also expressed concern about a no-deal scenario. ""I hope that both sides can contribute their wisdom and at least avoid a so-called disorderly Brexit,"" he said. He argued a transition period was essential for Japanese firms, saying, ""I truly hope that the negative impact of Brexit to the global economy, including Japanese businesses, will be minimised.""

But in the run-up to Brexit several Japanese financial firms have said they intend to move their main EU bases away from London andelectronics giant Panasonic has said it will move its European headquarters from the UK to Amsterdam. Talks on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and its future relations with the EU are entering a critical phase ahead of a summit of European leaders next week. On Wednesday, the EU is due to publish updated proposals for future co-operation as well as more details of its no-deal contingency plans but the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said these could now be delayed. Brussels, she added, was anxious not to do anything that could imperil the chance of an agreement by the middle of November and wanted to meet the UK's concerns without crossing their own red lines. The UK is also expected to update its own proposals for its so-called Northern Ireland backstop - an insurance policy intended to stop the return of physical infrastructure on the border with the Republic of Ireland. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said this could involve an increase in ""light touch"" checks on products and goods away from the border until a more comprehensive solution was agreed. Media reports suggest Tory Brexiteers might be willing to accept such a temporary customs arrangement extending beyond the end of 2020 - when the UK-EU's proposed transition period will cease. Former Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who until July was an adviser to ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, said this had been their view for some time but also that Eurosceptics would not allow it to continue indefinitely.

Irish border arrangements have proven a sticking point in negotiations. An alternative backstop proposed by the EU would see Northern Ireland effectively remain in the customs union and single market, while the rest of the UK shifted away from Brussels' rules. However, the prime minister has already said it would be unacceptable and it is strongly opposed by Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), on which Mrs May's government relies to secure a majority in Parliament. DUP leader Arlene Foster warned it would be ""catastrophic"" to create a barrier between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as she travelled for talks with the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday.

Man killed by sea snake,"Harry Evans was bitten by the snake as he pulled in a net, police said A British man who died after being bitten by a sea snake in Australia was ""living his dream"" working on a fishing boat, his mother said. Harry Evans, 23, from Poole, Dorset, was bitten while working on a trawler off the coast of the Northern Territory on Thursday. Emergency crews were called to the boat, near island Groote Eylandt, but were unable to save him. His mother, Sharon Evans, said he was ""working in a job he loved"". Mr Evans was bitten by the venomous snakewhile pulling a net onto the boat at about 09:00 local time, police said. His mother told the Press Association: ""We know Harry was bitten by a snake and died. ""Harry was not a backpacker, he was working in a job he loved and was living his dream. ""He had contact with his family and friends at home regularly and couldn't have been any more loved. We couldn't have been prouder of him."" Harry Evans was working on a trawler off Groote Eylandt, which is 400 miles from Darwin Friend George Jackson-Carter posted on Facebook: ""RIP Harry Evans, you were one of the most kind-hearted and funniest people I've ever met. Always made everyone laugh and smile."" The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man who had died in the Northern Territory and are in contact with the Australian authorities."" Sea snakes are highly venomous, but because of their limited contact with humans, bites are relatively rare. Blanche D'Anastasi, who researches the animal at James Cook University, had said she believed Australia had no previously recorded deaths from sea snakes.

Taylor Swift breaks political silence,"Taylor Swift has spoken out politically for the first time, publicly endorsing two Democrats for the upcomingUS mid-term elections. The 28-year-old says events in ""the past two years"" have meant she's no longer reluctant to share her views.

""I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of colour is terrifying, sickening and prevalent."" What are the US mid-terms? Taylor spoke out against the Republican candidate who is currently elected in her home state. ""As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appals and terrifies me,"" she wrote. ""She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorisation of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape."" One of the candidates endorsed by Taylor, former Tennessee Governor Phil Bredesen, backedBrett Kavanaugh's controversial successful Supreme Court nomination. Tennessee usually sides with President Donald Trump's Republican party, but recent polls suggest the result there could be close. The Instagram post has had more than a million likes, while users on Twitter used Taylor's letter as an opportunity to speak on one of her historical foes - Ye (formerly known as Kanye) West.

Facebook's UK tax bill triples to ÃÂ£15.7m,"Facebook's UK tax bill has tripled to Â£15.8m - but the social media giant will see an immediate cut because of a tax credit. The final bill comes to Â£7.4m, since Facebook will see tax relief of Â£8.4m after awarding shares to employees. In 2016, Facebook's tax billrose to Â£5.1m, following a major overhaul of the social media firm's tax structure. However, the company's profits only climbed by Â£4m year-on-year from Â£58.4m to Â£62.7m in 2017. The company's UK office provides marketing services and sales and engineering support to the company. Facebook's revenue rose by a third year-on-year to Â£1.2bn in 2017, because of increased revenues from inter-company and advertising reseller services in 2017. ""We have changed the way we report tax so that revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is recorded in the UK and any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax,"" said Facebook's Northern Europe vice-president, Steve Hatch. In 2017, Facebook gave out 1.48 million restricted ordinary shares (RSU) to employees, a move that reduces its tax liability. This is one million fewer shares than it gave out in 2016. Facebook security breach: Up to 50m accounts attacked Facebook slated over phone ad push Facebook hate speech glitch investigated by firm The publication ofFacebook's 2017 tax accounts,externalfollows extensive criticism from policymakers and the media over the last 12 months of how much tax tech giants typically pay in Europe. Large technology companies have been condemned for moving sales through other countries and paying modest amounts of tax in the UK. Last week, Chancellor Philip Hammond raised the prospect of introducing a new tax to address this concern. Meanwhile, online payments firm PayPal has announced that its UK subsidiary has agreed to pay an extra Â£3.1m in taxfollowing a review by HMRC. The social networking giant said that it intended to expand its UK operations further in the future. In July, it signed a new facility lease in the UK. In 2017, Facebook employed 330 more people than the previous year - a 34% increase in headcount. Mr Hatch said that the UK was Facebook's largest engineering base outside the US.

Boots investigated over fatal pills error,"Tony Lee had been coping well with the death of his wife just months before, his family said Regulators are investigating the actions of Boots after the death of a great-grandfather who was sent duplicate packs of prescription drugs. Richard ""Tony"" Lee took a week of extra pills dispensed in error shortly before his death in December 2016. The General Pharmaceutical Council, which regulates pharmacies, said it was investigating his daughter's complaint. Boots said ""extremely rare circumstances"" led to the error and has now apologised to the family. However, the family is still waiting for a written apology from the company. Gail Pickles said she went through the pill packs to send them back for disposal Mr Lee, 84, from Doncaster, was supposed to be sent four 108-pill, weekly packs each month to control heart, kidney and anxiety conditions. But after his death, his daughter Gail Pickles found double the expected number of packs, along with evidence he had taken the double dose. After reporting the duplicated medication packs found among her late father's belongings, she said she was promised there would be an investigation and ""Boots would be transparent"". But trying to follow this up in February 2017, she was told the Nottingham-based company ""could not comment at this time"". Mrs Pickles said the ""tone of the letter was shocking"". Gail Pickles found double the number of packs her father should have been given She was determined to look more closely at what had happened, a decision backed up in January this year when she watcheda BBC investigation into Boots, which covered three patients who died after pharmacy errors. In June, atthe inquest at Doncaster Coroner's Court, it was revealed that when responsibility for sending the prescription was moved to a new pharmacy, the original pharmacy did not get a message to cancel its order, resulting in two sets of the same prescription being sent to Mr Lee. Assistant coroner Louise Slater said excess dosing would have increased the risk of a cardiac event and was ""a contributory factor"" in his death. Mrs Slater told the inquest shortfalls in communication had ""resulted in a lack of clarity as to which pharmacy would assume responsibility"". ""I'm satisfied that policies and procedures were in place at the pharmacies,"" she said. ""However, they were not followed on this occasion due an individual failing rather than a systemic failure."" Questions over staffing and safety at Boots pharmacies featured in a BBC investigation in January Immediately after the inquest, Mrs Pickles said she was ""appalled"" by Boots' actions, particularly the revelation an internal investigation report into the error stated Mr Lee did not need medical attention and the incident did not need to be escalated. Mrs Pickles from Penistone, South Yorkshire, also believes the Boots pharmacies had repeatedly failed to meet Boots' own rules - known as Standard Operating Procedures - for dispensing prescriptions. Gail Pickles said follow-up phone calls might have alerted her father to the mistake After examining a total of 15 Medisure packs, including the duplicate ones, she said: ""There's a space [on the pack] to write the 'week commencing...', had that been filled in alarm bells might have rung for Dad. ""They hadn't labelled properly, for example saying 'take so many times a day' but not how many tablets. ""Had they phoned as they're supposed to, to say a delivery's coming, [it may have brought the error to light but] they weren't doing that."" Liam Gallagher questioned over 'assault' Horseracing chiefs pledge to make sport more diverse The household items we miss the most Mrs Pickles said: ""I don't think that any pharmacist goes to work thinking that they're going to cut corners and harm patients. They're going to work to do their job properly. ""Don't they have time to do it? Don't they have staff to do it?"" Dr Anthony Cox, from University of Birmingham Pharmacy School, said workload was a critical element of safety Dr Anthony Cox, from University of Birmingham Pharmacy School, who examined the packs for BBC Inside Out, said: ""Pharmacists are horrified when they've made an error. ""If you are getting errors and violations occurring then you do need to look at your standard operating procedures, you do need to look at staffing, you do need to look at the workload pressures on people to see whether they're contributing to that."" But apart from the critical double dose, Dr Cox could not find an error which on its own could have caused Mr Lee harm. Each of the four duplicate ""double dose"" packs contained more than 108 tablets Boots said it had apologised for the tone of the letter but denied it was not transparent - saying it could not comment further while inquest proceedings were ongoing. It has also repeatedly expressed its condolences over Mr Lee's death, accepts it should have provided a written apology sooner and has offered to meet Mrs Pickles. The firm insisted ""rare and exceptional"" circumstances led to the original mistake and it had an extremely low error rate. Boots told the BBC the report revealed at the inquest was the initial report from the store which was based on limited information and a full investigation was already under way. It added procedures had been updated and pharmacists were asked for feedback about them in 2016 to identify whether any additional support was needed. Boots accepted there were some failings complying with standard operating procedures in this case but said they were not symptomatic of a wider problem. During the Inside Out investigation in January, Boots said it was confident it had both the resource to deliver patient care and the company had enough pharmacy staff. It also said it had contacted Dr Cox to discuss patient safety further and drive best practice. Boots added it fully complied with the coroner's investigation. The General Pharmaceutical Council, which in January cleared Boots of risking patient safety, said it was investigating Mrs Pickles' concerns and it took all complaints raised extremely seriously - in particular those relating to a patient death. Mrs Pickles said: ""My family were very, very wrong to place our trust in that company. ""If I hadn't looked through dad's medication, if I had just bundled them up and taken them back to the pharmacy none of this would have come to light."" Mrs Pickles is considering a civil claim.

Sydney Opera House in racing ad furore,"The promotion for ""The Everest"" is to take place on Tuesday A plan to advertise a horse race on the sails of the Sydney Opera House has prompted a large backlash in Australia. The World Heritage-listed site will show the advert on Tuesday, after an order by the New South Wales premier. Critics say the decision defies Sydney Opera House rules by effectively creating a ""billboard"" for the racing and gambling industries. But others, including Prime Minister Scott Morrison, have defended it as positive for the economy and tourism. Since Friday, more than 150,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the opera house to be ""protected"". The Sydney Opera House, inaugurated in 1973, is recognised by the UN as a ""masterpiece of 20th Century architecture"". It was declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 2007. Last week, the Sydney Opera House board rejected the advert for the Everest Cup - arguing it was an ""inappropriate"" commercialisation. ""We have a policy that protects our world heritage status,"" chief executive Louise Herron said on radio 2GB on Friday. But state Premier Gladys Berejiklian overturned the decision, approving a revised advert for a 10-minute projection. The building is celebrated internationally for its design The amended design retains the word ""Everest"" and jockey numbers - elements that had been classified by the opera house as commercial logos. Adding to the controversy, Ms Berejiklian's order came soon after a top-rating radio host,Alan Jones, berated Ms Herron in an interview on 2GB,external. ""If I were Gladys Berejiklian, I would pick up the phone and sack you today,"" said Jones, a supporter of the racing event. A Unesco spokesperson toldThe Guardian,externalit was ""looking into"" the matter, but would not immediately comment. Thousands of people have signalled on social media that they will attend a ""light-based"" protest on Tuesday to disrupt the projection. Among prominent critics, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore called the advert ""blatant commercialisation... for an industry notorious for damaging gambling and animal cruelty"". Australia's escalating gambling addiction Indigenous art lights up Sydney icon However, Ms Berejiklian and Mr Morrison have defended the race's economic benefits. ""This is one of the biggest events of the year... why not put it on the biggest billboard Sydney has?"" Mr Morrison said on Sunday. Others accused Jones of bullying Ms Herron, whilethe Sydney Morning Herald reported,externalthat Ms Berejiklian had handed him and the racing industry ""a massive public relations and promotional victory"". The building's sails are often illuminated for art and cultural events - such as for Vivid Sydney, an annual light festival. The Sydney Opera House featuring indigenous artworks earlier this year It also displayed the logo of the national rugby team in 2015, and cricket's Ashes urn after Australia's series victory earlier this year.

'Grace's dealers have blood on their hands',"This video can not be played 'If it could happen to Grace it could happen to anyone', says Stewart The father of a 13-year-old girl who died after taking ecstasy is warning other parents if it can happen to his daughter, it can happen to anyone. Grace Handling was found dead in a house in Irvine in Ayrshire just after school broke up in June. Her dad Stewart Handling has confirmed for the first time she died after taking ecstasy. He said his daughter was given the drugs by a boy she met three weeks earlier. Mr Handling is concerned the person responsible - if and when they are caught - will serve a minimal jail term after the pain and suffering caused to the family. He told the BBC Scotland news website: ""These 'entrepreneurs' have young people's blood on their hands. ""Grace was vulnerable. ""I just want to know the truth - I want to know what his motives were."" The Handling family has been devastated by the death of Grace Grace, a pupil at Irvine Royal Academy, died in a house in Arran Place on the afternoon of 29 June. The family had to wait 10 weeks for a toxicology report to find out why she died. Mr Handling said: ""It has been painfully slow. We have been in limbo. ""We did anticipate that it was drugs, but about 1% of us hoped it was natural causes."" The report stated that Grace's cause of death was intoxication from MDMA (ecstasy). Her father confirmed: ""She went to this house with a boy. She had met him about three weeks previously and was under his influence. ""For some reason the ecstasy has been offered to her and she was told by the boy she could take three of them."" Grace had just finished for the school holidays and had plans for the summer Mr Handling, his wife Lorraine and Grace's siblings Dani and Matthew are struggling to come to terms with their loss. They believe they are in a position that any other family could find themselves in. As they try to cope with what has happened, Mr Handling wants people to know the kind of girl his daughter was. ""She was amazing and loved by all her pals,"" said Mr Handling. ""About 300 people came to the beach for a balloon release in Grace's memory. ""We are heartbroken about what happened. ""School had just finished, she had plans for the summer. She was going to get a part-time job. She wanted to be a dog handler when she left school. ""She was a great kid. ""Her primary school headmistress summed it up to us when she said: 'If it can happen to Grace, it can happen to anyone.'"" Stewart Handling said he hoped speaking out would help spare other families such heartbreak No charges have been made over the drugs supplied to Grace. A 17-year-old was arrested at the time of the incident and then released. Police said inquiries were ongoing. Mr Handling wants justice but fears it won't be enough. Last week, 18-year-oldThomas Lamont from Glasgow was jailed for a year for selling ecstasy to 14-year-old Zoe Bremnerfrom Glasgow. Zoe Bremner and two friends bought six pills from Thomas Lamont She became ill after taking two of the pills in June last year and was pronounced dead after an ambulance was called to a flat in Glasgow's Cowcaddens. Lamont, from Knightswood,admitted being concerned in the supply of ecstasy. Grace's father said: ""I've spoken to the police and they have warned me that the outcome could be similar to the Lamont case. ""The person who supplied these drugs should be punished and rehabilitated. But he will probably get six months in Polmont and build up his contacts in there."" Grace's death happened just one month after a 17-year-old boy was jailed for supplying ecstasy to six 13-year-olds in Irvine. The boy supplied 'Trip Advisor' drugs to two girls who then shared them with their friends. Three girls and three boys spent the night in hospital after taking them. The Handling family will now wait for the justice system to run its course. Grace's friends are giving the family support and the family's strong faith is helping. Mr Handling doesn't want this to happen to anyone else. And he believes Grace would not want that for her family or anyone else. He said: ""She definitely didn't deserve to die this way but we know where she is now, she is void of pain and trouble.""

'We want to be accepted into the club'Walkers to launch crisp packet recyclingVideoVideoGoat yoga?Entire lead roof stolen from church,"The female winner of the Nobel Prize in Physicshas criticised a senior scientist's commentsthat physics was ""invented and built by men"" as ""silly"". Prof Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, told an audience of young, mainly female, physicists that physics was ""becoming sexist against men"". It didn't go down well. What do other women in science think? Getting into it:I can't remember a time when I didn't want to become a scientist. I was voted ""most likely to become a scientist"" in high school. I was unabashedly geeky and read lots of books. I grew up with no role models in science and was not aware of any famous female scientist. I didn't even meet a scientist until I went to university. What are you working on?I got tired of the abstract and wanted to work on something that would make an impact. I'm now working on a cure for urinary tract infections. It's the most common reason in the UK that an antibiotic is prescribed - and the most common infection in elderly people, yet few studies have been done on it. Currently antibiotics can't reach inside the bladder so we are using nano-technology to create little particles of antibiotics that can go inside the bladder wall. We're hoping clinical trials will start late next year, and a cure could be available quite soon afterwards. Prof Strumia's comments:If you took them at face value, they could be quite demoralising - he is a big-shot professional. Most of what he presented has been debunked and there's been a swift universal rebuttal from the science community of his comments. Greatest achievement:Managing to cling onto my job. Most women I know were forced to leave. There aren't that many jobs and most go to men. Memorable moment:An elderly male professor assumed I was the research nurse when he first met me in a lift. What I've learned:I have been in science for 30 years. I've never seen any evidence that women are not as good as men at science. It's a pervasive view but is simply not true, in my opinion. Hope for the future:I'm just looking forward to that day when we can be accepted into the club on our own terms. I don't know if that will ever happen. Allow Twitter content?

They did inspire me though to do something I loved and to always be asking questions. What are you working on?I work with carbon-based materials for light emitting diodes. Think of the pixels in your TV screen or your mobile phone. We are looking at light, low-cost, high efficiency and flexible displays. Prof Strumia's comments:They are really damaging to the community. Most of us realise that having diversity, having people who think differently to you, is so important to research. If you only have people who look and think the same, you will never progress. Greatest achievement:For me, it was when I was asked to take part in the International Visitor Leadership Programme in the US. There were 48 people representing different countries, and I represented the UK. Memorable moment:The thing is that the challenges women face in the field are less overt than a moment. There are biases when you apply for a new job, with peer reviews... and it affects non-Western scientists too. Sometimes we are facing sexism and we don't even know it. What I've learned:There are challenges, but if we work closely together, we can overcome them. Hope for the future:That we won't have to be excited about one women getting a Nobel Prize in physics and that it instead becomes a yearly occurrence. Seven trailblazing women in science Viewpoint: Everyone must fight sexism in science First woman Physics Nobel winner in 55 years Getting into it:She spent a long eight years getting a zoology degree as she had to work intermittently cleaning houses, delivering pizzas and working in gas stations to pay for her fees. She became a lab technician but the low pay prompted her to return to her studies, and she got a PhD in chemistry at 36. ""I wasn't deeply passionate about science but I was pretty good at it and could earn some decent money."" What are you working on?Research lecturer in the biochemistry department at Oxford University. Prof Strumia's comments:I think he's weak and feeling threatened. In nature, some oak trees kill off small oak trees so they can grow bigger and stronger. Greatest achievement:Helping my students achieve their goals or giving them the courage to do something else. Memorable moment:I'm a middle-of-the-road scientist but I always funded my own research. Every single time I got an award, at least one person would tell me: ""You only got it because you are a woman."" It's, like, thanks! What I've learned:I used to want to be seen just as a scientist but you are prejudged for being a woman before you even walk through the door. They don't mean to do it. Hope for the future:It's very important to listen to each other. I hope we get to the place where people take this seriously.

Walkers to launch crisp packet recyclingVideoVideoGoat yoga?Entire lead roof stolen from church,"Royal Mail intervened when people started posting empty crisp packets back to Walkers Snack firm Walkers has announced a recycling scheme - after Royal Mail begged campaigners not to post empty crisp packets without envelopes. From December, snack fans will be able to post used bags - in envelopes, for free - directly to a recycling company. Campaigner Geraint Ashcroft, wholaunched the petition against Walkers, said it was ""a great first step"". The company said it had been in talks about the scheme since the beginning of the year. It will involve packets being turned into plastic items such as benches, watering cans and plant pots by recycling firm TerraCycle. Marine biology student Emily Stevenson wore a dress made out of crisp packets during her graduation ceremony, to put pressure on Walkers Mr Ashcroft, whose petition against the Leicester-based crisp maker has been signed by more than 330,000 people, said the announcement was ""really exciting"". ""I hope other snack companies get on board,"" he said. ""This is a great first step and makes all the work that's gone into the petition worthwhile."" Royal Mail: Stop posting crisp packets without envelopes What's the real price of getting rid of plastic packaging? Marine plastic: Hundreds of fragments in dead seabirds All the plastic you can and cannot recycle But the firm ""still have a lot to do to meet their pledge of making their packaging fully recyclable, compostable or biodegradable [by 2025]"", Mr Ashcroft added. Walkers crisps are packaged in metallised plastic film, to stop them from going rancid Campaign group 38 Degrees, which previously encouraged people to post their crisp packets back to the company, said it was ""delighted"" to hear about the scheme. ""It's proof that public pressure can shift big companies to do more to prevent waste,"" said executive director David Babbs. ""The public will be watching to make sure that the new recycling scheme isn't just a PR stunt,"" he added. Beach Guardian campaign group founder Emily Stevenson, who wore a dress made of crisp packets during her graduation ceremony, briefly said before catching a flight: ""We spoke, they listened and now they have acted."" Her father and fellow campaigner Rob Stevenson added: ""The public and media really supported her graduation dress and it enabled her to demonstrate her knowledge and passion about the subject. ""Exactly what she suggested on her TV appearances as a short-term solution has now been adopted by PepsiCo so it makes us very happy to see this action. ""We still think that a 2025 target is too long and look forward to hearing more positive steps along the way to the goal being achieved."" Walkers described its partnership with TerraCycle as ""the UK's first nationwide recycling scheme for crisp packets"". Any brand of crisp packets - not just Walkers - will be accepted. People will be encouraged to drop off their packets at one of hundreds of ""public access collection points"" around the country They can also put them in a box or envelope and post them to TerraCycle free of charge The packets will be cleaned, shredded and turned into small pellets which will be converted into plastic items The scheme is due to start in December. Walkers' packets are made from a fusion of plastic and aluminium foil. Crisps are packaged like this by many manufacturers because of their high fat content, which means they can quickly go rancid when exposed to oxygen. Walkers said its packets are technically recyclable, but until now they were not being separated or collected for recycling. Ian Ellington, general manager of Walkers' owner PepsiCo UK, said: ""We share people's concerns about the amount of plastic in our environment and are working on a number of both short and long-term solutions to reduce the impact of our packaging."" Campaigner Geraint Ashcroft met Duncan Gordon from Walkers' owner PepsiCo in August Laure Cucuron, general manager of TerraCycle Europe, said: ""We hope other snack manufacturers will follow suit, by investing in new ways to reduce the amount of packaging that goes to landfill and incineration.""

Key climate report urges deep rapid change,"This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It's the final call, say scientists, in the most extensive warning yet on the risks of rising global temperatures. Theirdramatic report on keeping that rise under 1.5 degrees C,externalsays the world is now completely off track, heading instead towards 3C. Keeping to the preferred target of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels will mean ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". It will be hugely expensive - but the window of opportunity remains open. After three years of research and a week of haggling between scientists and government officials at a meeting in South Korea, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has issued a special report on the impact of global warming of 1.5C. What could be wiped out by temperature rise What is climate change? The critical 33-page Summary for Policymakers certainly bears the hallmarks of difficult negotiations between climate researchers determined to stick to what their studies have shown and political representatives more concerned with economies and living standards. Despite the inevitable compromises, there are some key messages that come through loud and clear. Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger,external ""The first is that limiting warming to 1.5C brings a lot of benefits compared with limiting it to two degrees. It really reduces the impacts of climate change in very important ways,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs the IPCC. ""The second is the unprecedented nature of the changes that are required if we are to limit warming to 1.5C - changes to energy systems, changes to the way we manage land, changes to the way we move around with transportation."" ""Scientists might want to write in capital letters, 'ACT NOW, IDIOTS,' but they need to say that with facts and numbers,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, of Greenpeace, who was an observer at the negotiations. ""And they have."" The researchers have used these facts and numbers to paint a picture of the world with a dangerous fever, caused by humans. We used to think if we could keep warming below two degrees this century, then the changes we would experience would be manageable. Not any more. This new study says that going past 1.5C is dicing with the planet's liveability. And the 1.5C temperature ""guard rail"" could be exceeded in just 12 years, in 2030. We can stay below it - but it will require urgent, large-scale changes from governments and individuals and we will have to invest a massive pile of cash every year, about 2.5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), the value of all goods and services produced, for two decades. Even then, we will still need machines, trees and plants to capture carbon from the air that we can then store deep underground - forever. This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures The report says there must be rapid and significant changes in four big global systems: energy â¢ land use â¢ cities â¢ industry But it adds that the world cannot meet its target without changes by individuals, urging people to: buy less meat, milk, cheese and butter and morelocally sourced seasonal food- and throw less of it away â¢ driveelectric carsbut walk or cycle short distances â¢ taketrains and busesinstead of planes â¢ usevideoconferencinginstead of business travel â¢ use awashing lineinstead of a tumble dryerâ¢ insulatehomes â¢ demandlow carbonin every consumer product Lifestyle changes can make a big difference, said Dr Debra Roberts, the IPCC's other co-chair. ""That's a very empowering message for the individual,"" she said. ""This is not about remote science; it is about where we live and work, and it gives us a cue on how we might be able to contribute to that massive change, because everyone is going to have to be involved."" ""You might say you don't have control over land use, but you do have control over what you eat and that determines land use. ""We can choose the way we move in cities and if we don't have access to public transport - make sure you are electing politicians who provide options around public transport."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Global emissions of CO2 need to decline by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 Renewables are estimated to provide up to 85% of global electricity by 2050 Coal is expected to reduce to close to zero Up to seven million sq km of land will be needed for energy crops (a bit less than the size of Australia) Global net zero emissions by 2050 It won't come cheap. The report says to limit warming to 1.5C, will involve ""annual average investment needs in the energy system of around $2.4 trillion"" between 2016 and 2035. Experts believe this number needs to be put in context. ""There are costs and benefits you have to weigh up,"" said Dr Stephen Cornelius, a former UK IPCC negotiator now with WWF. He says making big emissions cuts in the short term will cost money but be cheaper than paying for carbon dioxide removal later this century. ""The report also talks about the benefits as there is higher economic growth at 1.5 degrees than there is at 2C and you don't have the higher risk of catastrophic impacts at 1.5 that you do at two."" Five things we have learned from the report Fast fashion is harming the planet, MPs say Vietnam's children and the fear of climate change 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The researchers say that if we fail to keep temperature rises below 1.5C, we are in for some significant and dangerous changes to our world. You can kiss coral reefs goodbye, as the report says they would be essentially 100% wiped out at two degrees of warming. Global sea-level will rise about 10cm (4in) more if we let warming go to 2C. That may not sound like much but keeping to 1.5C means that 10 million fewer people would be exposed to the risks of flooding. There are also significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat. ""We are already in the danger zone at one degree of warming,"" said Kaisa Kosonen, from Greenpeace. ""Both poles are melting at an accelerated rate; ancient trees that have been there for hundreds of years are suddenly dying; and the summer we've just experienced - basically, the whole world was on fire."" Analysis by David Shukman, BBC science editor The countdown to the worst of global warming seems to have accelerated. Seriously damaging impacts are no longer on a distant horizon later this century but within a timeframe that appears uncomfortably close. By the same token, the report's ""pathways"" for keeping a lid on temperatures all mean that hard decisions cannot be delayed: a shift away from fossil fuels by mid-century coal phased out far sooner than previously suggested vast tracts of land given over to forests It's mind-bending stuff and some will say it's hopelessly unrealistic, a climate scientists' fantasy. So is any of it plausible? On the one hand, the global economy relies on carbon and key activities depend on it. On the other, wind turbines and solar panels have tumbled in price and more and more countries and states such as California are setting ambitious green targets. Ultimately, politicians will face a difficult choice: persuade their voters that the revolutionary change outlined in the report is urgently needed or ignore it and say the scientists have got it wrong. The idea of keeping the global temperature rise to 1.5 is something very close to the hearts and minds of small island and low-lying states, which fear being inundated with flooding if temperatures go to two degrees. But over the three years that the report was in preparation, more and more scientific evidence has been published showing the benefits of staying close to 1.5C are not just for island nations in the Pacific. ""If you save a small island country, then you save the world,"" said Dr Amjad Abdulla, an IPCC author, from the Maldives. ""Because the report clearly states that no-one is going to be immune. It's about morality - it's about humanity."" Not long at all. But that issue is now in the hands of political leaders. The report says hard decisions can no longer be kicked down the road. If the nations of the world don't act soon, they will have to rely even more on unproven technologies to take carbon out of the air - an expensive and uncertain road. ""They really need to start work immediately. The report is clear that if governments just fulfil the pledges they made in the Paris agreement for 2030, it is not good enough. It will make it very difficult to consider global warming of 1.5C,"" said Prof Jim Skea. ""If they read the report and decide to increase their ambitions and act more immediately, then 1.5C stays within reach - that's the nature of the choice they face."" Campaigners and environmentalists, who have welcomed the report, say there is simply no time left for debate. ""This is the moment where we need to decide"" said Kaisa Kosonen. ""We want to move to clean energy, sustainable lifestyles. We want to protect our forests and species. This is the moment that we will remember; this is the year when the turning point happened.""

Top Chinese official to lead Interpol,"Chinese Vice Minister of Public Security Meng Hongwei was elected at Interpol's general assembly meeting A senior Chinese official has been elected head of global police co-operation agency Interpol. Vice Minister of Public Security Meng Hongwei is the first Chinese citizen to hold the four-year post. His appointment begins immediately. Amnesty International fears the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country. But Mr Meng said he was ready to do ""everything he could towards the cause of policing in the world"". ""We currently face some of the most serious global public security challenges since World War Two,"" Mr Meng said in anInterpol statement,external. His role will see him become president of Interpol's Executive Committee, which provides guidance and direction to the organisation. ""This [appointment] is extraordinarily worrying given China's long-standing practice of trying to use Interpol to arrest dissidents and refugees abroad,"" said Nicholas Bequelin of Amnesty International. ""I think having this particular person in charge seems to conflict with the organisation's mandate to work in the spirit of the universal declaration of human rights."" However, Interpol does not have the power to send officers into countries to arrest individuals, nor issue arrest warrants. It may issue a red notice, an international alert for a wanted person. China has in the past worked through Interpol to bring back people it wants to try. In 2014, Interpol issued red notices for some 100 Chinese corruption suspects who had fled overseas. ""Interpol does not have strong operational power, but it does have considerable influence as the world's largest police organisation,"" Mr Bequelin told the BBC. ""So I think there needs to be very strong scrutiny of the kind of notices that Interpol is going to issue in respect to Chinese citizens."" China will host Interpol's 86th General Assembly in 2017.

"Whittaker a hit with Doctor Who fansAfter her first full episode, most viewers on social media give the new Doctor a big thumbs up.Entertainment & ArtsComments","Jodie Whittaker with (left-right) Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole, Bradley Walsh and Sharon D Clarke The 13th Doctor has landed. Or, rather, crash-landed through a train roof, fully introducing Jodie Whittaker as the first female Time Lord. Whittaker's first episode as the Doctor drew the programme's biggest series launch viewing figures in 10 years. The show saw an average of 8.2 million viewers in its new Sunday teatime slot. After her first episode, many fans took to social media to give Whittaker's portrayal of the Doctor their approval. Whittaker's first outing as Doctor Who, which has moved from a Saturday night slot, saw more people tuning in than for the debuts of her predecessors Peter Capaldi and Matt Smith. This makes the broadcast the most-watched, according to overnight ratings, since David Tennant's 2008 series opener - which garnered an audience of 8.4 million. The first episode featuring a female Doctor was always going to draw a big audience. But last night's figure of 8.2 million has exceeded many people's expectations - the biggest Doctor Who overnight figure in almost five years, and the biggest overnight audience for a Doctor Who series launch in 10 years (the first episode of David Tennant's final series got slightly more with 8.4 million). It's significant not just because, obviously, large numbers of people chose to tune in, but because it underlines with hard stats the overwhelmingly positive social media reaction in declaring the new Doctor Who with Jodie Whittaker as being a huge success. And in an era where catch-up viewing for a show like Doctor Who typically adds millions to an overnight figure, BBC One will be thrilled with how the first episode has performed. Still, the true test will be what happens over the remainder of the series. A (not too big) fall in the figures will still count as big success, as inevitably some will have only viewed out of curiosity over the show's new era. And it's possible, if perhaps unlikely, that it could even perform like BBC drama Bodyguard which started off well and massively increased its overnight viewers as the series progressed. Viewers were quick to take to social media to give their feedback on the show's first female Doctor. Comments ranged from""A breath of fresh air"",externalto""This is everything the show was ever meant to be"",externaland ""Jodie has nailed it at the first attempt,external"". Allow Twitter content?

The West Yorkshire-born former Broadchurch actress was wearing Capaldi's outfit for most of the episode, and addressed her status as the first female Doctor early on. When someone told her she was a woman, she replied: ""Am I? Does it suit me? Oh yeah, I remember. Half an hour ago I was a white-haired Scotsman."" There was also a thinly-veiled message to any sceptical fans when her character said at one point: ""Don't be scared. All this is new to you and new can be scary."" Allow Twitter content?
