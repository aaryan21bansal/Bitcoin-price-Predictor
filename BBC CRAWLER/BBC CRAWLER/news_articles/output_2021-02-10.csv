KPMG boss steps aside after 'stop moaning' comment,"Bill Michael reportedly told consultants to ""stop moaning"" The UK boss of KPMG will step aside while the accountancy giant investigates offensive comments he allegedly made at a meeting on Monday. Bill Michael reportedly told consultants to ""stop moaning"" about the impact of the pandemic and lockdown on people's lives, and to stop ""playing the victim card"". He later apologised, saying the comments did not reflect his beliefs. But KPMG said an ""independent investigation"" had begun. ""Mr Michael has decided to step aside from his duties as chair while the investigation is underway,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We take this matter very seriously and will not comment further while the investigation is ongoing."" According to theFinancial Times,external, which first reported the story, about 500 KPMG staff attended the virtual meeting on 8 February. After Mr Michael's alleged comments, staff reportedly complained on an app used to post comments anonymously during the meeting. Some said they were disappointed by Mr Michael's suggestion that staff needed to stop complaining and work harder, the FT reported. Others were allegedly angry that he had dismissed concerns about potential cuts to staff bonuses, pay and pensions. KPMG boss apologises for 'stop moaning' outburst KPMG ousts head of financial services unit Mr Michael's comments were particularly badly received after a staff poll at the beginning of the meeting, which showed a high percentage of consultants were struggling to cope during the pandemic, the FT said. On Tuesday Mr Michael said: ""I am sorry for the words I used, which did not reflect what I believe in, and I have apologised to my colleagues. ""Looking after the wellbeing of our people and creating a culture where everyone can thrive is of critical importance to me and is at the heart of everything we do as a firm."" Mr Michael, who was hospitalised with Covid-19 last year, has presided over a rocky period at KPMG. The firm has faced scrutiny over its audit of Carillion, the government contractor that collapsed under Â£1bn of debt in 2018. There have also been claims from some staff of a toxic work culture. Last week the company's UK business revealed that Mr Michael was paid Â£1.7m in 2020, down from Â£1.98m in 2019. Sales for the year slumped 4% to Â£2.3bn as the company's clients cut back expenses amid the pandemic.

EU warns NI protocol is 'the only way' post-Brexit,"Preserving post-Brexit trading rules for goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is ""the only way"" to avoid a hard border, warns the EU. European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has written to the UK's Michael Gove, saying ""teething problems"" needed to be resolved. It comes after Mr Gove called for an urgent ""reset"" of the arrangements that came into force on 1 January. Mr Sefcovic and Mr Gove will discuss the issues in London on Thursday. The so-called Northern Ireland Protocol was designed to ensure an open border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Urgent reset needed on NI trade rules - Gove Unionism 'coming together' to oppose NI Protocol DUP protocol petition passes 100,000 signatures Northern Ireland remained in the single market for goods, but the rest of the UK did not - meaning some checks for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland were introduced. Tensions have been high in recent weeks at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries due to the new checks required. Unionists want the protocol to be scrapped because they say it damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK union. But the EU has stood by this part of the post-Brexit trade agreement, finalised in December and coming into force on New Year's Day. Mr Gove told MPs last week that, while the UK did not want to ""ditch"" it, it ""reserved the right"" to do what it must to protect Northern Ireland. In his letter, Mr Sefcovic said he welcomed ""the shared commitment"" between the UK and the EU to work together to solve the difficulties. But he stressed that Brexit had caused problems, adding: ""The UK's withdrawal from the Union, its single market and customs union presents unique and significant challenges for the island of Ireland."" He said the UK and the EU had a shared objective to ""work tirelessly in order to make the protocol work"" because it was ""the only way""  to protect the Good Friday Agreement, and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Sefcovic also said the EU and the UK had a ""common responsibility to diffuse tensions and to ensure the safety of staff on the ground"". Checks at some ports were temporarilysuspended at the beginning of Februaryover ""sinister"" threats made to some border staff who were carrying out checks on goods. The Commission vice-president said it had come to his attention that border control posts were not yet fully operational and a number of consignments were entering Northern Ireland without being properly declared and without proper certificates. But he said he hoped these were ""teething problems"" for which ""swift solutions"" could be found. Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, has raised concerns over the protocol Northern Ireland's First Minister, Arlene Foster, accused Mr Sefcovic of ""putting his head in the sand and his fingers in his ears"" over concerns her party - the DUP -  had raised. She told ITV's Peston that the call to strengthen the protocol, despite the problems raised by unionists, was an ""incredible state of affairs"". Ms Foster said the protocol was not only creating problems for businesses, but consumers too having problems with parcel deliveries, adding: ""You can't even get a pot plant from Great Britain.""

PM wrongly says Bridgend will be battery centre,"Boris Johnson was speaking during Prime Minister's Questions The prime minister misspoke when he claimed Bridgend would become a great centre of battery manufacturing, the UK government has confirmed. Boris Johnson has been asked to apologise for his comments in the Commons on Wednesday. Labour's Nia Griffith said they were ""deeply unfair"" when the town was ""reeling from theclosure of Ford"". The UK government said it is working with investors on battery manufacturing plans across the United Kingdom. Plaid Cymru called for a retraction for the comments, made in response to a question from Plaid's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts. No plans have been announced for a battery factory in Bridgend. Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Battery factory planned for Wales moved to England End of Ford in Bridgend 'hard to take' In December, it was announced that a Britishvolt electric car battery factory that would create 3,000 jobs wasgoing to be built near Blyth, Northumberland, rather than St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan as had been previously planned. That announcement came days after a decision from another company, Ineos, tobuild its 4x4 vehicle in France rather than Bridgend- just 13 miles away from St Athan. Britishvolt had previously signed a memorandum of understanding with the Welsh Government in July 2020 to build the plant in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. This video can not be played Liz Saville Roberts addressing Boris Johnson in Prime Minister's Questions Speaking at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson had said Bridgend was ""going to be the one of the great centres of battery manufacturing in this country if not the world"". A video of Mr Johnson's comments was later tweeted by the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. The UK government later confirmed to BBC Wales that Mr Johnson had misspoken when he made the comments. Speaking later, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: ""Whether intentional or negligent, the Prime Minister's answer misled the people of Wales, while the Secretary of State for Wales threw his support behind him."" ""We are inured to his abuse of facts. But for Mr Hart to broadcast false information about investment in his own country - the interests of which he has a duty to defend - is reprehensible. I expect a retraction and apology."" Shadow Welsh Secretary Ms Griffiths said: ""It is deeply unfair for the prime minister to be so loose with his words when Bridgend has faced so many set backs on his watch. The community is still reeling from the closure of Ford and the loss of the Ineos project to France."" Peter Hughes, Unite Wales Regional Secretary said: ""The prime minister's comments today regarding Bridgend are news to everyone in Wales."" A UK government spokeswoman said they would ""continue to work with investors"" to progress plans for UK battery manufacturing. ""We are investing heavily to expand the UK's supply chain for cleaner vehicles, while working with our auto industry to ensure it remains competitive for years to come. ""As part of the prime minister's Ten Point Plan, we recently announced nearly Â£500m funding - as part of a wider commitment of up to Â£1 billion - to support the electrification of vehicles and their supply chains, including developing Gigafactories across all parts of the UK. ""We will continue to work with investors to progress plans to mass manufacture the batteries needed for the next generation of electric vehicles."" Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Battery factory planned for Wales moved to England End of Ford and Bridgend marriage 'hard to take' LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Everton beat Spurs in nine-goal FA Cup thriller,"This video can not be played FA Cup highlights: Everton 5-4 Tottenham Hotspur Everton reached the FA Cup quarter-finals after edging out Tottenham Hotspur in a nine-goal classic at Goodison Park. A magnificent contest swung in both teams' favour before Carlo Ancelotti's hosts - showing huge reserves of resolve and fitness - finally struck the decisive blow when substitute Bernard fired home in the seventh minute of extra time. Spurs dominated the early exchanges and were rewarded when Davinson Sanchez headed in from a corner in the third minute before Everton sprang to life with a three-goal burst inside eight minutes before half-time. Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who later went off with what looked like a groin injury, levelled nine minutes before the break with a shot Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris should have saved, before Richarlison's fine low drive and Gylfi Sigurdsson's penalty looked to have put Everton in command. But Erik Lamela scored in the closing seconds of the first half to put Spurs back in contention and Sanchez pounced again after more chaos at a corner to drag Jose Mourinho's side level just before the hour. Mourinho had introduced Harry Kane as a substitute just before that equaliser but it was Everton who edged ahead again as more brilliant individual work by Richarlison restored their advantage after 68 minutes - but it was inevitable Spurs' main man would have a say. It came with seven minutes of normal time left as Everton were undone by the old firm, Son Heung-min's cross the perfect invitation for Kane to score with a far-post header. All the momentum appeared to be with Spurs but Everton are now a side to be reckoned with under Ancelotti and Bernard cashed in after more good work by Sigurdsson - who claimed three assists - to beat Lloris with an angled finish. There was still time for Spurs to respond but Everton saw out an outstanding victory in relative comfort, certainly given what had gone before, to secure a place in the last eight. Everything you need to know about FA Cup quarter-final draw Reaction and analysis from all of Wednesday's FA Cup fifth-round ties Lawro's FA Cup fifth-round predictions v Radio 1's Jack Saunders Football Daily podcast: Everton edge Tottenham in nine-goal thriller This video can not be played The good, the bad, the Gylfi - Sigurdsson pivotal to  Everton win Ancelotti, the manager who has seen it all, was the calmest man amid the mayhem inside Goodison Park - celebrating what turned out to be the winner from Bernard by simply blowing on his cup of coffee while his backroom staff reacted wildly. This was perhaps the Italian's finest moment since coming to Everton, his side - without the injured James Rodriguez, Andre Gomes and Jordan Pickford - showing remarkable energy, spirit and a capacity to recover from adversity to outlast their visitors. Ancelotti will be concerned about some of Everton's questionable defending - especially from corners - and the injury to Calvert-Lewin, but he will also be justifiably proud of how they fought back to win when, at several stages, the tide seemed to be turning against them. The sight of Calvert-Lewin going off, Spurs danger man Kane having just come on and losing a two-goal lead as the hour mark approached could have undermined Everton but they carried a threat throughout, with Richarlison back to his menacing best after a season where he has not been in peak form. In midfield, both Tom Davies and Abdoulaye Doucoure were outstanding, the latter demonstrating remarkable fitness and still running non-stop until the final seconds, while his young team-mate continues to flourish under the sympathetic guidance of Ancelotti. Sigurdsson, who scored calmly from the spot after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg tripped Calvert-Lewin, was also a huge creative force and contributed hugely to Everton's attacking threat. Everton are seeking their first trophy since they won the FA Cup in 1995 - they beat Spurs in the semi-finals on that occasion - and this victory will raise hopes not just of further progress in the competition, but for their long-term development under of one of Europe's most decorated managers. The scenes of elation at the final whistle were understandable and fully deserved. Everton gave everything and were rewarded. This video can not be played Analysis: Pundits praise 'brave' Tottenham display Mourinho would have hoped to build on Sunday's Premier League win against West Bromwich Albion after three successive defeats - but he was left to survey the end of Spurs' FA Cup ambitions after a dramatic night on freezing Merseyside. It all looked good for Spurs for the first half-hour as they had a deserved lead, but the manner in which they capitulated for those crucial minutes to concede three goals just before the break, and then continued to look vulnerable, meant this was a very damaging night. Spurs, after criticism of Mourinho's perceived conservative approach in recent weeks, were positive and played with attacking intent throughout with some sparkling passing but were let down by dreadful defending and another expensive error from Lloris, who should have saved Calvert-Lewin's equaliser but only helped a powerful drive that was straight at him into the net. Mourinho did not risk Kane from the start after his return from an ankle injury at the weekend, but when he was introduced it was with Spurs looking the more likely winners. He will be particularly frustrated with his porous defence, given his stock-in-trade is meant to be a rearguard that gives nothing away. This looked nothing like a Mourinho team in a defensive context. This was the first time a team managed by Mourinho has conceded five goals since his Chelsea side lost 5-3 to his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham in January 2015. And another sub-plot to this FA Cup exit was the absence of Gareth Bale, who Mourinho said had complained of a muscular issue so was not even on the bench. Bale's return to Spurs on loan from Real Madrid, hailed as a coup when he arrived, has turned into a huge anti-climax. It will continue to  be a distraction if results do not improve. This was a night where there was very little in the way of good news for Mourinho and Spurs - and next they face a visit to rampant Manchester City on Saturday. Everton assistant boss Duncan Ferguson to BBC Sport:""It was an exciting game. Tottenham started better than us and got the lead but we got ourselves back into the game. ""At 3-1 you're thinking 'get to half-time at 3-1' and then they score to put us on the back foot. Exciting game, fantastic. ""It's 25 years since we won the FA Cup. It would be great to get to the final. It keeps your season going. We want to do well in the Premier League but the FA Cup is the one we want."" Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho, speaking to BBC Sport:""If you say it was fantastic, it was fantastic. I'm not a neutral. ""When you score four goals, you have to win. The way we played, we should win comfortably. Attacking football and defensive mistakes. ""The players gave everything. I have to admit for some of them it was not easy because you play so well and one, two, three mistakes and you're losing 3-1. ""OK, I take positives. Amazing to watch."" This was the highest scoring FA Cup game between two top-flight teams since February 1961 when Sheffield Wednesday won 7-2 against Man Utd. In what is the 981st match of his managerial career, this is the first time a Jose Mourinho side has both scored and conceded at least four goals in a single game. Mourinho has seen his team concede five goals in a game for the first time since January 2015, when his Chelsea side were beaten 5-3 by Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs in the Premier League. There were just seven minutes and 26 seconds between Everton's first and third goals against Tottenham. While it was the first time a Mourinho led side conceded three first-half goals since Man Utd away at Brighton in August 2018. Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his 50th goal in all competitions for Everton (159th app), with 26 of his goals for the Toffees coming under Carlo Ancelotti. Gylfi Sigurdsson became the first Everton player to assist three goals in a single match since Steven Pienaar against Fulham in a Premier League tie in April 2012. Nine of the 12 goals in all competitions scored by Colombian players for Premier League sides this season have come at Goodison Park (James Rodriguez - four, Yerry Mina - three, Davinson Sanchez - three). Harry Kane has now scored 209 goals in 318 appearances in all competitions for Tottenham, making him the second highest scorer in the club's history behind only Jimmy Greaves (266 goals in 379 apps). Son Heung-min has provided 12 assists in all competitions this season - his most in a single campaign for Spurs.

Singer leads 'I Love You' graffiti backlash,"The romantic gesture - overlaid with neon lights in 2008 - had formed part of the city's skyline since 2001 Musicians have reacted angrily to the removal of a graffiti marriage proposal painted almost 20 years ago. The 'I Love You Will U Marry Me' message had remained on Sheffield's Park Hill flats since 2001. Singer Richard Hawley, a well-known son of the Steel City, said he was ""really angry"" and called for the symbol of his hometown to be reinstated. Pulp drummer Nick Banks and singer Yungblud also said they were ""dismayed"" and ""heartbroken"". The graffiti was painted by Jason Lowe in a bid to woo his then-girlfriend and was later immortalised in neon lights as part of a marketing campaign. Developers Urban Splash said the message - on a bridge linking two blocks of flats -had been removed to allow for ""essential repair work"". Hawley told BBC Radio 4: ""Like all graffiti, it's sometimes just some kind of nuisance, but it symbolises a state of mind in Sheffield. ""When I first found out about this I was, probably like a lot of Sheffielders, really, really angry."" The story of the graffiti bridge Hawley to co-write musical set in flats Read more Yorkshire stories L-to-R: Yungblud, Richard Hawley and Nick Banks have all spoken out about the graffiti removal Hawley,who wrote songs for a 2019 musical about the Park Hill estate, added: ""I just hope and would urge Urban Splash to put at least the fluorescent signs back. ""The people of Sheffield love it and that's the bottom line really."" Banks said the graffiti had become ""almost a message to Sheffield itself, overlooking the city"". ""Put the neon sign back, yes, but it kind of loses something without the graffiti underneath."" Park Hill flats, which have undergone extensive renovations, overlook Sheffield city centre Meanwhile, Yungblud, real name Dominic Harrison, from Doncaster, tweeted to say he was ""heartbroken"". He described the graffiti as ""a quirky act of romance"" in his song I Love You, Will You Marry Me. Surriya Falconer, speaking on behalf of the developers, said there were ""some structural issues"" which meant the words had to be removed but there were plans to replace them. Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys sported a t-shirt bearing an image of the graffiti during gigs Although Mr Lowe and his girlfriend never married, his romantic gesture has formed part of the city's skyline since, with many considering it an ""iconic"" piece of history. In aBBC radio documentary, Mr Lowe explained how he braved his fear of heights to make a public show of proposing to Ms Middleton, who he had had been dating for a year. He said: ""You used to be able to see it from the Odeon cinema. ""I took her there, she thought she was going to see a film and I said: 'I've got something to show you'. I told her to look up and she read it. ""She said 'yeah'. She thought I was mad."" The pair split up three months later and Ms Middleton died in 2007 from cancer.

Travel chief scorns 'puerile' holiday plan warning,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to stop making summer holiday plans has been branded ""puerile and nonsensical"" by a senior travel industry professional. ""We're talking about the end of May or June, which is a long way off,"" said Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO). Mr Shapps said there was too much uncertainty because of Covid. But Ms Ockwell said booking breaks gave hope to holidaymakers and the industry. ""It's something for people to look forward to and to keep travel companies going,"" she told the BBC. Earlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer. ""It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson later said it was ""just too early for people to be certain about what we'll be able to do this summer"". He added that he understood ""why people want to make plans now, but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient"". Too soon to book holiday, minister warns Mr Shapps' comments have been seen by many in the travel sector as dealing a blow to hopes of a swift recovery for tourism. For Ms Ockwell, they are symptomatic of a government that has failed to listen to her and her colleagues. ""It's highly frustrating. The government doesn't compare notes with anyone in the travel industry,"" she said. ""They could save getting a lot of egg on their faces if they did."" AITO represents about 120 specialist and independent tour operators in the UK. Ms Ockwell said the industry understood ""the scale of the challenges"" facing the government over coronavirus, but added that tourism brought great benefits to the UK economy and was in need of sector-specific help. Can I book a holiday in the UK? ""Holidays bring in a lot of money, holidays employ a lot of people and they're good for us,"" she said. ""We just want to be allowed to trade. That's all we're asking,"" she added. ""We're not forcing people to make bookings. We want people to be allowed to make their own common-sense judgements."" Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is ""optimistic"" British people will be allowed to travel from May onwards Other travel industry figures have echoed Ms Ockwell's dismay. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us."" And trade organisation Abta said waiting until the UK's vaccination programme was completed before allowing people to travel abroad meant ""we'll lose another summer season to the pandemic"". Several big travel companies, including Tui and Ryanair, have said theyexpect to see a strong rebound in bookings this summer. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC he remained ""optimistic"" that British people would be allowed to travel from May onwards. ""Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,"" he added. Don't book holiday yet, government warns UK holidays: What are the rules?

"Â£3.5bn for unsafe cladding 'too little, too late'","Campaigners have said the government's promise of Â£3.5bn of extra funding to remove unsafe cladding from England's high-rises is ""too little, too late"". The government said flammable materials would be removed from buildings over 18m high ""at no cost to residents"". But Labour said the ""arbitrary"" height limit could result in financial ruin for many in lower blocks, who would be offered loans to make their home safe. After 2017's Grenfell disaster, many tower blocks were found to be unsafe. This meant many thousands of flat-owners have since faced huge bills for fire-safety improvements, brought in after the devastating tower block fire when flames spread via combustible cladding, killing 72 people. The Grenfell United campaign group said the latest measures were ""too little, too late"", and it needed the mess dealt with ""once and for all"". ""Residents living in unsafe homes will go to bed tonight worrying if their building will qualify or be left out once again. And bereaved and survivors of Grenfell will lay awake fearful that what happened to us could still happen again,"" the group said. In the Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also announced: Owners of flats in lower-rise blocks would have access to loans to replace unsafe cladding - and would never have to pay more than Â£50 a month for them A new levy on developers of future high rises to cover the cost of grants A separate new tax on residential property development in the UK from 2022 The Â£3.5bn comes on top of Â£1.6bn in funding that was announced for the removal of unsafe cladding last year. Ministers have come under growing pressure to increase the pot as leaseholders have been hit by building improvement costs and soaring insurance costs. Some say they have effectively become trapped in their own homes - unable to sell until the work is carried out, yet in danger of bankrupting themselves to meet the costs. Stephen Squires, who lives in a 22-storey block in Manchester, told the PA Media news agency he and others were ""still stuck in limbo"", even after the announcement. The government had consistently failed to acknowledge the issues were far wider reaching than cladding, he said, and they still did not know whether fire safety defects would be covered by the funding. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding company 'knew of fire risk' 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' Mr Jenrick told MPs that leaseholders in high-rise buildings above 18m, or with six storeys or more, would face no costs for cladding works. He said the risk was ""significantly lower"" for lower-rise blocks of flats. However, for anyone living with dangerous cladding in such flats, a loan scheme would be set up to protect leaseholders so none of them would pay more than Â£50 a month for the removal of unsafe cladding. This video can not be played Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick: ""End the cladding scandal in a way that is fair and generous to leaseholders"" It ""cannot be right the costs fall solely on tax payers"", he said, adding that the government would develop a levy targeted at developers seeking to build certain high-rise buildings in England. He also said a new tax for the UK residential property sector would be introduced from next year, to raise Â£2bn over a decade and help pay for the removal of cladding. Mr Jenrick described the action as an ""unprecedented intervention"" without which building owners would simply pass on the costs of remediation work to leaseholders. ""That would risk punishing those who have worked hard, who have bought their own home, but through no fault of their own have found themselves caught in an absolutely invidious situation,"" he said. The Home Builders Federation, a trade association for private sector homebuilders, said it supported ""sensible"" solutions for recouping costs and was looking forward to working with the government on an ""equitable"" tax that did not ""threaten housing supply"". Matt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat-owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block. Their Birmingham city centre building measures 18.2 metres - so just qualifies for the funding promised today. Matt, a 26-year-old video producer, says although he is relieved, he feels ""incredibly sorry"" for those whose homes don't meet that threshold. ""[That] could have been ours if our building was one brick lower. That's literally the difference we're talking about,"" he says. He says leaseholders feel ""betrayed"" because the government has said ""multiple times"" they should not pay. ""Then all of a sudden today it's like, 'right, leaseholders are going to pay Â£50 a month,'"" he says. The couple say they have been hit with a Â£50,000 bill after their block failed an external wall fire review. That covers not only the removal of unsafe cladding, but also works relating to other things found in the review like missing fire cavity barriers. Matt is now concerned the government fund only covers the cladding removal. ""There are still costs in there which are going to cost thousands and thousands of pounds, which is money we don't have,"" he says. Around 100 miles away in east London, solicitor Peter Tolson lives in a building that also qualifies for the extra cash, but says the announcement ""doesn't make a huge amount of difference"" to him and his fellow residents. He helps run his block's management company, and says they began the initial process to prove their eligibility for the fund last spring. But they haven't received funds, he says. ""We're just trying to pass every barrier and get access to the funds, which we're finding harder and harder,"" he adds. Conservative MP Stephen McPartland, a critic of the government's handling of the cladding crisis, said Mr Jenrick's announcement did not go far enough and the issue was much bigger than the matter of cladding. ""The support he has offered does not help most people because people who've got excessive insurance premiums, fire safety defects - that's where the real costs are,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""Leaseholders are the innocent parties in this. Many people were in primary school when these buildings were constructed and they're now being hit with bills that will be bankrupting them."" Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, called the proposals ""an injustice"" that would ""pile financial misery"" on homeowners. She said there were many questions left unanswered, including on ""skyrocketing"" insurance costs, homes potentially remaining ""unsellable"", and the amount leaseholders would be expected to pay. The ""arbitrary 18m-height limit"" could ""mean the difference between a safe home and financial ruin"", she said. Labour wants an independent taskforce to be established to take the matter out of politicians' hands and ensure funds are distributed fairly. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous building materials By Sarah Corker, BBC consumer affairs correspondent The question of who should pay to fix fire safety faults - government, developers, building owners or leaseholders - is at the heart of resolving this crisis. While cladding campaigners have welcomed the extra government funding, they say an additional Â£3.5bn is not enough given the scale of the problems. To force the building industry to contribute, the government will introduce a levy on developers which build future high-rises. A move broadly welcomed, but it will take years to build up a pot of money. What started as a cladding scandal has become a much wider building safety crisis. In the wake of the Grenfell tower tragedy, safety inspections on thousands of high rise blocks have exposed not just dangerous cladding but other fire safety problems including defective insulation, missing fire breaks and timber balconies. Currently there is no government money to fix non-cladding faults. Rebecca Fairclough, from Manchester Cladiators, which represents 70 tower blocks with fire safety issues in the Greater Manchester area, said funding was needed to cover all building safety issues, not just cladding. She said she was disappointed loans were the only solution on offer to those in buildings under 18m high. ""Millions of residents continue to live in dangerous buildings, facing impossible bills and with their mental health deteriorating daily,"" she said. Natasha Letchford, a campaigner for the End Our Cladding Scandal group, said the funding was far short of the estimated Â£15bn bill to fix all the issues. She said as long as there were outstanding bills on properties, they would be worthless and people simply would not want to buy them. The government said the spending funded by the UK-wide tax would be subject to theBarnett formula.This means Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding, which can be spent as the devolved administrations see fit, including on building safety.

Extra Â£3.5bn promised to tackle unsafe cladding,"Campaigners have said the government's promise of Â£3.5bn of extra funding to remove unsafe cladding from England's high-rises is ""too little, too late"".

Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous building materials By Sarah Corker, BBC consumer affairs correspondent The question of who should pay to fix fire safety faults - government, developers, building owners or leaseholders - is at the heart of resolving this crisis. While cladding campaigners have welcomed the extra government funding, they say an additional Â£3.5bn is not enough given the scale of the problems. To force the building industry to contribute, the government will introduce a levy on developers which build future high-rises. A move broadly welcomed, but it will take years to build up a pot of money. What started as a cladding scandal has become a much wider building safety crisis. In the wake of the Grenfell tower tragedy, safety inspections on thousands of high rise blocks have exposed not just dangerous cladding but other fire safety problems including defective insulation, missing fire breaks and timber balconies. Currently there is no government money to fix non-cladding faults. Rebecca Fairclough, from Manchester Cladiators, which represents 70 tower blocks with fire safety issues in the Greater Manchester area, said funding was needed to cover all building safety issues, not just cladding. She said she was disappointed loans were the only solution on offer to those in buildings under 18m high. ""Millions of residents continue to live in dangerous buildings, facing impossible bills and with their mental health deteriorating daily,"" she said. Natasha Letchford, a campaigner for the End Our Cladding Scandal group, said the funding was far short of the estimated Â£15bn bill to fix all the issues. She said as long as there were outstanding bills on properties, they would be worthless and people simply would not want to buy them. The government said the spending funded by the UK-wide tax would be subject to theBarnett formula.This means Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding, which can be spent as the devolved administrations see fit, including on building safety.

Prof Jonathan Van-Tam made the comments while answering audience questions about vaccines and Covid misinformation on the BBC's News Channel and Asian Network earlier. He said he was worried ""the uptake in minority ethnic groups is not going to be as rapid or as high"" compared to the white population. However, he did stress that vaccine uptake has been very high among people who have been offered it so far. He also expressed concern about fake news about vaccines. Read more John Loch thanked staff for making his vaccination 'simple and straighforward' More than one million people have received their first dose of the Covid vaccine in Scotland. The Scottish government said the milestone was reached on Wednesday and the vaccination programme was now moving ""at pace"". Ministers say they are on track to inoculate everyone in the top priority groups - including everyone aged over 70 - by 15 February First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier described the recent rate of vaccinations in the country -in spite of severe weather- as ""nothing short of extraordinary"". Retired businessman John Loch was among those being immunised at the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow as the landmark figure was reached. The 69-year-old from Bearsden says: ""It is exciting to be a part of thismilestone moment."" During his Covid briefing earlier, PM Boris Johnsonurged the two million peopleyet to take up their offer of a Covid jab in the UK to ""come forward"" this week. About 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated in the US so far, and there have been ""no red flags"" in their reactions to it, Anthony Fauci has said. Dr Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told a White House press briefing that pregnant women and children hadn't been included in the original clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. However, he said clinical trials including pregnant women are either already under way or are planned for the near future. Dr Fauci said the vaccination of pregnant women was being monitored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Verona Thomas decided to have the vaccine There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests. Just under half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who have not had a vaccine,according to the research by the National Care Forum. The survey also confirms staff hesitancy is a significant factor in the slow uptake. Verona Thomas, a unit manager at Saffron House nursing home in Bristol, says she had initial concerns - but worrying about what would happen to loved ones if she caught the virus changed her mind. ""I work with quite vulnerable adults...So it was a case of doing my best to protect them,"" she said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just under 24 hours
until the Lunar New Year for people in China (12 February) and during this
period it is common for people in the country to gather for family meals, or
large banquet gatherings. This year, Chinaâs official
Peopleâs Daily newspaper is urging people not to eat wild animals during the
holidays. It issharing posters,externalthat
show the silhouette of animals including snakes, hedgehogs and turtles, and
telling people to avoid contact with them. âDo not illegally hunt, trade
or eat wild animals,â it says. The campaign, which uses the hashtag #DontEatWildAnimalsDuringSpringFestival, has so far been seen by more than 9.5
million people. The posters have echoes ofones that circulated nationally last year at this time,external, back when the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan drew international attention. At the time, there was evident nervousness in the country about animal consumption being a possible reason for Covid-19. In May, the original epicentre of the coronavirus, Wuhan,banned eating and hunting wild animals,externalamid these fears. And over the last year, other regions havestepped up regulations to ban the consumption of animals. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have also been updating âChinaâs law on animal epidemic preventionâ to limit contact between animals and humans that could lead to disease. In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

Travel chief scorns 'puerile' holiday plan warningTransport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to pause summer holiday plans gets a rough reception.,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to stop making summer holiday plans has been branded ""puerile and nonsensical"" by a senior travel industry professional. ""We're talking about the end of May or June, which is a long way off,"" said Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO). Mr Shapps said there was too much uncertainty because of Covid. But Ms Ockwell said booking breaks gave hope to holidaymakers and the industry. ""It's something for people to look forward to and to keep travel companies going,"" she told the BBC. Earlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer. ""It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson later said it was ""just too early for people to be certain about what we'll be able to do this summer"". He added that he understood ""why people want to make plans now, but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient"". Too soon to book holiday, minister warns Mr Shapps' comments have been seen by many in the travel sector as dealing a blow to hopes of a swift recovery for tourism. For Ms Ockwell, they are symptomatic of a government that has failed to listen to her and her colleagues. ""It's highly frustrating. The government doesn't compare notes with anyone in the travel industry,"" she said. ""They could save getting a lot of egg on their faces if they did."" AITO represents about 120 specialist and independent tour operators in the UK. Ms Ockwell said the industry understood ""the scale of the challenges"" facing the government over coronavirus, but added that tourism brought great benefits to the UK economy and was in need of sector-specific help. Can I book a holiday in the UK? ""Holidays bring in a lot of money, holidays employ a lot of people and they're good for us,"" she said. ""We just want to be allowed to trade. That's all we're asking,"" she added. ""We're not forcing people to make bookings. We want people to be allowed to make their own common-sense judgements."" Ryanair's Michael O'Leary is ""optimistic"" British people will be allowed to travel from May onwards Other travel industry figures have echoed Ms Ockwell's dismay. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us."" And trade organisation Abta said waiting until the UK's vaccination programme was completed before allowing people to travel abroad meant ""we'll lose another summer season to the pandemic"". Several big travel companies, including Tui and Ryanair, have said theyexpect to see a strong rebound in bookings this summer. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC he remained ""optimistic"" that British people would be allowed to travel from May onwards. ""Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,"" he added. Don't book holiday yet, government warns UK holidays: What are the rules?

Man cleared over celebrity raids 'sleeping in car',"Alexandru Stan says he was evicted from his home in Harrow while he was in HMP Wormwood Scrubs A man cleared of being involved in Â£26m raids on the luxury homes of three celebrities in west London says he is now sleeping in a car. Alexandru Stan was acquitted of conspiring to burgle the homes following a high-profile trial. Watches and jewellery belonging to Frank Lampard and Tamara Ecclestone were among the items taken during a series of burglaries in December 2019. Mr Stan says the case has left him homeless and he has ""lost everything"". A legal expert told the BBC that there was nothing in place to help people who are acquitted of a crime following a trial. ""This is the system working,"" said Dr Hannah Quirk, a reader in criminal law at King's College London. ""It is disgraceful and it has been dubbed the innocence tax."" Tamara Ecclestone, her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter Sophia had left for Lapland on the morning of the raid at their palatial home Speaking to BBC London, Mr Stan said he had not even heard of Ms Ecclestone until he was arrested by police last year. Mr Stan spent nearly six months in custody at Wormwood Scrubs Prison. While on remand he made friends with his co-accused Sorin Marcovici. Both were released on 8 Januaryfollowing the not guilty verdicts. ""We were scared we would be convicted because we were Romanian,"" Mr Stan said. ""They [the prosecution] made out we were thieves and terrorised London. ""I knew I had done nothing and I thought I had been framed. If they found me guilty of the burglaries, I risked 14 years in prison."" A Cartier bangle worth Â£80,000 was reportedly taken in the raid on Tamara Ecclestone's home Isleworth Crown Court heard how the raids at the homes of Mr Lampard, Ms Ecclestone and the family home of duty-free tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha netted ""big money"" for a team of burglars. ""Fabulous jewellery"" was stolen, the majority of which has never been recovered. In one burglary alone, a Â£25m haul of cash and jewellery was taken from Ms Ecclestone's Kensington home. This happened only hours after she left London for a holiday in Lapland with her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter, on 13 December 2019. Three days before, burglars had ransacked the family home of the late Leicester City owner Mr Vichai. The first in the series of raids was at the home of Mr Lampard and his TV presenter wife Christine. About Â£60,000 worth of jewellery was taken when they were out on 1 December. Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash in 2018 Mr Stan, Mr Marcovici, Maria Mester and her son Emil Bogdan-Savastru were said to be the ""support cast"" to a team of burglars, who cannot be named for legal reasons. All four were unanimously found not guilty by a jury of 11, much to the relief of Mr Stan. ""I thought I was dreaming,"" he said. ""I have been through hell and no-one can ever know what it is like to lose your home, lose your place at university and everything."" Jurors were shown an image from Maria Mester's Facebook account, in which she is said to be wearing Ms Ecclestone's necklace Mr Stan first moved to London in June 2019 and worked as a porter and waiter. In July 2020 he enrolled at the University of Suffolk to study for a business degree, but said he lost this place and was evicted from his home in Harrow while in prison on remand. The 49-year-old says he is struggling to get his life back on track since being released from prison. Sorin Marcovici says his life has been ""really bad"" since he was arrested He added: ""Mr Marcovici took me in and we sleep a couple of nights with his friends or sleep in his car. ""It is hard to find a place in the pandemic, people are scared to put you in their home. We have nothing."" Mr Stan said Mr Marcovici was helping him with clothing and food and lets him sleep in his car at night. The raids on the west London homes of the celebrities all happened in December 2019 Mr Marcovici, who has a room in a shared house, said his life was ""really bad"" and he could not find a job because of lockdown. He said: ""No-one helps us. Every morning Mr Stan tries to do something for each of us, but no-one is helping. ""How they have left us on the streets in a pandemic - I have no words."" Nigel Evans said a trial over alleged sexual offences cost him Â£130,000 in legal fees Dr Quirk, who used to work at the Criminal Case Review Commission, said that a high-profile victim of the so-called innocence tax was the Conservative MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of all charges at a trial in 2014. ""He wascharged with rapeand sexual offences and ended up having touse his life savings."" Dr Quirk told the BBC that when convicted criminals finish a jail sentence, they deal with the Probation Service which helps them acclimatise to life on the outside. But for those who are acquitted, ""there is no involvement with the criminal justice system any more"". She added: ""It is a real problem."" Two men accused of burgling the three homes are due to go on trial at Isleworth Crown Court in August.

Ministers say they are on track to inoculate everyone in the top priority groups - including everyone aged over 70 - by 15 February First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier described the recent rate of vaccinations in the country -in spite of severe weather- as ""nothing short of extraordinary"". Retired businessman John Loch was among those being immunised at the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow as the landmark figure was reached. The 69-year-old from Bearsden says: ""It is exciting to be a part of thismilestone moment."" During his Covid briefing earlier, PM Boris Johnsonurged the two million peopleyet to take up their offer of a Covid jab in the UK to ""come forward"" this week. About 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated in the US so far, and there have been ""no red flags"" in their reactions to it, Anthony Fauci has said. Dr Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told a White House press briefing that pregnant women and children hadn't been included in the original clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. However, he said clinical trials including pregnant women are either already under way or are planned for the near future. Dr Fauci said the vaccination of pregnant women was being monitored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Verona Thomas decided to have the vaccine There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests. Just under half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who have not had a vaccine,according to the research by the National Care Forum. The survey also confirms staff hesitancy is a significant factor in the slow uptake. Verona Thomas, a unit manager at Saffron House nursing home in Bristol, says she had initial concerns - but worrying about what would happen to loved ones if she caught the virus changed her mind. ""I work with quite vulnerable adults...So it was a case of doing my best to protect them,"" she said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just under 24 hours
until the Lunar New Year for people in China (12 February) and during this
period it is common for people in the country to gather for family meals, or
large banquet gatherings. This year, Chinaâs official
Peopleâs Daily newspaper is urging people not to eat wild animals during the
holidays. It issharing posters,externalthat
show the silhouette of animals including snakes, hedgehogs and turtles, and
telling people to avoid contact with them. âDo not illegally hunt, trade
or eat wild animals,â it says. The campaign, which uses the hashtag #DontEatWildAnimalsDuringSpringFestival, has so far been seen by more than 9.5
million people. The posters have echoes ofones that circulated nationally last year at this time,external, back when the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan drew international attention. At the time, there was evident nervousness in the country about animal consumption being a possible reason for Covid-19. In May, the original epicentre of the coronavirus, Wuhan,banned eating and hunting wild animals,externalamid these fears. And over the last year, other regions havestepped up regulations to ban the consumption of animals. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have also been updating âChinaâs law on animal epidemic preventionâ to limit contact between animals and humans that could lead to disease. In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

PM mistakenly says Bridgend will be battery centre,"Boris Johnson was speaking during Prime Minister's Questions The prime minister misspoke when he claimed Bridgend would become a great centre of battery manufacturing, the UK government has confirmed. Boris Johnson has been asked to apologise for his comments in the Commons on Wednesday. Labour's Nia Griffith said they were ""deeply unfair"" when the town was ""reeling from theclosure of Ford"". The UK government said it is working with investors on battery manufacturing plans across the United Kingdom. Plaid Cymru called for a retraction for the comments, made in response to a question from Plaid's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts. No plans have been announced for a battery factory in Bridgend. Scrapped 4x4 plant plans 'not down to Brexit' Battery factory planned for Wales moved to England End of Ford in Bridgend 'hard to take' In December, it was announced that a Britishvolt electric car battery factory that would create 3,000 jobs wasgoing to be built near Blyth, Northumberland, rather than St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan as had been previously planned. That announcement came days after a decision from another company, Ineos, tobuild its 4x4 vehicle in France rather than Bridgend- just 13 miles away from St Athan. Britishvolt had previously signed a memorandum of understanding with the Welsh Government in July 2020 to build the plant in St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. This video can not be played Liz Saville Roberts addressing Boris Johnson in Prime Minister's Questions Speaking at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson had said Bridgend was ""going to be the one of the great centres of battery manufacturing in this country if not the world"". A video of Mr Johnson's comments was later tweeted by the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. The UK government later confirmed to BBC Wales that Mr Johnson had misspoken when he made the comments. Speaking later, Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts said: ""Whether intentional or negligent, the Prime Minister's answer misled the people of Wales, while the Secretary of State for Wales threw his support behind him."" ""We are inured to his abuse of facts. But for Mr Hart to broadcast false information about investment in his own country - the interests of which he has a duty to defend - is reprehensible. I expect a retraction and apology."" Shadow Welsh Secretary Ms Griffiths said: ""It is deeply unfair for the prime minister to be so loose with his words when Bridgend has faced so many set backs on his watch. The community is still reeling from the closure of Ford and the loss of the Ineos project to France."" Peter Hughes, Unite Wales Regional Secretary said: ""The prime minister's comments today regarding Bridgend are news to everyone in Wales."" A UK government spokeswoman said they would ""continue to work with investors"" to progress plans for UK battery manufacturing. ""We are investing heavily to expand the UK's supply chain for cleaner vehicles, while working with our auto industry to ensure it remains competitive for years to come. ""As part of the prime minister's Ten Point Plan, we recently announced nearly Â£500m funding - as part of a wider commitment of up to Â£1 billion - to support the electrification of vehicles and their supply chains, including developing Gigafactories across all parts of the UK.

Millions watched clips of the Handforth Parish Council meeting, which featured insults and members being kicked out.

Grenfell cladding company 'knew of fire risk',"A fire destroyed Grenfell Tower in June 2017, with the loss of 72 lives The firm that sold the cladding used at Grenfell Tower knew about the risk of fires in 2013, but continued to offer a flammable version of it. The public inquiry has been shown an internal email sent by a sales manager at Arconic warning of the risk of high-rise fires in the United Arab Emirates. Deborah French also forwarded an email from a competitor company that was switching to sell only fire-resistant cladding as a result. Seventy-two peopledied at Grenfell. On Wednesday the inquiry has focused on what Arconic told its customers, who were fabricating cladding systems for high-rise blocks around the UK. On 1 May 2013, the BBC reported on ""towering inferno"" fearsfollowing a series of fires involving cladding in the Gulf. Deborah French sent a link to the article and also forwarded an email from Richard Geater, a rival salesperson for another company, Alucobond, who was warning his customers of the risks. Mr Geater wrote that using cladding known as aluminium composite material (ACM), made partly from plastic, created a situation like ""a chimney which transports the fire from bottom to top or vice versa within the shortest time. ""The perils of using cheap ACM alternatives have been exposed,"" he said. Arconic did not follow its competitor's lead. Its most popular type of cladding in the UK was Reynobond PE, with its flammable plastic layer, used on dozens of buildings including Grenfell Tower. Grenfell firm sold flammable cladding 'by default' Lies, sham tests & buck-passing - Grenfell's year of evidence The Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast On 13 May 2013, Deborah French wrote to her customers saying that by working closely with them, ""we are able to follow what type of project is being designed/developed and then offer the right... specification"". However, since the fire, Arconic has insisted it had no control over the type of materials it sold to customers, taking the position that it was for architects to decide whether they met fire safety regulations. In a later witness statement, Ms French adopted this position, saying that in her email to customers she had simply meant the company's technical support department could offer advice if needed. Richard Millett, the inquiry's lead counsel, questioned her about why, if the email was false, she had sent it in the first place. He suggested the email might have been correct and that she had changed her account since the fire, despite being content to say at the time that Arconic could control the types of cladding used. The degree to which Arconic ""pushed"" flammable cladding for use on tall buildings is central to the question of who might be to blame for the fire. The timing of Ms French's emails is relevant. She was negotiating with the Grenfell Tower project for the sale of 3,000 sq m of cladding. She admitted to the inquiry that at the time she knew this was a high-rise residential housing project. By this point, Arconic had already changed its marketing materials after receiving poor fire test results for the Reynobond cladding sheets. But a technical manager at Arconic said customers would only be informed ""when asking about the fire performance"" of the product. The change was made a year earlier, in 2012, as designers were starting to consider materials for Grenfell Tower. Despite ""bad behaviour"" in fires, the company believed the product could still be sold in countries with less restrictive regulations. These included the UK where it was the standard type of cladding the company sold. The UK sales manager involved in the discussions explained to the inquiry that she could not remember being told about the change to the specification, or it being discussed at meetings. Arconic sold raw aluminium cladding sheets, which were formed into ""cassettes"" - rectangular folded panels - for fixing on the outside of buildings. In 2010 Arconic published a specification for its cladding, which contained a fire classification of class B out of a possible A1 to F. But in 2011 the ""cassette"" version of the product was put through a standard European fire test where it achieved a poor result, classified E out of a possible A1 to F. The test went so badly it had to be stopped early, with the panel on fire. As a result in 2012, the flammable version of the cladding was removed entirely from the specification sheet published by Arconic, despite the fact that it continued to be the main type sold in the UK. Only a less common fire-retardant version was included in the information. The BBC previously revealed thatpoor test results were withheld from the British Board of AgrÃ©mentwhich issues independent safety certificates relied on by construction firms and architects. A witness statement provided by a French technical manager, Claude Wehrle, said: ""The intention was for customers to be informed of the position when asking about the fire performance of the cassette variant of the product."" However, Arconic continued to sell the product to construction projects involving tall buildings. In a meeting note, Mr Wehrle wrote that ""for the moment, even if we know the PE (polyethylene material) in cassette has a bad behaviour exposed to fire, we can still work with national regulations who are not as restrictive"". Arconic's UK sales manager, Deborah French, was asked by the inquiry's lead counsel: ""Do we take it... that if the customers didn't ask, they didn't get told?"" ""Yes,"" she answered, adding that they would not have known unless they had been told. The cassette version of the cladding, formed from flammable materials, has been shown to pose a particular risk in fires on tall buildings and was the type eventually used at Grenfell Tower.

Man cleared of celebrity heists 'sleeping in car',"Alexandru Stan says he was evicted from his home in Harrow while he was in HMP Wormwood Scrubs A man cleared of being involved in Â£26m raids on the luxury homes of three celebrities in west London says he is now sleeping in a car. Alexandru Stan was acquitted of conspiring to burgle the homes following a high-profile trial. Watches and jewellery belonging to Frank Lampard and Tamara Ecclestone were among the items taken during a series of burglaries in December 2019. Mr Stan says the case has left him homeless and he has ""lost everything"". A legal expert told the BBC that there was nothing in place to help people who are acquitted of a crime following a trial. ""This is the system working,"" said Dr Hannah Quirk, a reader in criminal law at King's College London. ""It is disgraceful and it has been dubbed the innocence tax."" Tamara Ecclestone, her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter Sophia had left for Lapland on the morning of the raid at their palatial home Speaking to BBC London, Mr Stan said he had not even heard of Ms Ecclestone until he was arrested by police last year. Mr Stan spent nearly six months in custody at Wormwood Scrubs Prison. While on remand he made friends with his co-accused Sorin Marcovici. Both were released on 8 Januaryfollowing the not guilty verdicts. ""We were scared we would be convicted because we were Romanian,"" Mr Stan said. ""They [the prosecution] made out we were thieves and terrorised London. ""I knew I had done nothing and I thought I had been framed. If they found me guilty of the burglaries, I risked 14 years in prison."" A Cartier bangle worth Â£80,000 was reportedly taken in the raid on Tamara Ecclestone's home Isleworth Crown Court heard how the raids at the homes of Mr Lampard, Ms Ecclestone and the family home of duty-free tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha netted ""big money"" for a team of burglars. ""Fabulous jewellery"" was stolen, the majority of which has never been recovered. In one burglary alone, a Â£25m haul of cash and jewellery was taken from Ms Ecclestone's Kensington home. This happened only hours after she left London for a holiday in Lapland with her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter, on 13 December 2019. Three days before, burglars had ransacked the family home of the late Leicester City owner Mr Vichai. The first in the series of raids was at the home of Mr Lampard and his TV presenter wife Christine. About Â£60,000 worth of jewellery was taken when they were out on 1 December. Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha died in a helicopter crash in 2018 Mr Stan, Mr Marcovici, Maria Mester and her son Emil Bogdan-Savastru were said to be the ""support cast"" to a team of burglars, who cannot be named for legal reasons. All four were unanimously found not guilty by a jury of 11, much to the relief of Mr Stan. ""I thought I was dreaming,"" he said. ""I have been through hell and no-one can ever know what it is like to lose your home, lose your place at university and everything."" Jurors were shown an image from Maria Mester's Facebook account, in which she is said to be wearing Ms Ecclestone's necklace Mr Stan first moved to London in June 2019 and worked as a porter and waiter. In July 2020 he enrolled at the University of Suffolk to study for a business degree, but said he lost this place and was evicted from his home in Harrow while in prison on remand. The 49-year-old says he is struggling to get his life back on track since being released from prison. Sorin Marcovici says his life has been ""really bad"" since he was arrested He added: ""Mr Marcovici took me in and we sleep a couple of nights with his friends or sleep in his car. ""It is hard to find a place in the pandemic, people are scared to put you in their home. We have nothing."" Mr Stan said Mr Marcovici was helping him with clothing and food and lets him sleep in his car at night. The raids on the west London homes of the celebrities all happened in December 2019 Mr Marcovici, who has a room in a shared house, said his life was ""really bad"" and he could not find a job because of lockdown. He said: ""No-one helps us. Every morning Mr Stan tries to do something for each of us, but no-one is helping. ""How they have left us on the streets in a pandemic - I have no words."" Nigel Evans said a trial over alleged sexual offences cost him Â£130,000 in legal fees Dr Quirk, who used to work at the Criminal Case Review Commission, said that a high-profile victim of the so-called innocence tax was the Conservative MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of all charges at a trial in 2014. ""He wascharged with rapeand sexual offences and ended up having touse his life savings."" Dr Quirk told the BBC that when convicted criminals finish a jail sentence, they deal with the Probation Service which helps them acclimatise to life on the outside. But for those who are acquitted, ""there is no involvement with the criminal justice system any more"". She added: ""It is a real problem."" Two men accused of burgling the three homes are due to go on trial at Isleworth Crown Court in August.

A video of Rod Ponton appearing as a cat during a virtual court session has been viewed millions of times online. ""I did not know that Zoom could turn me into a cat. I did not know that cat Zoom could turn me into an internet celebrity, but it all happened in just a matter of hours,"" he told the BBC. He said he is trying to ""roll with it"". Mr Ponton said he was using his secretary's computer when the filter popped up, replacing his face with that of a white kitten with large, concerned eyes. As his assistant tries to rectify the issue, he can be heard saying: ""I'm here live, I'm not a cat."" ""When I got on Zoom everything seemed fine - my picture popped up, I was in the waiting room with the judge.

Trio fined for 150-mile drive to 'photograph view',"The three men were questioned by officers in Little Stretton, south Shropshire Three men have been fined for making a 300-mile (483km) round trip from London to a Shropshire beauty spot to ""take a photograph of the view"". West Mercia Police said the trio had not even managed to snap a picture as their phone batteries had died. They were stopped and questioned in Little Stretton, south Shropshire, having driven from Kensington. The trio were given Covid fixed penalty notices with police saying it would be the ""only souvenir"" of the trip.

UK Government urged to reduce staff in DVLA HQ,"A Covid outbreak was declared at the DVLA's contact centre in December Staff at the DVLA headquarters, which has seen more than 500 Covid cases since September, are to be balloted for strike action. The PCS union said the DVLA had been ""forcing"" staff to go into the Swansea office despite the infections. It comes after MP Geraint Davies called for the UK government to reduce the number of workers at the centre. Boris Johnson said at Prime Minister's Questions all staff who can work from home, were working from home. The DVLA rejected claims it is ""an unsafe place to work"". The ballot will be open from 18 February until 11 March, the union said. DVLA 'must follow Welsh Covid rules in Wales' DVLA staff 'scared to enter workplace' Both Mr Davies and the PCS Union said 250 people were working on the site last March, but that number is now in the thousands. It was announced last month thatone member of staff had died with coronavirus. PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""It is a scandal that DVLA have insisted over 2,000 staff members come into work every day, despite having the biggest outbreak of Covid in an office workplace within the UK."" He added management had shown a ""cruel indifference"" to staff's concerns. The coronavirus outbreakwas declared at the offices in the Llansamlet area of Swansea in December after 352 cases in the space of four months. The total number of Covid cases at the site now stands at 526, according to Mr Davies. Speaking at Prime Minister's questions, Labour MP for Swansea West, Mr Davies, said thousands were now working at the site ""facing a more infectious and widespread disease"". ""Yesterday 90 people were sent home following the latest outbreak of coronavirus just before the weekend,"" he told the Commons. ""Given that BT are on standby to install home secure technology to allow home working, will the prime minister meet with me and the unionahead of the strike ballot next week,externalso that workplace numbers can be reduced until the vaccine is rolled out to keep people safe and avoid an unnecessary strike?"" The DVLA later said only 37 staff had been sent home on Tuesday after one staff member had tested positive. It added this had not been declared an outbreak by Public Health Wales. The prime minister responded that ""to the best of my knowledge"" out of the workforce of 6,000 there were ""thankfully"" only nine cases of Covid now and three of those individuals were currently working from home. Mr Johnson said that the DVLA was pursuing a working from home strategy. He added the UK government was ""rolling out lateral flow tests"" but said the ""long term solution"" was vaccinating people. A DVLA spokesperson said: ""We care deeply about the safety of DVLA staff and we fully reject the claims made that DVLA is an unsafe place to work. Rigorous protocols are in place to ensure a Covid-secure workplace. ""We are disappointed that the trade union feel that industrial action is justified, not only because of the current low rate of positive cases among DVLA staff, but also because we are actively working with PCS on further steps that can be taken to keep staff safe on site."" 500 Covid cases at DVLA a 'scandal', union says UK government 'working flat-out at DVLA site' DVLA 'must follow Welsh Covid rules in Wales' Video, 00:01:23DVLA 'must follow Welsh Covid rules in Wales' LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Cladding 'taking over our lives',"Pippa Hamshaw says the costs and worry of fire-safety regulations have left her in tears Thousands of flat owners are facing large bills for fire-safety improvements demanded following the Grenfell disaster. Labour says they're not getting enough help, but the government insists it's taking appropriate action. ""The building should never have been signed off in the first place,"" says Pippa Hamshaw. ""The flats are all valued at nothing. Mortgage companies won't offer mortgages on any of them."" Pippa, 31, is also expecting a Â£70,000 bill for her share of renovations on her block of flats in Leeds. ""I go from being really angry with the situation to being in tears,"" she tells BBC 5 live's Naga Munchetty. ""It's taken over my life."" Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Pippa is one of thousands of people facing large payments for safety renovations required following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in west London, in which 72 people died when flames spread via combustible exterior cladding. Many fire-safety concerns have come up in inspections since then, but those not relating to cladding - such as missing fire breaks and flammable balconies - are not covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. And a report by MPs has said that the Â£1.6bn the government has allocated for removing dangerous cladding is insufficient - with the real cost nearer Â£15bn. This video can not be played Starmer: ""Three and a half years after Grenfell, most people would not believe this is the situation we are in"" Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders like Pippa, whose monthly service charge has risen from Â£240 to Â£630. ""I just feel totally let down by the whole system,"" she says. ""The government could do something right now... I feel like everyone's winning bar the leaseholder."" After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. ""I don't feel any safer,"" says Pippa. ""I don't see how they are going to be much use. They literally have to go and knock on every door of the flats to tell you that the building is on fire. We've got 10 floors in my property. Are they really going to be able to knock on every door?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is accusing ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" to the problems exposed by Grenfell and has called for a national cladding taskforce, modelled on a similar body set up in Australia. He argues this would ""drive forward"" work on funding the removal of dangerous cladding, while pursuing ""those responsible for the cladding scandal"", protecting residents from costs and ensuring they can sell their properties. Builders remove cladding from a block in Greater Manchester Jenny Garrett, who bought her flat in Sheffield in 2019, says that, when the survey was carried out, ""absolutely nothing"" wrong was found. Only later did she find out the building's cladding was flammable. ""The whole situation is quite overwhelming because there's the issue of feeling unsafe,"" she says. ""On top of that, there's the issue about the financial pressure and worrying about what's coming down the road."" Residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Flat owners in one Cheshire development had their combined premiums rise from Â£34,000 in 2018 to more than Â£500,000. Some are now paying almost Â£2,000 a year for building insurance. Meanwhile,data released last month shows,externalthat cladding removal and repair work has been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. The Association of British Insurers says the slow pace of getting buildings fixed means means high policy prices reflect risks accurately. ""For the last two or three years, a lot of our lives have been completely ruined,"" says Giles, a flat owner from Manchester. ""We're living in fear and limbo. All we've been told so far is the government wants us to pay sums running into the tens of thousands of pounds, simply to make our homes safe. ""It's all got even worse over the last year, because we're trapped in our homes for 23 hours a day during the pandemic. We almost feel safer outside than inside."" People attended a commemoration to mark the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in 2020 ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible... we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman says. ""Leaseholders shouldn't have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didn't cause - and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible,"" he adds. ""The Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course."" The House of Commons backed a Labour motion calling for further action on cladding on Monday by 263 votes to none. The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain and the result is not binding on the government. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Need some assistance with home-schooling?

Body to ban dangerous materials,"Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it was ""clear that action is required now"" A new regulator will be established with powers to ban the use of dangerous building materials, following evidence at the Grenfell Tower Inquiry that manufacturers covered up safety issues. It will be able to prosecute companies that flout rules, the government said. Ministers have called revelations at the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire ""deeply disturbing"". They have also ordered a review of product testing because of ""abuses"" in the testing system. The findings of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, which led to the deaths of 72 people in June 2017, are not expected for at least another year. But Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it was ""already clear that action is required now"". In evidence given late last year, the behaviour of several companies was under close scrutiny - with damaging admissions about their activities in the years before the fire. Lies, sham tests & buck-passing - Grenfell's year of evidence 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' Kingspan, which makes insulation panels, revealed it sold a combustible product despite failed fire tests. The Grenfell Inquiry heard that Celotex, another insulation maker, effectively ""rigged"" a test to keep its product on the market. The BBC also revealed thatcladding manufacturer Arconic failed to tell British standards bodies about poor resultsfrom tests it carried out on the aluminium panels used at Grenfell. All three products have been found to have contributed to the fire. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the new regulator would be able to conduct its own tests. It will operate within the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS), which wasset up by the government to help manage large-scale product recalls and identify risks to consumers. The OPSS will be expanded and given Â£10m in funding to establish the new function. The regulator will work with the newly created Building Safety Regulator and Trading Standards to ""encourage and enforce compliance"". Mr Jenrick said:â¯ ""The Grenfell Inquiry has heard deeply disturbing allegations of malpractice by some construction product manufacturers and their employees, and of the weaknesses of the present product testing regime. ""We are establishing a national regulator to address these concerns and a review into testing to ensure our national approach is fit for purpose. ""We will continue to listen to the evidence emerging in the inquiry, and await the judge's ultimate recommendation - but it is already clear that action is required now and that is what we are doing."" The Grenfell Tower fire revealeddeep-seated problems with the building regulations and product testing. Ministers say they are pushing through a ""fundamental overhaul of regulatory systems"". But thousands of people currently live in buildings constructed with materials which pose a risk.  They have to pay for extra fire safety measures until cladding or insulation is stripped off. Seventy-two people died as a result of the fire Giles Grover, from the national campaigning coalition End Our Cladding Scandal said the announcement was not enough. ""It will help people in new homes but it doesn't help those of us with Kingspan K15 insulation wrapped around our flats.  The only way that the government's going to make sure our buildings are safe is to put up the money now."" The government has made Â£1.6 billion available for the work, and there has been steady progress on public housing. But for private sector buildings it has barely begun.  The overall cost of the crisis could to rise to Â£15 billion. Kingspan and Celotex have both admitted failings in the testing of their products. Celotex said it discovered discrepancies in the tests and some staff had been disciplined.

About 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated in the US so far, and there have been ""no red flags"" in their reactions to it, Anthony Fauci has said. Dr Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told a White House press briefing that pregnant women and children hadn't been included in the original clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. However, he said clinical trials including pregnant women are either already under way or are planned for the near future. Dr Fauci said the vaccination of pregnant women was being monitored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Verona Thomas decided to have the vaccine There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests. Just under half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who have not had a vaccine,according to the research by the National Care Forum. The survey also confirms staff hesitancy is a significant factor in the slow uptake. Verona Thomas, a unit manager at Saffron House nursing home in Bristol, says she had initial concerns - but worrying about what would happen to loved ones if she caught the virus changed her mind.

until the Lunar New Year for people in China (12 February) and during this
period it is common for people in the country to gather for family meals, or
large banquet gatherings. This year, Chinaâs official
Peopleâs Daily newspaper is urging people not to eat wild animals during the
holidays. It issharing posters,externalthat
show the silhouette of animals including snakes, hedgehogs and turtles, and
telling people to avoid contact with them. âDo not illegally hunt, trade
or eat wild animals,â it says. The campaign, which uses the hashtag #DontEatWildAnimalsDuringSpringFestival, has so far been seen by more than 9.5
million people. The posters have echoes ofones that circulated nationally last year at this time,external, back when the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan drew international attention. At the time, there was evident nervousness in the country about animal consumption being a possible reason for Covid-19. In May, the original epicentre of the coronavirus, Wuhan,banned eating and hunting wild animals,externalamid these fears. And over the last year, other regions havestepped up regulations to ban the consumption of animals. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have also been updating âChinaâs law on animal epidemic preventionâ to limit contact between animals and humans that could lead to disease. In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

Extra Â£3.5bn promised to tackle unsafe claddingResidents say it is not enough and would still leave many in dangerous buildings with impossible bills.UK,"Campaigners have said the government's promise of Â£3.5bn of extra funding to remove unsafe cladding from England's high-rises is ""too little, too late"". The government said flammable materials would be removed from buildings over 18m high ""at no cost to residents"". But Labour said the ""arbitrary"" height limit could result in financial ruin for many in lower blocks, who would be offered loans to make their home safe. After 2017's Grenfell disaster, many tower blocks were found to be unsafe. This meant many thousands of flat-owners have since faced huge bills for fire-safety improvements, brought in after the devastating tower block fire when flames spread via combustible cladding, killing 72 people. The Grenfell United campaign group said the latest measures were ""too little, too late"", and it needed the mess dealt with ""once and for all"". ""Residents living in unsafe homes will go to bed tonight worrying if their building will qualify or be left out once again. And bereaved and survivors of Grenfell will lay awake fearful that what happened to us could still happen again,"" the group said. In the Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick also announced: Owners of flats in lower-rise blocks would have access to loans to replace unsafe cladding - and would never have to pay more than Â£50 a month for them A new levy on developers of future high rises to cover the cost of grants A separate new tax on residential property development in the UK from 2022 The Â£3.5bn comes on top of Â£1.6bn in funding that was announced for the removal of unsafe cladding last year. Ministers have come under growing pressure to increase the pot as leaseholders have been hit by building improvement costs and soaring insurance costs. Some say they have effectively become trapped in their own homes - unable to sell until the work is carried out, yet in danger of bankrupting themselves to meet the costs. Stephen Squires, who lives in a 22-storey block in Manchester, told the PA Media news agency he and others were ""still stuck in limbo"", even after the announcement. The government had consistently failed to acknowledge the issues were far wider reaching than cladding, he said, and they still did not know whether fire safety defects would be covered by the funding. What makes cladding unsafe and what are your rights? Grenfell cladding company 'knew of fire risk' 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' Mr Jenrick told MPs that leaseholders in high-rise buildings above 18m, or with six storeys or more, would face no costs for cladding works. He said the risk was ""significantly lower"" for lower-rise blocks of flats. However, for anyone living with dangerous cladding in such flats, a loan scheme would be set up to protect leaseholders so none of them would pay more than Â£50 a month for the removal of unsafe cladding. This video can not be played Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick: ""End the cladding scandal in a way that is fair and generous to leaseholders"" It ""cannot be right the costs fall solely on tax payers"", he said, adding that the government would develop a levy targeted at developers seeking to build certain high-rise buildings in England. He also said a new tax for the UK residential property sector would be introduced from next year, to raise Â£2bn over a decade and help pay for the removal of cladding. Mr Jenrick described the action as an ""unprecedented intervention"" without which building owners would simply pass on the costs of remediation work to leaseholders. ""That would risk punishing those who have worked hard, who have bought their own home, but through no fault of their own have found themselves caught in an absolutely invidious situation,"" he said. The Home Builders Federation, a trade association for private sector homebuilders, said it supported ""sensible"" solutions for recouping costs and was looking forward to working with the government on an ""equitable"" tax that did not ""threaten housing supply"". Matt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat-owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block. Their Birmingham city centre building measures 18.2 metres - so just qualifies for the funding promised today. Matt, a 26-year-old video producer, says although he is relieved, he feels ""incredibly sorry"" for those whose homes don't meet that threshold. ""[That] could have been ours if our building was one brick lower. That's literally the difference we're talking about,"" he says. He says leaseholders feel ""betrayed"" because the government has said ""multiple times"" they should not pay. ""Then all of a sudden today it's like, 'right, leaseholders are going to pay Â£50 a month,'"" he says. The couple say they have been hit with a Â£50,000 bill after their block failed an external wall fire review. That covers not only the removal of unsafe cladding, but also works relating to other things found in the review like missing fire cavity barriers. Matt is now concerned the government fund only covers the cladding removal. ""There are still costs in there which are going to cost thousands and thousands of pounds, which is money we don't have,"" he says. Around 100 miles away in east London, solicitor Peter Tolson lives in a building that also qualifies for the extra cash, but says the announcement ""doesn't make a huge amount of difference"" to him and his fellow residents. He helps run his block's management company, and says they began the initial process to prove their eligibility for the fund last spring. But they haven't received funds, he says. ""We're just trying to pass every barrier and get access to the funds, which we're finding harder and harder,"" he adds. Conservative MP Stephen McPartland, a critic of the government's handling of the cladding crisis, said Mr Jenrick's announcement did not go far enough and the issue was much bigger than the matter of cladding. ""The support he has offered does not help most people because people who've got excessive insurance premiums, fire safety defects - that's where the real costs are,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""Leaseholders are the innocent parties in this. Many people were in primary school when these buildings were constructed and they're now being hit with bills that will be bankrupting them."" Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, called the proposals ""an injustice"" that would ""pile financial misery"" on homeowners. She said there were many questions left unanswered, including on ""skyrocketing"" insurance costs, homes potentially remaining ""unsellable"", and the amount leaseholders would be expected to pay. The ""arbitrary 18m-height limit"" could ""mean the difference between a safe home and financial ruin"", she said. Labour wants an independent taskforce to be established to take the matter out of politicians' hands and ensure funds are distributed fairly. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous building materials By Sarah Corker, BBC consumer affairs correspondent The question of who should pay to fix fire safety faults - government, developers, building owners or leaseholders - is at the heart of resolving this crisis. While cladding campaigners have welcomed the extra government funding, they say an additional Â£3.5bn is not enough given the scale of the problems. To force the building industry to contribute, the government will introduce a levy on developers which build future high-rises. A move broadly welcomed, but it will take years to build up a pot of money. What started as a cladding scandal has become a much wider building safety crisis. In the wake of the Grenfell tower tragedy, safety inspections on thousands of high rise blocks have exposed not just dangerous cladding but other fire safety problems including defective insulation, missing fire breaks and timber balconies. Currently there is no government money to fix non-cladding faults. Rebecca Fairclough, from Manchester Cladiators, which represents 70 tower blocks with fire safety issues in the Greater Manchester area, said funding was needed to cover all building safety issues, not just cladding. She said she was disappointed loans were the only solution on offer to those in buildings under 18m high. ""Millions of residents continue to live in dangerous buildings, facing impossible bills and with their mental health deteriorating daily,"" she said. Natasha Letchford, a campaigner for the End Our Cladding Scandal group, said the funding was far short of the estimated Â£15bn bill to fix all the issues. She said as long as there were outstanding bills on properties, they would be worthless and people simply would not want to buy them. The government said the spending funded by the UK-wide tax would be subject to theBarnett formula.This means Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding, which can be spent as the devolved administrations see fit, including on building safety.

In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

EU Commission chief admits vaccine failures,"This video can not be played In February the head of the European Commission insisted on Europe's ""fair share"" of vaccines The EU was late to authorise Covid-19 vaccines and ""still not where we want to be"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said. She also acknowledged the EU had been overconfident about production targets being met amid delays at factories. The Commission chief has come under fire for the EU's slow vaccine rollout. There is anger that the bloc has fallen behind countries like the UK, where more than 12 million people have already received the jab. But Mrs von der Leyen was adamant that ordering vaccines collectively on behalf of member states was ""the right thing to do"". Meanwhile pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca has said it will join forces with German company IDT Biologika to produce more vaccines for Europe. Producers of vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs have postponed delivery of some of the EU's order because of capacity and supply issues. Vaccine tensions stoke German criticism of EU chief What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How Serbia soared ahead in Covid vaccinations This was Mrs von der Leyen's first public acceptance of criticism,external. Last week, she told German paper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung that ""a country on its own can be a speedboat, the EU is more like a tanker"". ""We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production,"" the Commission president told the European Parliament, ""and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time."" She also noted that questions would have to be answered about what went wrong. However, Mrs von der Leyen maintained that a joint EU response had been the correct decision in dealing with the pandemic: ""I can't even imagine if a few big players had rushed to it and the others went empty-handed. ""In economic terms it would have been nonsense and it would have been I think the end of our community."" She also defended the time taken to approve vaccines, which she described as ""an essential investment to establish confidence and security"". The Commission president said she ""deeply"" regretted a threat made by the EU last month to restrict the flow of vaccines passing between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""But in the end we got it right and I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace in Northern Ireland."" By Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, Brussels The EU's vaccination programme has become an important political test for the European Commission, which took over responsibility for the rollout from individual member states. It has also become a critical test of the personal standing of Ursula von der Leyen. She has now acknowledged failings and admitting underestimating the difficulties of mass production. But this was not by any means a straightforward apology. Mrs von der Leyen said it was right for the EU to have acted together, not in competition. The experiences of Serbia, which is not an EU member state, and Hungary, which is, point to a possible solution to vaccine shortages in Europe. Both have turned to suppliers of Russian and Chinese vaccines to supplement supplies from Western pharmaceutical companies. Right-wing Danish MEP Peter Kofod complained that the EU was ""treading water"" while other countries such as the UK, US and Israel made big strides in vaccinating their populations. Addressing Mrs von der Leyen directly, left-wing French MEP Manon Aubry asked: ""How could the European Commission accept to just lie down when dealing with the pharma companies?"" But there was support for the EU's response, too. Spanish centre-right Euro MP Esteban GonzÃ¡lez Pons said if it had not been for the Commission's decision to centralise the purchase of vaccines, his country and others would not have received their consignments ""because of a lack of political clout and budget"". ""Not everything was perfect in the last weeks and the last months,"" said Manfred Weber, the chairman of the centre-right EPP group of MEPs. ""The key decisions were right.""

Labour backbenchers blast free school meals snub,"A budget amendment would have seen free school meals extended to families receiving Universal Credit More children in Wales should get free school meals, backbench Labour Senedd members have said. A Plaid Cymru amendment to next year's draft budget was voted down in a debate in the Senedd on Tuesday. It would have seen free school meals extended to all pupils whose families receive Universal Credit, whichFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has resisted. But Labour Member of the Senedd (MS) Alun Davies said the Welsh Government was on the ""wrong side"" of the debate. Ministers should ""commit to looking at"" the proposal ""and looking at how much it's going to cost and where the money is going to come from"", Labour MS Mike Hedges added. Who gets free school meals in Wales? Families who don't qualify for free school meals 'struggling' Marcus Rashford backs free school meals extension in Wales The amendment said the extra costs could be paid for out of funds the Welsh Government has set aside to combat coronavirus. Mr Davies said the amendment was ""broadly right"", adding: ""The government is on the wrong side of this argument and I hope that the government will recognise that and I hope that the government will, in returning to the chamber, recognise its position is neither sustainable nor credible on that particular matter."" Rebecca Evans says any proposal should be within current ""budgetary constraints"" Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said: ""I hope those colleagues who have talked on this issue today will be supporting our budget when we come to the final budget. ""I will say it's important that we continue to explore all the options available to us and seek to build on the actions that we've already taken. ""But I do recognise also that it has to be within the context of the budgetary constraints that we are under."" Using money earmarked for fighting the pandemic involved ""trade-offs"" that could leave less for the NHS or local councils, Ms Evans argued. ""These are the serious decisions and serious choices we have to make when we are calling for additional funding for parts of the budget,"" she added. The Welsh Government has extended free school meals during the holidays until Easter 2022. Footballer Marcus Rashford welcomed it as ""a great move"" when it was announced in December.

Sainsburyâs takes on Aldi in supermarket price war,"The supermarket price-war has edged up a notch after Sainsbury's followed Tesco's Aldi price-match scheme. The major supermarkets are fighting the German discount chains for business and price is their chosen battleground. Tesco launched its Aldi price-match in March 2020 and extended it to around 500 products in September. Sainsbury's - the UK's second-largest supermarket - has now joined the fray, saying: ""It will help shoppers who are working hard to balance budgets"". It has promised to slash the cost of hundreds of essential groceries to match Aldi. Prices will be cut on 250 popular items including meat, chicken, fresh fruit and vegetables and dairy. The price match is the first part of chief executive Simon Roberts' plan announced in November to put food back at the heart of the business. ""We are making great progress delivering our Food First plan and I'm determined that in these tough times, we do even more to help our customers save money,"" he said. The grocery chains are under political pressure with rumours circulating that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is considering a levy on them for making ""excess profits"" during the pandemic. But while people are buying more food to eat at home, the supermarkets say they are making less money. Mr Roberts has said that that the pandemic has led to customers switching from its most profitable channel - convenience stores - to its least profitable - online shopping. Supermarkets make less money out of online shopping because of delivery and higher staffing costs. Tesco calls for online stores to pay sales tax Sainsbury's festive boost despite smaller turkeys The latest price-war will hit profit margins already squeezed to between 2-4%. But on the other hand, the move to online has benefited the traditional supermarkets as Aldi's smaller online offering has left it unable to take advantage of the booming demand for home deliveries. In fact Aldi has seen its sales growth fall behind some of its rivals during the pandemic. Figures from retail analysts Kantar for the 12 weeks to 24 January 24 revealed that Aldi sales grew by just 5.7% compared with 12.2% growth across the UK grocery market as a whole. The price war has seen rival supermarkets set up their own discounts and deals to try and attract customers through their doors or onto their online sites. As well as its Aldi Price Match, Tesco offers savings through its Club Card Prices and said: ""We know that our customers want competitive prices for the products and brands they buy regularly."" Aldi pointed out that ""Consumer group Which? recently found that Sainsbury's were over 31% more expensive than Aldi"". An Aldi spokesperson said: ""Shoppers know that the only place you can get Aldi prices is at Aldi."" Lidl, contrarily, avoids price drop campaigns in favour of low prices, although it does have a Pick of the Week special offer. It was awarded the title of cheapest supermarket in 2020 by Which?

LiveLiveCovid is a challenge this country is meeting - PM7 minutes ago,"""There's no doubt we have made great strides,"" says the PM at a Downing Street briefing, adding one in four adults in England have been vaccinated The number of people who have received their first dose of a Covid vaccine in the UK has now passed 13 million He calls on the remaining 2 million eligible people to come forward for their vaccines. ""Now is the moment,"" he says Boris Johnson say ""it is just too early"" to be certain about what people can do this summer He repeats he'll be saying more about the roadmap out of lockdown in two weeks Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urges the government to ""stop the mixed messages"" on summer holidays He also criticises a potential 10-year sentence for failing to quarantine as an ""empty threat"" The World Health Organization backs 12-week gap between Oxford vaccine doses and also says it's safe for over-65s A further 1,001 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, new government figures show Edited by Sarah Collerton Thanks for following our live updates. They were brought to you by Alex Therrien, Ashitha Nagesh, Cherry Wilson, Doug Faulkner, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Jennifer Scott, Marie Jackson, Richard Morris and Sarah Collerton. We will be back with the latest on coronavirus tomorrow. Have a good evening. And here's a look at the UK headlines before we go:  Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is coming to a close. A lot has happened today. To sum it all up, here's a round-up of the main global headlines: When the coronavirus hit the UK, Nicola Muirhead, like many photographers, set out to record her experience. She photographed the people and places around her but soon felt the images needed something extra to bring the unseen virus home to the viewer. ""I started investigating ways in which I could metaphorically 'reveal' this unseen virus in my pictures,"" she says, ""to expose its lurking presence in the skin and air and manifest it in my pictures - to identify it - marking this time in place in our history."" Muirhead began to treat the pictures with a variety of ""ritualistic disinfecting"", exposing them to household cleaning products meant to help stop the spread of coronavirus, such as hand sanitiser, soap, and bleach. Here's our gallery of Nicola's work where she talks aboutwhat's next. A D-Day veteran has been sent more than 3,000 cards after a party marking his 100th birthday was cancelled due to lockdown. Tommy Trotter, a former Northumberland fusilier, was ""over the moon"" after seeing the cards laid out at the Don War Memorial Bar in Thornaby, Teesside. Among the messages was a letter from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He said: ""I've never had nowt like this before, it's lovely."" Read more here Scotland's transport secretary says he is pressing the UK government to close a loophole which could allow travellers to avoid new Covid quarantine rules. Michael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were ""inadequate"". New quarantine rules for people arriving into England only apply to people arriving from33 countries deemed ""high risk"",external, but Scotland's apply to all travellers who have been abroad. The Scottish government has expressed concern that travellers could avoid the rules in Scotland by flying into England first. Read more Three people who travelled 150 miles because they were ""bored"" of lockdown have been fined and had their car seized. Derbyshire Police saidtwo men and a woman drove from London to Baslow, Derbyshire, on Monday afternoon. After questioning the reason for their trip, officers also discovered the driver's Albanian driving licence had expired. Police said all three were fined Â£200 for breaching Covid-19 rules. For more on the lockdown rules in your area you can read our guidehere. Many business owners have seen their customer numbers dwindle as a result of the pandemic - including mechanic Jim Walsh. His car repair business was on the brink of collapse due to the fact there are less drivers on the road during lockdown. But the garage is now fully booked this week and busy for the next fortnight after his daughter, Harley,posted a single tweet to drum up business. ""It just shows that there's good people and it's nice to see that on social media,"" she said. This video can not be played Saving my dad's garage with the power of social This video can not be played Covid-19: 'The virus does not care about the colour of your skin' England's deputy chief medical officer has said it ""really concerns"" him that fewer BAME people may get the Covid vaccine. Prof Jonathan Van-Tam made the comments while answering audience questions about vaccines and Covid misinformation on the BBC's News Channel and Asian Network earlier. He said he was worried ""the uptake in minority ethnic groups is not going to be as rapid or as high"" compared to the white population. However, he did stress that vaccine uptake has been very high among people who have been offered it so far. He also expressed concern about fake news about vaccines. Read more John Loch thanked staff for making his vaccination 'simple and straighforward' More than one million people have received their first dose of the Covid vaccine in Scotland. The Scottish government said the milestone was reached on Wednesday and the vaccination programme was now moving ""at pace"". Ministers say they are on track to inoculate everyone in the top priority groups - including everyone aged over 70 - by 15 February First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier described the recent rate of vaccinations in the country -in spite of severe weather- as ""nothing short of extraordinary"". Retired businessman John Loch was among those being immunised at the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow as the landmark figure was reached. The 69-year-old from Bearsden says: ""It is exciting to be a part of thismilestone moment."" During his Covid briefing earlier, PM Boris Johnsonurged the two million peopleyet to take up their offer of a Covid jab in the UK to ""come forward"" this week. About 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated in the US so far, and there have been ""no red flags"" in their reactions to it, Anthony Fauci has said. Dr Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told a White House press briefing that pregnant women and children hadn't been included in the original clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. However, he said clinical trials including pregnant women are either already under way or are planned for the near future. Dr Fauci said the vaccination of pregnant women was being monitored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Verona Thomas decided to have the vaccine There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests. Just under half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who have not had a vaccine,according to the research by the National Care Forum. The survey also confirms staff hesitancy is a significant factor in the slow uptake. Verona Thomas, a unit manager at Saffron House nursing home in Bristol, says she had initial concerns - but worrying about what would happen to loved ones if she caught the virus changed her mind. ""I work with quite vulnerable adults...So it was a case of doing my best to protect them,"" she said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just under 24 hours
until the Lunar New Year for people in China (12 February) and during this
period it is common for people in the country to gather for family meals, or
large banquet gatherings. This year, Chinaâs official
Peopleâs Daily newspaper is urging people not to eat wild animals during the
holidays. It issharing posters,externalthat
show the silhouette of animals including snakes, hedgehogs and turtles, and
telling people to avoid contact with them. âDo not illegally hunt, trade
or eat wild animals,â it says. The campaign, which uses the hashtag #DontEatWildAnimalsDuringSpringFestival, has so far been seen by more than 9.5
million people. The posters have echoes ofones that circulated nationally last year at this time,external, back when the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan drew international attention. At the time, there was evident nervousness in the country about animal consumption being a possible reason for Covid-19. In May, the original epicentre of the coronavirus, Wuhan,banned eating and hunting wild animals,externalamid these fears. And over the last year, other regions havestepped up regulations to ban the consumption of animals. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have also been updating âChinaâs law on animal epidemic preventionâ to limit contact between animals and humans that could lead to disease. In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

Cladding costs 'takes over our lives',"Pippa Hamshaw says the costs and worry of fire-safety regulations have left her in tears Thousands of flat owners are facing large bills for fire-safety improvements demanded following the Grenfell disaster. Labour says they're not getting enough help, but the government insists it's taking appropriate action. ""The building should never have been signed off in the first place,"" says Pippa Hamshaw. ""The flats are all valued at nothing. Mortgage companies won't offer mortgages on any of them."" Pippa, 31, is also expecting a Â£70,000 bill for her share of renovations on her block of flats in Leeds. ""I go from being really angry with the situation to being in tears,"" she tells BBC 5 live's Naga Munchetty. ""It's taken over my life."" Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' New body to ban dangerous building materials No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Pippa is one of thousands of people facing large payments for safety renovations required following the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, in west London, in which 72 people died when flames spread via combustible exterior cladding. Many fire-safety concerns have come up in inspections since then, but those not relating to cladding - such as missing fire breaks and flammable balconies - are not covered by the government's Building Safety Fund. And a report by MPs has said that the Â£1.6bn the government has allocated for removing dangerous cladding is insufficient - with the real cost nearer Â£15bn. This video can not be played Starmer: ""Three and a half years after Grenfell, most people would not believe this is the situation we are in"" Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders like Pippa, whose monthly service charge has risen from Â£240 to Â£630. ""I just feel totally let down by the whole system,"" she says. ""The government could do something right now... I feel like everyone's winning bar the leaseholder."" After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. ""I don't feel any safer,"" says Pippa. ""I don't see how they are going to be much use. They literally have to go and knock on every door of the flats to tell you that the building is on fire. We've got 10 floors in my property. Are they really going to be able to knock on every door?"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is accusing ministers of offering ""half-baked solutions"" to the problems exposed by Grenfell and has called for a national cladding taskforce, modelled on a similar body set up in Australia. He argues this would ""drive forward"" work on funding the removal of dangerous cladding, while pursuing ""those responsible for the cladding scandal"", protecting residents from costs and ensuring they can sell their properties. Builders remove cladding from a block in Greater Manchester Jenny Garrett, who bought her flat in Sheffield in 2019, says that, when the survey was carried out, ""absolutely nothing"" wrong was found. Only later did she find out the building's cladding was flammable. ""The whole situation is quite overwhelming because there's the issue of feeling unsafe,"" she says. ""On top of that, there's the issue about the financial pressure and worrying about what's coming down the road."" Residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Flat owners in one Cheshire development had their combined premiums rise from Â£34,000 in 2018 to more than Â£500,000. Some are now paying almost Â£2,000 a year for building insurance. Meanwhile,data released last month shows,externalthat cladding removal and repair work has been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. The Association of British Insurers says the slow pace of getting buildings fixed means means high policy prices reflect risks accurately. ""For the last two or three years, a lot of our lives have been completely ruined,"" says Giles, a flat owner from Manchester. ""We're living in fear and limbo. All we've been told so far is the government wants us to pay sums running into the tens of thousands of pounds, simply to make our homes safe. ""It's all got even worse over the last year, because we're trapped in our homes for 23 hours a day during the pandemic. We almost feel safer outside than inside."" People attended a commemoration to mark the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in 2020 ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible... we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman says. ""Leaseholders shouldn't have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didn't cause - and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible,"" he adds. ""The Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course."" The House of Commons backed a Labour motion calling for further action on cladding on Monday by 263 votes to none. The Conservative leadership asked its MPs to abstain and the result is not binding on the government. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Need some assistance with home-schooling?

Extra cash to remove unsafe cladding expected,"This video can not be played ""I didn't choose any cladding and now I'm going to be skint forever"" Further funding towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding on buildings is expected to be announced by the government. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will make a statement to MPs shortly, but details of the plan are unknown. Thousands of flat-owners are facing huge bills for fire-safety improvements after 2017's Grenfell disaster, when flames spread via combustible cladding. The government announced a Â£1.6bn building safety fund in 2020 to help. But pressure is growing on ministers to increase the pot for residents stuck in the buildings, with a committee of MPs estimating the total cost of the crisis could run to Â£15bn. BBC Newsnightreported last monththat the government had decided to allocate extra funding, possibly running into billions of pounds, to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous materials Fire patrols at our flats 'cost us Â£500,000' More than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders, while residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley said ministers should accept that ""the only tenants who are being asked to pay at the moment are leaseholders"" and confirm they are ""not responsible"". ""They need to provide the money so that remediation can take place,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Buildings should be made safe, they need to be made saleable - which means you can't have liabilities hanging around the necks of individual leaseholders."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast there has been ""substantial help"" available for those facing higher costs, but ""needs are very high"". He acknowledged concerns among leaseholders - referring particularly to those who share ownership with housing associations or local authorities - that they ""may be left out of this"". The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said work was ""either completed or under way"" on around 95% of the residential high-rises identified as having flammable ACM cladding at the start of last year, ""with all works to be completed this year"". ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible and are already backing this with our Â£1.6 billion funding we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a statement said. It added that the government was ""working at pace to develop further financial solutions to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs"". Butdata released last month showed,externalthat cladding removal and repair work had been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. Homebuilder Persimmon said it was putting aside Â£75m ""towards any necessary cladding remediation and safety work"" in 26 developments. They include nine high-rise buildings where cladding may need to be removed - although Persimmon no longer owns the sites - and 17 smaller buildings that may be fitted with unsafe cladding and need investigating. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" says Amy First-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for Â£85,000 in 2017. Inspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" she said. ""With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe."" While the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme. It could cost up to Â£6m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to Â£50,000 each. ""We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,"" Ms Cottenden said. A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said: ""We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist."" Read more:Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, said it was ""shameful"" that ""hundreds of thousands of people are still trapped in unsafe homes"". She added: ""Whatever is announced will be too late for those first-time buyers who have already gone bust."" In an open letter to the chancellor, campaigning coalition End Our Cladding Scandal said Mr Jenrick's announcement should not be ""another partial solution"". ""If your government chooses to force us, the innocent victims of this crisis, into lifelong loans, of any size, this will be unacceptable, unfair and completely immoral,"" it said. It said any proposal ""must be adequate in size and scope to fully resolve this quandary"", adding: ""This is not just about billing the taxpayer ever higher amounts, but finding ways to make those who caused the crisis pay."" On Tuesday evening, the National Leasehold Campaigntweeted,externalthat it was ""another sleepless night"" for leaseholders ""worried sick"" about what Mr Jenrick was going to announce.

There is no PMQs next week, as MPs are in recess. Here is a quick recap of what happened today, to tide you over: Sir Keir Starmer asked whether various Covid business support schemes will be extended - but the PM said we'll have to wait a bit longer to find out. The Labour leader also pressed the PM on borders policy, again urging hotel quarantine in England to be extended to arrivals from all countries. But Boris Johnson defended his current policy, calling it ""amongst the toughest in the worldâ. In answer to backbench MP questions, the prime minister said the government is doing ""everything we can"" to get England's schoolchildren back after 8 March. And he said people ""will have to get used to the idea"" of re-vaccination in the autumn to protect against new coronavirus variants.

from a manâ¦who proposed Donald Trump for a
Nobel peace prize.â The prime minister has not
nominated the former US president. Instead, Boris Johnson suggested that he was as worthy for a
nomination as his predecessor Barack Obama. âIf Trump can fix North Korea and the Iran nuclear deal then
I donât see why heâs any less of a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize than
Barack Obama who got it before he even did anything,âhe said in 2018, then as foreign secretary. Donald Trump has in fact been nominated twice by a far-right
Norwegian politician for his engagement with both North Korea and the Middle East peace process. Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor The BBC's Deputy Political Editor Vicki Young says Sir Keir Starmer adopted a ""firmer tone"" with the prime minister during his questions this week. She tells the BBC's Politics Live Sir Keir tried to ""make a theme"" of asking why businesses aren't getting reassurances now on whether support for them will continue until lockdown restrictions end. Sir Keir accused the government of leaving everything to the last minute. The final question this week is from the DUP's Gregory Campbell on the Northern Ireland Protocol, the controversial part of the Brexit agreement governing trade between Britain and Northern Ireland which unionists want scrapped because of its disruption on business. The PM has said he wants to make existing agreements work but he has made it ""absolutely clear"" to the EU that there needs to be ""untrammelled free trade"" between all parts of the UK. He adds that the UK will not rule out any options, including invoking Article 16 of the protocol, to defend Northern Ireland's interests.  Conservative MP Nicola Richards says many people are missing a cancer diagnosis because screenings have been suspended due to Covid. She urges the prime minister to make the resumption of cancer screenings a ""top priority"" once restrictions begin to ease. Boris Johnson replies that the government is ""worried"" about people coming forward as they normally would, and urges them to do so. Labour's Geraint Davies says there has been a fresh outbreak of the virus at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea, coming on top of more than 500 cases of Covid since last autumn. He urges the PM to meet him and union officials to enable more staff to work from home to ward off the risk of imminent strike action. The PM says that of 6,000 staff working there, there are currently only nine cases, showing proper protocols are in place. Opportunities to work from home are being stepped up, he says, and lateral flow tests being made available to those who have to go in. Analysis Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister despatched Sir Keir Starmerâs six questions in under
10 minutes. Surely a recent record. The Labour leader tried to sound
pro-business and tough and borders but didnât ask anything that pinned the PM
down. It seems odd that the Labour leader chose Budget-related questions that the PM can easily side-step and say wait until
March. In response to a question from Conservative Julian Sturdy, the prime minister says the government will do everything it can ""if possible"" to ensure that all school children return in full on 8 March. He says he believes prioritising schools' return is the ""settled will of most people in Parliament"" and he will set out plans on 22 February. But he says the government must not let the virus get out of control again, saying we ""cannot take our foot off its throat"". Liberal Democrat Layla Moran asks the prime minister whether a compensation fund will be set up for NHS staff who are suffering with ""long Covid"".. She says it could be classed as an ""occupational disease"" and the fund could mirror that for armed services personnel. Boris Johnson says it will be important to ""look after"" NHS staff, and commends their ""incredible sacrifice"" during the pandemic. Conservative former chancellor Sajid Javid asks a question on biodiversity. He says the world's ecosystems are at threat of ""catastrophic decline"". He warns that it is a moral and economic failure to do nothing about this. He asks if the UK has a ""unique opportunity"" to discuss this at this year's COP26 climate summit. Mr Johnson thanks Mr Javid for his work in this area. He says he wants the COP26 summit in Glasgow to be a ""landmark event"", adding that it was ""high time"" the world's leaders worked to prevent the loss of wildlife that has taken place over the past century. Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Jones says the Conservatives' record on spreading prosperity around the UK  - ""levelling up"" in government jargon - is ""abysmal"", with Research and Development spending in Wales 40% less per head than in England. She asks when the government will move beyond its obsession with the ""golden triangle of London, Oxford and Cambridge"" and focus on Wales and other parts of the UK. The PM says he is surprised by the question, suggesting the MP is in danger of ""talking Wales down"". He highlights the siting of a major new battery production factory in Bridgend and the fact that many of the wings used by the world's airliners are made in Wales. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle ticks off the prime minister for referring to the Scottish National Party as the ""Scottish Nationalist Party"" during his reply to Mr Blackford. This matter has been a bone of contention between Boris Johnson and the SNP -  and is regularly brought up at PMQs. Sir Lindsay claims Mr Johnson was ""teasing"" Mr Blackford and trying to wind his party up, adding: ""please, let's drop it"". Everyone arriving on an overseas flight will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at a cost of at least Â£1,750. SNP Westminster Leader Ian Blackford saysnew research shows1.3m children under five are living in poverty. He says it is a ""truly shocking figure"" which should make the government ""truly ashamed"". The government could act on poverty now by making the Â£20 temporary uplift to Universal Credit permanent. Boris Johnson says the government is helping people with food, heating bills and free school meals. He says the government is ""putting our arms around the people of this country throughout the pandemic"". Mr Blackford accuses Mr Johnson of giving a ""pathetic"" answer. ""They don't need more empty words from a prime minister"" he adds. He says further cuts to Universal Credit could reduce the value of it by a quarter. He asks if Mr Johnson will be ""another Tory prime minister"" who leaves children ""languishing in poverty"". Mr Johnson says ""we bitterly lament and regret the poverty"" that some families suffer. He says the SNP is morphing into a more ""left wing party"" that believes taxpayers should ""pay more and more and more"", whereas the Conservatives want more jobs for people. For his final question, Sir Keir says the PM is failing to provide security for businesses or security at the border. He repeats Labour's calls for the furlough scheme, business rates holiday and VAT relief to be extended - and for the hotel quarantine policy to cover arrivals from all countries. In reply, Boris Johnson accuses the Labour leader of moving ""from one side to the other"" on business support measures, and calls his demands for an extension a ""stunt of bandwagoneering"". Sir Keir Starmer says he will not take lessons from someone ""who proposed Donald Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize and gave Dominic Cummings a pay rise. Moving to his next question, he cites research from Oxford University saying there are at least 33 countries with tougher border restrictions than the UK. He asks why - after more than 50 days since the South African variant was discovered - the government's hotel quarantine plan for high-risk travellers has not come into force. The PM says some European countries do not have a quarantine plan, saying the number of people entering the UK has fallen to about 20,000, 5,000 of whom are delivering vital supplies. He says the border controls in place are ""measured, proportionate and about to get tougher on Monday"". Sir Keir Starmer asks whether the latest ban on evictions in England will also be extended. In reply, the prime minister says the government will make sure people will are not evicted from their homes unfairly. He says Labour should get behind government policies rather than ""sniping from the side lines"". Sir Keir Starmer says he can take decisions for himself and not leaves things to the ""11th minute"", adding that business groups have also said they cannot wait to the Budget. Why does the PM ""know better than business"", he asks. The PM says no government has done more to support business and he welcomes Labour's support for enterprise, saying it is ironic coming from a party which advocated ""dismantling"" capitalism in its 2019 election manifesto and hitting pharmaceutical companies that, he says, have been so crucial in the vaccine production. For his second question, Sir Keir says hundreds of thousands of businesses ""need an answer now"" on whether business rates relief will be extended. He also asks whether the furlough scheme will be extended beyond its scheduled end-date of the end of April. Boris Johnson doesn't respond but says his ""roadmap"" for unlocking rules in England will be set out in a few days. Sir Keir Starmer is on his feet in the Commons. The Labour leader thanks everyone involved in the vaccine rollout, saying progress has been ""truly amazing"". He then asks whether the government will extend business rate relief for firms beyond 31 March. The PM says the government is committed to supporting business through the pandemic but he should wait to March's budget to find out the government's next steps. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's a reminder of the main coronavirus developments:  Thanks for joining us - our next live blog is scheduled for Friday's update from the Welsh Government. A newvirtual festivalis being launched to bring music, laughter and culture into our homes almost a year on from the first lockdown. It will bring together four of Wales' major arts, music and comedy festivals and be broadcast as part of the BBC's Culture in Quarantine initiative. Director of BBC Wales Rhodri Talfan Davies said GÅµyl 2021 would provide a much needed ""blast of creativity"". It will be online and on BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru on 6-7 March. The event will see the first-ever joining of forces by Wales' Festival of Voice, new music event FOCUS Wales, the Aberystwyth Comedy Festival and Other Voices Cardigan. It has been filmed and recorded in line with Covid restrictions in recent months while the pandemic has kept the public away from arts venues and concerts in Wales. This video can not be played Covid: Funeral director says 'no-one is grateful for the work' A funeral director has described how he has had toturn relatives away from their own loved ones' funerals because of Covid restrictions. Gareth Jenkins, from Baglan, Port Talbot, said he would usually expect to see a whole village attend a funeral. However, due to pandemic rules, he said numbers were heavily restricted - meaning close family members were often unable to attend - and that ""it's just not what we do"". He said ""no-one in this profession"" thought Covid had ""been good for business,"" adding he was burying about 20 people a week. A Wrexham factory hashad its contract to help in the production of Covid-19 vaccines extended by six months, creating 40 new jobs. The UK government awarded Wockhardt an18-month contractfor the ""fill-and-finish"" stage of manufacture in August. The extension means production will now continue at CP Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Wockhardt, until August 2022. The UK's International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said it was ""a brilliant bit of news"" for people in Wrexham. She added: ""It brings important investment to the local area, bringing jobs and security to the community as we battle this awful pandemic."" Mark HutchingsBBC Radio 5 Live #MyCovidYear ""I feel so sorry because I'm 20 years older and I'm still here"". Betty Tovey, 94, was being treated at a field hospital in Carmarthenshire for Covid-19when her daughter-in-law died with the virus. Now she is ready to go home after six weeks, Betty is looking forward to returning to Penygroes, but it is an occasion marked with sadness. She and other patients have spoken to BBC Radio 5 Live, which was given extensive access to the temporary hospital in Llanelli, housed in a bowling centre. ""I kept praying, please God let me go home to them, but unfortunately she was taken,"" Betty continued. She shared her story along with a series of other patients at the field hospital, in the weekthe number of deaths with coronavirus in Wales passed 5,000. Wrexham remains the local authority area with the highest Covid case rate in Wales, with 217.7 people per 100,000 population testing positive for the virus in the past seven days. That is followed by Flintshire with 203.7 and Anglesey with 178.5. Local Democracy Reporting Service Some public toilets in Cardiff have reopened and are being cleaned regularly throughout the day, having been closed during the pandemic. The facilities available again are at Victoria Park in Canton, Roath Park Pleasure Gardens, Roath Park Lake, and the Cardiff Bay Barrage. Social distancing measures and regular cleaning will be in place, the council said. Liberal Democrat Councillor Rodney Berman said his group had been calling for toilets to be reopened and welcomed the news, saying the Labour-run authority ""has finally seen sense"". âOnly last month they claimed it wasnât possible and yet other parts of Wales have managed to make toilets Covid-safe,"" he said. On social media, people welcomed the toilets reopening but called on the council to also reopen public toilets in Cardiff Bay and Bute Park. Peopleshould not be booking holidays at home or abroadyet due to coronavirus, the UK government's transport secretary has warned. Grant Shapps told the BBC he did not know ""where we'll be in terms of cases, deaths and vaccination"" by the summer. He said the UK was talking to other countries about setting up an ""international system"" for checking if people have been tested or vaccinated. But this should not be likened to a Covid ""passport"", Mr Shapps added. As it attempts to reduce the spread of new coronavirus variants from abroad, the UK government has promised maximum jail sentences of 10 years for people lying about their recent travel history. The boss of the NHS in Wales has urged the public to continue to work with the health service by sticking to Covid rules. Dr Andrew Goodall thanked all the NHS staff for their work during the pandemic, but he said it was important that the public continue to âwork with us on their actionsâ. âWe know that our rollout and the pace we are going at with vaccinations will make a differenceâ, he said. âI just hope that the Welsh public will continue to work with us, and it's been really important to see that progress over these recent months.â Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC Wales Swansea West MP Geraint Davies
has urged the UK Government to reduce the number of people working at DVLA
offices in Swansea due to large numbers catching Covid. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, he said the DVLA had had
526 cases of coronavirus since last September, with staff now ""facing a
more infectious and widespread disease"". ""Yesterday 90 people were
sent home following the latest outbreak of coronavirus just before the weekend,"" he said. ""Given that BT are on standby to install home secure technology to allow home
working, will the prime minister meet with me and the union ahead of the strike ballot
next week so that workplace numbers can be reduced until the vaccine is rolled
out to keep people safe and avoid an unnecessary strike?"" The prime minister said the DVLA was
pursuing a working-from-home strategy, and said he believed out of the workforce
of 6,000 there were ""thankfully"" only nine cases of Covid now and three of
those individuals were currently working from home. Mr Johnson added the UK government was
""rolling out lateral flow tests"" but said the ""long-term
solution"" was vaccinating people. Meanwhile a DVLA spokesperson denied there had been another outbreak, but said one person tested positive on Tuesday and 37 staff were sent home having been alerted by Test and Trace. The number of âdefinitive or probableâ cases of the South
Africa variant in Wales is still 13, according to the chief executive of the Welsh NHS. Dr Andrew Goodall said the number âhasnât really changed
very much over the course of recent daysâ. However he added that experts were keeping an eye on the
situation. âWe always need to continue to look back on the data and
the intelligence as well as look forward,"" he said. ""It is a bit of a balance between
the two areas, but from a public health perspective - and certainly advice
internally from our professional advisors and Public Health Wales - we're not
necessarily seeing that as the core problem at this stage. âWe've probably had greater concerns about the higher
level of transmissibility with a Kent variant that's been around and about us
for some time now.â NHS
Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall paid tribute to all health service staff who have worked through ""some of the most difficult periods they have ever experienced"". ""NHS
staff have worked under exceptional pressure, providing healthcare and support
in the most extraordinary circumstances, without a break,"" he said. Dr Goodall said front-line staff had experienced ""great strain and
stress on both their physical and mental health"" over the last year. He added that NHS sickness and absence rates remained high. ""At this
point last year around 5% of our staff were absent; currently this is 8% (and
has been higher). Around half of this relates to coronavirus."" The emergence of new variants of coronavirus are âof
concernâ, the NHS Wales chief executive says. Dr Andrew Goodall said it was  âinevitable that there will be
constant mutations of the virusâ but Wales had âstrong experienceâ of being
able to identify these through sequencing. âOver the last couple weeks we particularly focused on the
South African variant, very small numbers at this stage and at least weâve been
able to track it and we do link with other agencies,â he said. âWhat weâre always looking for is whether this is a variant
that takes hold within a community, and a particular concern was the Kent
variant as opposed to many of the other mutations, simply because of the
evidence that it was increasing transmissibility.â NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says he is looking to local health board to decide ""where they have flexibility"" to reintroduce routine services, rather than take a national decision. He said some areas of Wales had already reintroduced some of that work. But he added: ""There is some time to come for us to feel that we have the capacity available."" The chief executive of the Welsh NHS says it faces a âconsiderable backlog of referrals and demandâ. Dr Andrew Goodall said that as the position âstabilisesâ, he expects to âexpand the level and rangeâ of NHS activity and resume services which have been temporarily paused. âIt is critical we can set out a clear plan for resetting and recovering the normal NHS responsibilities across settings."" NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says the NHS has been under âintense and sustained pressureâ over the last few months but hospital admissions are falling. âThere are now around 2,200 Covid-related patients in Welsh hospitals â this is around 25% lower than the peak we saw in January,"" he said. âBut there are still nearly 50% more patients with coronavirus in hospital beds than at the peak of the first wave in April."" Dr Goodall added that there were 84 people with coronavirus in critical care, which is nearly ""25% lower than last weekâ. âBut we still have 177 people in total in critical care units, which means our staff are supporting the equivalent of 116% occupancy, more beds than we usually have available."" Dr Andrew Goodall, the chief executive of NHS Wales, says covid rates are falling but the situation still remains âprecariousâ for the health service. He said the overall infection rate was around 110 cases per 100,000 people in Wales. âAlthough levels are falling, there are still a couple of areas in north Wales where the rate is more than 200 cases per 100,000 people,"" Dr Goodall said. âWe are making good progress in reducing the level of infections in the community. âBut overall, the situation in the NHS remains precarious.â Public Health Wales said 655,419 people in Wales had now received their first vaccine, with 26,659 jabs given yesterday. It means 20.8% of the Welsh population have now been vaccinated. Second doses have now been given to 3,687 people. NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall is about to give today's Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch proceedings live on BBC One Wales, via theBBC iPlayer, onS4Cand via the Coronavirus Update video link above. Of the 21 new Covid deaths reported by Public Health Wales today, seven were reported by Betsi Cadwaladr health board in north Wales, five by both Hywel Dda in west Wales and Cardiff and Vale, two by Cwm Taf Morgannwg in south Wales and one by both the Powys and Swansea Bay health boards.

There is no PMQs next week, as MPs are in recess. Here is a quick recap of what happened today, to tide you over: Sir Keir Starmer asked whether various Covid business support schemes will be extended - but the PM said we'll have to wait a bit longer to find out. The Labour leader also pressed the PM on borders policy, again urging hotel quarantine in England to be extended to arrivals from all countries. But Boris Johnson defended his current policy, calling it ""amongst the toughest in the worldâ. In answer to backbench MP questions, the prime minister said the government is doing ""everything we can"" to get England's schoolchildren back after 8 March.

Care home staff 'without PPE at start of pandemic',"Care home staff were without personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic because the government prioritised the NHS, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said care homes received only a fraction of the PPE needed compared with the health service. It said social care ""was only taken seriously after the high mortality rate in care homes became apparent"". The government said it worked ""tirelessly"" to provide PPE. How healthcare workers came to feel 'expendable' NHS gowns suspended due to packaging concern Do NHS staff have the protective gear they need? Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used The report from the Public Accounts Committee said many healthcare workers were put in an ""appalling situation"" where they had to care for people with Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19 ""without sufficient PPE to protect themselves from infection"". It said the social care sector did not receive ""anywhere near enough"" to meet its needs. Health and social care staff suffered PPE shortages, it said, with some forced to reuse single-use items as stocks ran ""perilously low"". Between March and July 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care provided NHS trusts with 1.9 billion items of PPE, the equivalent to 80% of their estimated need. The adult social care sector was given 331 million items, accounting for 10% of its requirements. At the same time, about 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes from hospitals without being tested for Covid-19. ""This contributed significantly to the deaths in care homes during the first wave,"" the committee said. Its report said the government had believed it was well placed to cope at the start of the outbreak, as it had a stockpile of PPE. But this was only intended for a flu pandemic and was ""inadequate"" for the coronavirus pandemic. More than Â£12bn was spent by the Department of Health and Social Care between February and July 2020 on 32 billion items of PPE. However, the committee said hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money was ""wasted"" on unusable kit. Staff reported receiving face masks with rotten elastic and, in one case, a box of surgical gowns which was infested with insects. Committee chairman Meg Hillier said frontline workers were left ""without adequate supplies, risking their own and their families' lives to provide treatment and care"". ""The government needs to acknowledge the errors and be better prepared,"" she said. The report came aftertwo highly critical reportspublished by the National Audit Office in November last year. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it worked ""tirelessly to procure, produce and deliver PPE"" to frontline workers.

"EU's von der Leyen admits vaccine shortcomingsThe European Commission chief tells the Brussels Parliament ""we're still not where we want to be"".Europe","This video can not be played In February the head of the European Commission insisted on Europe's ""fair share"" of vaccines The EU was late to authorise Covid-19 vaccines and ""still not where we want to be"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said. She also acknowledged the EU had been overconfident about production targets being met amid delays at factories. The Commission chief has come under fire for the EU's slow vaccine rollout. There is anger that the bloc has fallen behind countries like the UK, where more than 12 million people have already received the jab. But Mrs von der Leyen was adamant that ordering vaccines collectively on behalf of member states was ""the right thing to do"". Meanwhile pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca has said it will join forces with German company IDT Biologika to produce more vaccines for Europe. Producers of vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs have postponed delivery of some of the EU's order because of capacity and supply issues. Vaccine tensions stoke German criticism of EU chief What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? How Serbia soared ahead in Covid vaccinations This was Mrs von der Leyen's first public acceptance of criticism,external. Last week, she told German paper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung that ""a country on its own can be a speedboat, the EU is more like a tanker"". ""We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production,"" the Commission president told the European Parliament, ""and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time."" She also noted that questions would have to be answered about what went wrong. However, Mrs von der Leyen maintained that a joint EU response had been the correct decision in dealing with the pandemic: ""I can't even imagine if a few big players had rushed to it and the others went empty-handed. ""In economic terms it would have been nonsense and it would have been I think the end of our community."" She also defended the time taken to approve vaccines, which she described as ""an essential investment to establish confidence and security"". The Commission president said she ""deeply"" regretted a threat made by the EU last month to restrict the flow of vaccines passing between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""But in the end we got it right and I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace in Northern Ireland."" By Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, Brussels The EU's vaccination programme has become an important political test for the European Commission, which took over responsibility for the rollout from individual member states. It has also become a critical test of the personal standing of Ursula von der Leyen. She has now acknowledged failings and admitting underestimating the difficulties of mass production. But this was not by any means a straightforward apology. Mrs von der Leyen said it was right for the EU to have acted together, not in competition. The experiences of Serbia, which is not an EU member state, and Hungary, which is, point to a possible solution to vaccine shortages in Europe. Both have turned to suppliers of Russian and Chinese vaccines to supplement supplies from Western pharmaceutical companies. Right-wing Danish MEP Peter Kofod complained that the EU was ""treading water"" while other countries such as the UK, US and Israel made big strides in vaccinating their populations. Addressing Mrs von der Leyen directly, left-wing French MEP Manon Aubry asked: ""How could the European Commission accept to just lie down when dealing with the pharma companies?"" But there was support for the EU's response, too. Spanish centre-right Euro MP Esteban GonzÃ¡lez Pons said if it had not been for the Commission's decision to centralise the purchase of vaccines, his country and others would not have received their consignments ""because of a lack of political clout and budget"". ""Not everything was perfect in the last weeks and the last months,"" said Manfred Weber, the chairman of the centre-right EPP group of MEPs. ""The key decisions were right.""

Care home staff 'without PPE at start of pandemic'MPs say care homes received a fraction of the PPE needed compared with the health service.UKComments,"Care home staff were without personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic because the government prioritised the NHS, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said care homes received only a fraction of the PPE needed compared with the health service. It said social care ""was only taken seriously after the high mortality rate in care homes became apparent"". The government said it worked ""tirelessly"" to provide PPE.

Pubs plead for reopening date after sales halve,"Beer and pub sector leaders are pressing the government to give them a reopening date. The industry is desperate to get back to business after repeated warnings many pubs will not survive. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) is asking the government for a clear timeline and a ""roadmap to recovery"". The government insists that it has a plan for re-opening the economy which it will reveal after 22 February. The BBPA said trading restrictions and lockdowns knocked sales by 56% - worth Â£7.8bn - last year. In the first lockdown in the second quarter of the year, beer sales plummeted by 96%, it said. Even during the summer, which saw the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and a temporary VAT cut on food and soft drinks, pub beer sales fell 27%. The BBPA said that unless pubs received more assistance, even once they were allowed to reopen with far fewer restrictions, thousands would fail and be lost for good as many had built up substantial debts during the pandemic. What's the evidence for pub restrictions and curfews? Heineken cuts 8,000 jobs after Covid hits sales Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Its proposed roadmap states that, post-vaccination of the most vulnerable, pubs must reopen in unison with non-essential retail and other parts of the hospitality sector. It also says mandatory trading restrictions - such as alcoholic drinks served only with a substantial meal, no mixed households and the 10pm curfew - should be removed when pubs reopen in a timely way. Financially, it is pressing for an extension to the VAT cut and business rates holiday, as well as a significant beer duty cut. ""There's been a real lack of clarity,"" said Dianne Irving, who manages three pubs in Carlisle. ""It's just really, really difficult to know where we are and where we are going."" ""It's very difficult to plan."" Beyond March, things will be ""very difficult, financially,"" she said. Any kind of restrictions make her pubs expensive to run, she said. Under Tier 1 - the mildest of restrictions - two of her pubs were only breaking even, with her city-centre venue making a loss, she said. Philip Whitehead, chairman of the British Beer & Pub Association,  urged the government ""to provide clarity to our sector on when it can expect to fully reopen"". He added: ""After nearly a whole year under forced closure, or open but under severe restrictions, pub trade has been decimated and sales of beer in pubs have plummeted . Furthermore, due to their revenue falling off a cliff in 2020, pubs are holding debt and have little to no cash left. ""We need the government to continue to provide financial support for pubs when they reopen to bridge the gap to full recovery. Nick Mackenzie, boss of brewer and pub giant Greene King, said the industry needed ""a clear plan for reopening. without complex and unjustified restrictions which would make it unviable to open"". He added that without additional support, ""there is a real risk of more viable businesses closing their doors in the weeks and months ahead"". Mark Davies, boss of Hawthorn, the Community Pub Company with over 700 pubs said: ""I cannot emphasise enough how important it is that the government recognises the role that pubs play in so many communities around the UK and that pubs are part of the fabric of our society. ""It is therefore crucial that immediate financial support is secured for the pub sector with business rates and VAT an urgent priority."" A Government spokesperson said: ""We will set out our plan for reopening schools and, gradually, the economy in the week of 22 February. Ministers regularly engage with the sector to understand their concerns and discuss how the sector can restart when it is safe to do so. ""We have put in place one of the most comprehensive and generous packages of business support in the world worth Â£280 billion. This includes a new one-off grant worth up to Â£9,000, VAT relief, various loan schemes, a business rates holiday as well as the extended furlough scheme.""

Cancer therapy with no visitors is 'hardest thing'Covid restrictions mean patients such as Sophie must attend appointments without family or friends.Health,"Covid restrictions have made this year much tougher for young people already dealing with a cancer diagnosis. Sophie, like many other young cancer patients, has had to attend appointments and treatments alone, with no family or friends at her side. ""My mum was crying, I was crying and she had to leave me at the door and drive off,"" the 24-year-old says. Last year, she was told she would need hospital treatment for five weeks, 70 miles away from home. ""We had to travel to Manchester so my mum drove me,"" Sophie says. ""We got to the door and I had my suitcase - I was struggling alone with this suitcase. ""My mum was terrified leaving me, because she was probably thinking, 'I can't be there to comfort her,' and as well, if things go wrong, would she be walking back out of the hospital?"" Rules on who can visit have varied at different hospitals throughout the pandemic but official NHS England advice is that young cancer patients should be able to have friends and family supporting them at appointments in a Covid-safe way. Mikaela, 18, from Frome, needed treatment for cancer last March. She had three weeks of radiotherapy, fertility treatment to freeze her eggs and a biopsy operation. Mikaela's mother was able to go with her for a couple of chemotherapy sessions - but lockdown rules changed that. And Mikaela had to attend appointments - and have a stem-cell transplant - alone. Kathryn, 22, from Gwernaffield, in Flintshire, who has Hodgkin lymphoma, says the prospect of being isolated in hospital for up to six weeks without any of her family being there is difficult to comprehend. ""It's going to be extremely difficult going from shielding at home with my mum, dad and my brother around to not having my family there in person,"" she says. ""I know from friends going through similar things that having family there is really important - and I won't have that at all.""

We will be back with the latest on coronavirus tomorrow. Have a good evening. And here's a look at the UK headlines before we go:  Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is coming to a close. A lot has happened today. To sum it all up, here's a round-up of the main global headlines: When the coronavirus hit the UK, Nicola Muirhead, like many photographers, set out to record her experience. She photographed the people and places around her but soon felt the images needed something extra to bring the unseen virus home to the viewer. ""I started investigating ways in which I could metaphorically 'reveal' this unseen virus in my pictures,"" she says, ""to expose its lurking presence in the skin and air and manifest it in my pictures - to identify it - marking this time in place in our history."" Muirhead began to treat the pictures with a variety of ""ritualistic disinfecting"", exposing them to household cleaning products meant to help stop the spread of coronavirus, such as hand sanitiser, soap, and bleach. Here's our gallery of Nicola's work where she talks aboutwhat's next. A D-Day veteran has been sent more than 3,000 cards after a party marking his 100th birthday was cancelled due to lockdown. Tommy Trotter, a former Northumberland fusilier, was ""over the moon"" after seeing the cards laid out at the Don War Memorial Bar in Thornaby, Teesside. Among the messages was a letter from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He said: ""I've never had nowt like this before, it's lovely.""

New quarantine rules for people arriving into England only apply to people arriving from33 countries deemed ""high risk"",external, but Scotland's apply to all travellers who have been abroad. The Scottish government has expressed concern that travellers could avoid the rules in Scotland by flying into England first.

His car repair business was on the brink of collapse due to the fact there are less drivers on the road during lockdown.

About 20,000 pregnant women have been vaccinated in the US so far, and there have been ""no red flags"" in their reactions to it, Anthony Fauci has said. Dr Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told a White House press briefing that pregnant women and children hadn't been included in the original clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. However, he said clinical trials including pregnant women are either already under way or are planned for the near future. Dr Fauci said the vaccination of pregnant women was being monitored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Verona Thomas decided to have the vaccine There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests. Just under half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who have not had a vaccine,according to the research by the National Care Forum. The survey also confirms staff hesitancy is a significant factor in the slow uptake. Verona Thomas, a unit manager at Saffron House nursing home in Bristol, says she had initial concerns - but worrying about what would happen to loved ones if she caught the virus changed her mind. ""I work with quite vulnerable adults...So it was a case of doing my best to protect them,"" she said. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just under 24 hours
until the Lunar New Year for people in China (12 February) and during this
period it is common for people in the country to gather for family meals, or
large banquet gatherings. This year, Chinaâs official
Peopleâs Daily newspaper is urging people not to eat wild animals during the
holidays. It issharing posters,externalthat
show the silhouette of animals including snakes, hedgehogs and turtles, and
telling people to avoid contact with them. âDo not illegally hunt, trade
or eat wild animals,â it says. The campaign, which uses the hashtag #DontEatWildAnimalsDuringSpringFestival, has so far been seen by more than 9.5
million people. The posters have echoes ofones that circulated nationally last year at this time,external, back when the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan drew international attention. At the time, there was evident nervousness in the country about animal consumption being a possible reason for Covid-19. In May, the original epicentre of the coronavirus, Wuhan,banned eating and hunting wild animals,externalamid these fears. And over the last year, other regions havestepped up regulations to ban the consumption of animals. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have also been updating âChinaâs law on animal epidemic preventionâ to limit contact between animals and humans that could lead to disease. In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

We will be back with the latest on coronavirus tomorrow. Have a good evening. And here's a look at the UK headlines before we go:  Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is coming to a close. A lot has happened today. To sum it all up, here's a round-up of the main global headlines: When the coronavirus hit the UK, Nicola Muirhead, like many photographers, set out to record her experience. She photographed the people and places around her but soon felt the images needed something extra to bring the unseen virus home to the viewer. ""I started investigating ways in which I could metaphorically 'reveal' this unseen virus in my pictures,"" she says, ""to expose its lurking presence in the skin and air and manifest it in my pictures - to identify it - marking this time in place in our history."" Muirhead began to treat the pictures with a variety of ""ritualistic disinfecting"", exposing them to household cleaning products meant to help stop the spread of coronavirus, such as hand sanitiser, soap, and bleach. Here's our gallery of Nicola's work where she talks aboutwhat's next. A D-Day veteran has been sent more than 3,000 cards after a party marking his 100th birthday was cancelled due to lockdown. Tommy Trotter, a former Northumberland fusilier, was ""over the moon"" after seeing the cards laid out at the Don War Memorial Bar in Thornaby, Teesside. Among the messages was a letter from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He said: ""I've never had nowt like this before, it's lovely.""

Michael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were ""inadequate"". New quarantine rules for people arriving into England only apply to people arriving from33 countries deemed ""high risk"",external, but Scotland's apply to all travellers who have been abroad. The Scottish government has expressed concern that travellers could avoid the rules in Scotland by flying into England first.

Derbyshire Police saidtwo men and a woman drove from London to Baslow, Derbyshire, on Monday afternoon.

'While in hospital I lost my daughter-in-law',"This video can not be played Covid patients describe what it's like to be cared for in Llanelli's field hospital ""I feel so sorry because I'm 20 years older and I'm still here"". Betty Tovey, 94, was being treated at a field hospital for Covid-19 when her daughter-in-law died with the virus. Now she is ready to go home after six weeks, Betty is looking forward to returning to Penygroes, but it is an occasion marked with sadness. She and other patients have spoken to BBC 5Live, which was given extensive access inside the temporary hospital, housed in a Llanelli bowling centre. ""I kept praying, please God let me go home to them, but unfortunately she was taken,"" Betty continued. Betty Tovey, 94, says she needs to get home to her son who has lost his wife to the virus She shared her story along with a series of other patients at the Carmarthenshire facility, in the weekthe number of deaths with coronavirus in Wales passed 5,000. On the last six weeks, she said: ""I don't remember a lot, there's lots of things I'd like to remember. Live: On the NHS front line ""I just wanted to go to sleep, but thankfully the Lord doesn't want me yet, I've got to go home and help my son, he's lost his wife."" Patients in the hospital are treated to try and get them ready to go home When the coronavirus pandemic struck nearly a year ago,facilities all over the country from sports stadia to theatres were rapidly converted into field hospitals, in a bid to relieved the pressure on hospital wards across Wales. About 12 weeks ago, Hywel Dda University Health Board opened Ysbyty Enfys Selwyn Samuel in Llanelli and Ysbyty Enfys Carreg Las in Pembrokeshire, as a ""step-down"" facilities to help ease pressure on hospital beds. Another weekly fall in Covid deaths in Wales How many vaccines have been given in Wales? Hospital criticised over A&E social distancing At the Selwyn Samuel centre the bowling floor has been transformed into a ""recovery"" hospital ward with 42 patients being treated, mostly in the final stages of recovering from Covid-19. Staff working here are helping to get patients - many of them elderly - back up on their feet, eating and drinking, and doing laps of the bowling floor, ready for the day they can go home. Ceri-Ann Jones says she enjoys talking to the patients and treats them like they are a ""part of the family"" Ceri-Ann Jones was getting ready for a shift in a pub when the first nationwide lockdown was announced, on 23 March. Now, after hearing the pressure the NHS has been under, she is helping care for Betty and other patients after starting work as a domestic assistant on the ward. ""I thought I was fit and healthy, to a degree, and when Covid started kicking off... if you could get your hands dirty and help out, why not?"". Ceri-Ann said that working on the ward had opened her eyes and she now wanted to train to become a nurse, to keep caring for people in the future. Staff said it was hard to see people breaking rules when they saw the impact of Covid on people's lives She said she would like to bring people who did not believe Covid-19 existed on to the ward to see the lasting impact on patients' and staffs' lives. ""I look at it and think, if my parents or my grandparents were in this situation, how would I want them to be treated, ""she said. ""It's knowing you've made a difference... why wouldn't you want to put a smile on someone's face."" Charles Hughes said his son told him he had been ill in hospital, but he did not remember a thing Charles Hughes spent about three weeks in hospital, but said he had been told about it by his son and does not remember ""a day"" of his time there. But, the 88-year-old said he felt like he was getting better in the hospital. ""I'm well looked after, it's a palace... with the staff, with the food, everything, I couldn't be better well looked after,"" he said. Senior Nurse Manager Sarah Williams said working at the field hospital could be tough but there were so many positives Sarah Williams, a nurse of 32-years, never imagined working in a ward inside a bowling centre, but working with the patients - more than 100 of whom have been treated in 12 weeks - was very rewarding. While it had been positive helping people get ready to go home, the work had been ""challenging at times"", especially with some of her family also contacting the virus. ""There are some really sad stories but there are a lot of positives as well,"" she said. ""The focus is getting them up and about, eating and drinking, giving them that extra care that they need before they go home to the care setting. ""It's a very positive experience for the patients to get that extra bit of care before they go home."" Dr Meinir Jones said she hoped the facility would be able to close sometime this year Dr Meinir Jones, field hospitals clinical lead, said facilities like this field hospital, used to provide an extra level of care before a patient is discharged, were what was needed to ""maintain flow"" in hospitals. The model is different from England's Nightingale Hospital approach, which were temporary hospitals used to provide critical care for patients. She said that while the Llanelli facility could not be used for intensive care, because of workforce issues and technical medical equipment, it had helped to ease pressure. ""It's not just how long a patient spends in intensive care, it's about what happens afterwards... they spend a lot longer on wards afterwards,"" she said.

Dr Fauci, chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden, told a White House press briefing that pregnant women and children hadn't been included in the original clinical trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. However, he said clinical trials including pregnant women are either already under way or are planned for the near future. Dr Fauci said the vaccination of pregnant women was being monitored by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as the Food and Drug Administration. Verona Thomas decided to have the vaccine There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests. Just under half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who have not had a vaccine,according to the research by the National Care Forum.

until the Lunar New Year for people in China (12 February) and during this
period it is common for people in the country to gather for family meals, or
large banquet gatherings. This year, Chinaâs official
Peopleâs Daily newspaper is urging people not to eat wild animals during the
holidays. It issharing posters,externalthat
show the silhouette of animals including snakes, hedgehogs and turtles, and
telling people to avoid contact with them. âDo not illegally hunt, trade
or eat wild animals,â it says. The campaign, which uses the hashtag #DontEatWildAnimalsDuringSpringFestival, has so far been seen by more than 9.5
million people. The posters have echoes ofones that circulated nationally last year at this time,external, back when the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan drew international attention. At the time, there was evident nervousness in the country about animal consumption being a possible reason for Covid-19. In May, the original epicentre of the coronavirus, Wuhan,banned eating and hunting wild animals,externalamid these fears. And over the last year, other regions havestepped up regulations to ban the consumption of animals. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have also been updating âChinaâs law on animal epidemic preventionâ to limit contact between animals and humans that could lead to disease. In late January, it became a requirement that pet owners keep their dogs on leads,to prevent potential diseases such as rabies. Returning to the Downing Street briefing, Boris Johnson said it was good to see the World Health Organization's support for the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on everyone over 18, including the over-65s. You'll rememberFrance and Germany cast doubt on its efficacyin the older population and restricted its use. Johnson went on to say the WHO had also supported the UK's decision to leave a 12-week interval between the first and second dose. This is something of a turnaround. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Now though, its scientific advisers say giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increases the vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. Our health correspondent James Gallagher has been looking inmore detail at the WHO's latest findings. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the 10-year jail term announced on Tuesday for people who lie about having been in a ""red list"" country. The former lawyer says: ""I've prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10-year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it."" ""The effectiveness of what happens at the border is to do with testing and quarantining but pretending there's going to be a 10-year sentence when in reality I don't think there is isn't really helping anyone,"" he says. Starmer has called for Boris Johnson to give ""as much detail as possible"" in his roadmap out of lockdown in the week of 22 February. He wants to know ""roughly when the vaccination programme will be finished, the measures for controlling the variant and therefore what the milestones are"", he says. Starmer says the government needs to ""stop putting out mixed messages"" over whether UK residents can expect to go on a summer holiday this year. ""The prime minister one week was saying he was optimistic about holidays then you've got the transport secretary saying don't book holidays - that isn't helping businesses, it's not helping families,"" he says. Tim MuffettBBC Breakfast Some people who have recovered from Covid-19 have reported a loss of smell, a condition known as anosmia - or distorted tastes and smells, known as parosmia. I've been chatting to three women who tell me they're struggling with these symptoms. Victoria says: ""Going into public toilets is actually quite nice...it just smells of sweet hay"" but ""onions, garlic, coffee, all the things that are meant to smell nice and taste nice, taste revolting."" This video can not be played Covid-19 parosmia: 'Public toilets smell nice to me now' Ben WrightBBC political correspondent The prime minister couldnât bring himself to say people should not book a holiday right now. Instead he advised people to wait for the result of the governmentâs lockdown review in the week of 22 February. So, who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mumâ¦ But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd. The prime minister has just finished giving a Downing Street press briefing, alongside the UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. If you scroll back you can catch up on all the detail but here's a quick recap: Nigel Praities from the Pharmaceutical Journal says that community pharmacies have been a ""vital lifeline"" for people during the pandemic. He warns that they are yet to have their additional costs from the pandemic reimbursed, and he asks how many pharmacies will close before the government tackles the issue. Johnson says that ""community pharmacies provide an outstanding healthcare resource"" for people across the country. He adds that pharmacies can ""play a very important role"" in getting harder to reach people vaccinated. ""People trust pharmacies, they know where to find them,"" he says. He states that he wants to make sure pharmacies are reimbursed as soon as possible. That is the final question and ends the briefing. We will bring you a round-up shortly. The next question is to do with what the latest scientific evidence says about those who have had coronavirus already and if they need the jab. Vallance says if you have had Covid, most people get antibodies, but it is ""really important to get the vaccine as well"" as it will ""give a boost"". He adds: ""It is not a reason to avoid vaccination."" The PM is then asked about proposals for booster jabs in the autumn to tackle new variants. Johnson says: ""We don't see any evidence that the vaccines don't have a beneficial impact against all the variants, and they are all likely to have some beneficial impacts."" But he says it is better to ""get ready for a world where we do have booster jabs in the autumn and maybe beyond"", and to start to think of it as ""a flu jab - something elderly and vulnerable people have every year"".

Care home staff 'without PPE at start of pandemic'MPs say care homes received a fraction of the PPE needed compared with the health service.UK,"Care home staff were without personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic because the government prioritised the NHS, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said care homes received only a fraction of the PPE needed compared with the health service. It said social care ""was only taken seriously after the high mortality rate in care homes became apparent"". The government said it worked ""tirelessly"" to provide PPE. How healthcare workers came to feel 'expendable' NHS gowns suspended due to packaging concern Do NHS staff have the protective gear they need? Hospital gowns that cost Â£122m never used The report from the Public Accounts Committee said many healthcare workers were put in an ""appalling situation"" where they had to care for people with Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19 ""without sufficient PPE to protect themselves from infection"". It said the social care sector did not receive ""anywhere near enough"" to meet its needs. Health and social care staff suffered PPE shortages, it said, with some forced to reuse single-use items as stocks ran ""perilously low"". Between March and July 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care provided NHS trusts with 1.9 billion items of PPE, the equivalent to 80% of their estimated need. The adult social care sector was given 331 million items, accounting for 10% of its requirements. At the same time, about 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes from hospitals without being tested for Covid-19. ""This contributed significantly to the deaths in care homes during the first wave,"" the committee said. Its report said the government had believed it was well placed to cope at the start of the outbreak, as it had a stockpile of PPE. But this was only intended for a flu pandemic and was ""inadequate"" for the coronavirus pandemic. More than Â£12bn was spent by the Department of Health and Social Care between February and July 2020 on 32 billion items of PPE. However, the committee said hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money was ""wasted"" on unusable kit. Staff reported receiving face masks with rotten elastic and, in one case, a box of surgical gowns which was infested with insects. Committee chairman Meg Hillier said frontline workers were left ""without adequate supplies, risking their own and their families' lives to provide treatment and care"". ""The government needs to acknowledge the errors and be better prepared,"" she said. The report came aftertwo highly critical reportspublished by the National Audit Office in November last year. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it worked ""tirelessly to procure, produce and deliver PPE"" to frontline workers.

We will be back with the latest on coronavirus tomorrow. Have a good evening. And here's a look at the UK headlines before we go:  Our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic is coming to a close. A lot has happened today. To sum it all up, here's a round-up of the main global headlines: When the coronavirus hit the UK, Nicola Muirhead, like many photographers, set out to record her experience. She photographed the people and places around her but soon felt the images needed something extra to bring the unseen virus home to the viewer. ""I started investigating ways in which I could metaphorically 'reveal' this unseen virus in my pictures,"" she says, ""to expose its lurking presence in the skin and air and manifest it in my pictures - to identify it - marking this time in place in our history."" Muirhead began to treat the pictures with a variety of ""ritualistic disinfecting"", exposing them to household cleaning products meant to help stop the spread of coronavirus, such as hand sanitiser, soap, and bleach. Here's our gallery of Nicola's work where she talks aboutwhat's next. A D-Day veteran has been sent more than 3,000 cards after a party marking his 100th birthday was cancelled due to lockdown. Tommy Trotter, a former Northumberland fusilier, was ""over the moon"" after seeing the cards laid out at the Don War Memorial Bar in Thornaby, Teesside. Among the messages was a letter from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He said: ""I've never had nowt like this before, it's lovely.""

"Extra cash to remove unsafe cladding expectedThe housing secretary will make a statement later, as thousands face huge bills for safety renovations.","This video can not be played ""I didn't choose any cladding and now I'm going to be skint forever"" Further funding towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding on buildings is expected to be announced by the government. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will make a statement to MPs shortly, but details of the plan are unknown. Thousands of flat-owners are facing huge bills for fire-safety improvements after 2017's Grenfell disaster, when flames spread via combustible cladding. The government announced a Â£1.6bn building safety fund in 2020 to help. But pressure is growing on ministers to increase the pot for residents stuck in the buildings, with a committee of MPs estimating the total cost of the crisis could run to Â£15bn. BBC Newsnightreported last monththat the government had decided to allocate extra funding, possibly running into billions of pounds, to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous materials Fire patrols at our flats 'cost us Â£500,000' More than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders, while residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley said ministers should accept that ""the only tenants who are being asked to pay at the moment are leaseholders"" and confirm they are ""not responsible"". ""They need to provide the money so that remediation can take place,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Buildings should be made safe, they need to be made saleable - which means you can't have liabilities hanging around the necks of individual leaseholders."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast there has been ""substantial help"" available for those facing higher costs, but ""needs are very high"". He acknowledged concerns among leaseholders - referring particularly to those who share ownership with housing associations or local authorities - that they ""may be left out of this"". The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said work was ""either completed or under way"" on around 95% of the residential high-rises identified as having flammable ACM cladding at the start of last year, ""with all works to be completed this year"". ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible and are already backing this with our Â£1.6 billion funding we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a statement said. It added that the government was ""working at pace to develop further financial solutions to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs"". Butdata released last month showed,externalthat cladding removal and repair work had been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. Homebuilder Persimmon said it was putting aside Â£75m ""towards any necessary cladding remediation and safety work"" in 26 developments. They include nine high-rise buildings where cladding may need to be removed - although Persimmon no longer owns the sites - and 17 smaller buildings that may be fitted with unsafe cladding and need investigating. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" says Amy First-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for Â£85,000 in 2017. Inspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" she said. ""With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe."" While the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme. It could cost up to Â£6m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to Â£50,000 each. ""We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,"" Ms Cottenden said. A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said: ""We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist.""

She added: ""Whatever is announced will be too late for those first-time buyers who have already gone bust."" In an open letter to the chancellor, campaigning coalition End Our Cladding Scandal said Mr Jenrick's announcement should not be ""another partial solution"". ""If your government chooses to force us, the innocent victims of this crisis, into lifelong loans, of any size, this will be unacceptable, unfair and completely immoral,"" it said. It said any proposal ""must be adequate in size and scope to fully resolve this quandary"", adding: ""This is not just about billing the taxpayer ever higher amounts, but finding ways to make those who caused the crisis pay."" On Tuesday evening, the National Leasehold Campaigntweeted,externalthat it was ""another sleepless night"" for leaseholders ""worried sick"" about what Mr Jenrick was going to announce.

Romance fraud on rise in coronavirus lockdown,"More than 2.3 million people across Britain used dating apps during the initial coronavirus lockdown according to the Online Dating Association Romance fraud - scamming someone out of money by pretending to want a relationship - has been on the rise during lockdown. According to UK Finance, there was a 20% increase in bank transfer fraud linked to romance scams in 2020 compared to 2019. And Â£68m was lost to such scams in 2020, said the UK's Action Fraud - another increase on the previous year. Organisations warned people to be vigilant ahead of Valentine's Day. Lockdown loneliness exploited Women often victims The advice suggests: online daters should not send any money, allow the other person to access their bank account, transfer money or take out a loan on the other person's behalf neither should they hand over copies of personal documents such as their passport or driving licence or invest money on the other person's advice do not receive or send parcels on the other person's behalf perform a reverse image search on a search engine to see if person is using fake images contact your bank immediately if you think you have fallen for a scam and report it to Action Fraud In both 2019 and 2020, the amount of money lost to romance fraud outstripped that stolen by online shopping fraud, according to Action Fraud, which is the main reporting body in the UK. In 2020, online shopping and auction fraud accounted for Â£63m compared to Â£68m for dating scams. The Covid-19 pandemic has added to the problem. ""The national lockdowns, and other restrictions on our social lives, implemented because of the coronavirus outbreak, have meant more people have been seeking companionship online and this has undoubtedly affected the number of reports we have seen,"" said Pauline Smith, head of Action Fraud. ""Romance scams can leave customers out of love and out of pocket,"" added Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at trade association UK Finance. A widow lost her life savings after being used as a ""money mule"" by a man she fell in love with Victims of romance scams lose money via money transfers, and sending fraudsters gift cards and vouchers or presents such as phones and laptops. Some even provide access to their bank account or bank card. Fraudsters can be very convincing, using emotive language and stories to manipulate people, for instance saying they need money for medical bills. And increasingly, victims are at risk of prosecution as well as having their bank account emptied - as it is revealed that some scammers are now asking them to unwittingly launder money for criminal gangs. ABC News reported,externalon an Australian woman who thought she was falling in love with a US army officer but ended up laundering A$150,000 (Â£83,000) for such a gang. According to data from Lloyds Bank, people aged 55 to 64 are particularly at risk. Like Anna (not her real name) who is in her 50s and a widow: she became prey to her scammer â who called himself Tim â after meeting him on a dating website, initially using its chat facility before switching to WhatsApp. After a few weeks, Tim told Anna he was travelling to Romania to work on a transport project, and asked her to send money. First he asked for small amounts, and then larger ones, eventually defrauding her of Â£320,000. Romance fraud often starts on online dating websites but quickly switches to social media or old-fashioned texting, so there is no evidence of the scam. Sometimes the scammer is more subtle than just asking for money, seeking instead to garner personal information, which can later be used to commit identity fraud. Many victims do not report romance scams because they are embarrassed or ashamed. But for those who do, there is some recourse.  In 2019 banks agreed to a voluntary code which said that if someone ""has taken reasonable care and has any element of vulnerability"" they are more likely to receive a refund. In Anna's case for example, she was able to recover half of what she lost.

"'While in hospital I lost my daughter-in-law'Betty Tovey, 94, was at a field hospital in Llanelli when her relative died with coronavirus.Wales","This video can not be played Covid patients describe what it's like to be cared for in Llanelli's field hospital ""I feel so sorry because I'm 20 years older and I'm still here"". Betty Tovey, 94, was being treated at a field hospital for Covid-19 when her daughter-in-law died with the virus. Now she is ready to go home after six weeks, Betty is looking forward to returning to Penygroes, but it is an occasion marked with sadness. She and other patients have spoken to BBC 5Live, which was given extensive access inside the temporary hospital, housed in a Llanelli bowling centre. ""I kept praying, please God let me go home to them, but unfortunately she was taken,"" Betty continued. Betty Tovey, 94, says she needs to get home to her son who has lost his wife to the virus She shared her story along with a series of other patients at the Carmarthenshire facility, in the weekthe number of deaths with coronavirus in Wales passed 5,000. On the last six weeks, she said: ""I don't remember a lot, there's lots of things I'd like to remember. Live: On the NHS front line ""I just wanted to go to sleep, but thankfully the Lord doesn't want me yet, I've got to go home and help my son, he's lost his wife."" Patients in the hospital are treated to try and get them ready to go home When the coronavirus pandemic struck nearly a year ago,facilities all over the country from sports stadia to theatres were rapidly converted into field hospitals, in a bid to relieved the pressure on hospital wards across Wales. About 12 weeks ago, Hywel Dda University Health Board opened Ysbyty Enfys Selwyn Samuel in Llanelli and Ysbyty Enfys Carreg Las in Pembrokeshire, as a ""step-down"" facilities to help ease pressure on hospital beds. Another weekly fall in Covid deaths in Wales How many vaccines have been given in Wales? Hospital criticised over A&E social distancing At the Selwyn Samuel centre the bowling floor has been transformed into a ""recovery"" hospital ward with 42 patients being treated, mostly in the final stages of recovering from Covid-19. Staff working here are helping to get patients - many of them elderly - back up on their feet, eating and drinking, and doing laps of the bowling floor, ready for the day they can go home. Ceri-Ann Jones says she enjoys talking to the patients and treats them like they are a ""part of the family"" Ceri-Ann Jones was getting ready for a shift in a pub when the first nationwide lockdown was announced, on 23 March. Now, after hearing the pressure the NHS has been under, she is helping care for Betty and other patients after starting work as a domestic assistant on the ward. ""I thought I was fit and healthy, to a degree, and when Covid started kicking off... if you could get your hands dirty and help out, why not?"". Ceri-Ann said that working on the ward had opened her eyes and she now wanted to train to become a nurse, to keep caring for people in the future. Staff said it was hard to see people breaking rules when they saw the impact of Covid on people's lives She said she would like to bring people who did not believe Covid-19 existed on to the ward to see the lasting impact on patients' and staffs' lives. ""I look at it and think, if my parents or my grandparents were in this situation, how would I want them to be treated, ""she said. ""It's knowing you've made a difference... why wouldn't you want to put a smile on someone's face."" Charles Hughes said his son told him he had been ill in hospital, but he did not remember a thing Charles Hughes spent about three weeks in hospital, but said he had been told about it by his son and does not remember ""a day"" of his time there. But, the 88-year-old said he felt like he was getting better in the hospital. ""I'm well looked after, it's a palace... with the staff, with the food, everything, I couldn't be better well looked after,"" he said. Senior Nurse Manager Sarah Williams said working at the field hospital could be tough but there were so many positives Sarah Williams, a nurse of 32-years, never imagined working in a ward inside a bowling centre, but working with the patients - more than 100 of whom have been treated in 12 weeks - was very rewarding. While it had been positive helping people get ready to go home, the work had been ""challenging at times"", especially with some of her family also contacting the virus. ""There are some really sad stories but there are a lot of positives as well,"" she said. ""The focus is getting them up and about, eating and drinking, giving them that extra care that they need before they go home to the care setting. ""It's a very positive experience for the patients to get that extra bit of care before they go home."" Dr Meinir Jones said she hoped the facility would be able to close sometime this year Dr Meinir Jones, field hospitals clinical lead, said facilities like this field hospital, used to provide an extra level of care before a patient is discharged, were what was needed to ""maintain flow"" in hospitals. The model is different from England's Nightingale Hospital approach, which were temporary hospitals used to provide critical care for patients. She said that while the Llanelli facility could not be used for intensive care, because of workforce issues and technical medical equipment, it had helped to ease pressure. ""It's not just how long a patient spends in intensive care, it's about what happens afterwards... they spend a lot longer on wards afterwards,"" she said. ""I think we have in Wales been able to successfully adopt that step-down model."" Are field hospitals operating in Wales? Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open?

Investor group calls for Tesco healthy food plan,"A group of investors is trying to pressure Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, into selling healthier food and drink amid a growing obesity problem. Investors led by pressure group ShareAction will ask shareholders to vote for their plan. Tesco is due to hold its annual meeting in the summer. The company insists that it already has a plan to make healthy and sustainable food available. The UK has one of the highest rates of obesity in the world and obesity increases the risk of hospitalisation and death from a coronavirus infection, according to Public Health England. If the investor group is successful, it will force Tesco to reveal more about the share of sales it makes on healthier food, and publish annual updates on how well it is improving that share. The investors says rivals Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer have made similar commitments to selling healthier food and that Tesco, with a UK market share of just under 27%, should follow suit. Ignacio Vazquez, senior manager at ShareAction, said: ""As the UK's largest food retailer, Tesco's actions are of systemic importance in tackling obesity. But its prime market position has not yet translated into leadership on this critical issue. ""We hope that Tesco's board will endorse the resolution and grasp the opportunity to help build a healthier UK post-Covid, while also improving its financial sustainability in the long-term."" ShareAction praised recent Tesco initiatives, which showed that price cuts on fruit and vegetables raised sales, and that removing chocolate from prominent promotion spaces cut consumption. A Tesco spokesperson said: ""We are working hard to make it easy for our customers to make healthy choices, and we have set very clear targets on health and sustainability, published in our Little Helps Plan. ""Our reformulation programme has already removed more than 50 billion calories from our products since 2018; our 'helpful little swaps' events offer healthier alternatives to family favourites at the same price; and we have given away more than 100 million pieces of free fruit to children. ""We have also announced a target to increase sales of plant-based meat alternatives by 300% by 2025, and were the first retailer to set a target of this kind."" Backers of the move include Robeco Institutional Asset Management, JO Hambro Capital Management's UK Dynamic Fund and Epworth Investment Management, owned by the Central Finance Board of the Methodist Church. Together, the backers manage Â£140bn of funds. How bad is our obesity problem?

"Extra cash to remove unsafe cladding expectedThe housing secretary will make a statement later, as thousands face huge bills for safety renovations.UK","This video can not be played ""I didn't choose any cladding and now I'm going to be skint forever"" Further funding towards the cost of removing unsafe cladding on buildings is expected to be announced by the government. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will make a statement to MPs shortly, but details of the plan are unknown. Thousands of flat-owners are facing huge bills for fire-safety improvements after 2017's Grenfell disaster, when flames spread via combustible cladding. The government announced a Â£1.6bn building safety fund in 2020 to help. But pressure is growing on ministers to increase the pot for residents stuck in the buildings, with a committee of MPs estimating the total cost of the crisis could run to Â£15bn. BBC Newsnightreported last monththat the government had decided to allocate extra funding, possibly running into billions of pounds, to speed up the removal of unsafe cladding. Fire-cladding costs 'are taking over our lives' New body to ban dangerous materials Fire patrols at our flats 'cost us Â£500,000' More than three and a half years since the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. After Grenfell, round-the-clock fire patrols known as ""waking watches"" were put in place in hundreds of buildings, costing groups of leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. Fixing safety faults has seen costs surge for leaseholders, while residents have seen insurance costs on buildings with fire safety problems rocket. Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley said ministers should accept that ""the only tenants who are being asked to pay at the moment are leaseholders"" and confirm they are ""not responsible"". ""They need to provide the money so that remediation can take place,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Buildings should be made safe, they need to be made saleable - which means you can't have liabilities hanging around the necks of individual leaseholders."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast there has been ""substantial help"" available for those facing higher costs, but ""needs are very high"". He acknowledged concerns among leaseholders - referring particularly to those who share ownership with housing associations or local authorities - that they ""may be left out of this"". The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said work was ""either completed or under way"" on around 95% of the residential high-rises identified as having flammable ACM cladding at the start of last year, ""with all works to be completed this year"". ""We all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible and are already backing this with our Â£1.6 billion funding we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes,"" a statement said. It added that the government was ""working at pace to develop further financial solutions to protect leaseholders from unaffordable costs"". Butdata released last month showed,externalthat cladding removal and repair work had been completed on only 58% of social housing blocks and 30% of private sector buildings. Homebuilder Persimmon said it was putting aside Â£75m ""towards any necessary cladding remediation and safety work"" in 26 developments. They include nine high-rise buildings where cladding may need to be removed - although Persimmon no longer owns the sites - and 17 smaller buildings that may be fitted with unsafe cladding and need investigating. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" says Amy First-time buyer Amy Cottenden, who is 28, bought a one-bed flat in Metis Tower in the centre of Sheffield for Â£85,000 in 2017. Inspections of the 14-storey building in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy revealed it had the same type of flammable ACM cladding and other safety faults. ""It is absolutely terrifying knowing that you are stuck here,"" she said. ""With lockdown, they are saying not to go out, but you are in a building where all you want to do is not be in it. You can't leave. You can't sell. My flat isn't worth anything until it is made safe."" While the government's Building Safety Fund is paying for the Grenfell-style cladding to be removed, the building has other fire safety faults, including missing fire breaks, that aren't covered by the scheme. It could cost up to Â£6m to fix. Flat owners fear they may face huge bills of up to Â£50,000 each. ""We can't pay it and we shouldn't have to pay it. It is not our fault. We could all go bankrupt because of this,"" Ms Cottenden said. A spokesperson for Rendall & Rittner, the company which manages Metis Tower, said: ""We understand and sympathise with residents and owners about the uncertainty that this situation is causing and will do all we can to assist."" Read more:Cladding crisis: 'Delays could bankrupt us' Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, said it was ""shameful"" that ""hundreds of thousands of people are still trapped in unsafe homes"". She added: ""Whatever is announced will be too late for those first-time buyers who have already gone bust."" In an open letter to the chancellor, campaigning coalition End Our Cladding Scandal said Mr Jenrick's announcement should not be ""another partial solution"". ""If your government chooses to force us, the innocent victims of this crisis, into lifelong loans, of any size, this will be unacceptable, unfair and completely immoral,"" it said. It said any proposal ""must be adequate in size and scope to fully resolve this quandary"", adding: ""This is not just about billing the taxpayer ever higher amounts, but finding ways to make those who caused the crisis pay."" On Tuesday evening, the National Leasehold Campaigntweeted,externalthat it was ""another sleepless night"" for leaseholders ""worried sick"" about what Mr Jenrick was going to announce.

LiveLiveSenate votes to go ahead with Trump trial5 minutes ago,"Donald Trump's impeachment trial will go ahead in the US Senate after a vote declaring it constitutional He is accused of inciting his supporters ahead of a deadly riot at the US Capitol on 6 January Six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats and voted to proceed Seventeen Republicans will need to turn against their former president to convict him Democrat Jamie Raskin played new, hard-hitting footage of Trump supporters ransacking the Capitol The defence lawyers argued it was unconstitutional to put a private citizen through this process And they accused the Democrats of acting out of spite, to remove a political rival Marianna Brady and Ritu Prasad Thank you for joining our live coverage of day one in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. You can keep following the story on our site, here. Here's a look back at today's key moments: It all picks back up again tomorrow at1200 EST (1700 GMT). Our live coverage will begin here at1100 EST (1600 GMT). See you then! Today's writers and editors were Tom Geoghegan, Marianna Brady, Sarah Fowler, Ritu Prasad, Sam Cabral, Tara McKelvey, Anthony Zurcher, Sam Granville, Georgina Rannard, Holly Honderich and Alice Cuddy. It's been a long day of impeachment proceedings, but if you haven't had your fill of US politics yet, we understand. If you want to read more about the Capitol riot, check out these stories:  Or are you looking for more on impeachment? This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What the Proud Boys did before president's speech The storming of the Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. The impeachment trial comes down to this one question: Did Donald Trump incite the insurrection of the Capitol on 6 January? No matter what the Senate decides, the repercussions of that day tell us a frightening truth about the divided American public. BBC Newsnight's Gabriel Gatehouse takes a closer look at the movements of far-right extremists on the day of the riot - and how the Proud Boys were already heading to the Capitol before President Trump had even spoken at his rally. But the vast majority of those arrested for their actions on 6 January did not have affiliations to such groups before the siege. Experts say that many more Americans have become radicalised since the election and warn that the risk of political violence could grow. A month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people,which you can read about here. Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington What can be done if Republicans refuse to convict Trump?- Cody, Ohio, USA Yes. The senators could censure Trump. This would be a formal denunciation and condemnation by the Senate, but holds no real penalties. Still, it would be a defeat for a man who once described himself as the âgreatest of all presidentsâ. Very little will be remembered from the first day of Trump's impeachment trial, aside from the opening video. After hours of arguments, the montage of footage from the Capitol riot that Democrats played remains the top search term in the US. It's garnered praise online, with one lawyer who worked on Trump's first impeachment calling it a ""smart"" move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Journalists who covered the proceedings on Tuesday said the acoustics of the Senate amplified the sounds. ""The sounds of the montage seemed to echo a lot more in the chamber, filling it with the screams and yells of the mob,"" wrote Emily Cochrane. ""When the video concluded, it was silent in the chamber."" Reporter James Poniewozik said that it included footage he had not seen before while MSNBC host Tiffany Cross commented on how powerful the montage was. Allow Twitter content?

Here's a look at what Republicans are saying about this first day of impeachment proceedings. TexasSenator John Cornyntold NBC he was not impressed by the Trump defence team. ""The presidentâs lawyer just rambled on and on,"" Cornyn said. ""Iâve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments and that was not one of the finest Iâve seen."" But Alabama CongressmanMo Brookscontinued to back the president (he was among the lawmakers to dispute the election results last month). ""Impeaching Donald Trump for inciting a riot is akin to impeaching him for Russian collusion â neither of which happened and both of which are Socialist Democrat concoctions,"" he tweeted. A Trump campaign account, meanwhile, tweeted a criticism of having Democrat Patrick Leahy chair the session. (Typically ensuring trial rules are followed is the job of the Chief Supreme Court Justice, but he declined.) ""Imagine having a 'trial' where the 'judge' had already voted to convict the defendant? 

That's what happens in banana republics, third world dictatorships and now the United States Senate. SAD!"" Conservative punditAnn Coultershared an opinion piece from political news site The Hill that suggested Republicans could unite the country by convicting Trump, commenting: ""And Democrats could unite the nation by giving them a wall in return!"" Rab is a doctor who has been very frustrated with Trump over the past four years and says his irresponsible conduct since the election merits his impeachment. He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Yes. Even before the violence at the Capitol, he made comments calling people to come to DC on 6 January and ""stop the steal"". When the president of the United States says something, people believe it. He also made comments encouraging people to fight like hell and scared them that they wouldn't have a country anymore if they didn't. We need to hold people accountable for doing things that are wrong. Six Republican senators just joined their Democratic colleagues in voting to move the trial forward. They are Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah. You may have heard most of those names before - Murkowski, Collins, Sasse, Toomey and Romney had previously taken a similar vote upholding the constitutionality of the trial proceedings. But Bill Cassidy is a noteworthy name on the list: he had previously voted to dismiss the trial. Cassidy later told CNN the House prosecutors made ""very good arguments"", noting he'd always planned to approach the trial ""with an open mind"" and as an ""impartial juror"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter Well, that should about do it. There are going to be four days of arguments, Senate questions and, perhaps, witnesses. The final outcome, however, is all but certain. When the first substantive vote of the impeachment trial was taken on Tuesday â a vote about whether to have a trial at all â only six Republicans sided with all 50 Democrats to proceed. Thatâs well short of the 17 Republicans who would be necessary to convict. And if there arenât 17 Republicans who think there should be a trial at all, it seems unlikely that the House impeachment managers are going to be able to change enough minds. Sam voted twice for Donald Trump but has turned his back on him, saying the attack on the Capitol ""made me sick to my stomach"". He is a member of our voter panel. Do you think Donald Trump should be convicted by the Senate? There is not enough direct correlation and evidence for him to be convicted, so he should not be. But the impeachment in the House was a good slap on the wrist. There needed to be some sort of response to the way he handled - or didnât handle - the peaceful transfer of power. I don't think Trump himself was directly responsible for getting people riled up but I do think that he set the stage for what happened. But pursuing a conviction is just another means of tribalistic partisan politics that will further divide the country because there are still millions of Americans who voted for Trump and really like him. Alright, so in the last four hours, we've heard from House prosecutors and the Trump defence team. And we've just had a speedy vote on whether or not the trial is constitutional and can continue (it is, and it will). Now what?  Both Republicans and Democrats are keen on a speedy trial, US media report, so we could see a vote on conviction as early as this weekend if there are no witnesses to hear from. The Senate has voted 56-44 that it is constitutional to hold a trial for a president who is no longer in office. This means Donald Trump's second impeachment trial will continue, starting tomorrow. Only a simple majority was required on the measure. Now that arguments from both sides have concluded, the Senate is voting on whether or not to go forward with Trump's impeachment trial. BBC editors in Washington have cast a critical eye on how well the defence lawyers are making their case. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Samantha GranvilleBBC News, Capitol Hill There is only one camera in the Senate chambers and it's not on the senators. Here's what's going on that you can't see. Republican Senators Murkowski, Collins and Graham are the studious notetakers. Senator Josh Hawley, also a Republican, was reading papers that didnât seem to be marked with the symbols of the House - so they probably weren't trial-related documents. Senator Sasse looked confused at one point and seemed to just shake his head before sharing a whisper with Senators Scott, Burr and Portman. Democratic Senator Sanders is staring straight ahead and listening to the arguments. Fellow Democrat Senator Booker is in the back of the room. He appeared to get a little restless and stood up and leaned against the back wall of the chamber. The former president's lawyers continue their arguments that the impeachment trial is unconstitutional. Later tonight, the Senate will hold a vote on whether or not the trial can take place. Here are some of defence attorney David Schoen's arguments: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Trump is facing legal troubles in Washington, and at home in Palm Beach, Florida, too. He bought his ocean-side property, an estate called Mar-a-Lago, in 1985, and spent part of his winters there. Then, after leaving the White House, he moved in. Some of his neighbours want him out, saying he will bring down property values, and have talked about evicting him. They say an agreement that was reached nearly 30 years ago, one that turned the estate into a private club, does not allow anyone to live there on a permanent basis unless they work on the premises. Trump, through a lawyer, has argued that he should be allowed to stay, as an employee. The issue is being discussed at a Palm Beach Town Council meeting on Tuesday. One of his former employees, Wes Blackman, a former project director at Mar-a-Lago, says that Trump will see the designation as an employee not as a demotion, but as an opportunity, a loophole that will allow him to stay where he is. The designation as an employee is ""convenient and expedient"", says Blackman. ""It gets him out of a tight situation."" Besides, says Blackman, the fight with his neighbours in Florida is not the biggest problem Trump is facing today. Over the course of the day, Blackman has been watching the impeachment trial in Washington, wondering how his old boss will fare. Now up, Trump lawyer David Schoen. He begins by saying it's an honour to appear in this chamber, but ""that is tempered by a feeling of grave concern"". ""My overriding emotion is frankly wanting to cry for what I believe these proceedings will do to our great long-enduring Constitution and to the American people on both sides of the great divide that now characterises our nation."" Schoen says the trial is unconstitutional and ""wrong as wrong can be"". He adds that while Democrats claim the proceedings are for accountability if that was the case, they would wait for a full investigation. He says the trial is a ""chance for partisan politicians to eliminate Donald Trump from the American political scheme and to disenfranchise"" the millions of people who voted for him. Schoen says the trial is for ""pure, raw, misguided partisanship"". Much of Trump lawyer Castor's speech has focused on appealing to the patriotism of the Senate. ""The top responsibility of a US senator and the top characteristic that you all have in common... there isn't a single one of you who doesn't consider yourself a patriot of the US."" ""That is why this attack on the constitution will not prevail,"" he says, reiterating his argument that the impeachment of Trump is unconstitutional. Trump attorney, Bruce Castor Jr, denounces the Capitol riot and says those responsible ought to be prosecuted. He adds that there is a reasonable desire to ask ""how do we make them pay?"" But Castor argues that Trump should not be the scapegoat for this tragedy. ""We expect US senators to not react to popular will and emotions, but do what is right,"" Castor says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Executive must fund Troubles pension, court rulesStormont and Westminster have been involved in a long-running row over cash for the scheme.Northern Ireland","Stormont's Executive Office is under a legal duty to fund a pension for people badly injured in the Troubles, Northern Ireland's Court of Appeal has ruled. The scheme is due to open for applications next month but it is not clear who will fund the payments. Stormont and Westminsterhave been engaged in a long-running rowabout who is responsible. On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal said it was giving the parties four weeks to find a solution. It said if that was not possible the case would be relisted to include Stormont's Department of Finance as an additional notice party. A spokesperson for the department said Finance Minister Conor Murphy had been pressing Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis to meet him about the pension since September. A UK government spokesperson said Mr Lewis had ""always been clear"" that the responsibility for funding the scheme lay with the Stormont Executive.Â Â It is understood the NI secretary has agreed to meet Stormont ministers and has asked for more detail about estimated costs and wider spending plans. The pension scheme was initially approved at Westminster when devolution in Northern Ireland had collapsed. What's the trouble with the Troubles pension? Victims 'outraged' over Troubles payment row Since power-sharing returned in January 2020, estimates from Stormont for the cost of the scheme have been suggested to run toas high as Â£800m. The executive argues that Westminster should help fund it, as it is a UK-wide scheme and people injured outside Northern Ireland will be able to apply. Last year, a judge ruled that the Executive Officewas acting unlawfullyin delaying Troubles pensions, following a legal challenge from some victims. Tuesday's appeal was brought by Brian Turley, one ofthose known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early-1970s. In the ruling, Northern Ireland's Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan said there was a legal duty on the Executive Office regarding the funding, to ensure payments could be made. He backed submissions that there is no discretion involved but said the court expressed ""no view"" on the political dispute between the Stormont Executive and Northern Ireland Office. Brian Turley instigated the latest court action Speaking after the hearing, Mr Turley said the judgement confirmed there were ""no justifiable reasons"" for delaying the payments to victims. ""The need to keep taking cases to court to obtain what I am entitled to is another form of torture,"" he said. Alan McBride from Wave Trauma Centre told BBC Newsline that he was ""disappointed"" that it had been left to the courts system to make progress with the scheme. ""It is up now to the executive and Northern Ireland Office to sit down around the table like mature adults and sort this out once and for all."" DUP leader and First Minister Arlene Foster said the ruling was ""reassuring"" for victims and that she looked forward to payments being issued. ""Whilst the payments will be made from the Northern Ireland Executive, there is a strong argument that the government should be increasing the NI budget accordingly to fund the pension,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in's Linda Dillon said her party was committed to ensuring payments were made as quickly as possible, but insisted the executive alone does not have the resources to deliver it. Stormont's Justice Minister Naomi Long said she hoped Stormont and Westminster could agree a resolution. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chair of Stormont's Executive Office Committee, the SDLP's Colin McGrath said it was ""welcome"" that a four-week deadline had been set. ""While the British government clearly must meet their financial commitments to this scheme, the public row between the Secretary of State and Finance Minister is unedifying and also serves to re-traumatise victims and survivors,"" he said. Ulster Unionist assembly member (MLA) Doug Beattie described the ruling as the ""latest abject failure"" in supporting the needs of Troubles victims. ""The Executive Office has not only a moral obligation but now a legal one to provide the funding to this scheme and end the uncertainty for those who have spent years suffering as a result of injuries caused by no fault of their own,"" he said. The scheme is due to run for two or three decades and payments are to be backdated to 2014, the year in which it was first agreed. Last August, Stormont's Department of Justice was designated to administer the scheme. But in January, the Department of Financedid not set aside fundingfor payments in the draft budget for 2021-22, only the administrative cost of the pension. The legislation came on to the statute book in January 2020. To qualify, applicants must have an injury which is severe and permanent and caused by no fault of their own. That can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example. The scheme covers violence related to the Northern Ireland Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe. Non-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply - such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974. People will get between Â£2,000 and Â£10,000 a year for the rest of their lives. Upon their death, a spouse or carer, will get the payments for a further 10 years. The scheme is a recognition that criminal injuries awards from decades ago were largely inadequate. What's the trouble with the Troubles pension?
