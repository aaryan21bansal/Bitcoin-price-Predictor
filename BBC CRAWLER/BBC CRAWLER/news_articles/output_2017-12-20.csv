Stepfather jailed over water park death,"Charlie Dunn was pulled from the Blue Lagoon children's pool at Bosworth Water Park The stepfather of a five-year-old boy who drowned at a water park has been jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Paul Smith pleaded guilty to manslaughter by gross negligence over the death of Charlie Dunn. Charlie, who could not swim,was found in a poolat Bosworth Water Park in Leicestershire on 23 July 2016. Smith, 36, of Tamworth, denied letting the boy wander off alone for more than two hours butchanged his plea during a trialat Birmingham Crown Court. More on this and other stories from the East Midlands Paul Smith and Lynsey Dunn from Tamworth, Staffordshire, were sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court The boy's mother, Lynsey Dunn, 28, also of Tamworth, Staffordshire, had a charge of manslaughter dropped. She was given an eight-month suspended sentence after she admitted neglecting Charlie in a separate incident in 2015, when a neighbour prevented him driving a toy car onto a main road. The court was told Smith was heard swearing and blaming others after Charlie - who was placed on the child protection register in 2012 - went missing while unsupervised. Charlie was left to ""fend for himself"" in a pool which had signs warning that children must be supervised. One father who was in the pool had to explain to another parent that Charlie was not his son, Mrs Justice Jefford recounted. The court heard Smith has 10 previous convictions for 28 crimes and was a ""person of interest"" to Staffordshire social services. They had become involved with Charlie when he was 14 months old and put a child protection plan in place for him. Mary Prior QC, prosecuting, said Smith ""had a status of being a risk to children"", but there was no evidence of Charlie having come to harm when the plan became effective. Staffordshire County Council is now conducting a serious case review into Charlie's death. Lynsey Dunn pleaded guilty to neglecting a child In sentencing, Mrs Justice Jefford said she did not doubt the defendants ""had genuine love and affection for Charlie"", but said Smith was ""completely indifferent"" to the boy's ""whereabouts and safety"". ""This was not a case in which there was an isolated and momentary lapse in care and supervision,"" she said. The judge also praised three boys, aged 10, 11 and 12, who pulled Charlie from the pool, saying it ""must have been a horrific experience for them"". Smith was sentenced to five years and two months for manslaughter, with a consecutive two-year term handed down for threatening to petrol-bomb the home of a witness. He was also given a further four months for driving while disqualified.

'Longest-frozen' embryo born 24 years on,"This video can not be played Emma's mother called her ""a sweet, sweet miracle"" A baby has been born from an embryo frozen for nearly 25 years - possibly the longest gap between conception and birth since IVF began. The embryo was donated by a family in the US and has become the first child for a woman who would herself have been only one when the baby was conceived. The donated embryo that would become Emma Wren Gibson, a healthy baby girl, was thawed in March and transferred to mum Tina Gibson's uterus. Emma was born in November. ""Do you realise I'm only 25? This embryo and I could have been best friends,"" Mrs Gibson, now 26, of eastern Tennessee told CNN. ""I just wanted a baby. I don't care if it's a world record or not,"" she added. Baby Emma was conceived a year and half after her mum's own birth The faith-based National Embryo Donation Center provided the fertilised embryo, which doctors there refer to as ""snow babies"" because of how long they are kept frozen. The organisation encourages couples who do not want additional children to donate unneeded embryos after their families are complete, so that other couples can try to become parents. The Americans who 'adopt' other people's embryos Modern Family star's battle over embryos Tina and Benjamin Gibson turned to the Knoxville-based organisation after Mr Gibson, who has cystic fibrosis, was found to have fertility issues. Baby Emma was conceived in October 1992 - a year and half after her mum's own birth. The 24-year-old embryo is believed to have been cryopreserved for longer than any other viable human embryo. ""Emma is such a sweet miracle,"" Mr Gibson said. ""I think she looks pretty perfect to have been frozen all those years ago."" Neither parent is biologically related to their new daughter.

Travelling circus wild animal ban agreedMSPs unanimously back legislation banning the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Scotland.5h5 hours agoScotland politics,"Legislation banning the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Scotland has been passed. The bill, which bans the use of non-domesticated animals for performance or exhibition in travelling shows, does not apply to static circuses. MSPs unanimously signed off the ban, the first of its kind in the UK. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the move would send a message to the world that Scotland does not condone the misuse of wild animals. There are not currently any travelling circuses based in Scotland which use wild animals. However, a Scottish government survey found that more than 95% of respondents were in favour of a ban, and legislation was introduced at Holyrood on ""ethical"" grounds. The ban does not apply to static circuses, but a circus leader warned MSPs during committee consideration thata law on such grounds ""will eventually close your zoos"". Ms Cunningham conceded that such travelling circuses ""rarely"" visit Scotland, but called it ""a preventative measure based on ethical concerns"". She said: ""This is an important act that will not only prevent travelling circuses ever showing wild animals in Scotland in the future, but will demonstrate to the wider world that we are one of the growing number of countries that no longer condones the use of wild animals in this way."" She said travelling circuses which do not feature wild animals ""will always be welcome in Scotland"". Roseanna Cunningham said the bill was a ""preventative measure"" Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron said the legislation meant ""we will finally and at last truly be able to say Nelly the Elephant has packed her trunk and said goodbye to the circus"". Labour's Claudia Beamish also spoke in favour, and said she hoped static circuses would be subject to a similar ban in future. Green MSP Mark Ruskell said it was ""unethical"" to make animals live in circuses their whole lives, while Lib Dem Liam McArthur also strongly backed the bill. MSPs had raised concerns earlier in the legislative process about a lack of definitions in the bill, including a definition of a travelling circus. This was added at committee stage, which also featured a lengthy debate about what constitutes a wild animal - including references to alpacas, wallabies, raccoon dogs and even rabbits. With members reassured by the amendments, the bill passed its final vote unanimously. A ban on wild animals in all circuses in the Republic of Irelandis to come into force from 1 January 2018. A total of 18 other EU countries have banned or restricted the use of wild animals in travelling circuses, in addition to 14 other countries, but a 2007 review by the UK government found insufficient evidence to support a science-based ban on welfare grounds.

She made her final appearance on the network on Tuesday, fronting daytime programme Daily Pop and later E! News. Sadler said in a post on her website,external: ""There was a massive disparity in pay between my similarly situated male co-host and myself.  He was making close to double my salary for the past several years."" 'Why I invented the glass ceiling phrase' ""How can I remain silent when my rights under the law have been violated?

EU acts against Poland judiciary reforms,"Thousands of people across Poland have held protests against the proposed reforms The European Union has launched unprecedented disciplinary measures against Poland, saying its judicial reforms threaten the rule of law. It said 13 new laws in two years have allowed the government to ""interfere significantly"" in the judiciary. Poland has been given three months to address the concerns. In defiance of the EU move, President Andrzej Duda signed into law two bills reforming the Supreme Court and the National Council of the Judiciary. President Duda: ""I have taken a decision to sign these bills"" Mr Duda said this would deepen democracy in Poland, improve the justice system and restore citizens' faith in the judiciary. Poland's conservative government called the EU decision ""political"". It has repeatedly stated that the reforms are needed to curb inefficiency and corruption. After almost two years monitoring the situation in Poland, the European Commission - the EU executive - said this was a matter of ""common concern"" for the 28-member bloc. At a meeting in Brussels, the Commission decided to launch disciplinary measures, called Article 7, and asked Warsaw to: Not apply lower retirement age to current judges Remove the discretionary power of the president to prolong the mandate of Supreme Court judges Remove the new retirement regime for judges including the discretionary powers of the Minister of Justice Restore the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal The Commission's deputy head, First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, who had conducted talks with the Polish government led by the Law and Justice party (PiS), said there was ""no other option"" as the ""entire structure was affected"". WATCH: Why is Poland worrying the EU? Mr Timmermans said it was with ""heavy heart"" that he announced the measures ""After two years of trying for dialogue, of course we are frustrated that we haven't achieved what we want to, so now we're encouraging the council and Parliament to support us,"" he said. All member states will now be asked to decide whether Poland is violating EU standards. Such a ruling needs the backing of 22 out of the 28 states. Any possible sanctions would only come at a later stage. But Mr Timmermans said that Article 7 could be revoked if Poland addressed the points within the three-month period. The sanctions could lead to the suspension of Poland's voting rights at EU summits. But Hungary has said it would block such a move, known as the ""nuclear option"", that requires the approval of all member states. The row underlines an escalation of tensions between western countries and eastern, former Communist countries within the EU, correspondents say. Other sensitive issues include media independence and immigration. By Adam Easton, BBC News, Warsaw Poland's governing party says the judicial system needs deep reform because it is inefficient, slow and has never been ""decommunised"", in other words, communist-era judges and collaborators of that regime are still presiding over trials. It is perhaps ironic then, that the party's point man on judicial reform, the PiS MP Stanislaw Piotrowicz, is a former communist-era prosecutor. According to a recent opinion poll, 81% of Poles agree the court system needs reform. They were not asked whether they agreed with the party's solutions. The public's main grievances in order of importance were that trials drag on far too long, the proceedings themselves are too complicated and corrupt judges. PiS says its reforms would re-establish public trust in the judiciary. On TwitterPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the reform was deeply needed,externaland that ""Poland is as devoted to the rule of law as the rest of the EU"". He added: ""The dialogue between the Commission and Warsaw needs to be both open and honest. I believe that Poland's sovereignty and the idea of United Europe can be reconciled."" Poland country profile Mr Morawiecki, who took office this month, has said that the EU has taken a one-sided view and that his country is entitled to carry out reforms. The proposals have sparked street protests. Following the announcement, a spokesman for the prime minister said talks could resume in January. British Prime Minister Theresa May, who is due to meet Mr Morawiecki at a summit in Warsaw on Thursday, will raise her concerns over the issue, a spokesman said.

EU says Brexit transition to end by 2021,"A ""transition period"" after the UK leaves the EU should not continue beyond 31 December 2020, Brussels says. This would put a 21-month limit on the temporary arrangement - the UK says it should last for about two years. And some business groups have called for a much longer transition period once the UK leaves in March 2019. The terms of the transition period, which the UK calls an implementation phase, have yet to be negotiated between the two sides. The EU says the UK will have to continue to follow its rules and cannot adopt an ""a la carte"" approach. It has just published itsguidelines,externalfor the next phase of Brexit negotiations. These talks will initially focus on agreeing the precise terms of the transition phase, before moving on to the UK and EU's long-term future relationship. It will be a temporary period after the UK leaves the EU and before the final arrangements kick in. Both sides have talked about having such an arrangement, although they use different names for it. The UK says the ""implementation phase"" will avoid a ""cliff edge"" for businesses on Brexit day. The European Commission's guidelines state that the UK should continue to follow EU law and stay in the European customs union and single market during the transition phase. Rulings of the European Court of Justice will continue to apply, it says. ""The transition period needs to be clearly defined and precisely limited in time,"" the EU says. ""The commission recommends that it should not last beyond 31 December 2020."" This date marks the end of the EU's seven-year budget cycle. Giving evidence to a committee of MPs, Prime Minister Theresa May said a 31 December 2020 cut-off offered a ""neatness"" for the EU, but suggested the length of the transition phase would be a matter for the negotiations. Long-term, the UK has already said it plans to leave the customs union and single market and end the supremacy of EU court rulings as part of Brexit. Some Brexit-supporting Tory MPs have warned the UK could become a ""colony"" of the EU during the transition period if it continues to closely follow the same rules. Looking beyond the transition phase, the UK is hoping to strike a ""comprehensive"" and ""bespoke"" trade deal with the European Union to replace its membership of the single market and customs union. Talks on this have not started and the European Union says it will not have been fully agreed by the time the UK leaves in March 2019. But Mrs May disagrees - asked earlier whether she still believes the entire agreement can be negotiated by Brexit day, she said: ""That is what we are working to and that is what I believe we can do."" The prime minister said the UK would ""start off at a different point"" from other countries because of its current trade relationship with the EU. The overseas territory of Gibraltar - whose sovereignty is disputed by Spain - has been raised as a potential sticking point in Brexit negotiations. The EU has said that Spain must agree to any arrangement between the UK and the EU applying to Gibraltar, a stance reiterated in the latest negotiating guidelines. Asked whether he expected Spain to agree to the transitional arrangement covering Gibraltar, Mr Barnier said decisions on the issue would be ""made for the 27, unanimously, by consensus"". Later in Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May was asked to promise not to enter into any agreement that excluded Gibraltar. She said the UK would not exclude Gibraltar from either the temporary implementation period or the long-term future agreement with the EU.

What Green said in resignation letter,"Prime Minister Theresa May has sacked Damian Green as First Secretary of State amid claims that pornographic material was found on a Commons computer in 2008. Replying to his letter of resignation, she recalls the pair's lengthy friendship and how they entered Parliament together in 1997. Here is the full text of both her reply and his notice of resignation. I am extremely sad to be writing this letter. We have been friends and colleagues throughout our whole political lives - from our early days at university, entering the House of Commons at the same election, and serving alongside each other both in Opposition and in Government. As Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and as First Secretary of State, you have brought great wisdom, good sense and a commitment to helping the most vulnerable to my Cabinets in this Parliament and the last. I have greatly appreciated your hard work and the contribution you have made to my team, just as I did at the Home Office, where you served as Immigration Minister and Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, helping to drive through important but often difficult reforms. Like you, I know the vast majority of our police to be diligent and honourable public servants, working hard to protect the public and maintain law and order. But I shared the concerns raised from across the political spectrum when your Parliamentary office was raided in 2008 when you were a shadow Home Office Minister holding the then Labour Government to account. And I share the concerns, raised once again from across the political spectrum, at the comments made by a former officer involved in that case in recent weeks. I am glad that the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police has condemned that, made clear that police officers' duty of confidentiality endures after they leave the force, and that the Metropolitan Police's professional standards department are reviewing the comments which have been made. When allegations were raised about your personal conduct, I asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish as far as possible the facts of the case and provide advice on whether or not there had been a breach of the Ministerial Code. He has produced a thorough report which concludes that your conduct as a minister has generally been both professional and proper. You have expressed your regret for the distress caused to Ms Maltby following her article about you and the reaction to it. I appreciate that you do not recognise the events Ms Maltby described in the article, but you do recognise that you made her feel uncomfortable and it is right that you have apologised. I know that you share my determination to ensure that everyone who wants to play their part in our political life should feel able to do so - without fear or harassment, and knowing they can speak out if they need to. Equally, it is right that those who put themselves forward to serve the public should also be accorded the respect of a private life within the law. I have also carefully considered the report's conclusions in relation to two statements you made on 4 and 11 November which you now accept were inaccurate and misleading. This falls short of the Seven Principles of Public Life and is a breach of the Ministerial Code - a conclusion which has been endorsed by Sir Alex Allan, the Independent Adviser on Ministers' Interests. While I can understand the considerable distress caused to you by some of the allegations which have been made in recent weeks, I know that you share my commitment to maintaining the high standards which the public demands of Ministers of the Crown. It is therefore with deep regret, and enduring gratitude for the contribution you have made over many years, that I asked you to resign from the Government and have accepted your resignation. Yours ever Theresa Dear Prime Minister, I regret that I've been asked to resign from the government following breaches of the Ministerial Code, for which I apologise. It has been a privilege to serve in your government both as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and as First Secretary of State and Minister for the Cabinet Office. It was also a great pleasure to work with you in the Home Office both as Minister for Immigration and as Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims. Your years as home secretary were a model of reforming institutions in the interests of the wider public. I share and support your vision of a country that works for everyone, using Conservative policies to help those who have for too long been disadvantaged. In particular I am pleased to have published the Race Disparity Audit and to have started the government on a road to a reformed social care system. From the outset I have been clear that I did not download or view pornography on my Parliamentary computers. I accept that I should have been clear in my press statements that police lawyers talked to my lawyers in 2008 about the pornography on the computers, and that the police raised it with me in a subsequent phone call in 2013. I apologise that my statements were misleading on this point. The unfounded and deeply hurtful allegations that were being levelled at me were distressing both to me and my family and it is right that these are being investigated by the Metropolitan Police's professional standards department. I am grateful that the Cabinet Secretary has concluded that my conduct as a minister has generally been both professional and proper. I deeply regret the distress caused to Kate Maltby following her article about me and the reaction to it. I do not recognise the events she described in her article, but I clearly made her feel uncomfortable and for this I apologise. Finally I would like to give heartfelt thanks to my Parliamentary colleagues and my Ashford constituents for the huge support they have shown me in recent weeks. I will continue to argue for the modernising conservatism I have always believed in.

Kuenssberg: May loses trusted ally,"As Theresa May was just ending her year in a better place than her team could have imagined, her deputy has been forced to depart from government, despite his continued insistence that he has done nothing wrong. Damian Green has never been a politician with a huge public persona, or even a hugely well-known character. But he was an extremely important ally of Theresa May. Not just a political friend but a genuine one, close to her for decades. Full report: Damian Green sacked after porn allegations The government, so the joke in Westminster goes, has become ""weak and stable"", with number 10 taking back some control of the agenda in recent weeks. So it is not likely that Mr Green's exit will suddenly unleash another bout of turmoil. But the prime minister clearly took this decision very seriously. His friends in government had believed that he would have been cleared, with one minister telling me today, ""he'll be fine"". After the prime minister received the initial report on Monday from the Cabinet Office official Sue Grey, who found flaws in his account, Mrs May asked for further advice, calling in her independent adviser, Sir Alex Allan. He then, in turn, concluded that there had been breaches of the rules. With that, Mrs May had little choice but to ask him to go. But just as Damian Green's friends say it is a disappointment for him, still insisting that he has done nothing wrong, so too it is a political blow for the prime minister. She is a politician who guards her views, her own persona very closely. To lose one of the few who understood her, who she trusts, leaves her a lonelier figure tonight.

Profile: Who is Damian Green?,"Damian Green has been a confidant of the prime minister for many years Damian Green was one of the prime minister's closest allies in government. A university friend, he entered Parliament at the same time as Theresa May. But now he has been sacked from the cabinetafter an investigation found he breached the ministerial code. Mr Green was a leading Conservative figure for 20 years and had been a friend of the prime minister since they were at Oxford university together in the 1970s. They entered Parliament together in 1997. Later, he served in the Home Office during the coalition government. After she became Tory leader in June 2016, Mrs May brought the 61-year old into her cabinet and a year later named him as her effective deputy by giving him the title of first secretary of state. Since then, the former journalist, who campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum, has been a vital cog in a government beset by divisions and infighting over Brexit. Kuenssberg: He was one of the few who understood May Damian Green resignation letter in full He has played a substantial role behind the scenes chairing key cabinet committees and, more publicly, deputised for Mrs May at Prime Minister's Questions as recently as last week. He spent much of his early political career in the backroom, but the MP for Ashford in Kent has twice hit the headlines in a big way over the past decade. His political future has been in question since journalist and Conservative activist Kate Maltby suggested,in an article in November for the Times,external, he had behaved inappropriately towards her. The 31-year old claimed the minister ""fleetingly"" touched her knee in a pub in 2015 and in 2016 sent her a ""suggestive"" text message which left her feeling ""awkward, embarrassed and professionally compromised"". Damian Green resigns from cabinet 'Thousands' of porn images on MP's computer Minister denies computer porn allegations Mr Green, who is an acquaintance of the journalist's parents, said the claims were ""hurtful"" and ""completely false"". But they were referred to the Cabinet Office for investigation by a top civil servant amid a swirl of allegations about harassment and other misconduct at Westminster. In his resignation letter, Mr Green apologised to Ms Maltby for making her feel ""uncomfortable"". The civil servant's inquiry also considered claims that legal pornography was found on a computer removed from Mr Green's office in the House of Commons in 2008. Damian Green and his wife, Alicia Collinson, have two daughters Date of birth:17 January 1956, aged 61 Job:First secretary of state since June this year. MP for Ashford in Kent since 1997 Education:Reading School in Berkshire, followed by Balliol College, Oxford University Family:Married to barrister Alicia Collinson. The couple have two grown-up daughters Mr Green, shadow immigration minister at the time, was arrested in November 2008 and was held for nine hours as part of a Scotland Yard inquiry into a Home Office leak. The arrest was described as disproportionate and flawed by two inquiries in 2009 and no charges were brought against him. Mr Green, who is married to barrister Alicia Collinson and has two grown-up daughters, has always strenuously denied that he either viewed or downloaded any pornographic material on his Commons computer. But, in his resignation letter, he said he should have been clear that police lawyers talked to his lawyers in 2008 about the pornography, and the police raised the matter again in a phone call in 2013. Although it took Mr Green a comparatively long while to make it to the cabinet table, he is no stranger to being close to the centre of power - giving up a successful career in newspapers and broadcasting to work as an official in John Major's Downing Street in the early 1990s. The Welsh-born politician was on the Tories' pro-European wing, having refused to rule out the UK one day joining the euro, long after many of his colleagues had done so. But unlike EU diehards such as Ken Clarke and Lord Heseltine, who also campaigned on the remain side in the 2016 referendum, he has been on something of a journey and has taken a more pragmatic approach to Brexit.

Collapse of rape trials 'appalling'Two young men were cleared after Met Police officers failed to disclose crucial evidence.2h2 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Rape trial collapse student Liam Allan felt 'pure fear' The collapse of two rape cases in one week was an ""appalling failure"" of the criminal justice system, Attorney General Jeremy Wright has said. Two young men were cleared when it emerged that Met Police officers had failed to disclose crucial evidence. Around 30 rape cases about to go to trial are to be reviewed immediately and ""scores"" more will be looked at. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick admitted that police and prosecutors had made mistakes. She said the 30 cases would not be reinvestigated, but would be reviewed to make sure everything that should have been disclosed had been. The police have a duty to disclose any material to the defence that might support their case. If disclosure fails, innocent people go to jail, says the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman. ""We need to learn lessons,"" Ms Dick told BBC Radio London, and insisted her officers were professional and fair with a ""very complex job"" to do. Collapsed rape trial accused 'betrayed' Why disclosure failings can prove crucial 'It's just sheer incompetence' - says prosecutor Isaac Itiary was charged with raping a child in July but the case collapsed The trial of student Liam Allan, 22, was thrown out at Croydon Crown Court last week. The case collapsed three days into the trial when the police were ordered to hand over phone records showing the alleged victim had pestered Mr Allan for casual sex. Days later, another prosecution case collapsed against Isaac Itiary, who was facing trial at Inner London Crown Court, accused of raping a child. He was charged in July but police only disclosed ""relevant material"" in response to his defence case statement as his trial was about to start. The same Met Police officer had worked on both men's cases. He remains on full duty. The Met said it would review both these cases separately, as well as carrying out the wider review of other live rape cases. Justice minister Dominic Raab said it was ""absolutely right"" for the Met to carry out the review, adding: ""The basic principle of British justice is at stake."" ""The proper disclosure obligations in these two cases have not been discharged, and that is deeply worrying,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""This is not a new thing. It should be made easy by technology,"" he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The cases of Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary are very different. As far as Mr Allan is concerned, the Met has accepted the case ""clearly went wrong"". Crucial information was disclosed to defence barristers so late that the trial was already well under way. In Mr Itiary's case, procedures appear to have been followed, though it's possible police could have acted more quickly. What the cases have done is shine a light on the importance of following disclosure rules. Undoubtedly the squeeze on resources, with cuts in the Crown Prosecution Service and policing and a national shortage of detectives, together with the increased caseload for sexual offences units, have played their part. An inspection report this year also pinpointed inadequacies in training and supervision. Some see the problems as a direct result of a misplaced culture of ""believing"" the victim, where police don't look for or withhold contradictory evidence - but that's an assertion for the attorney general's inquiry to examine. Last week, Attorney General of England and Wales Jeremy Wright ordered a review to look at disclosure processes - including codes of practice, guidelines and legislation relating to sex offences and other crimes - which is expected to report back next year. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Wright said the two cases of the young men were ""obviously appalling failures of the criminal justice system"". ""We need to understand and understand urgently what went wrong in those cases,"" he said. He added that there were already concerns about the disclosure system due to the large amounts of digital information that needed filtering and sifting to find evidence that ought to be disclosed.

Travelling circus wild animal ban agreed,"Legislation banning the use of wild animals in travelling circuses in Scotland has been passed. The bill, which bans the use of non-domesticated animals for performance or exhibition in travelling shows, does not apply to static circuses. MSPs unanimously signed off the ban, the first of its kind in the UK. Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the move would send a message to the world that Scotland does not condone the misuse of wild animals. There are not currently any travelling circuses based in Scotland which use wild animals. However, a Scottish government survey found that more than 95% of respondents were in favour of a ban, and legislation was introduced at Holyrood on ""ethical"" grounds. The ban does not apply to static circuses, but a circus leader warned MSPs during committee consideration thata law on such grounds ""will eventually close your zoos"". Ms Cunningham conceded that such travelling circuses ""rarely"" visit Scotland, but called it ""a preventative measure based on ethical concerns"". She said: ""This is an important act that will not only prevent travelling circuses ever showing wild animals in Scotland in the future, but will demonstrate to the wider world that we are one of the growing number of countries that no longer condones the use of wild animals in this way."" She said travelling circuses which do not feature wild animals ""will always be welcome in Scotland"". Roseanna Cunningham said the bill was a ""preventative measure"" Scottish Conservative MSP Donald Cameron said the legislation meant ""we will finally and at last truly be able to say Nelly the Elephant has packed her trunk and said goodbye to the circus"". Labour's Claudia Beamish also spoke in favour, and said she hoped static circuses would be subject to a similar ban in future. Green MSP Mark Ruskell said it was ""unethical"" to make animals live in circuses their whole lives, while Lib Dem Liam McArthur also strongly backed the bill. MSPs had raised concerns earlier in the legislative process about a lack of definitions in the bill, including a definition of a travelling circus. This was added at committee stage, which also featured a lengthy debate about what constitutes a wild animal - including references to alpacas, wallabies, raccoon dogs and even rabbits. With members reassured by the amendments, the bill passed its final vote unanimously. A ban on wild animals in all circuses in the Republic of Irelandis to come into force from 1 January 2018. A total of 18 other EU countries have banned or restricted the use of wild animals in travelling circuses, in addition to 14 other countries, but a 2007 review by the UK government found insufficient evidence to support a science-based ban on welfare grounds.

Sesame Street to help Syrian refugeesA $100m grant is going to bring Sesame Street characters to help traumatised refugee children in Syria.2h2 hours agoFamily & Education,"Sesame Street will be used to rebuild trust among millions of displaced children from Syria Characters from the children's television programme Sesame Street are going to be used to help teach children displaced by war in Syria. The Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee have won a $100m (Â£75m) grant to help with the ""toxic stress"" on child refugees. It will help children in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria Jeffrey Dunn, head of Sesame Workshop, said Syria's refugee crisis was the ""humanitarian issue of our time"". ""This may be our most important initiative ever,"" he said. The award has been made by the Chicago-based John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation, which wants to make ""big bets"" on influencing major challenges. Sesame Street is going to be used as a way of helping teach traumatised youngsters about relationships It's one of the biggest single philanthropic donations to such an education project - and will fund efforts to provide early years education and tackle the trauma of millions of young refugees created by Syria's conflict. It will produce a customised version of Sesame Street for the young Syrian refugees, available on mobile phones, which will support literacy and numeracy, help to teach about relationships and encourage respect for others. This is being claimed as the biggest such humanitarian intervention for early years learning There will also be child development centres created, where parents will be able to bring children, and where advice, resources and information will be available. Julia Stasch, president of the foundation, said this would be ""the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting"". ""Less than 2% of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. Millions of young refugees are living in countries such as Lebanon and Jordan ""The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education."" David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, said the funding would ""bring hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children"". ""At a time when governments are in retreat, [non-governmental organisations] and philanthropists need to step up, and that is what we are seeing here - and in a big way.""

Trump issues threat over Jerusalem vote,"This video can not be played Trump: ""We're watching those votes"" US President Donald Trump has threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that back a United Nations resolution opposing the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Earlier this month, Mr Trump took that step amid international criticism. ""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."" His comments come ahead of a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution opposing any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk The draft resolution does not mention the US, but says any decisions on Jerusalem should be cancelled. Fourteen states backed a similar motion on Jerusalem at the UN Security Council on Monday Earlier, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley warned member states that President Trump had asked her to report on ""who voted against us"" on Thursday. By Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York President Trump and Ambassador Haley are trying to use American muscle rather than diplomacy to convince countries to vote their way. From Washington's perspective, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital and deciding to move its embassy there is its sovereign right. But that's not how the majority of countries at the United Nations see it. The strongest repudiation came, unsurprisingly, from Washington's critics. Meanwhile, many US allies are brushing off the tough rhetoric as an empty threat. A senior diplomat told me it was clear that the Trump administration was determined to take a stand for Israel at the UN, but he doubted that Washington would cut aid to, say, Egypt - which sponsored the failed Security Council measure on which the General Assembly draft resolution is based. What is certain is that the US will be isolated in the General Assembly on Thursday as the rest of the world once again tells President Trump that it does not agree with his decision on Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel occupied the east of the city, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy. The 193-member UN General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution, which affirmed that any decisions on the status of Jerusalem were ""null and void and must be rescinded"", and urged all states to ""refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the holy city"". The other 14 members of the Security Council voted in favour of the draft, but Ms Haley described it as an ""insult"". The non-binding resolution put forward by Turkey and Yemen for the General Assembly vote mirrors the vetoed Security Council draft. The Palestinian permanent observer at the UN, Riyad Mansour, said he hoped there would be ""overwhelming support"" for the resolution. But on Tuesday, Ms Haley warned in a letter to dozens of member states that encouraged them to ""know that the president and the US take this vote personally"". Allow Twitter content?

IMF sees slower growth on Brexit caution,"IMF chief Christine Largarde The IMF has cut its UK economic growth forecast, blaming Brexit uncertainty. The Fund expects growth of 1.6% this year, down slightly from its previous forecast of 1.7%. It expects growth to slow further next year, to 1.5%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde said uncertainty over the Brexit deal was causing UK firms to delay investment plans. She also said rising inflation, caused by the fall in the pound, and stagnant wages were squeezing spending power. Ms Lagarde said that the government had made ""significant progress"" in reducing the deficit. But she added that relative to growth in the rest of the world, ""the UK is losing out as a result of higher inflation, pressure on wages and incomes and delayed investment"". ""If you look at investment alone, with 2.1% of GDP in investment, with the global economy as it is, and the space the UK economy has in that global economy, it should be rolling at 6%."" Today, the experts fought back. I asked Christine Lagarde at the launch of the IMF report how she responded to critics who said the IMF had been too gloomy before the referendum. It's worth reproducing her answer in full. ""The numbers that we are seeing the economy deliver today are actually proving the point we made a year and a half ago when people said, you are too gloomy,"" she said. ""We were not too gloomy, we were pretty much on the mark, I mean within 0.1% or so - our forecast actually turned out to be the reality of the economy. ""Sterling has depreciated, inflation has gone up, wages have been squeezed as a result, and investments have been slowed down and are certainly lower than where we would expect them to be."" Yes, there are many positives in this report on record high employment and praise for progress on those Brexit talks. But the big takeaway is this. In a world of strong global growth, the IMF stands by its analysis that the UK economy has suffered since the referendum. Ms Lagarde said that increased productivity was key to increasing living standards and that a new trade deal could help restore productivity levels in the UK. She said: ""The shape of the new agreement with the EU will affect productivity performance through its implications for trade, investment and migration. ""The higher are any new barriers to the cross-border flow of services, goods and workers, the more negative the impact would be."" However, Ms Lagarde also said: ""Brexit has the potential to reshape the structure of the UK economy. The impact will depend on the nature of the final agreement and may take many years to fully materialise."" Brexit supporter and economist Ruth Lea said that while the fall in value of the pound had squeezed incomes, it had also helped exports. Ms Lea, who is economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, also said that inflation was likely to fall, which would help company and household finances. The IMF has made dramatic changes to its growth forecasts for the UK since the Brexit referendum. Immediately after the vote in June 2016, it slashed its forecast for 2017 from 2.2% to 1.3%. It then revised it sharply upwards at the start of this year, but since July has been steadily cutting it again. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""The IMF has today played the role of the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future to remind the chancellor that the last seven years of Tory economic failure is undermining our economy. ""As the IMF rightly points out, despite strong global growth, UK economic growth is revised down, and business growth is down despite Tory tax giveaways to big business; while working households this Christmas are struggling with rising prices and lagging wages.""

GCHQ hack tool developers 'over-achieved',"GCHQ can detect the work of hackers around the globe The UK has substantially increased its hacking capabilities in recent years, an official report says. This includes the ability to attack other country's communications, weapons systems and even infrastructure. The details were revealed in the annual report of the Intelligence and Security Committee, which oversees the work of intelligence agencies. It said GCHQ had ""over-achieved"", creating double the number of new offensive cyber-capabilities expected. The report said GCHQ's allocation of effort to develop hacks had increased ""very substantially"" from 2014. The programme of developing the capabilities is divided into three tranches and GCHQ said that it had just finished the first. ""Weâ¦ actually over-achieved and delivered [almost double the number of] capabilities [we were aiming for,"" an official from the agency told the committee. The details of the successes are classified in the public version of the report. Such capabilities could, in theory, be used to retaliate against others' cyber-attacks. The report comes a day after the Foreign Office publicly blamed North Korea for the Wannacry attack, which hit the NHS in May 2017. US and UK blame North Korea for WannaCry Cyber-attack glossary: What are malware, patches and worms? NHS cyber-attack was 'launched from North Korea' Not all the projects at GCHQ have been as successful. One - codenamed Foxtrot - was designed to deal with the spread of encryption. It is described as an ""equipment interference programme to increase GCHQ's ability to operate in an environment of ubiquitous encryption"" and is considered critical to the agency's work. However, it was reported to have suffered a number of delays. ""The task has become more complex, the skills shortage has become more apparent,"" GCHQ told the committee. ""It is our number one priority and our number one worry."" Another priority was Project Golf - an effort to enhance its supercomputing capacity. GCHQ said this project was also critical but on track to be operational early next year. For years the intelligence community, like much of government, has struggled with IT projects designed to facilitate the sharing of information. MI5's Alfa programme, described as crucial to the core business of managing information, is said by the committee to have faced major problems. It added that ""significant risks"" remained to its successful delivery.

Sesame Street to help Syrian refugees,"Sesame Street will be used to rebuild trust among millions of displaced children from Syria Characters from the children's television programme Sesame Street are going to be used to help teach children displaced by war in Syria. The Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee have won a $100m (Â£75m) grant to help with the ""toxic stress"" on child refugees. It will help children in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria Jeffrey Dunn, head of Sesame Workshop, said Syria's refugee crisis was the ""humanitarian issue of our time"". ""This may be our most important initiative ever,"" he said. The award has been made by the Chicago-based John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation, which wants to make ""big bets"" on influencing major challenges. Sesame Street is going to be used as a way of helping teach traumatised youngsters about relationships It's one of the biggest single philanthropic donations to such an education project - and will fund efforts to provide early years education and tackle the trauma of millions of young refugees created by Syria's conflict. It will produce a customised version of Sesame Street for the young Syrian refugees, available on mobile phones, which will support literacy and numeracy, help to teach about relationships and encourage respect for others. This is being claimed as the biggest such humanitarian intervention for early years learning There will also be child development centres created, where parents will be able to bring children, and where advice, resources and information will be available. Julia Stasch, president of the foundation, said this would be ""the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting"". ""Less than 2% of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. Millions of young refugees are living in countries such as Lebanon and Jordan ""The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education."" David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, said the funding would ""bring hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children"". ""At a time when governments are in retreat, [non-governmental organisations] and philanthropists need to step up, and that is what we are seeing here - and in a big way.""

US 'will take names' at UN Jerusalem vote,"Fourteen states backed a similar motion on Jerusalem at the UN Security Council on Monday The US says it ""will be taking names"" during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution criticising its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Permanent representative Nikki Haley warned member states that President Donald Trump had asked her to report on ""who voted against us"" on Thursday. The draft resolution does not mention the US, but says any decisions on Jerusalem should be cancelled. Mr Trump later threatened to cut off financial aid to those who backed it. ""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching those votes,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."" The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk The 193-member UN General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution, which affirmed that any decisions on the status of Jerusalem were ""null and void and must be rescinded"", and urged all states to ""refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the holy city"". The other 14 members of the Security Council voted in favour of the draft, but Ms Haley described it as an ""insult"". The non-binding resolution put forward by Turkey and Yemen for the General Assembly vote mirrors the vetoed Security Council draft. The Palestinian permanent observer at the UN, Riyad Mansour, said he hoped there would be ""overwhelming support"" for the resolution. But on Tuesday, Ms Haley warned in a letter to dozens of member states that encouraged them to ""know that the president and the US take this vote personally"". Allow Twitter content?

Longest-frozen embryo born after 24 years,"This video can not be played Emma's mother called her ""a sweet, sweet miracle"" A baby has been born from an embryo frozen for nearly 25 years - possibly the longest gap between conception and birth since IVF began. The embryo was donated by a family in the US and has become the first child for a woman who would herself have been only one when the baby was conceived. The donated embryo that would become Emma Wren Gibson, a healthy baby girl, was thawed in March and transferred to mum Tina Gibson's uterus. Emma was born in November. ""Do you realise I'm only 25? This embryo and I could have been best friends,"" Mrs Gibson, now 26, of eastern Tennessee told CNN. ""I just wanted a baby. I don't care if it's a world record or not,"" she added. Baby Emma was conceived a year and half after her mum's own birth The faith-based National Embryo Donation Center provided the fertilised embryo, which doctors there refer to as ""snow babies"" because of how long they are kept frozen. The organisation encourages couples who do not want additional children to donate unneeded embryos after their families are complete, so that other couples can try to become parents. The Americans who 'adopt' other people's embryos Modern Family star's battle over embryos Tina and Benjamin Gibson turned to the Knoxville-based organisation after Mr Gibson, who has cystic fibrosis, was found to have fertility issues. Baby Emma was conceived in October 1992 - a year and half after her mum's own birth. The 24-year-old embryo is believed to have been cryopreserved for longer than any other viable human embryo. ""Emma is such a sweet miracle,"" Mr Gibson said. ""I think she looks pretty perfect to have been frozen all those years ago."" Neither parent is biologically related to their new daughter.

IS bomber's brother jailed for 10 years,"Mohammed Abbas Idris Awan studied dentistry in Sheffield The brother of a suicide bomber killed in Iraq has been jailed for 10 years for terror offences. Dentistry student Mohammed Awan, from Huddersfield, was sentenced after being found guilty of preparing for terrorist acts and possessing material likely to be useful to a terrorist. The 24-year-old was jailed for 10 years and ordered to serve three years extended licence on his release. Awan's brother Rizwan Awan killed 30 people in a bomb blast in Iraq in 2016. Judge Paul Watson QC said he believed Awan was ""to a very large extent radicalised by the actions"" of his elder brother. More stories from across Yorkshire Anti-terror police said Awan had downloaded information on how to use ball bearings in attacks Passing sentence at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Watson said: ""I am completely satisfied that you had intentionally adopted an outwardly innocent and respectable persona with the clear intention that, at some future point, you would be able to perpetrate a terrorist act without being detected."" Awan, a fourth-year dentistry student at the University of Sheffield, was arrested by anti-terror police in June after purchasing 500 ball bearings online. During raids on his family home in Rudding Street, Huddersfield, and a flat in Dun Street, Sheffield, officers recovered a ""significant volume"" of extremist material, including advice on how to be a ""sleeper cell"" in the West. Police also seized 11 mobile phones, 16 USB memory sticks and seven computers. One memory stick contained a 36-minute video of a senior al Qaida leader calling on young Muslims to join so-called Islamic State (IS) and featured graphic footage of how to kill and kidnap victims. On a mobile phone, officers found images of the Boston Marathon bombing and a man wearing an orange jumpsuit about to be executed. Anti-terror police carried out a raid at the family home in Huddersfield Awan had claimed he had bought the ball bearings and a catapult to use for hunting. Det Supt Simon Atkinson, head of investigations at Counter Terrorism Policing North East, said: ""Whilst we do not know the full details of Awan's intentions, officers intervened swiftly before Awan could put any plans into practice."" Judge Watson added: ""The ideology to which you had so clearly wedded yourself is, to all right-thinking, peaceful, tolerant and inclusive Muslims living in harmony in this country, utterly abhorrent. ""Your romanticised notions of a jihadi struggle involving violence and destruction are far removed from the Islamic faith. ""You are, in my view, someone who is even now in the grip of idealistic extremism."" Rizwan Awan detonated a bomb in Iraq in 2016 killing himself and dozens of people During his trial, jurors heard Awan's brother Rizwan had travelled from Manchester to Istanbul on 17 May, 2015 where he appeared to have joined IS. The court heard that the brothers remained in contact until Rizwan launched an attack on an Iraqi military convoy. Awan said he will appeal against his conviction and sentence.

"Uber is officially a cab firm, says court","Uber is officially a transport company and not a digital service, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled. The ride-hailing firm argued it was an information society service - helping people to make contact with each other electronically - and not a cab firm. The case arose after Uber was told to obey local taxi rules in Barcelona. Uber said the verdict would make little difference to the way it operated in Europe, but experts say the case could have implications for the gig economy. An Uber spokesperson said: ""This ruling will not change things in most EU countries where we already operate under transportation law. ""However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new CEO has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across Europe. This is the approach we'll take to ensure everyone can get a reliable ride at the tap of a button."" Uber a danger to public safety, warns union Uber used undercover agents, court letter says Uber settles defamation lawsuit filed by Indian rape victim Uber concealed huge data breach In its ruling, the ECJ said that a service whose purpose was ""to connect, by means of a smartphone application and for remuneration, non-professional drivers using their own vehicle with persons who wish to make urban journeys"" must be classified as ""a service in the field of transport"" in EU law. It added: ""As EU law currently stands, it is for the member states to regulate the conditions under which such services are to be provided in conformity with the general rules of the treaty on the functioning of the EU."" This ruling is another example of how the courts and regulators are struggling to make sense of the phenomenon known as the gig economy. Since Uber was first launched less than a decade ago, it has repeatedly fallen foul of regulators in different countries - and has frequently been forced to change its business model as a result. This ruling sets out clearly that Uber is, in legal terms at least, a transport company. Uber itself insists that there won't be a huge immediate impact on its business, but it could still affect how it operates in future and how it liaises with national governments. Uber itself has previously said this will undermine the reform of what it calls outdated laws. On a wider basis, it could have implications for other gig economy businesses that try to portray themselves as little more than an app on a phone, connecting providers with customers; it appears the courts, so far, are taking a different view. That could ultimately have an impact, not just on ride-hailing services, but on other gig economy services - such as couriers and accommodation providers - who operate a similar model. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the verdict meant Uber must ""play by the same rules as everybody else"". She added: ""Their drivers are not commodities. They deserve at the very least the minimum wage and holiday pay. ""Advances in technology should be used to make work better, not to return to the type of working practices we thought we'd seen the back of decades ago."" The verdict comes after Uber was told last month thatthe appeal to renew its licence in London could take years,according to Mayor Sadiq Khan. Uber's presence around the world has often been controversial, with protests staged against it in various cities. However, Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur and former adviser to David Cameron, says the firm has made competitors up their game. ""Millions of people use these ride-hailing apps every day - not just Uber, but dozens of others too. They have brought real benefits, making it cheaper, easier and more convenient to get around the city,"" he toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""There has also been a benefit in incumbent London taxi cabs, which are now taking credit cards, which they resisted for years. That is a response to competition."" He added that similar services could soon face regulation as a result of the ECJ ruling. ""There could be big implications for a sharing economy service like Airbnb, which will probably be regulated by the EU,"" he said. ""What is fascinating about this right now is that different countries are taking very different views. Portugal has legalised Uber and Airbnb, whereas France is clamping down."" Prof Andre Spicer, from the Cass Business School, welcomed the ruling. He told Today: ""Many people see the EU is actually leading the way in pushing back the almost unlimited power of tech firms and beginning to provide some limits around that. ""We also claim this fosters competition, but what Uber's model is based on is pricing, so much that they basically drove everyone else out of the market. ""This judgement will allow normal competition, so what we will see is lots of other smaller apps appearing around Europe.""

On Tuesday, prosecutors dropped a case against a man charged with raping a child under 16 due to police providing ""relevant"" evidence in recent days. Last week, student Liam Allan's trial collapsed because of the late disclosure of evidence. The Met said the same officer worked on both cases and remains on full duty. The force has not referred the officer involved to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a Met spokesman said. The IPCC told the BBC it was ""monitoring the situation"". Collapsed rape trial accused 'betrayed' Why disclosure failings can prove crucial 'It's just sheer incompetence' - says prosecutor In the most recent case of Isaac Itiary, the Crown Prosecution Service said ""new material"" provided by Scotland Yard meant the case could not proceed. Isaac Itiary was charged with raping a child in July but the case collapsed The Met review is aimed at ensuring all digital evidence in other sex crime cases has been disclosed to the CPS. Conservative MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of rape and sexual assault charges in 2014, said there was a ""systemic"" problem, which could leave innocent people in jail. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attorney general had already started a review into the disclosure of evidence, telling PMQs: ""It is important that we look at this again so we make sure we are truly providing justice."" Liam Allan, 22, was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records crucial to the case. A computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". Mr Allan, who spent almost two years on bail,has said he intends to sue the Met. This video can not be played Barrister Jerry Hayes tells Today late disclosure of evidence is a worrying 'systemic' problem Jerry Hayes, the barrister prosecuting the case against Mr Allan, agreed with Mr Evans' assertion that the problem was ""systemic"" within the police, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""You speak to any barrister they will tell you stories that this happens every single day and it has got to stop."" He said anyone about to go to trial should seek a letter from the police force to say all evidence has been disclosed, and for those convicted, ""they will have to be looked at again"". By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The cases of Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary are very different. As far as Mr Allan is concerned, the Met has accepted the case ""clearly went wrong"". Crucial information was disclosed to defence barristers so late that the trial was already well under way. In Mr Itiary's case, procedures appear to have been followed, though it's possible police could have acted more quickly. What the cases have done is shine a light on the importance of following disclosure rules. Undoubtedly the squeeze on resources, with cuts in the Crown Prosecution Service and policing and a national shortage of detectives, together with the increased caseload for sexual offences units, have played their part. An inspection report this year also pinpointed inadequacies in training and supervision. Some see the problems as a direct result of a misplaced culture of ""believing"" the victim, where police don't look for or withhold contradictory evidence - but that's an assertion for the attorney general's inquiry to examine. Commander Richard Smith, who oversees the Met's rape investigations, said he understood the failure of the latest case would raise further concerns. He added: ""The Met is completely committed to understanding what went wrong in the case of Mr Allan and is carrying out a joint review with the CPS, the findings of which will be published."" But Nigel Evans said the late disclosure of evidence was ""common"" in investigations. Mr Evans was cleared in 2014 of charges of raping a student Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: ""It seems to be in too many cases that police are cherry-picking the evidence that is there in order to get a prosecution. "" Mr Evans called for a ""proper review"" involving police forces across the country, not just the Met. Dame Elish Angiolini led a review in 2015 into how the Met and the CPS deal with rape cases. She said she was ""concerned about the impact of excessive workloads on the effectiveness of both police and prosecutors"". In response to her review, the Met said it had carried out ""significant work"", with an extra 196 officers allocated to the relevant units and additional lawyers for the CPS. Former Met detective chief inspector Peter Kirkham told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was a resources issue. ""Since 2010, we have reduced the number of police officers around the country by about 20,000 - that's about 15%,"" he said. He warned that officers were ""stressed"" and ""haven't got time to do their jobs properly"".

Collapse of rape trials 'appalling',"This video can not be played Rape trial collapse student Liam Allan felt 'pure fear' The collapse of two rape cases in one week was an ""appalling failure"" of the criminal justice system, Attorney General Jeremy Wright has said. Two young men were cleared when it emerged that Met Police officers had failed to disclose crucial evidence. Around 30 rape cases about to go to trial are to be reviewed immediately and ""scores"" more will be looked at. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick admitted that police and prosecutors had made mistakes. She said the 30 cases would not be reinvestigated, but would be reviewed to make sure everything that should have been disclosed had been. The police have a duty to disclose any material to the defence that might support their case. If disclosure fails, innocent people go to jail, says the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman. ""We need to learn lessons,"" Ms Dick told BBC Radio London, and insisted her officers were professional and fair with a ""very complex job"" to do. Collapsed rape trial accused 'betrayed' Why disclosure failings can prove crucial 'It's just sheer incompetence' - says prosecutor Isaac Itiary was charged with raping a child in July but the case collapsed The trial of student Liam Allan, 22, was thrown out at Croydon Crown Court last week. The case collapsed three days into the trial when the police were ordered to hand over phone records showing the alleged victim had pestered Mr Allan for casual sex. Days later, another prosecution case collapsed against Isaac Itiary, who was facing trial at Inner London Crown Court, accused of raping a child. He was charged in July but police only disclosed ""relevant material"" in response to his defence case statement as his trial was about to start. The same Met Police officer had worked on both men's cases. He remains on full duty. The Met said it would review both these cases separately, as well as carrying out the wider review of other live rape cases. Justice minister Dominic Raab said it was ""absolutely right"" for the Met to carry out the review, adding: ""The basic principle of British justice is at stake."" ""The proper disclosure obligations in these two cases have not been discharged, and that is deeply worrying,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""This is not a new thing. It should be made easy by technology,"" he added. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The cases of Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary are very different. As far as Mr Allan is concerned, the Met has accepted the case ""clearly went wrong"". Crucial information was disclosed to defence barristers so late that the trial was already well under way. In Mr Itiary's case, procedures appear to have been followed, though it's possible police could have acted more quickly.

Some see the problems as a direct result of a misplaced culture of ""believing"" the victim, where police don't look for or withhold contradictory evidence - but that's an assertion for the attorney general's inquiry to examine. Last week, Attorney General of England and Wales Jeremy Wright ordered a review to look at disclosure processes - including codes of practice, guidelines and legislation relating to sex offences and other crimes - which is expected to report back next year. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Wright said the two cases of the young men were ""obviously appalling failures of the criminal justice system"". ""We need to understand and understand urgently what went wrong in those cases,"" he said. He added that there were already concerns about the disclosure system due to the large amounts of digital information that needed filtering and sifting to find evidence that ought to be disclosed.

"Be more patriotic about cheese, says Gove","Michael Gove has hit back at claims the price of cheddar cheese will go up by 40% if Britain leaves the EU without a trade deal. The environment secretary said that would not happen if consumers started buying more British cheddar. ""I am deeply concerned about your unpatriotic attitude towards cheese,"" he joked to the Labour MP quizzing him. He said his department was ""very pro UK cheddar"" - and Britain's dairy farmers would respond to what the market wants. His attempts to show off his knowledge of cheddar, by naming varieties such as ""Montgomery or Lincolnshire Poacher"", were cut short by environment committee chairman Neil Parish.

That meant prices in British shops would go up by 40%, Labour's Angela Smith claimed. Mr Gove said it would be important to have these WTO tariffs if Britain left without a deal to prevent British farmers being undercut by cheap food imports - but he insisted the price of cheddar would not rise by 40%. Mr Gove has criticised standards in US chicken farms Agriculture minister George Eustice told the environment committee: ""What would probably happen, if everybody put up such a tariff wall, is that we would consume more of the cheese we produce, rather than send it to Ireland, and Ireland would be selling us less cheese."" The UK currently exports Â£320m of cheddar to Ireland every year and imports Â£389m of cheddar, he told the committee (Ireland accounts for about 80% of all cheddar imports, according to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board). Mr Gove suggested going to WTO rules was as likely as ""a tsunami hitting the South West of England"" and the government did not want to do it - but he told the MPs that his department was planning for such an eventuality. He said that if it happened it would lead to higher food prices in the shops, but also more export opportunities for farmers. Mr Eustice quoted research by the Resolution Foundation that under WTO rules retail prices might rise by 4.3%. Mr Gove also suggested he could block a post-Brexit trade deal with the US if it included allowing the import of chlorine-washed chickens. He said it was a matter of animal welfare rather than food safety - saying American chicken farmers were ""less respectful of the birds"" - and Britain would need to be ""assertive"" in trade talks.

US 'will take names' at UN Jerusalem voteDonald Trump threatens to cut aid to states opposed to his recognition of the city as Israel's capital.1ma minute agoMiddle East,"Fourteen states backed a similar motion on Jerusalem at the UN Security Council on Monday The US says it ""will be taking names"" during a UN General Assembly vote on a resolution criticising its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Permanent representative Nikki Haley warned member states that President Donald Trump had asked her to report on ""who voted against us"" on Thursday. The draft resolution does not mention the US, but says any decisions on Jerusalem should be cancelled. Mr Trump later threatened to cut off financial aid to those who backed it. ""They take hundreds of millions of dollars and even billions of dollars, and then they vote against us. Well, we're watching those votes,"" he told reporters at the White House. ""Let them vote against us. We'll save a lot. We don't care."" The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. Israel occupied the east of the city, previously occupied by Jordan, in the 1967 Middle East war and regards the entire city as its indivisible capital. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state and its final status is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and all countries currently maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. However, President Trump has told the US state department to start work on moving the US embassy. Anger in Ramallah and delight in West Jerusalem The view from one street Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk The 193-member UN General Assembly will hold a rare emergency special session on Thursday at the request of Arab and Muslim states, who condemned Mr Trump's decision to reverse decades of US policy earlier this month. The Palestinians called for the meeting after the US vetoed a Security Council resolution, which affirmed that any decisions on the status of Jerusalem were ""null and void and must be rescinded"", and urged all states to ""refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the holy city"". The other 14 members of the Security Council voted in favour of the draft, but Ms Haley described it as an ""insult"". The non-binding resolution put forward by Turkey and Yemen for the General Assembly vote mirrors the vetoed Security Council draft. The Palestinian permanent observer at the UN, Riyad Mansour, said he hoped there would be ""overwhelming support"" for the resolution. But on Tuesday, Ms Haley warned in a letter to dozens of member states that encouraged them to ""know that the president and the US take this vote personally"". Allow Twitter content?

Sesame Street to help Syrian refugeesA $100m grant is going to bring Sesame Street characters to help traumatised refugee children in Syria.13m13 minutes agoFamily & Education,"Sesame Street will be used to rebuild trust among millions of displaced children from Syria Characters from the children's television programme Sesame Street are going to be used to help teach children displaced by war in Syria. The Sesame Workshop and the International Rescue Committee have won a $100m (Â£75m) grant to help with the ""toxic stress"" on child refugees. It will help children in Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria Jeffrey Dunn, head of Sesame Workshop, said Syria's refugee crisis was the ""humanitarian issue of our time"". ""This may be our most important initiative ever,"" he said. The award has been made by the Chicago-based John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation, which wants to make ""big bets"" on influencing major challenges. Sesame Street is going to be used as a way of helping teach traumatised youngsters about relationships It's one of the biggest single philanthropic donations to such an education project - and will fund efforts to provide early years education and tackle the trauma of millions of young refugees created by Syria's conflict. It will produce a customised version of Sesame Street for the young Syrian refugees, available on mobile phones, which will support literacy and numeracy, help to teach about relationships and encourage respect for others. This is being claimed as the biggest such humanitarian intervention for early years learning There will also be child development centres created, where parents will be able to bring children, and where advice, resources and information will be available. Julia Stasch, president of the foundation, said this would be ""the largest early childhood intervention program ever created in a humanitarian setting"". ""Less than 2% of the global humanitarian aid budget is dedicated to education, and only a sliver of all education assistance benefits young children. Millions of young refugees are living in countries such as Lebanon and Jordan ""The longer-term goal is to change the system of humanitarian aid to focus more on helping to ensure the future of young children through education."" David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, said the funding would ""bring hope and opportunity to a generation of refugee children"". ""At a time when governments are in retreat, [non-governmental organisations] and philanthropists need to step up, and that is what we are seeing here - and in a big way.""

Appeal over father's paternity pay rights,"Stock image: Capita is appealing against a ruling that it failed to give a new father full paternity leave rights A case that could determine whether firms have to pay fathers on maternity leave the same as women is being heard by the Employment Appeal Tribunal. The support services firm Capita is appealing against a ruling in June that it failed to give a new father full paternity leave rights. Madasar Ali, whose wife had post-natal depression, was offered two weeks' pay, whereas a woman is paid for 14 weeks. A tribunal ruled Mr Ali, a call centre worker, had been discriminated against,external. The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman says the outcome of the appeal will be binding for similar cases in the future. In 2015, new rules around shared parental leave came into forceto give fathers (or the other parent or partner) the opportunity to stay at home caring for the baby. For the first two weeks after birth, mothers must still take the time off but the rest of the leave, up to 50 weeks, can be shared between the parents if they meet certain criteria. What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? Shared parental leave explained The government said about 285,000 working couples would be eligible under the rules. Figures obtained by BBC Wales from HMRC showed 6,100 fathers and 542,850 mothers in England, and 250 fathers and 27,650 mothers in Wales, received a statutory payment to take time off work with their children in 2016/17. Employment lawyer Lindsey Bell told BBC Breakfast that companies were giving ""enhanced maternity leave over and above"" what they have to for women - but not for men. She said in Mr Ali's case, his wife was being encouraged to go back to work because of her post-natal depression, so he had to take on the childcare - but he was not being paid the same as female colleagues. She said in that situation ""that does seem to be discriminatory"". John Adams, from Dad Blog UK, is the main carer for his two children. He told BBC Breakfast that the leave offered for men and women was ""inconsistent"". ""It's small [the number of men taking up shared parental leave] but then this is the crux of the issue,"" he said. ""If men aren't getting the same rights as women, they can't actually get involved in family life, they can't afford to take the time off, so they don't, so from the earliest days they are basically discriminated against."" Tom Higham said he wants equal rights for paternity pay Tom Higham, who has a one-year-old son Jack, told the BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We are not advocating for lower pay for mothers. ""What we are advocating for is equal rights to pay and compensation for men who take paternity leave, because if you want a balanced family, a balanced economy and all of the positives that ensue for the child and for the family, and for the workplace, then you have to make an effort to make pay more equal."" Josh Lawson, who got 22 weeks' full paternity leave to look after five-month-old son Isaac, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it was ""absolutely critical to get that time to bond"". New rules came into force in 2015 where up to 50 weeks of leave - 37 weeks of which is paid -can be shared by parents,externalif they meet certain criteria Mothers must still take the initial two weeks after birth, but they can then cut their maternity leave short and exchange it for shared parental leave Both parents will then have a flexible choice of how to split up the rest of the leave entitlement - of up to 50 weeks Shared parental leave pay is Â£140.98 a week or 90% of an employee's average weekly earnings, whichever is lower Some mothers receive full pay during their maternity leave, rather than the statutory minimum, depending on their employer Lawyers suggested at the time of the leave's introduction that employers may worry that dads, taking shared parental leave, could bring discrimination claims if the extra pay was not offered to them too Some mums moving from maternity to shared parental leave may not receive full pay.

HMRC warns on iTunes gift card scamHundreds of people over 65 have been ripped off by fraudsters who tell them to buy gift vouchers.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"Vouchers that can be redeemed on iTunes are at the centre of the fraud Hundreds of older and vulnerable people are getting ripped off by fraudsters who tell them to buy iTunes gift cards to pay their tax bills. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said there have been 1,500 reports of such scams since the start of last year. Most victims are over 65 and lose Â£1,150 each on average. HMRC has said it is working with Apple and campaign groups to make sure the public know how to spot the scam and to whom they should report it. Here's how it works: victims are first cold-called by the fraudsters, who pose as staff from HMRC. They tell them they owe large amounts of tax. The householders are then told to go and buy digital vouchers or gift cards, redeemable on sites such as iTunes, and read out the code. Many of the victims agree to follow the instructions, as they don't know what an iTunes voucher is. The conmen sell the codes on, or purchase high-value products, at the victim's expense. Whats App supermarket voucher scam Old scams, new tricks On its support page,Apple said,externalsome fraudsters were using the same trick to persuade people to pay off hospital bills, bail money, debt collection fees and utility bills. Since October, there has been new wording on the back of iTunes vouchers warning buyers not to share the code with anyone else. It also warns specifically about tax bills: ""The card cannot be used for any payments outside of the UK App Store or iTunes Store, including taxes."" HMRC described the scammers as ""very confident, convincing and utterly ruthless"". ""We urge people with elderly relatives to warn them about this scam and remind them that they should never trust anyone who phones them out of the blue and asks them to pay a tax bill,"" said Angela MacDonald, HMRC's director general of customer services. ""If you think you've been a victim, you should contact Action Fraud immediately."" HMRC would never ask for outstanding payments using iTunes gift cards, it added.

Longest-frozen embryo born after 24 yearsUS mother who gave birth to the child was herself only one year old when the baby was conceived.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Emma's mother called her ""a sweet, sweet miracle"" A baby has been born from an embryo frozen for nearly 25 years - possibly the longest gap between conception and birth since IVF began. The embryo was donated by a family in the US and has become the first child for a woman who would herself have been only one when the baby was conceived. The donated embryo that would become Emma Wren Gibson, a healthy baby girl, was thawed in March and transferred to mum Tina Gibson's uterus. Emma was born in November. ""Do you realise I'm only 25? This embryo and I could have been best friends,"" Mrs Gibson, now 26, of eastern Tennessee told CNN. ""I just wanted a baby. I don't care if it's a world record or not,"" she added. Baby Emma was conceived a year and half after her mum's own birth The faith-based National Embryo Donation Center provided the fertilised embryo, which doctors there refer to as ""snow babies"" because of how long they are kept frozen. The organisation encourages couples who do not want additional children to donate unneeded embryos after their families are complete, so that other couples can try to become parents. The Americans who 'adopt' other people's embryos Modern Family star's battle over embryos Tina and Benjamin Gibson turned to the Knoxville-based organisation after Mr Gibson, who has cystic fibrosis, was found to have fertility issues. Baby Emma was conceived in October 1992 - a year and half after her mum's own birth. The 24-year-old embryo is believed to have been cryopreserved for longer than any other viable human embryo. ""Emma is such a sweet miracle,"" Mr Gibson said. ""I think she looks pretty perfect to have been frozen all those years ago."" Neither parent is biologically related to their new daughter.

Rail strikes in new year over guards row,"Workers at six train operators will walk out in January Train strikes are looming in the new year as rail workers plan a series of 24-hour walkouts in the long-running row over the role of guards. RMT members at five operators will walk out on 8, 10 and 12 January. Workers at Southern will strike on 8 January. The five involved are South Western Railway (SWR), Greater Anglia, Merseyrail, Northern and the Isle of Wight's Island Line run by SWR. Northern rail said it would work to keep customers on the move. Greater Anglia said it would run a full service on all the strike days. Govia Thameslink (GTR), Southern's parent company, said the RMT was striking on the same day the operator had invited the union to talks. The union said it received the letter inviting them to negotiations on Wednesday - after the decision had been made to stage industrial action. GTR's HR director, Andy Bindon, said: ""We ask them to call off the strike and come to the negotiating table as we have suggested on many occasions."" Andy Heath, managing director of Merseyrail said: ""I would like to make our passengers aware that we want to make every effort to reach an agreement with the RMT and have offered to meet with them with no preconditions in an effort to resolve this dispute - something they are unwilling to do."" The RMT said it was prepared to meet for ""genuine"" talks and that Merseyrail's claim that the union would not meet the operator was ""rubbish"". The operator SWR has not yet commented to the BBC. The union said it had tried to resolve the bitter row over driver-only operation (DOO) of trains and has insisted the dispute is about safety. The RMT has insisted the dispute is about safety What are driver-only-operated trains? General secretary Mick Cash said: ""Every single effort that RMT has made to reach negotiated settlements in these separate disputes with the different train operating companies over safe operation and safe staffing has been kicked back in our faces. ""We are left with no option but to confirm a further phase of industrial action in the new year."" He added: ""It is frankly ludicrous that we have been able to negotiate long-term arrangements in Scotland and Wales that protect the guards and passenger safety but we are being denied the same opportunities with rail companies in England."" He said the RMT stood ""ready for talks"" in each of the disputes. The RMT said the issue was not jobs but a second safety critical member of staff on trains Both Northern and Great Arriva said they had guaranteed conductors' jobs until the end of their franchises in 2025. Richard Dean, Greater Anglia trains service delivery director said: ""We are keeping our conductors on our trains. In fact we will be recruiting more."" Richard Allan, deputy managing director of Northern, added that the government last week had written to the union guaranteeing employment for conductors beyond 2025 if the RMT ended its dispute. However, the RMT has said the guarantee of jobs is not the issue. A union member told the BBC: ""The issue is about the role of the guard and the guarantee of a second safety critical member of staff, and the push to DOO on more trains."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport confirmed the offer had been made and said: ""It is total nonsense to suggest these strikes are about jobs or safety - employees have been guaranteed jobs and salaries. ""In fact at Southern rail, where these changes have already been introduced, there are now more staff on trains. ""And the independent rail regulator has said driver-controlled trains, which have been used in this country for more than 30 years, are safe."" He added: ""Not content with attempting to stop people getting home for Christmas, the RMT's version of a happy new year is to continue dragging paying customers into its futile and backward-looking industrial action. ""Despite this, rail companies will be working hard to keep people moving on RMT strike days."" The union said it was open to ""genuine"" talks Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""No-one wins from RMT strike action."" He said: ""Working together, we've got to find a way through this dispute so that we can get on with the business.""

Resident dolphins found off English coast,"Experts analysed thousands of photographs and sightings of bottlenose dolphins The first resident pod of bottlenose dolphins has been discovered off the south-west coast of England. Experts used thousands of sightings and photos to identify a group of 28 individuals living year-round off the coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Dorset. They were identified using their dorsal fins, which are as unique to dolphins as fingerprints are to humans. Plymouth University researchers studied 3,843 records to identify 98 dolphins and among them the resident population. The sightings, recorded between 2007 and 2016, established the group was present in shallow coastal waters, mainly off Cornwall and particularly near St Ives Bay and Mount's Bay. More Cornwall and Devon stories here Ruth Williams, marine conservation manager at the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ""Further work is needed but this is a huge step forward and I am proud of what our partnership between Cornwall Wildlife Trust, scientists and boat operators has achieved. ""We need to make sure the few we currently have in the south west are given the protection not just to survive, but to thrive."" Every bottlenose dolphin has a unique dorsal fin, similar to a human fingerprint Rebecca Dudley, of the University of Plymouth, gathered data from a large number of collaborators who had studied the dolphins' social structure and distribution. She said her findings will raise questions about conservation of the environment the pod inhabits. ""This shows that if anything happens to their habitat in this area, it is really going to affect the population, because they do spend all their time around the south west region."" The UK's two other resident bottlenose dolphin populations - in Cardigan, Wales and Moray Firth, Scotland - both have protection.

UK homes to get faster broadband by 2020,"Homes and businesses will have a legal right to demand faster broadband speed by 2020, the government has said, after rejecting a voluntary offer from BT. It has promised that the whole of the UK will have access to speeds of at least 10 Mbps by 2020. BT, which is responsible for the infrastructure, had previously offered to carry out improvements according to its own timetable. But the company said it accepted the government's decision. The government believes the regulatory Universal Service Obligation offers ""certainty"". Under the plan, broadband providers will face a legal requirement to provide this minimum standard to anyone requesting it, subject to a cost threshold. The UK lags behind many countries in terms of speed and reliability. BT customer Lee Wootton-Rowley, who lives in Wakefield, contacted the BBC to say: ""I get 5 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.9 in 2017. ""I lived in Malta for four years where I was getting 60 Mbps and 20 upload speed."" Mike Simatos, from Rotherhithe in south-east London, said his broadband supply speed was no faster than 4 Mbps. He described the service as ""appalling"". Regulator Ofcom said that 4% of UK premises, or about 1.1 million, could not access broadband speeds of at least 10 Mbps. It said poor connections were a particular concern for small businesses, with almost 230,000 unable to get a decent service. Ofcom defines superfast broadband as a download speed of 30 Mbps or more. Matt Hancock, minister of state for digital said on the BBC's Today programme: ""Access means you can phone up somebody, ask for it and then someone has the legal duty to deliver on that promise. ""It is about having the right to demand it, so it will be an on-demand programme. ""So if you don't go on the internet, aren't interested, then you won't phone up and demand this."" In response to the announcement, BT said: ""BT and Openreach want to get on with the job of making decent broadband available to everyone in the UK, so we'll continue to explore the commercial options for bringing faster speeds to those parts of the country which are hardest to reach."" In one sense, there is little new in today's announcement - people in remote places were promised a legal right to a minimum 10Mbps broadband service by 2020 and now they are going to get it. But in rejecting BT's plan for a voluntary agreement to fill in most of the remaining parts of the country with a decent service, the government is taking quite a risk. The plan, opposed as anti-competitive by BT's rivals, would at least have given some certainty. But now it is far from clear who will provide this Universal Service Obligation - the government hopes new providers will come in alongside BT's Openreach  - or what technology will be employed. New fast fibre firms are now competing in the cities, but the 1.1 million homes and offices Ofcom says still cannot get a 10Mbps service are mainly in rural areas, and it is not clear they will be keen to lay cables along every lane. Now it is the regulator's  job to make sure this all works. There are now two years to push through new legislation, work out how to police it, and determine what is a reasonable cost threshold for hooking up really remote homes. Should be a doddle, shouldn't it? Rival firms, which had talked of legal action if the government accepted BT's offer, welcomed the decision. Both TalkTalk and Sky said the government had made the right decision. Tristia Harrison, TalkTalk chief executive, said: ""By opting for formal regulation rather than weaker promises, ministers are guaranteeing consumers will get the minimum speeds they need at a price they can afford,"" she said. ""The whole industry now needs to work together to ensure customers see the benefits as quickly as possible."" Stephen van Rooyen, Sky's UK and Ireland chief executive, said: ""Government have made the right decision by choosing a fair and transparent approach that maintains competition, keeps prices fair and gives consumers a legal right to request broadband."" Following the introduction of secondary legislation early next year, it is thought it will take another two years before the right is enforced by Ofcom. Under BT's offer, which the company had said would cost up to Â£600m, 98.5% of premises would have had access to a fixed broadband service in 2020. Another 0.7% would have access to a service delivered by a combination of fixed and wireless connections. The remaining 0.8% in the most difficult-to-reach areas would have been guided toward satellite or on-demand fibre solutions.

Sharia court divorces 'not legal' in EU,"A couple in Germany who divorced in a Sharia court in Syria cannot have their divorce validated under EU law, Europe's top court has ruled. The European Court of Justice said member states must decide for themselves whether to recognise ""private divorces"", such as those performed in Sharia courts. EU law is not applicable, it said. Islamic law allows a man to divorce his wife instantly by saying ""talaq"" (divorce) three times. It is the ECJ's first ruling on the subject. The couple married in 1999 in the Syrian city of Homs before eventually moving to Germany. They hold both Syrian and German nationality. In 2013, the husband ended the marriage in a Sharia court in the Syrian city of Latakia by having a representative repeating ""talaq"" (divorce) three times. The ECJ calls the measure ""private divorce"", as a state authority is not involved. The wife acknowledged the divorce in writing, but contested it after the former husband applied for its recognition in a court in the German city of Munich. The court then referred the case to the ECJ, asking for clarifications over the interpretation of the EU divorce law pact, known as the Rome III Regulation. The ECJ said the regulation,external""does not apply, by itself, to the recognition of a divorce decision delivered in a third country"". It added that a unilateral declaration of divorce before a religious court does not fall under the scope of the regulation, and said the case must be resolved under German law. The ECJ does not decide the dispute itself, and the court in Munich will take a final decision on the issue. Triple talaq divorce has no mention in Islamic law or the Koran, even though the practice has existed for decades.

Appeal over father's paternity pay rightsThe case could determine whether firms have to pay new fathers the same as mothers.2h2 hours agoUK,"Stock image: Capita is appealing against a ruling that it failed to give a new father full paternity leave rights A case that could determine whether firms have to pay fathers on maternity leave the same as women is being heard by the Employment Appeal Tribunal. The support services firm Capita is appealing against a ruling in June that it failed to give a new father full paternity leave rights. Madasar Ali, whose wife had post-natal depression, was offered two weeks' pay, whereas a woman is paid for 14 weeks. A tribunal ruled Mr Ali, a call centre worker, had been discriminated against,external. The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman says the outcome of the appeal will be binding for similar cases in the future. In 2015, new rules around shared parental leave came into forceto give fathers (or the other parent or partner) the opportunity to stay at home caring for the baby. For the first two weeks after birth, mothers must still take the time off but the rest of the leave, up to 50 weeks, can be shared between the parents if they meet certain criteria. What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? Shared parental leave explained The government said about 285,000 working couples would be eligible under the rules. Figures obtained by BBC Wales from HMRC showed 6,100 fathers and 542,850 mothers in England, and 250 fathers and 27,650 mothers in Wales, received a statutory payment to take time off work with their children in 2016/17. Employment lawyer Lindsey Bell told BBC Breakfast that companies were giving ""enhanced maternity leave over and above"" what they have to for women - but not for men. She said in Mr Ali's case, his wife was being encouraged to go back to work because of her post-natal depression, so he had to take on the childcare - but he was not being paid the same as female colleagues. She said in that situation ""that does seem to be discriminatory"". John Adams, from Dad Blog UK, is the main carer for his two children. He told BBC Breakfast that the leave offered for men and women was ""inconsistent"". ""It's small [the number of men taking up shared parental leave] but then this is the crux of the issue,"" he said. ""If men aren't getting the same rights as women, they can't actually get involved in family life, they can't afford to take the time off, so they don't, so from the earliest days they are basically discriminated against."" Tom Higham said he wants equal rights for paternity pay Tom Higham, who has a one-year-old son Jack, told the BBC Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""We are not advocating for lower pay for mothers. ""What we are advocating for is equal rights to pay and compensation for men who take paternity leave, because if you want a balanced family, a balanced economy and all of the positives that ensue for the child and for the family, and for the workplace, then you have to make an effort to make pay more equal."" Josh Lawson, who got 22 weeks' full paternity leave to look after five-month-old son Isaac, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme it was ""absolutely critical to get that time to bond"". New rules came into force in 2015 where up to 50 weeks of leave - 37 weeks of which is paid -can be shared by parents,externalif they meet certain criteria Mothers must still take the initial two weeks after birth, but they can then cut their maternity leave short and exchange it for shared parental leave Both parents will then have a flexible choice of how to split up the rest of the leave entitlement - of up to 50 weeks Shared parental leave pay is Â£140.98 a week or 90% of an employee's average weekly earnings, whichever is lower Some mothers receive full pay during their maternity leave, rather than the statutory minimum, depending on their employer Lawyers suggested at the time of the leave's introduction that employers may worry that dads, taking shared parental leave, could bring discrimination claims if the extra pay was not offered to them too Some mums moving from maternity to shared parental leave may not receive full pay. The details should be in an employment contract Shared parental leave explained What's it like being a stay-at-home dad? Are fathers using their paternity leave?

Sharia divorces 'not legal' in EU,"A couple in Germany who divorced in a Sharia court in Syria cannot have their divorce validated under EU law, Europe's top court has ruled. The European Court of Justice said member states must decide for themselves whether to recognise ""private divorces"", such as those performed in Sharia courts. EU law is not applicable, it said. Islamic law allows a man to divorce his wife instantly by saying ""talaq"" (divorce) three times. It is the ECJ's first ruling on the subject. The couple married in 1999 in the Syrian city of Homs before eventually moving to Germany. They hold both Syrian and German nationality. In 2013, the husband ended the marriage in a Sharia court in the Syrian city of Latakia by having a representative repeating ""talaq"" (divorce) three times. The ECJ calls the measure ""private divorce"", as a state authority is not involved. The wife acknowledged the divorce in writing, but contested it after the former husband applied for its recognition in a court in the German city of Munich. The court then referred the case to the ECJ, asking for clarifications over the interpretation of the EU divorce law pact, known as the Rome III Regulation. The ECJ said the regulation,external""does not apply, by itself, to the recognition of a divorce decision delivered in a third country"". It added that a unilateral declaration of divorce before a religious court does not fall under the scope of the regulation, and said the case must be resolved under German law. The ECJ does not decide the dispute itself, and the court in Munich will take a final decision on the issue. Triple talaq divorce has no mention in Islamic law or the Koran, even though the practice has existed for decades.

"IMF sees slower growth on Brexit cautionThe IMF has cut its UK economic growth forecast, blaming Brexit uncertainty.1h43 minutes agoBusinessComments","IMF chief Christine Largarde The IMF has cut its UK economic growth forecast, blaming Brexit uncertainty. The Fund expects growth of 1.6% this year, down slightly from its previous forecast of 1.7%. It expects growth to slow further next year, to 1.5%. IMF chief Christine Lagarde said uncertainty over the Brexit deal was causing UK firms to delay investment plans. She also said rising inflation, caused by the fall in the pound, and stagnant wages were squeezing spending power. Ms Lagarde said that the government had made ""significant progress"" in reducing the deficit. But she added that relative to growth in the rest of the world, ""the UK is losing out as a result of higher inflation, pressure on wages and incomes and delayed investment"". ""If you look at investment alone, with 2.1% of GDP in investment, with the global economy as it is, and the space the UK economy has in that global economy, it should be rolling at 6%."" Today, the experts fought back. I asked Christine Lagarde at the launch of the IMF report how she responded to critics who said the IMF had been too gloomy before the referendum. It's worth reproducing her answer in full. ""The numbers that we are seeing the economy deliver today are actually proving the point we made a year and a half ago when people said, you are too gloomy,"" she said. ""We were not too gloomy, we were pretty much on the mark, I mean within 0.1% or so - our forecast actually turned out to be the reality of the economy. ""Sterling has depreciated, inflation has gone up, wages have been squeezed as a result, and investments have been slowed down and are certainly lower than where we would expect them to be."" Yes, there are many positives in this report on record high employment and praise for progress on those Brexit talks. But the big takeaway is this. In a world of strong global growth, the IMF stands by its analysis that the UK economy has suffered since the referendum. Ms Lagarde said that increased productivity was key to increasing living standards and that a new trade deal could help restore productivity levels in the UK. She said: ""The shape of the new agreement with the EU will affect productivity performance through its implications for trade, investment and migration. ""The higher are any new barriers to the cross-border flow of services, goods and workers, the more negative the impact would be."" However, Ms Lagarde also said: ""Brexit has the potential to reshape the structure of the UK economy. The impact will depend on the nature of the final agreement and may take many years to fully materialise."" Brexit supporter and economist Ruth Lea said that while the fall in value of the pound had squeezed incomes, it had also helped exports. Ms Lea, who is economic adviser to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, also said that inflation was likely to fall, which would help company and household finances. The IMF has made dramatic changes to its growth forecasts for the UK since the Brexit referendum. Immediately after the vote in June 2016, it slashed its forecast for 2017 from 2.2% to 1.3%. It then revised it sharply upwards at the start of this year, but since July has been steadily cutting it again. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""The IMF has today played the role of the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future to remind the chancellor that the last seven years of Tory economic failure is undermining our economy. ""As the IMF rightly points out, despite strong global growth, UK economic growth is revised down, and business growth is down despite Tory tax giveaways to big business; while working households this Christmas are struggling with rising prices and lagging wages.""

LivePMQs: Theresa May vs Jeremy CorbynTime for the last PMQs of 2017 - Theresa May faces Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and backbench MPs.Parliaments,"Commons started with questions to the culture secretary followed by the attorney general Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom set out future business Two statements on a parliamentary complaints policy and supported housing Debate on Russian interference in UK politics Peers take part in debates on climate change and ivory trade Esther Webber, Kate Whannel and Richard Morris That's where we leave our coverage of Parliament - the last debate of 2017. Thank you for following us here and we hope you'll join us for more parliamentary coverage in 2018. House of LordsParliament Peers are giving their traditional end-of-year thanks to retiring members of staff before they rise for the Christmas recess. The House of Lords returns on 7 January 2018. General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament ""It was all going so well,"" Deputy Leader of the House Michael Ellis says, until the ""last part"", referring to Karin Smyth saying she hopes that next year will bring a Labour government for the UK. Responding to Sir Paul Beresford, he says that in the UK, there is much more work to be done on the issue of cancer treatments, but 7,000 more people are alive today than there would have been thanks to new treatments. He tells Jamie Stone that the Scottish government has had the funding for broadband in rural Scotland since 2014, but the Scottish government haven't used it yet. Referring to Lyn Brown's points, he says a consultation has been launched by the government on fixed odds betting terminals. He says to Nigel Huddleston that most members ""get on very well across this House,"" and can disagree professionally, but have a chat otherwise. He invites Deirdre Brock to declare anything more she knows about Scottish and NI funding in the Leave campaign to the House, for it to be discussed further. He tells Siobhain McDonagh that the government is putting in Â£1bn into tackling homelessness and rough sleeping. He wraps up by thanking the whole House for their work and their protection of the Houses of Parliament, as well as thanking the Armed Forces. General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Opposition spokesperson Karin Smyth is summing up for Labour, saying it has been ""a fairly sombre debate this afternoon,"" and she says whatever side of the House members sit on, ""our constituents often face the same problems"". She thanks those who work in the community to provide public services, even at a time of enormous pressure, she adds. She congratulates Bristol City on their 2-1 win against Manchester United last night. She'll be catching up with The Crown and wants to see The Last Jedi, she says. She wishes everyone across the House a safe, happy and peaceful Christmas. Finally, she hopes that next year will bring about a Labour government. Parliamentary reporters tweet Allow Twitter content?

General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Siobhain McDonagh says that 128,000 children will wake up homeless on Christmas morning, and over half the homeless households in London are in work, she adds. She says that a quarter of temporary accommodation is only inspected by councils once the tenants have left. She says that 22,000 families have been moved in England to another borough, often without the receiving borough being given any information about their arrival. Ivory debate House of LordsParliament Environment Minister Lord Gardiner of Kimble responds to the debate, stressing the need to ""do everything we can to make sure future generations do not inherit a world without elephants"". He outlines the government's promise to ban the sale of ivory objects which contribute directly or indirectly to poaching - currently the subject of a consultation which ends on 29 December. He says ministers ""recognise a case"" for some items to be exempt, including musical instruments, objects with a small amount of ivory, and items of historic or artistic interest - adding that this will not be finalised until the end of the consultation. These exceptions apply where artefacts have a value independent of their ivory content, he explains. General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Deidre Brock calls for halting new rules on reporting of donations made between Scottish and Northern Irish organisations during the EU referendum. She says potential moving of the dates would disable transparency on this kind of funding. She says the Constitutional Research Council gave money to the DUP's Leave campaign in Northern Ireland. It has also funded the European Research Group and the Chairman of that group, Exiting the EU Minister Steve Baker, she says. She believes there should be a debate on this in the new year. Ivory debate House of LordsParliament Shadow environment spokesperson Baroness Jones of Whitchurch winds up this afternoon's debate on the ivory trade for Labour, pointing out that there is widespread support for tackling an industry associated with ""cruel and unnecessary slaughter"". She says whatever action is taken it needs to be ""operable, simple and deliverable"". On the question of exemptions, she says there should be an end to the distinction between pre- and post-1947 antiques, as it's unworkable. She adds that the exception for works of art is overly ""vague"". General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Nigel Huddleston says he is very concerned by ""what's happening online"". He says that generally, MPs in the House of Commons do get along; they do sometimes ""vehemently disagree,"" but he says while Parliamentarians have opinions, it doesn't ""necessarily mean that we're right"". He says that different Parliamentarians may look at the same data and see different points. He says if MPs are using a hashtag which is then being exploited by another group, then it is incumbent upon them to distance themselves from the trend. It can be ""disheartening"" that ""occasionally in this place...to hear people insinuate that because I'm a Tory, therefore I wake up in the morning wanting to hurt poor or disabled people, that is so far from the reality, it's downright offensive,"" he says. ""If anybody believes that in a public debate sphere or forum, then I feel really sorry for them,"" he adds. He finishes by calling for cross-party work to call out abuse against people online. General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Lyn Brown is using her speech to discuss poverty in Newham. She says that research suggests that 13 out of 20 children in Newham live in poverty. Newham is one of the areas of highest deprivation in the country, she says, and has one of the highest number of betting shops in any borough There are ""81 in operation, 12 on one street alone,"" she says. ""Newham Council estimate that Â£20m of residents' money was lost to Fixed Odds Betting Machines in just one year,"" she says. She says she has called for a reduction in the maximum stake to Â£2. She says a Â£2 limit would help to stop problem gambling. It would be a ""great, if belated Christmas present"" to the children of Newham, she adds. Ivory debate House of LordsParliament Ex-Metropolitan Police chief and crossbencher Lord Hogan-Howe is giving his maiden speech. He speaks of his 38 years in the service, saying he has ""never lost the thrill of arresting the bad guy to help the good guy"". Turning to the topic for debate, he says he backs a ban on ivory for domestic sale, but notes this still leaves the way open for a loophole via gifts and exchange. He warns that the exemption for items of artistic and historical value is ""too subjective and too broadly drawn"". General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Jamie Stone uses his speech to call for increased connectivity in his constituency of Caithness, Sutherland & Easter Ross. He says that broadband and energy ""do not respect national boundaries"", adding that people in his constituency struggle with Universal Credit claims because broadband is so slow, and he sees energy connectivity is still not good for his constituencies. He finishes by thanking all the staff for introducing him to the House of Commons over the past six months. Leader of the Commons tweets Allow Twitter content?

General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Paul Beresford is using his general debate speech to call for vaccination of HPV for both girls and boys. He says that the virus is mostly harmless, but there are two types which are dangerous to humans, and can cause illnesses. The prevalence of head and neck cancers is one of the fastest increasing in the UK, he says the cancer is also more suffered by men. There is a link between the two, he says, cervical cancer is linked to HPV and head and neck cancers are linked to HPV in men, he adds. General adjournment debate House of CommonsParliament As is customary before any recess, the House of Commons now turns to a general debate on ""matters to be raised before the forthcoming adjournment"". MPs may raise any topic as part of the debate. Conservative Bob Blackman says that his Homelessness Reduction Act was one of the last pieces of legislation to be given Royal Assent before the general election. He says it is both the longest and most expensive private members' bill in history, but will change how homeless people are treated. Ivory debate House of LordsParliament In the Lords, Conservative Lord Carrington of Fulham is opening his debate on a motion that this House takes note of the impact of the trade in ivory on endangered species, and of the efforts being made to eliminate that trade while protecting the cultural heritage of antique ivory. He tells peers ""the first priority is to protect elephants"" and while the trade of post-1947 ivory objects is already illegal, ""the current ban has not worked"". He discusses the difficulty of discerning which antique ivory objects are of ""museum quality"" and therefore should not be destroyed. Russian interference debate House of CommonsParliament Matt Hancock, Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Minister says that tomorrow the Foreign Secretary will be in Russia and will have discussions with the Russian government about disinformation. ""The SNP needs to take a cold hard look at itself,"" Mr Hancock says, referring to the fact that former SNP leader Alex Salmond now has a programme on the Kremlin-backed RT broadcaster. ""It is vital that we do not surrender our own values of liberal democracy"" in response to Russian disinformation, the minister says. He says that Ofcom has found RT to be in breach of broadcasters' code on 13 occasions. ""Our best defence is our critical faculties,"" Mr Hancock says. He says the government may take a view, but the National Cyber Security Centre is only able to respond to direct hacking, rather than take views on disinformation or bots being used. Russian interference debate House of CommonsParliament The SNPs Europe spokesman Stephen Gethins says that Russia is ""a wonderful country with a rich history"". However, he says, President Putin has had a ""devastating impact"" on his own people and urges the UK to work with the EU to stabilise countries threatened by the Russian Federation. Shadow digital economy minister Liam Byrne says it is ""ludicrous"" that the national security strategy does not include an objective to defend ""the integrity of our democracy"". ""The price of freedom is constant vigilance,"" he says. Russian interference debate House of CommonsParliament Before becoming an MP Conservative Bob Seely worked as a journalist in the Soviet Union. He stresses the importance of ""calling out malign Russian intent"" and makes a recommendation. He says that in 1980s America a powerful intelligence committee was set up to ""inoculate society against the lies that are told"". He calls for the UK Parliament to emulate this. Â© 2025 BBC.

Disgraced US cardinal dies in RomeCardinal Bernard Law resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002 over his handling of sex abuse cases.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"Cardinal Law was head of a major basilica in Rome until 2011 Cardinal Bernard Law, who was forced to resign as archbishop of Boston 15 years ago over a Church sex abuse scandal, has died aged 86 in Rome. Cardinal Law stepped down in 2002 after journalists reported he had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims. The film Spotlight was later made about the allegations against dozens of priests in his Boston diocese. After leaving Boston, Cardinal Law took a post at the Vatican. He worked there until 2011. The child sex abuse allegations, which covered events over a period of decades, led to hundreds of lawsuits and threatened the Boston diocese with bankruptcy. As a result, it agreed to sell land and buildings for more than $100m (Â£63m) to fund legal settlements for more than 500 victims. The scandal prompted the Vatican to draw up new plans to combat child sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. Disgraced Boston cardinal retires from new Rome job The Vatican's child abuse response Born in 1931 in Torreon, Mexico, Cardinal Law was the son of a US Air Force colonel and a musician. He graduated from Harvard University and was ordained a priest in 1961. He soon became heavily involved in civil rights work in Mississippi and his name was included on a hit list compiled by segregationists. In 1984, Cardinal Law was appointed Archbishop of Boston and was a high-profile figure both in Church matters and in the wider world. He raised millions of dollars to help victims of natural disasters and worked to improve ties between Catholics and other Christian groups. Cardinal Law held deeply traditional positions on issues such as Aids, abortion, same-sex marriage and education policy. He stepped down as Archbishop of Boston in 2002 following a series of reports alleging the cover-up of sexual misconduct by priests exposed by the Boston Globe newspaper's investigative Spotlight team. ""It is my fervent prayer that this action may help the archdiocese of Boston to experience the healing, reconciliation and unity which are so desperately needed,"" he said at the time. Cardinal Law went on to serve as the archpriest of the Basilica of the Santa Maria Maggiore until his retirement at the age of 80 in 2011. By Martin Bashir, BBC religious affairs correspondent Although Cardinal Bernard Law played a major role in inter-religious dialogue, serving as chair of the Bishops' Committee on Ecumenical and Interracial Affairs and on the Vatican's Commission on Religious Relations with Jews, it was his action in covering up child sexual abuse that stained his entire career. Revelations in the Boston Globe newspaper led to the uncovering of widespread child abuse by Catholic clergy within his diocese. The newspaper was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and Cardinal Law was forced to resign as Archbishop of Boston in 2002. Cardinal Law never faced criminal charges for his role in allowing priests accused of abusing children to remain in the church and his appointment as archpriest of the Papal Liberian Basilica of St Mary Major, effectively a second career, was perceived as adding insult to the injuries inflicted on children. Key dates: 1931: Born in Torreon, Mexico 1961: Ordained a priest 1973: Appointed bishop 1984: Became Archbishop of Boston 1985: Appointed cardinal 2002: Vatican accepts his resignation The investigation carried out by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team led to reports that dozens of priests who sexually abused children had been moved from parish to parish for years under Cardinal Law's tenure without informing parishioners or police. At the time, the Church was politically powerful in Boston and the cover-up of sexual abuse by more than 70 priests in the Boston area was seen as a move aimed at protecting the institution's reputation. However the damning reports published by the Globe resulted not only in the resignation of Cardinal Law, but the uncovering of further abuse in 102 cities in the US and 105 dioceses worldwide. The story of the Spotlight investigation, which involved a team of four reporters, was immortalised in the 2015 film Spotlight, which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2016.

UK to soften Brexit impact on European banks,"The Bank of England is to unveil plans allowing European banks to operate in the UK as normal post-Brexit. The BBC has learned that banks offering wholesale finance - money and services provided to businesses and each other - would operate under existing rules. It means EU banks operating through branches can continue without creating subsidiaries - an expensive process. Branches offer an easy way for banks to move money around their international operations. But they present the risk that, in the event of a financial crisis, funds are quickly repatriated to the foreign bank's headquarters - leaving customers of the UK branch out of pocket. Subsidiaries are forced to hold their own shock-absorbing capital which can't cut and run - they essentially become UK companies. Changing from a branch to a subsidiary could cost billions for a bank like Deutsche Bank, for example, which employs 9,000 people in the UK. Currently, banks based anywhere in the EU can sell services to anywhere else in the EU thanks to an instrument known as a financial services passport. Brexit 'affecting London's talent pool' Cold comfort in Bank's reassurance Will the government's economic medicine work? On Monday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier wastalking tough on UK-based financial services access to the European single market after Brexit,external. ""There is no place (for financial services). There is not a single trade agreement that is open to financial services. It doesn't exist. In leaving the single market, they lose the financial services passport,"" he said. Which begs the question - if they are playing hard ball - why are we being so nice in rolling out the red carpet? Miles Celic, head of the lobbying group TheCityUK, said offering continuity to EU banks was an act of goodwill, but it was also one of enlightened self interest. ""Encouraging EU banks to continue to operate in the UK will help preserve financial stability for the UK and the EU and will help defend London's position as an open global financial centre,"" he said. The Bank of England's announcement has the blessing of the government Forcing EU bank branches in the UK to become separately capitalised subsidiaries may well have encouraged European banks to pull out of London - gradually eroding its pre-eminence as a financial centre. But on the other hand, London acts as the wholesale bank to the EU and access to its expertise and capital is highly prized. Some may see this decision as surrendering a trump card that should have been held back for the tough negotiations ahead. So, why are we allowing the EU access to this valuable resource while the EU threatens to create barriers the other way? Government sources said there are three reasons. First, there are the jobs. Tens of thousands of highly paid people work in the London branches of big EU banks. That also creates knock on jobs in other professions like accountancy and law. Second, those people pay a lot of tax to the exchequer. And third, there is another important economic point. Services sold by the UK branch of a French or German bank to a third country like the US, for example, count as UK exports - something the government is keen to maximise. In a speech back in October, Sam Woods, the head of the Prudential Regulation Authority (the bit of the Bank of England that supervises banks) said the reason the European financial markets work so well is not just due to the ""passport"" that Michel Barnier insists will be revoked. He said he hoped ""for a strong, co-operative relationship in which wholesale banks can continue to operate across the UK and EU27 in branches... We have embedded a sophisticated framework of supervisory co-operation... There is every reason to think these will continue into the future"" This sentiment echoes what a senior banker told me six months ago - ""if the regulators were in charge, and not the politicians, this would all be sorted out in a fortnight."" They are not in charge. But I understand the bank has the blessing of the government in offering this ""no new post-Brexit strings attached"" access to the world's largest financial centre.

Senate passes sweeping US tax reform,"This video can not be played US tax bill: the winners and losers The US Senate has approved the most sweeping overhaul of the US tax system in more than three decades. Republicans say the tax cuts for corporations, small businesses and individuals will boost economic growth. Democrats, who all voted against it, say it is designed to benefit the ultra-rich at the expense of the national deficit. For final approval, the legislation must go back to the House on Wednesday for a procedural issue. If it passes, as expected, it will be President Donald Trump's first major legislative triumph.

The Republican tax plan explained Will Trump's plans trigger a tax war? How the reforms affect us all Shortly before the final tally was announced, protesters in the Senate's public gallery shouted ""kill the bill"". They were escorted out. Corporate taxes will be set at 21%, instead of the current rate of 35%. The bill will also lower individual tax rates, albeit temporarily. Other key elements include: Less inheritance tax An expanded child tax credit Lower taxes on overseas profits The vote has kept to party lines: Republicans in favour, Democrats in protest. Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress. The House earlier approved the bill comfortably, 227 to 203. In the Senate, it was 51 to 48. Democrat leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans that they would pay a price for the ""awful legislation"" in next year's mid-term elections. ""The substance and polling are so rotten that a year from now Republicans will be running from this bill in shame for voting yes this evening,"" he said. Speaker Paul Ryan remained wholly enthusiastic, saying: ""Today we are giving the people of this country their money back. This is their money after all!"" This video can not be played Paul Ryan's exuberant gavelling reflects how long he's pushed for tax reform The tax reform is good news for businesses, particularly multinational corporations and the commercial property industry. The extremely wealthy and parents sending their children to private schools are set to benefit. However, families living in high-tax, high-cost states could lose out, so could those paying for their own health insurance. Read the full explanation In the immediate future, the plan will see the vast majority of tax payers having lower tax bills, but the cuts expire in 2025. This video can not be played Chants of ""kill the bill"" drowned out proceedings at the Senate By 2027, theTax Policy Center estimates,externalthat the overall change would be negligible. And 53% of taxpayers would face higher bills, many of them in the lower income brackets. It could also be bad news for Alaskan animals as the bill attached a measure to open drilling in parts of the Arctic that have been protected for environmental reasons since 1960. Read more on the effects on Alaska's wilds The bill's final passing hit a last-minute hurdle when it was found that three procedural rules had been violated. As small changes to the wording were made, it now needs to return to the House of Representatives to be approved again. Some democrats say it is the speed at which the bill has been put together that caused the final hitch. ""The House re-vote is the latest evidence of just how shoddily written the GOP tax scam really is,"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. Republicans insist that such a major overhaul will always have hiccups, which are just part of the procedure. ""Listen, people screw up. A member of the staff screwed up. It's not the end of Western civilisation,"" Republican Senator John Kennedy told MSNBC, according to Reuters news agency. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter It wasn't exactly easy, but President Trump now has his signature legislative achievement. The self-styled dealmaker-in-chief was finally able to flex his party's majority muscle, overcoming internal dissent to accomplish some long-sought political goals. Subject to a vote in the House early on Wednesday, Republicans have reduced taxes by more than $1.4 trillion (Â£1tn) over 10 years, including significant changes to the corporate tax structure. Congressional conservatives also opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling - a pitched partisan battle for years. And it set a bomb at the heart of Obamacare by ending the tax penalty for those who don't have medical insurance starting in 2019. Vice-President Mike Pence announced the result What one Congress can do another can undo, of course, and the task ahead for Republicans is selling a sceptical public on the benefits of their plan. While they may argue that Americans will come around once they see lower tax bills, many may have already made up their mind. Like Obamacare eight years ago, this tax legislation was passed by partisan muscle alone. And like that law, many Americans view the legislation as largely benefitting others. They will be difficult to convince otherwise. Repealing key provisions of this tax law will be as uniting for Democrats as healthcare repeal was for conservatives. Donald Trump and Republicans have their victories. They will have to fight to keep them. The predicted boost for business has caused the stock market to soar in recent weeks. US economic growth is also expected to have a knock-on effect around the world. As a result of the reforms, US companies with offshore dealings could decide to keep their money at home, enticed by lower corporation taxes plus a desire to avoid new restrictions on shifting profits abroad. Trump's tax cuts: Why they matter further afield Companies operating overseas, such as big tech and pharma companies, would be taxed at a low rate - 15.5% - to return the cash to the US in a one-time move. Ireland, where Apple has a major base, still undercuts the US with its headline corporation tax rate of 12.5%. Trump's tax cuts: Why they matter to us Winners and losers? What is in the tax plan?

Birmingham set to host Commonwealth Games,"Weightlifting would be held at Birmingham's Symphony Hall under the city's plans Birmingham is set to be officially announced as the host of the 2022 Commonwealth Games on Thursday. It was the only interested city to submit a bid before the original 30 September deadline but was deemed ""not fully compliant"" by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). The CGF then gave rivals until 30 November to apply. Earlier this month the CGF reiterated it needed ""further clarification on issues"" before choosing a host city. But the BBC understands Birmingham has now finally prevailed in its attempt to stage the Â£750m showpiece, the most expensive sports event in Britain since the London 2012 Olympics. The bidding process has been beset with problems, with the South African city of Durban originally awarded the Games in 2015 before being stripped of the event in March because it did not meet the CGF criteria. Birmingham beat Liverpool in September to be Britain's candidate city and the bidsubsequently received government backing. As part of its bid, Birmingham has proposed to createthe UK's largest permanent athletics stadium, supplemented byfour indoor arenas. Birmingham is securing its first global sports event and will become the third British city since 2000 to host the Commonwealth Games. Other than Liverpool, it never faced a proper rival and was made to wait by the CGF, but none of that will bother a bid team that was always confident of victory. The fact there was only one official bidder is another reminder of the image problem facing big sports events. But the CGF has a new strategy designed to help support host cities, and believes its partnership with Birmingham can help find a solution to the challenge facing sports federations. Meanwhile, a bitter five-month long bin dispute has finally been resolved but amid further budget cuts, West Midlands local authorities will need to raise 25% of the overall cost of staging the Games. Organisers insist essential services will not be affected, and that the event will prove great value for the West Midlands, showcasing a diverse and youthful community, and leaving a sporting and economic legacy. But after the fiasco of the London Olympic Stadium's finances, there will be significant scrutiny of the costs and legacy benefits. However, after London 2012, Glasgow 2014, the start of the Tour de France and recent world championships in rugby, women's cricket and athletics, Britain is now set to organise yet another major sports event. It is a reminder of the importance the government now places on hosting sport as a platform for trade and tourism as the country prepares for Brexit.

England homelessness 'a national crisis',"The report says 120,000 children are homeless and living in temporary accommodation Homelessness in England is a ""national crisis"" and the government's attitude to tackling it is ""unacceptably complacent"", a committee of MPs say. A Public Accounts Committee report found there were more than 9,000 rough sleepers and some 78,000 families living in temporary accommodation. The cross-party research said there was a shortage of housing options for homeless people and those at risk. The government says it is investing more than Â£1 billion on the problem. The definition of homelessness under law includes rough sleepers, single people in hostels and those in temporary accommodation. Since 2011, the number of people sleeping on the streets has increased by 134 per cent,the report says.,external Meanwhile, those living in temporary accommodation has risen by about two-thirds in the last seven years. Some 120,000 children are among those without permanent housing, the report says. 'I asked to go to jail, rather than stay homeless' Ten-year goal to end youth homelessness Labour MP Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, says the government's approach to tackling the problem of homelessness has been an ""abject failure"". ""The government must do more to understand and measure the real world costs and causes of homelessness and put in place the joined-up strategy that is so desperately needed. ""That means properly addressing the shortage of realistic housing options for those at risk of homelessness or already in temporary accommodation. ""More fundamentally, it means getting a grip on the market's failure to provide genuinely affordable homes, both to rent and to buy."" Ms Hillier suggests action such as providing financial support to local authorities with acute shortages of suitable housing. Can Finland help reduce UK homelessness?

Resident dolphins found off English coastA pod of 28 bottlenose dolphins is found to be permanently living off the south-west coast of England.1h42 minutes agoEngland,"Experts analysed thousands of photographs and sightings of bottlenose dolphins The first resident pod of bottlenose dolphins has been discovered off the south-west coast of England. Experts used thousands of sightings and photos to identify a group of 28 individuals living year-round off the coasts of Cornwall, Devon and Dorset. They were identified using their dorsal fins, which are as unique to dolphins as fingerprints are to humans. Plymouth University researchers studied 3,843 records to identify 98 dolphins and among them the resident population. The sightings, recorded between 2007 and 2016, established the group was present in shallow coastal waters, mainly off Cornwall and particularly near St Ives Bay and Mount's Bay. More Cornwall and Devon stories here Ruth Williams, marine conservation manager at the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ""Further work is needed but this is a huge step forward and I am proud of what our partnership between Cornwall Wildlife Trust, scientists and boat operators has achieved. ""We need to make sure the few we currently have in the south west are given the protection not just to survive, but to thrive.""

Brexit 'hits London's talent pool',"This video can not be played 'We're preparing for the worst', says Standard Chartered boss Bill Winters The UK's ability to attract talent is already suffering, following the vote to leave the EU, according to the boss of the UK's fifth-largest bank. Standard Chartered is ""preparing for the worst"" from Brexit, chief executive Bill Winters told the BBC. The UK-headquartered bank is in the process of turning its Frankfurt branch into a subsidiary requiring additional capital, licences and staff. He said this was ""inconvenient and expensive"" and will damage London. ""London will take hits in the context of Brexitâ¦ I think big parts of the euro-denominated corporate banking business will be forced into Europe. ""It's possible that through the Brexit negotiations that there is some sort of extended passporting rule [ability of banks to sell services across Europe from a UK base] but none of us are expecting that quite frankly, or preparing for that. ""We have to prepare for the worstâ¦ let's hope for the best, but we're prepared for the worst."" Mr Winters said he would be happy to take the tens of millions of pounds he has spent on Brexit contingency planning and ""flush it down the toilet"" if it meant he could carry on as before and maintain the bank's current structure. The mood music from the UK has already affected the bank's ability to attract the best and brightest talent according to Mr Winters. ""We have already had some setbacks for the talent pool in London through the restriction on student visas. That's already a problem. ""Some of the best talent that we can have in the UK marketplace is coming from students that have chosen to study here and then stayed for some extended period afterwardsâ¦ We've noticed that's been impacted already. ""More through a sense from non-UK [people] that this might not be such a hospitable place any longer - it's more psychological than contractual."" Official numbers bear this out. After a decade of uninterrupted growth, applications from EU students for places at UK universities dropped by more than 7% last year, according to UCAS, even though their right to stay on and work is, as yet, unaffected. A Department for Education spokesperson said it was taking action to provide certainty for students. ""We have confirmed that EU students starting their courses in the academic year 18/19 or before will continue to be eligible for student loans and home fee status and will have a right to remain in the UK to complete their course,"" they added. Bill Winters says US President Donald Trump is wrong to allow China to grow its economic influence Standard Chartered is not a High Street bank here in the UK. It is probably best known here as Liverpool FC's shirt sponsor but it is a well-known financial brand in Asia, the Middle East and Africa and has a front row seat when it comes to financing global trade and investment. It provides advice and cash to grease the wheels of commerce within and between some of the world's fastest-growing markets. Former Wall Street banker Mr Winters is convinced the US under Donald Trump is making a big mistake in allowing China to grow its global economic influence in areas from which the US is retreating - as demonstrated when it dropped out of a trade mega deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""They're creating effectively a multi-regional trading bloc creating these markets in much the same way that the US and UK created markets in Europe after the Second World War during a period of so much devastation. ""They are creating markets where they will be less dependent on Europeâ¦the US is taking itself out of some of the key discussions for them and then actual trade agreements where the US could continue to have an extremely benevolent influence that it has had for decades. I think we have got to be extremely careful about that - and the UK does as well."" This video can not be played Bill Winters discusses the growing influence of China Mr Winters understands risk. He was part of a major report into the stability of the UK financial system commissioned by the government after the financial crisis. He believes the banks are much more secure than they were a decade ago but that has presented another type of risk. A lot of banks have seen their profitability, their earning power reduced. They have been forced to hold more shock-absorbing money in reserve and that has meant their earning power per pound of the capital they set aside has diminished. Meanwhile, technology companies are coming along and doing lots of the things banks like to charge for - like foreign exchange and making payments - and doing them more cheaply and conveniently. Many experts think banking's next crisis is the competition from nimble tech firms that don't have all the expense associated with being a bank. This is one reason why many banks' shares (including Standard Chartered) - are trading at roughly half the price they appear to be worth on paper. The idea that banks can't make enough money may seem perverse but any business that can't earn a sufficient return on the capital provided by investors is ultimately doomed as investors will take their capital away. Mr Winters, however, is confident that banks are here to stay. ""For my thirty five years in banking I've started every year with people saying there is some enormous competitive threat looming - and they are right - there always is. But if you serve your customers as best you can you will stay relevant"" 'We're preparing for the worst' Video, 00:03:05'We're preparing for the worst' Bank boss: US losing global influence.

Right granted to ask for fast broadband,"Homes and businesses will have a legal right to demand faster broadband speed by 2020, the government has said, after rejecting a voluntary offer from BT. It has promised that the whole of the UK will have access to speeds of at least 10 Mbps by 2020. BT, which is responsible for the infrastructure, had previously offered to carry out improvements according to its own timetable. But the company said it accepted the government's decision. The government believes the regulatory Universal Service Obligation offers ""certainty"". Under the plan, broadband providers will face a legal requirement to provide this minimum standard to anyone requesting it, subject to a cost threshold. The UK lags behind many countries in terms of speed and reliability. BT customer Lee Wootton-Rowley, who lives in Wakefield, contacted the BBC to say: ""I get 5 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.9 in 2017. ""I lived in Malta for four years where I was getting 60 Mbps and 20 upload speed."" Mike Simatos, from Rotherhithe in south-east London, said his broadband supply speed was no faster than 4 Mbps. He described the service as ""appalling"". Regulator Ofcom said that 4% of UK premises, or about 1.1 million, could not access broadband speeds of at least 10 Mbps. It said poor connections were a particular concern for small businesses, with almost 230,000 unable to get a decent service. Ofcom defines superfast broadband as a download speed of 30 Mbps or more. Matt Hancock, minister of state for digital said on the BBC's Today programme: ""Access means you can phone up somebody, ask for it and then someone has the legal duty to deliver on that promise. ""It is about having the right to demand it, so it will be an on-demand programme. ""So if you don't go on the internet, aren't interested, then you won't phone up and demand this."" In response to the announcement, BT said: ""BT and Openreach want to get on with the job of making decent broadband available to everyone in the UK, so we'll continue to explore the commercial options for bringing faster speeds to those parts of the country which are hardest to reach."" In one sense, there is little new in today's announcement - people in remote places were promised a legal right to a minimum 10Mbps broadband service by 2020 and now they are going to get it. But in rejecting BT's plan for a voluntary agreement to fill in most of the remaining parts of the country with a decent service, the government is taking quite a risk. The plan, opposed as anti-competitive by BT's rivals, would at least have given some certainty. But now it is far from clear who will provide this Universal Service Obligation - the government hopes new providers will come in alongside BT's Openreach  - or what technology will be employed. New fast fibre firms are now competing in the cities, but the 1.1 million homes and offices Ofcom says still cannot get a 10Mbps service are mainly in rural areas, and it is not clear they will be keen to lay cables along every lane. Now it is the regulator's  job to make sure this all works. There are now two years to push through new legislation, work out how to police it, and determine what is a reasonable cost threshold for hooking up really remote homes. Should be a doddle, shouldn't it? Rival firms, which had talked of legal action if the government accepted BT's offer, welcomed the decision. Both TalkTalk and Sky said the government had made the right decision. Tristia Harrison, TalkTalk chief executive, said: ""By opting for formal regulation rather than weaker promises, ministers are guaranteeing consumers will get the minimum speeds they need at a price they can afford,"" she said. ""The whole industry now needs to work together to ensure customers see the benefits as quickly as possible."" Stephen van Rooyen, Sky's UK and Ireland chief executive, said: ""Government have made the right decision by choosing a fair and transparent approach that maintains competition, keeps prices fair and gives consumers a legal right to request broadband."" Following the introduction of secondary legislation early next year, it is thought it will take another two years before the right is enforced by Ofcom. Under BT's offer, which the company had said would cost up to Â£600m, 98.5% of premises would have had access to a fixed broadband service in 2020. Another 0.7% would have access to a service delivered by a combination of fixed and wireless connections. The remaining 0.8% in the most difficult-to-reach areas would have been guided toward satellite or on-demand fibre solutions.

"Uber is taxi service, says European court","Uber is officially a transport company and not a digital service, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled. The ride-hailing firm argued it was an information society service - helping people to make contact with each other electronically - and not a cab firm. The case arose after Uber was told to obey local taxi rules in Barcelona. Uber said the verdict would make little difference to the way it operated in Europe, but experts say the case could have implications for the gig economy. An Uber spokesperson said: ""This ruling will not change things in most EU countries where we already operate under transportation law. ""However, millions of Europeans are still prevented from using apps like ours. As our new CEO has said, it is appropriate to regulate services such as Uber and so we will continue the dialogue with cities across Europe. This is the approach we'll take to ensure everyone can get a reliable ride at the tap of a button."" Uber a danger to public safety, warns union Uber used undercover agents, court letter says Uber settles defamation lawsuit filed by Indian rape victim Uber concealed huge data breach In its ruling, the ECJ said that a service whose purpose was ""to connect, by means of a smartphone application and for remuneration, non-professional drivers using their own vehicle with persons who wish to make urban journeys"" must be classified as ""a service in the field of transport"" in EU law. It added: ""As EU law currently stands, it is for the member states to regulate the conditions under which such services are to be provided in conformity with the general rules of the treaty on the functioning of the EU."" This ruling is another example of how the courts and regulators are struggling to make sense of the phenomenon known as the gig economy. Since Uber was first launched less than a decade ago, it has repeatedly fallen foul of regulators in different countries - and has frequently been forced to change its business model as a result. This ruling sets out clearly that Uber is, in legal terms at least, a transport company. Uber itself insists that there won't be a huge immediate impact on its business, but it could still affect how it operates in future and how it liaises with national governments. Uber itself has previously said this will undermine the reform of what it calls outdated laws. On a wider basis, it could have implications for other gig economy businesses that try to portray themselves as little more than an app on a phone, connecting providers with customers; it appears the courts, so far, are taking a different view. That could ultimately have an impact, not just on ride-hailing services, but on other gig economy services - such as couriers and accommodation providers - who operate a similar model. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said the verdict meant Uber must ""play by the same rules as everybody else"". She added: ""Their drivers are not commodities. They deserve at the very least the minimum wage and holiday pay. ""Advances in technology should be used to make work better, not to return to the type of working practices we thought we'd seen the back of decades ago."" The verdict comes after Uber was told last month thatthe appeal to renew its licence in London could take years,according to Mayor Sadiq Khan. Uber's presence around the world has often been controversial, with protests staged against it in various cities. However, Rohan Silva, a tech entrepreneur and former adviser to David Cameron, says the firm has made competitors up their game. ""Millions of people use these ride-hailing apps every day - not just Uber, but dozens of others too. They have brought real benefits, making it cheaper, easier and more convenient to get around the city,"" he toldRadio 4's Today programme. ""There has also been a benefit in incumbent London taxi cabs, which are now taking credit cards, which they resisted for years. That is a response to competition."" He added that similar services could soon face regulation as a result of the ECJ ruling. ""There could be big implications for a sharing economy service like Airbnb, which will probably be regulated by the EU,"" he said. ""What is fascinating about this right now is that different countries are taking very different views. Portugal has legalised Uber and Airbnb, whereas France is clamping down."" Prof Andre Spicer, from the Cass Business School, welcomed the ruling. He told Today: ""Many people see the EU is actually leading the way in pushing back the almost unlimited power of tech firms and beginning to provide some limits around that. ""We also claim this fosters competition, but what Uber's model is based on is pricing, so much that they basically drove everyone else out of the market. ""This judgement will allow normal competition, so what we will see is lots of other smaller apps appearing around Europe.""

Post Office to get extra Â£370m of funding,"The Post Office network is to get Â£370m in new funding, the government has announced. About Â£160m of the money will be used to protect village community branches, Business Secretary Greg Clark said. The three-year funding deal, running from next April, comes as the Post Office announced it had moved into profit for the first time in 16 years. Unions dismissed claims the investment would save the network, arguing that it was just ""managing decline"". In addition to the money for village branches, some Â£210m will be used to modernise services and technology. The government said it had invested more than Â£2bn since 2010, leaving a network of around 11,600 branches, extended opening hours and thousands of branches open on a Sunday. Mr Clark said the Post Office, run by an independent board, was ""at the heart of communities across the UK, with millions of customers and small businesses relying on their local branch every day to access a wide range of important services"". He said: ""With the network at its most stable in decades, this Â£370m of government funding will ensure it can continue to modernise and bring further benefits to customers across the UK."" Alongside the announcement, the Post Office revealed that it made Â£13m in the last financial year. Paula Vennells, its chief executive, described this as ""a major milestone in the Post Office's journey to a sustainable and successful business"". She added that ""we are better placed than ever to embrace the future"". But a spokesman for the Communication Workers Union said the government ""was dressing up"" the announcement as good news. In reality, the network was facing a funding cut, and the turnaround in profits was achieved from branch closures and thousands of job cuts, the CWU said. Brian Scott, of the Unite union, said the Post Office lacked a ""coherent strategy for the future"" and said that profits were being achieved through a ""slash-and-burn approach"".

Is the UK the most Christmas obsessed country?,"The UK is the country where the character Ebenezer Scrooge was invented, the man who would scoff ""bah humbug"" at any Christmas revellers. But Brits are no Scrooges, according to Google. The search engine claims people in Britain make more Christmas searches than anywhere else in the world. Whether it's searching mince pie recipes, or hunting down the perfect tree decorations, the UK seems to be Christmas obsessed. For the past four years the UK has had the highest search interest in Christmas topics, taking over from Ireland, which was top in 2012 and 2013. And in November and December of every year since 2010, UK search interest in Christmas topics has increased. ""Based on experiences I have, there's no question that we are the most Christmas obsessed,"" says shop owner Robert Newman. The 69-year-old is well-versed in this field, because he runs a Christmas shop in Stratford-upon-Avon that is open all year round. He says he will have returning customers come to the shop up to seven times in a year. ""It's just such a magical time for everyone, it's a time for family and celebration."" Consumer and retail analyst Kate Hardcastle is not surprised by the number of Christmas searches coming from the UK. She believes that the negative national mood over hard-hitting news events means people are going to try and make Christmas extra special this year. ""Life is really tough right now and emotionally, therefore everyone is aiming towards a celebration."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The Lincolnshire village of Keelby is at the top of the table when it comes to Christmas-related searches in the UK. Google's data shows the proportion of searches that relate to Christmas as a percentage of all searches in the given area and time period. A score of 100 shows the highest percentage of Christmas searches, and every other score is calculated in relation to that. In November people in Keelby, home to just over 2,000 people, made the highest proportion of searches for Christmas out of all the searches in the area. That gave it a score of 100, a fair way ahead of Rhos-on-Sea in North Wales, which came in second place with a score of 89. Burnham, on the outskirts of London, had the lowest Christmas search score of five.

Why is Christmas dinner more expensive this year? 'I spend Â£400 on each of my five kids' In 2017, UK search interest has been over a third higher than in the US, the data shows. Ms Hardcastle says because the USA has the added holiday of Thanksgiving in November, people in Britain are more focussed on a single holiday than those across the pond. Our interest in the festive period is also beginning earlier in the year, as search engine results have more than doubled in the last seven years between September and October. But what role does advertising have to play in Britons searching for Christmas earlier in the year? Retailers, supermarkets and brandsbegan releasing their adverts in November, in an attempt to entice shoppers to spend more before December arrives. Brands are expected to spend a record Â£6bn on Christmas advertising this year, and Ms Hardcastle believes this is down to the relatively new UK phenomenon ofBlack Friday. ""The retailers have to push early with their Christmas messages because they know that they're not going to be able to get more spend out of some people,"" she says. ""But they're trying to secure the spend with them through Christmas adverts."" John Lewis is thought to have spent Â£7m on developing its Moz the Monster Christmas campaign A Christmas survey published by professional services firm Deloitte echoes Google's data. According to the survey, ""November is fast becoming the key month for Christmas purchases for UK shoppers."" ""Over 50% of consumers plan to do the majority of their Christmas shopping before December,"" it added. On top of being organised by shopping for goods early, the survey shows ""UK consumers are by far the most active online spenders in Europe, and are planning to spend 142% more on gifts and 207% more on food and drink online than the European average"". The UK has surpassed America's interest in Christmas online Matt Cooke, the head of Google News Labs says: ""When you look at what people have been searching for online over the past decade, you can see the UK's interest in all things relating to Christmas is greater than any other country, and we start looking for festive information earlier each year too. In 2016 more people used Google search to find information relating to Christmas than ever before - and search interest begins increasing as early as 1 July.""

Police to resume 'Christmas terror' searchesFour men remain in custody after counter-terror police raids in Sheffield and Chesterfield.6h6 hours agoEngland,"Police and the bomb disposal unit were seen outside a property in Chesterfield, Derbyshire Counter-terror police are carrying out searches of two properties after they foiled an alleged Islamist terror plot that may have happened at Christmas. Armed officers and an Army bomb disposal squad were involved in raids on five properties in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire on Tuesday. Four men arrested under the Terrorism Act remain in custody. Searches at scenes in Burngreave, Sheffield, and at a house in Chesterfield are under way. More on this story and others in South Yorkshire A 31-year-old man was arrested after the bomb squad cordoned off a street in Chesterfield. Three other men aged 22, 36 and 41 were arrested in the Burngreave and Meersbrook areas of Sheffield.

EU to act over Poland judiciary reformsThere are concerns that judiciary bills that have triggered protests threaten the rule of law.6h6 hours agoEurope,"Thousands of people across Poland have held protests against the proposed reforms The European Union has launched unprecedented disciplinary measures against Poland, saying its judicial reforms threaten the rule of law. It said 13 new laws in two years have allowed the government to ""interfere significantly"" in the judiciary. Poland has been given three months to address the concerns. In defiance of the EU move, President Andrzej Duda signed into law two bills reforming the Supreme Court and the National Council of the Judiciary. President Duda: ""I have taken a decision to sign these bills"" Mr Duda said this would deepen democracy in Poland, improve the justice system and restore citizens' faith in the judiciary. Poland's conservative government called the EU decision ""political"". It has repeatedly stated that the reforms are needed to curb inefficiency and corruption. After almost two years monitoring the situation in Poland, the European Commission - the EU executive - said this was a matter of ""common concern"" for the 28-member bloc. At a meeting in Brussels, the Commission decided to launch disciplinary measures, called Article 7, and asked Warsaw to: Not apply lower retirement age to current judges Remove the discretionary power of the president to prolong the mandate of Supreme Court judges Remove the new retirement regime for judges including the discretionary powers of the Minister of Justice Restore the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal The Commission's deputy head, First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, who had conducted talks with the Polish government led by the Law and Justice party (PiS), said there was ""no other option"" as the ""entire structure was affected"". WATCH: Why is Poland worrying the EU? Mr Timmermans said it was with ""heavy heart"" that he announced the measures ""After two years of trying for dialogue, of course we are frustrated that we haven't achieved what we want to, so now we're encouraging the council and Parliament to support us,"" he said. All member states will now be asked to decide whether Poland is violating EU standards. Such a ruling needs the backing of 22 out of the 28 states. Any possible sanctions would only come at a later stage. But Mr Timmermans said that Article 7 could be revoked if Poland addressed the points within the three-month period. The sanctions could lead to the suspension of Poland's voting rights at EU summits. But Hungary has said it would block such a move, known as the ""nuclear option"", that requires the approval of all member states. The row underlines an escalation of tensions between western countries and eastern, former Communist countries within the EU, correspondents say. Other sensitive issues include media independence and immigration. By Adam Easton, BBC News, Warsaw Poland's governing party says the judicial system needs deep reform because it is inefficient, slow and has never been ""decommunised"", in other words, communist-era judges and collaborators of that regime are still presiding over trials. It is perhaps ironic then, that the party's point man on judicial reform, the PiS MP Stanislaw Piotrowicz, is a former communist-era prosecutor. According to a recent opinion poll, 81% of Poles agree the court system needs reform. They were not asked whether they agreed with the party's solutions. The public's main grievances in order of importance were that trials drag on far too long, the proceedings themselves are too complicated and corrupt judges. PiS says its reforms would re-establish public trust in the judiciary. On TwitterPrime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said the reform was deeply needed,externaland that ""Poland is as devoted to the rule of law as the rest of the EU"". He added: ""The dialogue between the Commission and Warsaw needs to be both open and honest. I believe that Poland's sovereignty and the idea of United Europe can be reconciled."" Poland country profile Mr Morawiecki, who took office this month, has said that the EU has taken a one-sided view and that his country is entitled to carry out reforms. The proposals have sparked street protests. Following the announcement, a spokesman for the prime minister said talks could resume in January.

Derailed train lacked key safety system,"This video can not be played Footage shows the scale of the derailment Technology that forces trains to adhere to speed limits was being installed on the express that crashed in the US state of Washington on Monday but was not yet operational, investigators say. Three people died when the train derailed at 80mph (130km/h) on a bend with a speed limit of 30mph. Officials say the train's emergency brakes had been deployed automatically and not by the driver. A conductor undergoing training was in the cab at the time with the driver. Bella Dinh-Zarr, of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), told reporters that positive train control (PTC) - a safety system that automatically slows or stops trains that are going too fast - was not operational on the train. ""The locomotive was in the process of getting a system of PTC installed but it was not yet functional,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added that the board had long recommended that PTC be installed across all US rail systems. But, she added, Congress had extended the deadline for implementation of the legislation from the end of 2015 until the end of 2018, a delay she described as ""unfortunate"". The cost of implementing the system fully on all tracks and vehicles is reported to be more than $22bn (Â£16.4bn). This video can not be played A 45-second look at how Positive Train Control works Ms Dinh-Zarr said investigators were waiting to question the train's crew once they had recovered from their injuries. She said they would want to know, among other things, whether the driver had been distracted in the cab. ""Distraction is one of our most-wanted-list priorities,"" she said, adding that there was a ""conductor-in training"" also present in the cab who ""was getting experience and familiarising himself with the territory"". The spokeswoman added that the driver did not use the emergency brake, saying it ""was automatically activated after - when the accident was occurring rather being initiated by the engineer"". Train drivers are called engineers in the US. The 12-carriage train crashed shortly after leaving a new station on its inaugural run between Olympia and Tacoma on Amtrak's Cascades line. There were 86 people on board, including 77 passengers and seven Amtrak crew members, as well as a train technician. Passengers say the train rocked and creaked as it took the bend fast before plummeting off a bridge on to a busy motorway. Seven vehicles, two of them lorries, were hit on the I-5 highway. Several people were injured in their vehicles but none died. Several drivers, including US soldiers, rushed from their cars to help rescue trapped rail passengers. Authorities have removed all but one carriage, a 270,000lb (122,000 kg) engine, and they say repairs will need to be done to the highway before it can be re-opened. Two friends who were railway enthusiasts were identified as among the fatalities on Tuesday. Rail aficionado Zack Willhoite, 35, was identified by his employer Pierce Transit, who said the IT specialist ""played an important role in our agency"". The National Association of Railroad Passengers identified board member Jim Hamre as another victim.

The message, broadcast on Channel 4 on Christmas Day, will urge people to ""love and cherish"" their families. The children, aged between seven and 12, will also speak about the importance of having a home and their experiences on the night of the fire. Children who survived the tragedy also took part in a service at St Paul's to mark six months since the fire. Last year,the alternative Christmas message was given by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered during the EU referendum campaign. In this year's message, 10-year-old Hayam Atmani, who lived on the 15th floor of the tower, will say: ""My message for everyone at Christmas is to stay as a family, and don't suffer about anything. ""I know this has been a really hard time for everyone, but everyone went through and everyone helped as a family. So I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year."" She will describe the family's life in a hotel, where she will also spend her birthday on 27 December, as ""not that much fun"". Grenfell memorial- Key moments - BBC News The 21st floor - BBC News School in the shadow of disaster Sisters Megan and Luana Gomes, 10 and 12, who were both put into induced comas after the fire, to be treated for smoke inhalation, will also take part in the broadcast. Having spent five months in a hotel before moving into a temporary flat, they will both speak of the importance of having a home. Megan will say: ""My Christmas message is that I think all families, children and parents should have a nice warm cosy home. ""I just want everyone in the world to have a house at least."" Luana will add: ""My Christmas message is that everybody should love and respect each other because you never know what tomorrow will be like.  And it is important to love and cherish your family."" The children will also recount their memories of the night of the fire. Brothers Amiel and Danel Miller, 10 and seven, who lived on the 17th floor, will describe hearing screaming and their mother telling them to get their clothes on and run down the stairs. Danel will say: ""We got outside and then we saw stuff falling down from the tower and grass on fire."" But the children will also talk of happier things, including memories of their former homes and their favourite aspects of Christmas. Hayam will describe how her friends admired her former home.  ""Everyone came. They were just saying, 'Oh that's so cool! I wish I lived here.' You could see the whole area; parks and stuff,"" she will say. Megan will describe how her family always got a real Christmas tree to gather around. And Danel will bring a smile to viewers' faces, telling them that his Christmas message is to ""share food!"".

Disgraced US cardinal 'dies in Rome'Cardinal Bernard Law resigned as archbishop of Boston in 2002 over his handling of sex abuse cases.14m15 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Cardinal Law was head of a major basilica in Rome until 2011 Cardinal Bernard Law, who was forced to resign as archbishop of Boston 15 years ago over a Church sex abuse scandal, has died aged 86 in Rome. Cardinal Law stepped down in 2002 after journalists reported he had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims. The film Spotlight was later made about the allegations against dozens of priests in his Boston diocese. After leaving Boston, Cardinal Law took a post at the Vatican. He worked there until 2011. The child sex abuse allegations, which covered events over a period of decades, led to hundreds of lawsuits and threatened the Boston diocese with bankruptcy. As a result, it agreed to sell land and buildings for more than $100m (Â£63m) to fund legal settlements for more than 500 victims. The scandal prompted the Vatican to draw up new plans to combat child sex abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. Disgraced Boston cardinal retires from new Rome job The Vatican's child abuse response Born in 1931 in Torreon, Mexico, Cardinal Law was the son of a US Air Force colonel and a musician. He graduated from Harvard University and was ordained a priest in 1961. He soon became heavily involved in civil rights work in Mississippi and his name was included on a hit list compiled by segregationists. In 1984, Cardinal Law was appointed Archbishop of Boston and was a high-profile figure both in Church matters and in the wider world. He raised millions of dollars to help victims of natural disasters and worked to improve ties between Catholics and other Christian groups. Cardinal Law held deeply traditional positions on issues such as Aids, abortion, same-sex marriage and education policy. He stepped down as Archbishop of Boston in 2002 following a series of reports alleging the cover-up of sexual misconduct by priests exposed by the Boston Globe newspaper's investigative Spotlight team. ""It is my fervent prayer that this action may help the archdiocese of Boston to experience the healing, reconciliation and unity which are so desperately needed,"" he said at the time. Cardinal Law went on to serve as the archpriest of the Basilica of the Santa Maria Maggiore until his retirement at the age of 80 in 2011. By Martin Bashir, BBC religious affairs correspondent Although Cardinal Bernard Law played a major role in inter-religious dialogue, serving as chair of the Bishops' Committee on Ecumenical and Interracial Affairs and on the Vatican's Commission on Religious Relations with Jews, it was his action in covering up child sexual abuse that stained his entire career. Revelations in the Boston Globe newspaper led to the uncovering of widespread child abuse by Catholic clergy within his diocese. The newspaper was awarded the Pulitzer Prize and Cardinal Law was forced to resign as Archbishop of Boston in 2002. Cardinal Law never faced criminal charges for his role in allowing priests accused of abusing children to remain in the church and his appointment as archpriest of the Papal Liberian Basilica of St Mary Major, effectively a second career, was perceived as adding insult to the injuries inflicted on children. Key dates: 1931: Born in Torreon, Mexico 1961: Ordained a priest 1973: Appointed bishop 1984: Became Archbishop of Boston 1985: Appointed cardinal 2002: Vatican accepts his resignation The investigation carried out by the Boston Globe's Spotlight team led to reports that dozens of priests who sexually abused children had been moved from parish to parish for years under Cardinal Law's tenure without informing parishioners or police. At the time, the Church was politically powerful in Boston and the cover-up of sexual abuse by more than 70 priests in the Boston area was seen as a move aimed at protecting the institution's reputation. However the damning reports published by the Globe resulted not only in the resignation of Cardinal Law, but the uncovering of further abuse in 102 cities in the US and 105 dioceses worldwide. The story of the Spotlight investigation, which involved a team of four reporters, was immortalised in the 2015 film Spotlight, which won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2016.

Police 'thwart UK Christmas terror plot',"Police and the bomb disposal unit were seen outside a property in Chesterfield, Derbyshire Action has been taken against an alleged Islamist terror plot in the UK that could have happened at Christmas, counter terrorism sources say. Four men were arrested early on Tuesday in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire. An Army bomb disposal team cordoned off a street in Chesterfield where a 31-year-old man was arrested. Nearby homes were evacuated. Three other men aged 22, 36 and 41 were arrested in the Burngreave and Meersbrook areas of Sheffield. All four suspects were detained on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism under Section 41 ofthe Terrorism Act 2000,external. They have been taken to a police station in West Yorkshire for questioning. The cordon in Chesterfield was later lifted. This video can not be played Elizabeth Fogarty lives on the street where a raid by police took place this morning The cordon around one of the properties - the Fatima community centre on Brunswick Road in Burngreave - was extended on Tuesday afternoon and the bomb disposal unit attended. A large number of police vehicles and officers were outside the two-storey building. The main door appeared to be broken on the ground. Five raids at houses took place on Tuesday at: Shirebrook Road in Meersbrook, Sheffield two addresses in Burngreave, Sheffield - including Fatima Community Centre on Brunswick Road a house on King Street North in Chesterfield an address in Stocksbridge Four men were arrested - all at their home addresses. one in Chesterfield two in Burngreave one in Meersbrook At 21:30 GMT, police said searches had been stood down for the evening but would resume at the scenes in Burngreave and Chesterfield in the morning. A neighbour in Shirebrook Road, Sheffield, reported hearing ""an enormous bang"" as one of the raids took place at 05:30. Carol Perry, who lives two doors from the scene, said: ""I was asleep and then I was woken suddenly... and the house shook. ""My immediate thought was that it was an earthquake."" A large police presence could be seen outside the Fatima community centre in Sheffield A spokeswoman from Counter Terrorism Policing North East said: ""The public may have heard a loud bang at the time as police entered one of the properties, but it was not an explosion. ""[We] would like to reassure them that it was part of the method to gain entry to the property."" Retired Joan Miller, 63, who lives opposite the run-down house, said she looked out of her window to see many plain-clothed armed officers in the street. Ms Miller said: ""[There] was very loud bang. It shook the house. ""I pulled the curtains and saw lots of armed men in the street, so I kept watching because that was quite extraordinary."" Police and Army activity is continuing in Chesterfield She said the officers shouted ""very abruptly"" for people to stay in their homes. Elizabeth Fogarty, who lives across the road from the house in Meersbrook, said: ""I've only recently moved up from London. ""One of the reasons we moved up north to Sheffield is because we felt quite nervous living in London with all the terrorist attacks taking place."" There are two types of terrorism raids in the UK.  Many occur very quietly as detectives knock on the door and take the suspect into custody under normal police powers. Then there are the full-on raids where doors or windows have to be knocked in, cordons set up and the bomb squad called. Such operations are only ever mounted because secret intelligence - perhaps from an intercepted communication and often only fragmentary - suggests there is something at a property they need to get to the bottom of. None of which is proof that any of those who have been arrested have committed an offence - but officers now have up to 14 days, subject to court oversight, to build a case. One of their priorities is likely to be forensically examining phones. All recent major terrorism investigations have turned on not just what officers found during searches, but what they uncovered from online lives. Supt Una Jennings of South Yorkshire Police said: ""I understand our local communities will have concerns about this morning's police activity but I want to offer my reassurance that we will continue to serve and protect the public of South Yorkshire."" Derbyshire's Assistant Chief Constable Bill McWilliam said: ""We of course understand that police activity of this nature can be unsettling.

Grenfell children give Christmas message,"The children all lived in Grenfell Tower Five children who survived the Grenfell Tower fire will deliver this year's alternative Christmas message. The message, broadcast on Channel 4 on Christmas Day, will urge people to ""love and cherish"" their families. The children, aged between seven and 12, will also speak about the importance of having a home and their experiences on the night of the fire. Children who survived the tragedy also took part in a service at St Paul's to mark six months since the fire. Last year,the alternative Christmas message was given by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was murdered during the EU referendum campaign. In this year's message, 10-year-old Hayam Atmani, who lived on the 15th floor of the tower, will say: ""My message for everyone at Christmas is to stay as a family, and don't suffer about anything. ""I know this has been a really hard time for everyone, but everyone went through and everyone helped as a family. So I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year."" She will describe the family's life in a hotel, where she will also spend her birthday on 27 December, as ""not that much fun"". Grenfell memorial- Key moments - BBC News The 21st floor - BBC News School in the shadow of disaster Sisters Megan and Luana Gomes, 10 and 12, who were both put into induced comas after the fire, to be treated for smoke inhalation, will also take part in the broadcast. Having spent five months in a hotel before moving into a temporary flat, they will both speak of the importance of having a home. Megan will say: ""My Christmas message is that I think all families, children and parents should have a nice warm cosy home. ""I just want everyone in the world to have a house at least."" Luana will add: ""My Christmas message is that everybody should love and respect each other because you never know what tomorrow will be like.  And it is important to love and cherish your family."" The children will also recount their memories of the night of the fire. Brothers Amiel and Danel Miller, 10 and seven, who lived on the 17th floor, will describe hearing screaming and their mother telling them to get their clothes on and run down the stairs. Danel will say: ""We got outside and then we saw stuff falling down from the tower and grass on fire."" But the children will also talk of happier things, including memories of their former homes and their favourite aspects of Christmas. Hayam will describe how her friends admired her former home.  ""Everyone came. They were just saying, 'Oh that's so cool! I wish I lived here.' You could see the whole area; parks and stuff,"" she will say. Megan will describe how her family always got a real Christmas tree to gather around. And Danel will bring a smile to viewers' faces, telling them that his Christmas message is to ""share food!"". Previous alternative Christmas messengers have included whistle-blower Edward Snowden and the parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence. Channel 4 has broadcast the series since 1993.

Baby likely to die at birth 'to be donor'Hayley Martin's unborn daughter has no kidneys as a result of a fatal rare genetic disease.8h8 hours agoHumberside,"The couple will donate their unborn daughter's heart valves A mother who has been told her unborn baby girl will not survive at birth is carrying her to full term so she can donate heart tissue to help others. Hayley Martin was told at her 20-week scan that her child has a rare genetic disorder meaning she will die during labour or within minutes of being born. Speaking on ITV's This Morning show, Mrs Martin, 30, said they would be able to donate her daughter's heart valves. Explaining her decision, she added: ""I wouldn't have it any other way."" More stories from across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire Already a mother-of-three, Mrs Martin and her husband Scott, from Hull, discovered their baby had bilateral renal agenesis at the five-month scan. Mrs Martin said she had a feeling early on in the pregnancy and that things were not right The condition is fatal and means the baby has no kidneys and is not surrounded by enough amniotic fluid, causing malformed lungs. After speaking to specialist doctors, the couple were given the weekend to consider terminating the pregnancy but Mrs Martin told This Morning her reaction was ""automatically, I don't want to let her go just yet"". The couple said they had taken the decision to give birth to their daughter, who they have already named Ava-Joy, to help others in need of a transplant. It is likely that their baby's heart valves will be used to help other seriously-ill children. ""With the heart valves they can store them up to ten years,"" Mrs Martin told the show. ""Anything is better than nothing. I know she can't donate proper organs but tissue is just as valuable."" Angie Scales, a NHS organ donation and transplantation nurse, said around 10 to 15 families a year ask about the possibility of donation in relation to their unborn child. She said: ""However, proceeding to actual donation in these cases is extremely rare due to the complexities of the processes that are required."" Three people a day, including children, die waiting for a transplant, she added. The couple said their other children would grow up knowing about their younger sister The couple said the support they had received through a specialist charity in Leeds had helped them bond with their unborn daughter. The charity funded a blood test to enable them to find out the sex of the baby so they were able to give her a name and buy clothes to dress her once she is born. The Martins said they were starting a charity project in Ava-Joy's memory to help other families who decided to carry to term, despite a fatal diagnosis. ""It was not an easy decision but it was the right decision and it has helped me cope with the heartbreak,"" said Mrs Martin. ""A part of her will live on, she won't be completely gone. She will be alive in somebody else.""
