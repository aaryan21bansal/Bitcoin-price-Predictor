Inquiry says Clutha crash pilot 'took a chance',"This video can not be played New footage from the Crown Office shows the aftermath of the helicopter crash An inquiry into the Clutha helicopter crash has found that the pilot ""took a chance"" and ignored low fuel warnings. Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull said the tragedy happened because Captain David Traill had ignored the five warnings he received during the flight. He said that was a ""conscious decision"" which had ""fatal consequences"" for the 10 people who died. The police helicopter crashed into the roof of the busy Glasgow bar at 22:22 on 29 November 2013. The tragedy claimed the lives of the pilot, his two crew members and seven customers in the pub. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker Those who died were Capt Traill, 51;  PC Tony Collins, 43; PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, and customers Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. Another 31 people were injured. Mr O'Prey's father Ian said he was ""really angry"" at the inquiry's findings and that Capt Traill had been made ""a fall guy"". The Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the report and how ""brutal"" it had been towards Capt Traill. He said questions remained over the reasons why the pilot had ignored the low fuel warnings. What we know about the minutes before the tragedy Clutha crash inquiry: The key questions During the fatal accident inquiry, Sheriff Turnbull heard testimony from families, experts and eyewitnesses. In his findings,external, he said there was ""no doubt"" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines ""flamed out"" due to a lack of fuel. The fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on. ""The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?"" said Sheriff Turnbull. ""The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received."" This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded He said the accident would not have happened if the pilot had followed the normal procedure for dealing with low fuel warnings. The Pilot's Checklist stipulated that he should land the aircraft within 10 minutes of a fuel warning. The sheriff described Capt Traill's failure to follow that procedure as ""inexplicable"". He said: ""Capt Traill took a chance that the low fuel warnings he received were erroneous. ""That was a conscious decision on his part. It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people."" Sheriff Turnbull also said that the Eurocopter EC135, manufactured by Airbus, should have had a visible and audible warning which would activate when both fuel transfer pumps had been switched off. The pumps, which were both switched off during the flight, supplied fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines. Sheriff Turnbull said: ""The circumstances of the accident are so unusual that it is improbable they will be repeated, even without the introduction of the safety actions taken since the accident."" He added that the tragedy ""changed forever the lives of many people"" and praised the dignity of those who attended the 32-day inquiry. More than 100 people were inside the bar at the time of the crash Sheriff Turnbull noted it was ""surprising"" that it took two years fromthe 2015 publication of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report on the crashto confirm that there would be no criminal proceedings. He added: ""It took far too long to lodge a notice of inquiry in this case."" Sheriff Turnbull also said the Crown Office's Helicopter Incidents Investigation Team were ""not sufficiently resourced"" to enable the FAI to start sooner. He added that an FAI into the deaths caused by theSumburgh helicopter crashin August 2013 was still to be held. A Crown Office spokesperson said: ""This was an exceptionally complex and challenging investigation and the Crown acknowledges that the time taken from the tragedy occurring to convening the inquiry was longer than desirable, and that this compounded the distress suffered by bereaved relatives."" The spokesperson said additional funding had been made available to recruit additional staff, and that improvements were being made. A spokesman for the aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus Helicopters, said it was ""deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life"". ""We took immediate action to understand the root cause and we have taken note of the findings of both the AAIB and FAI,"" he said. ""The safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters."" 29 November 2013: A police helicopter crashes onto the Clutha bar in Glasgow,killing 10 people 9 December 2013:AAIB preliminary reportfinds no evidence of a ""major"" engine or gearbox failure, and says there was 95 litres of fuel on board the aircraft 14 February 2014: An AAIB special report findsboth engines ""flamed out""but does not pinpoint the cause 23 October 2015: The AAIB's final report finds the main cause of accident to bemismanagement of the fuel system by the pilot 24 November 2017:Fatal accident inquiry announced 8 April 2019:Fatal accident inquiry beginsat Hampden Stadium in Glasgow Clutha: How the events unfolded.

"Resign now, Grenfell survivors tell fire chief","This video can not be played Grenfell families: 'There was a serious lack of common sense' Survivors and bereaved relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire have called for London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton to resign - after ahighly critical report,externalfrom the inquiry into the blaze. The report said some of the 72 people who were killed could have been saved if the building was evacuated sooner. The Grenfell United group said it was ""heartbreaking"" to read, and some relatives want senior staff prosecuted. The LFB said it was ""disappointed"" by some of the criticism of individuals. The inquiry, which examined what happened on the night of 14 June 2017, concluded that ""many more lives"" could have been saved if the advice to residents to ""stay put"" had been abandoned earlier than 02:35 BST. It said London Fire Brigade's preparations for such a fire were ""gravely inadequate"". Survivors called for senior fire brigade staff to be sacked and prosecuted, saying that the brigade is ""in the hands of people that are incapable of their jobs"". Grenfell: Seven key points from the report What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Nazanin Aghlani, who lost two family members in the fire, said: ""If a fire happened tonight the same thing would happen again."" The brigade's commissioner Dany Cotton, who is due to retire in April 2020, expressed her ""deepest sorrow"" that firefighters had not been able to save those who died, but said the inquiry had no expert evidence to support its conclusion about evacuating the tower. This video can not be played LFB chief Dany Cotton: ""We are truly sorry we couldn't save everyone's life that night"" It would not have been possible or safe to evacuate residents through a ""narrow, smoke-clogged stairwell"" with the number of firefighters who would have been available for that task said Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. The report also concluded that cladding surrounding the tower did not comply with building regulations and was the main reason for the fire's ""shocking"" spread. Campaign group Grenfell United said the report showed ""the immediate and real dangers"" of ""highly combustible cladding and insulation"". ""Lives are at risk and the government need to treat this as a national emergency,"" the group said. The inquiry made 46 recommendations, including improvements in training for fire brigade staff and the development of national guidelines for evacuating high-rise buildings. Grenfell United called for the recommendations to be implemented in full, saying they would save lives. The report condemned the brigade for""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failuresin its response to the fire. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a ""major omission"" by the brigade and more lives could have been saved had the ""stay-put"" policy been abandoned sooner. Grenfell United responded: ""It is heartbreaking to read that more of our loved ones could have been saved that night if the building was evacuated earlier."" This video can not be played âFire chief should step down today,' relatives of those that died in the fire say At an emotional news conference, relatives of 20 victims of the fire called for an overhaul of the brigade, saying its leadership should resign and face prosecution. Sid-Ali Atmani, who escaped from the 15th floor, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Those in command had [the] opportunity to save everyone in that tower - we're talking about two hours."" Karim Mussilhy, vice-chairman of Grenfell United, told the BBC he blamed the fire brigade leadership, not the firefighters. ""Dany Cotton needs to step down today,"" he said. ""She should not have the luxury to retire early with this Â£2m pot."" But Moyra Samuels of the Justice4Grenfell group said the firefighters were being scapegoated. ""It wasn't the firefighters who put the cladding on the building. The firefighters went into a building that was a deathtrap,"" she said. The report said evidence from Ms Cotton that she would not have changed anything about the brigade's response was ""insensitive"". Ms Cotton said many of the recommendations were welcome and would be ""carefully considered"". She expressed her ""deepest sorrow at not being able to save all those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire"". White doves were released at a memorial service earlier this year to mark two years since the tragedy She added: ""We welcome the chairman's recognition of the courage, commitment and bravery of firefighters on the night, but we are disappointed at some of the criticism of individual staff members who were placed in completely unprecedented circumstances and faced the most unimaginable conditions while trying to save the lives of others."" However, Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United who was rescued with her six-year-old daughter from the 11th floor, said Dany Cotton's statement was ""too little too late"". ""She stood up in the inquiry, in a room full of bereaved and survivors and said there's nothing she would do to change that night,"" she told the BBC. ""If she'd expressed that sorrow that day in that room, that potentially would have washed with us today."" Grenfell United expressed concern at the report's finding that the LFB were ""at risk of not learning the lessons from Grenfell"", adding that firefighters were ""let down by their training, procedures, equipment and leadership"". Other issues highlighted in the report included: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" In the House of Commons, MPs held a minutes' silence to remember victims of the fire, before a debate on the inquiry. This video can not be played ""No words... will ever make good the loss suffered"" - Johnson, May and Corbyn responded to the report Boris Johnson told MPs that survivors and the bereaved had been ""overlooked and ignored"" before the fire and ""shamefully failed"" afterwards. He said the government planned to name companies who were failing to replace unsafe cladding on their buildings, adding: ""Too many building owners have not acted responsibly."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response had been ""too slow and not strong enough on every front"", from rehousing the survivors to replacing Grenfell-style cladding. Eight out of 10 buildings residential blocks have still not had their cladding replaced, he said. The second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. This video can not be played What do survivors and bereaved families want from the inquiry? While this was not the focus of the first phase, the report found there was ""compelling evidence"" external walls of the building failed to comply with building regulations and ""actively promoted"" the spread of fire. It said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a ""source of fuel"". Grenfell United said the second phase of the inquiry ""must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment [of the building] lies"", with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and the companies involved facing ""serious questions"".

Glasgow Lord Provost to resign after expenses row,"Ms Bolander faced criticism for her expense claims, including for 23 pairs of shoes The Lord Provost of Glasgow, Eva Bolander, has said it is in the city's ""best interests"" for her to resign after acontroversy over her expenses. Ms Bolander faced criticism after claiming Â£8,000 worth of items, including 23 pairs of shoes. In a speech delivered to the City Chambers, Ms Bolander said that while her spending was ""within the rules"", she ""apologised unreservedly"". She said her resignation would be effective immediately. Ms Bolander had faced calls for her resignation after details of the expenses emerged earlier this month. Civic leader claimed 23 pairs of shoes on expenses She told councillors on Thursday: ""I am grateful for having been given the opportunity to represent Glasgow and all its communities and people. ""But it is with the city's best interest at heart that I am resigning with effect from after this statement."" The council said the provost was required to represent the city at hundreds of events each year Ms Bolander thanked civic staff and colleagues who had ""always done their utmost to ensure that I could perform my duties."" She added: ""Glasgow is a fantastic city, a city emerging on a global scale and I am proud to have played a small part in that. ""I will continue to represent my constituents for the best for them and to work for the best for Glasgow and for the best for Scotland."" The first minister thanked Ms Bolander ""for her service"" as provost and as an SNP councillor. Nicola Sturgeon tweeted,external: ""Eva Bolander was brave enough to recognise mistakes - but the fact is she was a good Lord Provost who served Glasgow with grace and dignity. ""As a resident and representative of the city, I thank her for her service."" When details of her expense claims first emerged, Ms Bolanderpreviously apologised and committed to repay some of the money. Herexpenses were obtained by the Daily Record under a Freedom of Information request,external. The claims were made between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reported Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from company Sole Bliss, which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, about Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earned Â£39,310 as provost- had her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. The council previously issued a statement which recognised that the Lord Provost was required ""to represent their city at hundreds of events"", which often incurred extra expenses. It explained that for this reason, each council was allocated a civic allowance by the Scottish government. The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile.

"Will Bayley leaves Strictly after leg injuryThe Paralympian says he is ""gutted my Strictly journey has come to an end"" after six weeks on the show.Entertainment & Arts","Will Bayley has left Strictly Come Dancing after sustaining a leg injury, the BBC has confirmed. The Paralympian landed awkwardly after jumping from a raised platform in studio rehearsals, causing him to miss last Saturday's show. ""I'm gutted my Strictly journey has had to come to an end. I've loved being part of the show,"" he said. Bayley, a gold medal-winning table tennis player, had been partnered with Strictly professional Janette Manrara. He is the second contestant to pull out this year due to injury.Jamie Laing had to withdraw before the series launchedafter injuring his foot, and was replaced by Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher. Bayley said: ""I want to say a special thank you to Janette for believing in me, and giving me the confidence to believe in myself. ""The things we achieved, from our couple's choice dance, through to the lifts in our salsa, will stay with me forever.  I've had the time of my life."" Bayley and Manrara had been in the competition for six weeks. Their best score from the judgescame in week five,external, when they received 32 points for their contemporary dance to Lukas Graham's 7 Years. The show's executive producer, Sarah James said: ""We are so sad that Will is unable to continue on the show. He will be greatly missed and we wish him a speedy recovery."" Manrara said: ""Absolutely devastated that Will and I will not be able to continue dancing. We made some incredible memories that I will never forget, and I am pleased to have shared them with such an inspirational person who I can now call a friend for life."" Strictly Come Dancing has not yet made any announcement on any changes that will be made to this year's competition as a result of the mid-series withdrawal. With nine couples left in the competition, a single vote-off each week would leave three pairs competing for the glitterball trophy on 14 December. The number of finalists has varied between three and four in recent years. Withdrawals from Strictly have been very rare over its 17 series to date, with just a handful leaving the ballroom bonanza without being voted off: Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck left the show during the programme's fourth series after being diagnosed with high blood pressure. ""I'm absolutely devastated,"" he said at the time. The following year, model and actress Kelly Brook withdrew in order to spend more time with her family after the death of her father, Kenneth. One year later, political journalist John Sergeant's simple steps won over many viewers but he decided to quit after fearing he might actually win the competition. ""That would be a joke too far,"" he said. Olympic athlete Jade Johnson said she was ""absolutely gutted"" after an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal forced her to withdraw during series seven. And singer Will Young left the show for ""personal reasons"" during series 14. He later told the Times Magazine it was ""for my own wellbeing"".

Police fear missing backpacker drowned,"Amelia Bambridge was last seen on the island of Koh Rong on 23 October Cambodian police have said they fear missing British backpacker Amelia Bambridge has drowned. Amelia Bambridge, from Worthing in West Sussex, was last seen on the island of Koh Rong a week ago. Members of Ms Bambridge's family have travelled to the island to join in the search for the 21-year-old. Major General Chuon Narin, police chief for Preah Sihanouk province, said searches would continue until she is found. Ms Bambridge was reported missing after she failed to check out of her hotel on time. Staff at Police Beach, a private venue on the island, found her purple rucksack with her purse, phone and bank cards inside the following morning.

Husband jailed for pregnant wife's murder,"Andrew Griggs was sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court A man who murdered his pregnant wife and disposed of her body in 1999 has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. The body of Debbie Griggs, who disappeared without trace from the family home in Deal, Kent, on 5 May 1999, has never been found. Sentencing Andrew Griggs at Canterbury Crown Court, His Honour Justice Robin Spencer said it was likely the keen sailor had ""dumped her body at sea"". Griggs, 57, of St Leonards in Dorset, was convicted on Monday. Jurors rejected his claims that his wife, then aged 34, had walked out on him and their three young sons. ""Only you know how you killed her and where you disposed of her body,"" Justice Spencer told Griggs. He said Griggs knew the coast ""like the back of his hand,"" adding: ""It would not have been difficult to weigh her body down so that it sank without trace."" Debbie Griggs was devoted to her three sons, the jury heard Justice Spencer said Mrs Griggs was ""an adored and adoring mother of three little boys,"" adding: ""They were her life, she would never have left them."" He told Griggs by murdering his wife, who was four and half months pregnant, he had also ""killed her unborn child"". Mrs Griggs's mother died of a ""broken heart"" in January just weeks before Griggs was charged, her father told the court. ""I know she longed to know where Debbie was,"" Brian Cameron said. The wife killer who escaped justice for 20 years Murder accused 'dumped wife's body at sea' Teenage girl 'groomed' by murder suspect The court heard Mrs Griggs believed her husband was having a ""sexual relationship"" with a 15-year-old girl and would have been entitled to half of the family's fishmonger business if they divorced. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said: ""The murder was committed to avoid the consequences, both in terms of the financial impact that divorce would otherwise have had, but also in the context of the illegal relationship that the defendant was engaged in at the time."" He told jurors Griggs had attacked his wife at their home in Cross Road ""at a time where the children were asleep upstairs"". Her car was found 1.3 miles away on 12 May with a smear of her blood discovered in the boot. The boot lining of Mrs Griggs's car had been removed, police found The length of time Griggs maintained his lie and concealed the location of his wife's body were aggravating factors, the judge said. ""You robbed the mother of her children and her family of the very thing you have enjoyed over those 20 years,"" he said. Griggs had been a prime suspect ever since police abandoned a missing persons inquiry and launched a murder investigation in late-May 1999. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) looked at the evidence in 2003 and decided there was ""no realistic prospect of conviction"". But in 2018, cold case detectives reviewed the evidence against him and early this year the CPS authorised a murder charge. Asked what had changed, prosecutors said while there was no new evidence the passage of time helped disprove the idea that Mrs Griggs was still alive or had taken her own life.

Five new things about online campaigning,"Pro-Jeremy Corbyn Facebook posts got huge traffic in 2017. How might things be different in the upcoming European elections? What has changed online since the UK's last nationwide election? Labour did surprisingly well in the 2017 general election, and social mediaprobably played a role- or at least indicated something amiss in pre-election polls. Pro-Jeremy Corbyn messages went viral online - particularly on Facebook - and were seen and shared by far more people than Conservative ones. Later this month the UK will hold European Parliament elections. What should we be looking out for online - and what has changed in the last two years? Who spent what on Facebook at 2017 election? Election 2017: Was it Facebook wot swung it? Facebook becomes key tool in parties' political message In the last general election, the Conservatives lost the Facebook war In 2017 the Conservatives spent more than on Facebook advertising than Labour. Butlists of most-shared stories,externalon the most popular social network were dominated by posts sympathetic to Labour and hostile to Theresa May's party. Instead of Labour relying on paid advertisements to push their messages, supporters were sharing them for free. However, in the upcoming European Parliament elections, it might be harder for posts in support of Labour - or any other party - to spread quite so far or fast. That's because at the start of 2018, Facebook announced a change to its algorithm, the code that decides what posts are given priority in your News Feed. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg chose to prioritise ""posts from your friends and family"" and make posts from ""businesses, brands and media"" less prominent. It changed the media landscape overnight, with many publishers, particularly video sites,struggling to retain traffic. In the political world, the algorithm changeparticularly affected,externalpro-Labour sites like Novara Media, the Canary and Skwawkbox. During the 2017 campaign some posts got tens of thousands of shares on Facebook but given the algorithm changes - along with the usual ebb in political engagement outside of general elections - it's highly unlikely that these numbers will be reached in 2019. Mark Zuckerberg's company has faced increased scrutiny For years the focal point of Facebook has been the News Feed, but this has recently been thesource of scandals, with misinformation or ""fake news"" going viral on the platform. The company has also faced a criticism over revelations aboutCambridge Analytica. Facebook recently announced a strategic change of direction to address these concerns. On 6 March chief executive Mark Zuckerberg announced that ""privacy-focused communications"" would become more important than ""open social networks"" in the future. Facebook boss reveals changes to apps What's in Mark Zuckerberg's privacy plan? The growing threat to Mark Zuckerberg's power The new plans include adding end-to-end encryption to all messaging services, ""reducing the permanence"" of content posted on Facebook, and merging elements of Facebook Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. More broadly, there are indications that political conversations in the UK increasingly take place within closed groups on Facebook and WhatsApp, where people can discuss issues with like-minded people in a semi-private format. However this comes with risks - closed groups can become incubators for offensive content, such asIslamophobia in pro-Conservative groups, andanti-Semitism in pro-Labour ones,external. During recent election campaigns inBrazilandIndia, misinformation spread rapidly in WhatsApp groups. And in closed groups it is much harder for regulators, researchers and journalists to observe what is going on. In one key way, Facebook has moved to increase transparency, through its political advertising archive. The aim is to shed light on so-called ""dark ads"" - messages targeted at particular groups, but which are all but invisible to people outside of the target audience. For instance, during the 2016 EU referendum, the official Vote Leave campaign spent more than Â£2.7mon targeted adson Facebook. The ads were viewed more than 169 million times - Facebook eventually released them to the general public, two years later. ""Dark ads"" were also a key feature of the 2017 election campaign, with Labour, Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and other parties targeting groups of voters. A number of organisations and media outlets - including the BBC - urged voters to send in examples of political advertising they were seeing in their feeds. This video can not be played VIDEO: How online advertising affects political campaigns The new ad archive, launched last year, makes that job easier. New rules mean people posting political ads must prove their identity and location. And it's now possible to browse the database of political ads and view a demographic breakdown of people who have seen a particular advert. We still do not know much about ads posted on other social media sites, although Google hasintroduced an ad archive,externalfor the upcoming elections. Last yeara BBC investigation revealed the government and the pro-Brexit group Britain's Future were both buying up Google adsto secure the top spot when people search for the phrase ""What is the Brexit deal?"" Examples of Brexit ads - both for and against - on Facebook Thanks to Facebook's archive, we know for example that pro-EU campaign groups have spent more money on Facebook advertising than pro-Brexit ones since last October. But while the ad archive identifies the person or group behind the ad, it doesn't mean that we know exactly where their money is coming from. Andresearchers have criticised,externalthe system for providing no information on who the advertisersmeantto target - rather than who was reached - and for not being completely comprehensive. So while we know more about online political ads than we did in 2017, there is still plenty we don't know. Aside from the world of politics, Facebook, Twitter and Google have been accused of neglecting user privacy and providing platforms for misinformation, hate speech and other damaging content. One case in particular has become a rallying point for critics of the big social media giants. After British teenager Molly Russell took her own life in 2017, her family looked at her Instagram account and found distressing material about depression and suicide. This video can not be played Molly Russell's father said that Instagram is partly to blame for his daughter's death In April the governmentreleased proposalsfor websites to be fined over ""online harms"". The proposals are also aimed at curbing terrorist content, child sex abuse and the sale of illegal goods. Labour has said the plan doesn't go far enough, while in the US presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has gone as far as saying the big social media giants should be broken up. The 2019 European Parliament elections will out against a very different public mood compared to the very recent past. Fierce criticism of Facebook and Google has now gone mainstream. Mark Meechan makes YouTube videos under the name 'Count Dankula' Celebrity politicians are nothing new. As you may have heard, in 2016 a TV star got elected president of the United States, while more recently,another became president of Ukraine. But what is new in this year's European Parliament elections is that internet celebrities are running for office. Two of UKIP's candidates gained fame through their controversial YouTube channels - Carl Benjamin, aka ""Sargon of Akkad"" and ""Count Dankula"", real name Mark Meechan. 2019 European elections: List of candidates Last year, Meechan was convicted of a hate crime and fined Â£800 after recording a pet dog giving Nazi salutes and posting it on YouTube. He was also the subject of a recentBBC Scotland investigationwhich found he was a prominent user of an online forum that contained racist language and threats against ethnic minorities. Last weekpolice said they were investigating a complaintagainst Benjamin, who in 2016 tweeted at Labour MP Jess Phillips: ""I wouldn't even rape you... feminism is cancer."" They may be the among the first YouTubers to run in a nationwide election, but it's safe to say they won't be the last.

Leaders in pre-election clash on NHS and economy,"This video can not be played Corbyn: ""NHS money is being siphoned off"" Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed over the NHS, Brexit and leadership at the last Prime Minister's Questions before the general election. The Labour leader said voters had a ""once in a generation"" chance to save the NHS, which was in ""greater danger"" than at any time in its history. But the PM warned of ""economic catastrophe"" if Labour got into power. Meanwhile, some senior MPs, including Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan, have said they will not be standing.

The House of Lords passed the early election bill - which wasapproved by MPs on Tuesday- in less than four hours, with no changes. In their final encounter in Parliament before the election, the two leaders exchanged barbs over their political values and disputed their parties' respective records on the NHS. The Labour leader accused the PM - who he has challenged to a one-on-one TV debate - of running down the health service, saying cuts to funding had contributed to rising waiting times for cancer treatment and operations. He said a Labour government would reverse what he said was the growing privatisation of the NHS, saying it existed to ""make people better, not make the wealthy few richer"".

""People have the choice to vote for real change after years of Conservative and Lib Dem cuts, privatisation and tax handouts for the richest."" Mr Johnson said he agreed voters faced a ""stark choice"" between a government spending ""unrivalled"" sums on the NHS and a Labour party that would ""wreck the economy"".

The Lib Dems say they will fight their most ambitious election campaign ever Speaking outside Parliament, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said her party was ""on the up"" and had a larger war chest at its disposal than ever before going into an election. ""Make no mistake, I stand ready to take on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate to be prime minister,"" she said. Twitter bans all political advertising ""We have a bold vision to stop Brexit and build a better, brighter future for the country."" For the Scottish National Party, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said an election was anopportunity for the country to hold another independence referendum. ""A win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland's right to choose our own future,"" she said. But the Scottish Conservatives claimed voting for their party would keep Scotland in the UK. Meanwhile, an attempt by Boris Johnson to unite his party by re-admitting 10 Tory Brexit rebels has been hit bya row over the party's refusal to give the whip backto Amber Rudd - the former home secretary who has said she is standing down as an MP. The smaller parties are already talking about striking deals with each other, which could see candidates standing aside in areas where their Remain-supporting rivals have a better chance of winning. Ms Swinson said there were a ""small number of seats"" where ""arrangements"" could be struck with other parties to give an anti-Brexit candidate the best chance of winning. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley told BBC Breakfast it was ""no secret"" that the Greens were ""talking to the Lib Dems and Plaid"" but ""nothing has been finalised"". This video can not be played It's been will they or won't they for weeks, so how did they reach an agreement?

Plaid leader Adam Price said his party was ""open to working with others to secure our European future"". Details of which candidates are standing and where will be published at 17:00 GMT on 14 November - as will information about the location of polling stations. The party leaders are also facing questions about whether they would form a coalition, if the election resulted in another hung Parliament. Asked if she would join forces with Labour or the Conservatives, Jo Swinson said: ""I can't be clearer - neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is fit to be prime minister.""

Twitter to ban all political advertising,"Jack Dorsey said details would follow in November Twitter is to ban all political advertising worldwide, saying that the reach of such messages ""should be earned, not bought"". ""While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics,"" company CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted. Social media rivalFacebook recently ruled out a ban on political ads. News of the ban divided America's political camps for the 2020 election. Brad Parscale, manager of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, said the ban was ""yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives"". But Bill Russo, spokesman for the campaign to elect Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, said: ""When faced with a choice between ad dollars and the integrity of our democracy,it is encouraging that, for once, revenue did not win out,external."" Reacting to the move, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg defended his company's policy. ""In a democracy, I don't think it's right for private companies to censor politicians or the news,"" he said during a conference call with journalists. Twitter's ban will be enforced from 22 November, with full details released by 15 November. Mr Dorsey explained his position in a thread of tweets. Allow Twitter content?

Internet political ads, he said, presented ""entirely new challenges to civic discourse"". These challenges included ""machine learning-based optimisation of messaging"", ""micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes"". ""It's not credible,"" he wrote, ""for us to say: 'We're working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, but if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political adâ¦well...they can say whatever they want!'"" Countering the argument that the new policy might be seen as favouring leaders already in office, he pointed out that ""many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising"". Ads in support of voter registration would not be affected by the ban, he added. Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic candidate who lost to Mr Trump in the 2016 presidential election, welcomed Twitter's ban and appeared to challenge Facebook to rethink its stance.

Jack Dorsey's decision is more significant for its timing and the principle it upholds than the practical effects it will have on modern democracy. Political ads on Twitter are just a fraction, in scale and impact, of those on Facebook. Mr Dorsey knew - and his chief financial officer has since confirmed - that this decision would have little impact on the company's bottom line. They therefore calculated that they could win a thumbs up from regulators and public opinion at little cost to the business. And they could also mischievously provoke Facebook, who are in a more difficult position on the subject. It cannot be mere coincidence that Mr Dorsey's tweet was just a fortnight after Mark Zuckerberg's speech on the same subject. A dividing line between the companies is useful for Twitter. It puts the onus on Facebook to once again defend its stance. It is very easy to find damaging or deceitful ads online. But asking Californian companies to decide what should or shouldn't be in the public domain grants them enormous power that is hard to undo. They already make such decisions on things like violent or hateful content; asking them to go further is, in effect, turning them into editorial arbiters of public conversation. That is, journalists. Earlier this month, Mr Zuckerberg went before an audience of students in Washington DC to defend the firm's decision not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods. He had considered barring all political ads on his platforms, but said he believed the move would favour incumbent politicians and whoever the media chose to cover. The company should ""err on the side of greater expression"", he argued. Zuckerberg gave his speech to an audience of students and others at Georgetown University in Washington DC Another spokesman for Mr Biden had criticised the firm for refusing to remove a video posted by Mr Trump's 2020 re-election campaign which promoted an unproven conspiracy theory involving the former vice-president and his son. ""It is unacceptable for any social media company to knowingly allow deliberately misleading material to corrupt its platform,""TJ Ducklo said,external. Fellow Democratic candidateSenator Elizabeth Warren then paid to run an intentionally misleading advert,externalon Facebook that claimed Mr Zuckerberg had personally endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. She said she had done so to protest against the firm's decision to allow politicians to run ads containing ""known lies"". US federal campaigns are expected to spend about $6bn (Â£4.6bn) on advertising,externalbut most of it will go on TV ads, with about 20% put into digital ads, advertising research firm Kantar estimates.

The first 24 hours of UK social media election ads,"It has been less than 24 hours since the election was signed off by MPs, and the Lords hasn't even agreed to the 12 December poll yet. But that hasn't stopped the party machines springing into action to sell their wares to voters. Gone are the days when the only sight you would get of your prospective candidates was a grainy party election broadcast or out on the stump in your village hall. Those classics still play a part of course - albeit in high definition and with more hi-vis jackets - but the early focus goes to one of the kings of communication - Twitter. So what early ads have the the rivals gone with to get their message into web users' brains? Twitter to ban all political advertising Let's start with the Conservatives, and their tactic to put their leader front and centre of their social media campaign. Allow Twitter content?

Boris Johnson's face dominates the 35 second video, as he repeats his ""let's get Brexit done"" mantra and reels off planned investments in the NHS, infrastructure and the police from his party conference speech. His typically colourful use of language - broadband will be ""sprouting"" into homes, he hopes to ""ping off the guy ropes of self doubt"" - is likely to please his existing fan base. And if anyone likes the look of the PM, they will enjoy the split screen of three Boris Johnsons - albeit all in the same suit and tie - and the slightly odd shot of his hair blowing in the wind while staring out to sea as strings play in the background. The rest of the Conservatives' feed is dominated by pictures of their leader and, no formalities here, it is ""back Boris"" all the way. Labour is also flexing its social media muscles. The party already has two videos doing the rounds - a short, sharp campaign message and a longer watch to highlight policies. The 23 second version starts with a silhouette of their bearded poster boy Jeremy Corbyn on the campaign trail - though you never get a full face shot of their leader. Instead, messages are emblazoned in bold red blocks across the screen - ""radical"", ""hopeful"" and ""people's plan"" - with a final question - ""are you with us?"". Allow Twitter content?

The longer version keeps to type with its music - think US rapper rather than brass band here - and tells the story of the rise of Corbyn, ranging from a nervy turn as new leader to a stern performance at the TUC conference. Like the Conservatives, Labour's leader is front and centre of their campaign - perhaps only second to tearing down their major rival. The Scottish National Party go quick with their first advert. The viewer is treated to 10 seconds of the top of the PM's notorious hair and a soothing yet ominous voice asking whose hands you want your future in. Allow Twitter content?

But like Labour, they have a longer version too - and this time the music gives off epic prime time TV drama vibes rather than political advert. They stick to the classics - a conference speech from Nicola Sturgeon, a slow-mo walk to the stage, even a Robert Burns quote. And after multiple shots of a nodding and cheering crowd, their leader blows a final kiss to the audience. It seems north and south of the border, the leader is key in these early ad attempts. The Liberal Democrats are a little behind their competitors on Twitter without a full on video to tempt in the electorate. But for now, the party is pushing plenty of their top team's media appearances - albeit with aslightly smarter screengrabs,externalfor some thanothers,external. Leader Jo Swinson gets top billing, and is using her own Twitter profile to showcase her opinions on an election. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But be sure it won't be long until we get their 15 seconds of a hard-sell against a hard Brexit. Fellow Remain campaigners, the Green Party, have got their first video up and running. There is a slightly more 1990s vibe to the backing track than some of their rivals. However, the leader theme remains, with a simple shot of co-leader Jonathan Bartley walking slowly towards camera to push his message. Allow Twitter content?

We are not sure why the other co-leader Sian Berry missed out on the shoot, or where the ""studios"" are (bad lighting there guys). But like Labour, their focus is to recruit, recruit, recruit, with or without flashy graphics, and push their environmental and Brexit messages. The Brexit Party on the other hand goes with giving all of its rivals a good verbal kicking and leaving its leader in the stables. The new outfit are trying to secure their first seats in the Westminster Parliament using an enraged Ann Widdecombe, condemning the prime minister as ""the worst in history"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Corbyn doesn't miss out on the MEP's wrath, and is deemed ""the worst opposition leader in the entire history of the Labour Party"". And Parliament - don't feel left in the cold. You are the worst since Oliver Cromwell, she says, as the Speaker John Bercow gets booed. ""Change the whole lot of them,"" Ms Widdecombe cries to rapturous applause. On Wednesday, Twitter announced a ban from 22 November on all political advertising worldwide, saying that the reach of such messages ""should be earned, not bought"". By Joe Tidy, BBC digital election reporter Thanks to resources like the Facebook ad library, we can analyse in more detail than ever exactly what messages are being served to whom and at what cost. So far, only the Lib Dems have active adverts on Facebook or Instagram. The message of the Lib Dems being the ""biggest, strongest party of Remain"" is being targeted at 35 to 54-year-old men mainly in Wales. The parties are very much relying on their own supporters to launch their campaigns. Calls to arms are taking place on official and unofficial social media pages asking people to donate, volunteer or register to vote. The parties are therefore preaching to the converted and hyping up their own bases. Interestingly, many parties are asking donors to fill out questionnaires about their election priorities - no doubt this data will come in handy in the weeks ahead. In some cases, campaigns are doing well despite not spending on ads. Labour-backing Momentum started a campaign with a Facebook post and a tweet asking supporters to help raise Â£50,000 in 48 hours. It was shared almost 900 times on Twitter and Facebook, and its video viewed more than 200,000 times. The group says it's received Â£100,000 in less than 12 hours.

Corbyn in election pitch against 'corrupt system',"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Whose side are you on?"" Jeremy Corbyn vowed to ""transform"" Britain by taking on ""the few who run a corrupt system"" as he kicked off Labour's election campaign. The party leader promised to ""rebuild"" public services and hit out at ""tax dodgers, dodgy landlords, bad bosses and big polluters"". In a speech, Mr Corbyn called the 12 December poll a ""once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country"". But Prime Minister Boris Johnson blamed Mr Corbyn for the delay to Brexit. He said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the 31 October deadline had to be extended, but a Conservative election win would remove the ""logjam"". Both leaders, and those of other parties, are beginning six weeks of campaigning. Johnson and Corbyn: The odd couple? A really simple guide to the UK general election Corbyn challenges Johnson to election TV debate Your questions answered: Could snow delay the vote? In a speech at Battersea Arts Centre, south London, Mr Corbyn received loud cheers from supporters when he said Labour would launch ""the biggest people-powered campaign in history"". After Jeremy Corbyn mentioned the NHS, Labour supporters chanted: ""Not for sale."" Flanked by members of the shadow cabinet, he said: ""You know what really scares the elite? What they're actually afraid of is paying their taxes. So in this election they'll fight harder and dirtier than ever before. They'll throw everything at us because they know we're not afraid to take them on. ""So we're going after the tax dodgers. We're going after the dodgy landlords. We're going after the bad bosses. We're going after the big polluters. Because we know whose side we're on."" The December election was called for by the prime minister  and is taking place after Mr Corbyn agreed to it, following the EU's decision to delay Brexit. The Labour leader told the audience that, if elected prime minister, he would ""open negotiations with the EU about a sensible relationship with Europe"". This wasn't exactly a pitch for the centre ground by Jeremy Corbyn. His tone was uncompromising. It's designed in part - just like in 2017 - to enthuse younger voters and previous non-voters, convincing them that politics can make a difference. But he is also searching for a message that might appeal beyond Brexit - to potential Labour voters in both Leave and Remain areas. Labour launched its election campaign in the London seat of Battersea. It doggedly campaigned here in 2017, and won narrowly - it now leads the Conservatives by just 2,416 votes. It's a reminder that the party will have to work hard to defend seats - as well as targets held by its opponents. Read Iain's blog Mr Corbyn also said: ""The prime minister wants you to believe that we're having this election because Brexit is being blocked by an establishment elite. ""People aren't fooled so easily. They know the Conservatives are the establishment elite."" The lighter side of the (former) Brexit deadline Twitter to ban all political advertising Mr Corbyn also said the NHS was ""not for sale"" and that any future trade deal with the US should not involve giving American firms greater access to it. The audience, made up of Labour supporters, then repeatedly chanted: ""Not for sale."" This video can not be played Corbyn: ""Our NHS is not for sale"" Several times he asked the audience: ""Whose side are you on?"" They replied: ""Yours."" Mr Corbyn said the prime minister had thought he was being ""smart"" in calling for an election in December, and thought that Labour supporters ""won't go out to vote"". ""Even if the rivers freeze over, we're going out to bring about real change for the many, not the few,"" he added. This video can not be played Johnson: Tories can get UK out of EU by January The prime minister visited Addenbooke's Hospital, Cambridge, where he said: ""I'm incredibly frustrated that we haven't been able to get Brexit done today. We had a fantastic deal on the table."" He said he would deliver Brexit and ""bring the country together"", adding: ""If you vote for us, and we get our programme through - which we will, because it's oven-ready - then we can be out, at the very latest, by January next year."" Mr Johnson promised to ""stimulate the wealth-creating sector"" if the Conservatives win the election, saying the contest was not about ""background"" but a ""vision for the country"". This video can not be played Jo Swinson is asked about an election leaflet describing her as the next PM Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson has defended her decision to campaign as a ""candidate to be prime minister"", denying such an outcome is a ""fantasy"". She told the BBC the UK was in a ""very volatile political situation"" and anything could happen on 12 December. Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems could find ""arrangements"" with other parties in a ""small number of seats"" to give an anti-Brexit candidate the best chance of winning. It could see candidates standing aside in areas where their Remain-supporting rivals have a better chance of winning. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley has said it is ""no secret"" that the Greens have been ""talking to the Lib Dems and Plaid [Cymru]"", but ""nothing has been finalised"". As other smaller parties geared up for their election campaigns,the Daily Telegraph reported,externalthat the Brexit Party was considering helping the Tories to secure a majority by withdrawing hundreds of its general election candidates.

Fed cuts rates again amid trade and growth fears,"The Fed is trying to interpret mixed economic signals The US central bank has cut interest rates again, hoping to shield the economy from the impact of trade wars and a global slowdown. The Federal Reserve lowered the target for its benchmark rate by a quarter point, to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%. The move was the third cut in four months. The decision comes asUS economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 1.9%in the most recent quarter. Fed Chair Jerome Powell implied the bank would hold off on further cuts. ""We feel that policy is well-positioned,"" he saidÂ at a press conference in Washington at the end of the Fed's two-day meeting. Since the last meeting, he said risks to the economy have subsided, pointing to the possibility of a limited ""phase one"" US-China trade pact and reduced odds of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Powell suggested he does not expect the bank to change rates again unless economic conditions worsen unexpectedly. ""We see the current stance of policy as likely to remain appropriate,"" he said. Wednesday's cut was expected. Eight policymakers voted in favour of reducing the rate, while two opposed the action, preferring to hold the rate steady. The divide reflects mixed economic signals. While growth has slowed, it has held up better than expected, decelerating only slightly from the 2% rate seen in the three months to 30 June. The expansion has been bolstered by spending by consumers, who are enjoying some of the lowest unemployment rates in almost 50 years. However, manufacturing and business investment continues to fall, as firms grapple with uncertainty generated by the US-China tariff war and other trade disputes. US economic growth slowest this year Why the Fed's interest rate move matters US shares recover as Trump renews Federal Reserve attack Global economic growth has slowed and inflation also remains lower than the Fed would like, moderating fears that further rate cuts will trigger a damaging acceleration in prices. As growth has softened, US President Donald Trump has sought to pin responsibility on the Fed. He has repeatedly called on the bank to cut rates more aggressively, pointing to lower borrowing costs in other countries. Mr Powell said the cuts to date have already helped certain sectors sensitive to borrowing costs, such as housing.  The full effects will be felt over time, he added. Dr. Kerstin Braun, president of Stenn Group, an international provider of cross-border trade finance, said looking to the Fed to solve the issues in the economy won't work. ""The US needs to end uncertainties about global trade while also implementing fiscal policies that foster investment in infrastructure and innovation,"" she said. With the cuts, the Fed is ""squandering"" its power despite lack of a real crisis, she added. ""The stock market is peaking, consumers are still spending, and the tariff war could be resolved,"" she said. ""This isn't the normal context for lowering interest rates.""

Apple profits hit by slowing iPhone sales,"Apple's business is being tested by ongoing weakening of its iPhone sales. In the most recent quarter, iPhone sales dropped to $33.4bn (Â£25.9bn), down almost 10% year-on-year. The fall extended a streak of declines and hit the firm's profits in the quarter, which slipped about 3% year-on-year to $13.7bn. The firm's profit and revenue for the full financial year also fell for the first time since 2016, weighed down by the iPhone results. In a presentation after the firm released its earnings, Apple boss Tim Cook hastened to reassure investors that the declines in iPhone sales are slowing, thanks to the popularity of the firm's latest model, the iPhone 11. ""It's early but the trendsÂ look very good,"" he said. ""We are bullish."" Mr Cook added that the firm's other businesses were healthy - sales of wearables, such as earphones and watches, surged by more than 50%, while services revenue, which includes Apple Pay and the app store, jumped 18% year-on-year. Few convinced by Apple's case for Hong Kong app removal iPhone 5 users risk losing internet access Man sues Apple claiming iPhone turned him gay That lifted quarterly revenue to $64bn (Â£49.6bn), up 2% year-on-year. Mr Cook has been working to make Apple's business less reliant on its phones, with new subscription services for news and television, among other offerings, but iPhones still account for a majority of sales. Mr Cook said his optimism about the iPhone 11's appeal is reflected in Apple's relatively bright forecast for the upcoming quarter, which includes the festive season - typically a time that sees many hardware purchases. The firm said it expected revenue growth in the quarter of as much as 6%, above analysts' expectations. Daniel Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said Apple also impressed investors with the resilience of its performance in its Greater China region, which accounts for nearly 20% of its business. Sales there declined less than 3%. On a call with investors, Mr Cook predicted additional growth in the region and expressed confidence that the US and China would reach an agreement that would avoid additional tariffs. ""The tone, I think, has changed significantly,"" he said. Apple shares gained almost 2% in after-hours trade.

"Will Bayley leaves Strictly after leg injuryThe Paralympian says he is ""gutted my Strictly journey has come to an end"" after six weeks on the show.","Will Bayley has left Strictly Come Dancing after sustaining a leg injury, the BBC has confirmed. The Paralympian landed awkwardly after jumping from a raised platform in studio rehearsals, causing him to miss last Saturday's show. ""I'm gutted my Strictly journey has had to come to an end. I've loved being part of the show,"" he said. Bayley, a gold medal-winning table tennis player, had been partnered with Strictly professional Janette Manrara. He is the second contestant to pull out this year due to injury.Jamie Laing had to withdraw before the series launchedafter injuring his foot, and was replaced by Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher. Bayley said: ""I want to say a special thank you to Janette for believing in me, and giving me the confidence to believe in myself. ""The things we achieved, from our couple's choice dance, through to the lifts in our salsa, will stay with me forever.  I've had the time of my life."" Bayley and Manrara had been in the competition for six weeks. Their best score from the judgescame in week five,external, when they received 32 points for their contemporary dance to Lukas Graham's 7 Years. The show's executive producer, Sarah James said: ""We are so sad that Will is unable to continue on the show. He will be greatly missed and we wish him a speedy recovery."" Manrara said: ""Absolutely devastated that Will and I will not be able to continue dancing. We made some incredible memories that I will never forget, and I am pleased to have shared them with such an inspirational person who I can now call a friend for life."" Strictly Come Dancing has not yet made any announcement on any changes that will be made to this year's competition as a result of the mid-series withdrawal. With nine couples left in the competition, a single vote-off each week would leave three pairs competing for the glitterball trophy on 14 December. The number of finalists has varied between three and four in recent years. Withdrawals from Strictly have been very rare over its 17 series to date, with just a handful leaving the ballroom bonanza without being voted off: Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck left the show during the programme's fourth series after being diagnosed with high blood pressure. ""I'm absolutely devastated,"" he said at the time. The following year, model and actress Kelly Brook withdrew in order to spend more time with her family after the death of her father, Kenneth. One year later, political journalist John Sergeant's simple steps won over many viewers but he decided to quit after fearing he might actually win the competition. ""That would be a joke too far,"" he said. Olympic athlete Jade Johnson said she was ""absolutely gutted"" after an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal forced her to withdraw during series seven. And singer Will Young left the show for ""personal reasons"" during series 14. He later told the Times Magazine it was ""for my own wellbeing"".

Chile cancels global climate summit amid unrest,"SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, centre, said his government needed to concentrate on ""re-establishing public order"" Chile has pulled out of hosting two major international summits, including a UN climate change conference, as anti-government protests continue. President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era said the decision had caused him ""pain"" but his government needed ""to prioritise re-establishing public order"". The COP25 climate summit was scheduled for 2 to 13 December, while the Apec trade forum was next month. The UN said it was now looking at alternative venues. World leaders were to gather at this year's Conference of the Parties (COP) to discuss the implementation of the Paris Accord - a landmark international climate agreement, first signed at COP21 in December 2015. This is the first time a country has pulled out of hosting the conference at such short notice. The demonstrations were originally triggered by a now-suspended rise in the price of metro fares in Santiago. However protesters are now marching to express their discontent over a wide variety of problems ranging from inequality to the high cost of healthcare. Fearlessness and anger drive Chile protesters Why protesters are on the streets worldwide The decision comes amid a number of global climate protests, includinga week of strikes led by environmental activist Greta Thunberglast month. And as the news was announced, a US-based organisation also separately revealed that tens of millions more people than previously thought were at risk ofcoastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level risewithin the next century. In a statement, the UN's climate change executive secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said: ""Earlier today, I was informed of the decision by the government of Chile not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing. We are currently exploring alternative hosting options."" This is a huge blow to hopes of progress on what many see as the crisis of climate change. Just as the science becomes more robust about rising carbon levels driving up temperatures and triggering a range of dangerous impacts, diplomats and experts have been looking to the COP25 talks in December as a vital staging-post on the way to global action. In particular, developing countries - the most vulnerable to the effects of rising sea levels and stronger storms - were banking on the event to raise their claims for more help from the richest nations. But the longer the unrest has continued on the streets of Santiago, the more the government of Chile must have worried about coping. Already there were reports of delays in getting the massive conference venue ready for the tens of thousands of delegates and campaigners. Now there'll be a frantic search for another venue, and soon. It was also hoped the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum - due to be held in Santiago from 15 to 17 November - would help ease tensions between the US and China. US officials said President Donald Trump had been planning to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at Apec, to discuss a possible trade deal. The two nations have been locked in an escalating trade war for some 18 months. However, the White House confirmed that although a new location was yet to be found, the US still expected to sign an initial trade agreement with China next month. ""We look forward to finalising Phase One of the historic trade deal with China within the same time frame,"" the White House said in a statement. At least 20 people have been killed since the mass protests in Chile began. While many protests were peaceful, there were also deadly incidents of arson and looting, as well as violent clashes between the security forces and protesters. They have shown little sign of abating despite Mr PiÃ±era announcing measures to ease Chileans' discontent with high levels of inequality and other grievances. People continued to demonstrate near La Moneda presidential palace in Santiago on Wednesday More than a million people are believed to have attended a rally in the capital last weekend More than 7,000 people have been arrested and the response by Mr PiÃ±era's government to the protests has come in for heavy criticism. He declared a state of emergency and night-time curfews in many of Chile's major cities, but the measures only seemed to further incense protesters. A rally on Saturday is estimated to have drawn more than a million people to the streets of Santiago, in what organisers said was the largest demonstration since democracy was restored in Chile in 1990. COP25 was originally supposed to be hosted by Brazil. But in November last year, just two months after being announced as the summit's host nation, then President-elect Jair Bolsonaro pulled out. The far-right leader said this was due to the change of government and budget restrictions, according to local media. However, he had recently chosen a foreign minister who claimed ""climate alarmism"" was just a plot by ""cultural Marxists"". A month later, Chile was selected to host the climate conference instead.

Will Bayley leaves Strictly after leg injury,"Will Bayley has left Strictly Come Dancing after sustaining a leg injury, the BBC has confirmed. The Paralympian landed awkwardly after jumping from a raised platform in studio rehearsals, causing him to miss last Saturday's show. ""I'm gutted my Strictly journey has had to come to an end. I've loved being part of the show,"" he said. Bayley, a gold medal-winning table tennis player, had been partnered with Strictly professional Janette Manrara. He is the second contestant to pull out this year due to injury.Jamie Laing had to withdraw before the series launchedafter injuring his foot, and was replaced by Emmerdale actor Kelvin Fletcher. Bayley said: ""I want to say a special thank you to Janette for believing in me, and giving me the confidence to believe in myself. ""The things we achieved, from our couple's choice dance, through to the lifts in our salsa, will stay with me forever.  I've had the time of my life."" Bayley and Manrara had been in the competition for six weeks. Their best score from the judgescame in week five,external, when they received 32 points for their contemporary dance to Lukas Graham's 7 Years. The show's executive producer, Sarah James said: ""We are so sad that Will is unable to continue on the show. He will be greatly missed and we wish him a speedy recovery."" Manrara said: ""Absolutely devastated that Will and I will not be able to continue dancing. We made some incredible memories that I will never forget, and I am pleased to have shared them with such an inspirational person who I can now call a friend for life."" Strictly Come Dancing has not yet made any announcement on any changes that will be made to this year's competition as a result of the mid-series withdrawal. With nine couples left in the competition, a single vote-off each week would leave three pairs competing for the glitterball trophy on 14 December. The number of finalists has varied between three and four in recent years. Withdrawals from Strictly have been very rare over its 17 series to date, with just a handful leaving the ballroom bonanza without being voted off: Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck left the show during the programme's fourth series after being diagnosed with high blood pressure. ""I'm absolutely devastated,"" he said at the time. The following year, model and actress Kelly Brook withdrew in order to spend more time with her family after the death of her father, Kenneth. One year later, political journalist John Sergeant's simple steps won over many viewers but he decided to quit after fearing he might actually win the competition. ""That would be a joke too far,"" he said. Olympic athlete Jade Johnson said she was ""absolutely gutted"" after an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal forced her to withdraw during series seven. And singer Will Young left the show for ""personal reasons"" during series 14. He later told the Times Magazine it was ""for my own wellbeing"". Earlier this year, Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing pulled out before the series started after injuring his foot in rehearsals.

"Resign now, Grenfell survivors tell fire chiefRelatives say an inquiry's conclusion that more lives could have been saved is ""heartbreaking"".","This video can not be played Grenfell families: 'There was a serious lack of common sense' Survivors and bereaved relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire have called for London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton to resign - after ahighly critical report,externalfrom the inquiry into the blaze. The report said some of the 72 people who were killed could have been saved if the building was evacuated sooner. The Grenfell United group said it was ""heartbreaking"" to read, and some relatives want senior staff prosecuted. The LFB said it was ""disappointed"" by some of the criticism of individuals. The inquiry, which examined what happened on the night of 14 June 2017, concluded that ""many more lives"" could have been saved if the advice to residents to ""stay put"" had been abandoned earlier than 02:35 BST. It said London Fire Brigade's preparations for such a fire were ""gravely inadequate"". Survivors called for senior fire brigade staff to be sacked and prosecuted, saying that the brigade is ""in the hands of people that are incapable of their jobs"". Grenfell: Seven key points from the report What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Nazanin Aghlani, who lost two family members in the fire, said: ""If a fire happened tonight the same thing would happen again."" The brigade's commissioner Dany Cotton, who is due to retire in April 2020, expressed her ""deepest sorrow"" that firefighters had not been able to save those who died, but said the inquiry had no expert evidence to support its conclusion about evacuating the tower. This video can not be played LFB chief Dany Cotton: ""We are truly sorry we couldn't save everyone's life that night"" It would not have been possible or safe to evacuate residents through a ""narrow, smoke-clogged stairwell"" with the number of firefighters who would have been available for that task said Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. The report also concluded that cladding surrounding the tower did not comply with building regulations and was the main reason for the fire's ""shocking"" spread. Campaign group Grenfell United said the report showed ""the immediate and real dangers"" of ""highly combustible cladding and insulation"". ""Lives are at risk and the government need to treat this as a national emergency,"" the group said. The inquiry made 46 recommendations, including improvements in training for fire brigade staff and the development of national guidelines for evacuating high-rise buildings. Grenfell United called for the recommendations to be implemented in full, saying they would save lives. The report condemned the brigade for""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failuresin its response to the fire. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a ""major omission"" by the brigade and more lives could have been saved had the ""stay-put"" policy been abandoned sooner. Grenfell United responded: ""It is heartbreaking to read that more of our loved ones could have been saved that night if the building was evacuated earlier."" This video can not be played âFire chief should step down today,' relatives of those that died in the fire say At an emotional news conference, relatives of 20 victims of the fire called for an overhaul of the brigade, saying its leadership should resign and face prosecution. Sid-Ali Atmani, who escaped from the 15th floor, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Those in command had [the] opportunity to save everyone in that tower - we're talking about two hours."" Karim Mussilhy, vice-chairman of Grenfell United, told the BBC he blamed the fire brigade leadership, not the firefighters. ""Dany Cotton needs to step down today,"" he said. ""She should not have the luxury to retire early with this Â£2m pot."" But Moyra Samuels of the Justice4Grenfell group said the firefighters were being scapegoated. ""It wasn't the firefighters who put the cladding on the building. The firefighters went into a building that was a deathtrap,"" she said. The report said evidence from Ms Cotton that she would not have changed anything about the brigade's response was ""insensitive"". Ms Cotton said many of the recommendations were welcome and would be ""carefully considered"". She expressed her ""deepest sorrow at not being able to save all those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire"". White doves were released at a memorial service earlier this year to mark two years since the tragedy She added: ""We welcome the chairman's recognition of the courage, commitment and bravery of firefighters on the night, but we are disappointed at some of the criticism of individual staff members who were placed in completely unprecedented circumstances and faced the most unimaginable conditions while trying to save the lives of others."" However, Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United who was rescued with her six-year-old daughter from the 11th floor, said Dany Cotton's statement was ""too little too late"". ""She stood up in the inquiry, in a room full of bereaved and survivors and said there's nothing she would do to change that night,"" she told the BBC. ""If she'd expressed that sorrow that day in that room, that potentially would have washed with us today."" Grenfell United expressed concern at the report's finding that the LFB were ""at risk of not learning the lessons from Grenfell"", adding that firefighters were ""let down by their training, procedures, equipment and leadership"". Other issues highlighted in the report included: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" In the House of Commons, MPs held a minutes' silence to remember victims of the fire, before a debate on the inquiry. This video can not be played ""No words... will ever make good the loss suffered"" - Johnson, May and Corbyn responded to the report Boris Johnson told MPs that survivors and the bereaved had been ""overlooked and ignored"" before the fire and ""shamefully failed"" afterwards. He said the government planned to name companies who were failing to replace unsafe cladding on their buildings, adding: ""Too many building owners have not acted responsibly."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response had been ""too slow and not strong enough on every front"", from rehousing the survivors to replacing Grenfell-style cladding. Eight out of 10 buildings residential blocks have still not had their cladding replaced, he said. The second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. This video can not be played What do survivors and bereaved families want from the inquiry? While this was not the focus of the first phase, the report found there was ""compelling evidence"" external walls of the building failed to comply with building regulations and ""actively promoted"" the spread of fire. It said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a ""source of fuel"". Grenfell United said the second phase of the inquiry ""must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment [of the building] lies"", with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and the companies involved facing ""serious questions"".

Australia's 'backpacker tax' ruled illegal,"This video can not be played Backpacker Alex Sinchak: ""A little bit of a win"" Australia has used a so-called ""backpacker tax"" to illegally tax foreign workers from eight countries, according to a landmark ruling. In 2017, the government imposed a controversial 15% tax rate on two visa categories for working holiday-makers. But a court on Wednesday found the levy was in breach of existing treaties with the UK, US, Germany, Finland, Chile, Japan, Norway and Turkey. Tens of thousands of foreign nationals may be owed money, local media said. The Australian Tax Office said it was considering whether to appeal against the ruling. The levy was challenged by an international tax company on behalf of a British tourist, Catherine Addy, who worked in Australia between 2015 and 2017. She welcomed the ruling, telling ABC News: ""I think it is wrong that foreigners should be taxed more harshly than Australians when they are doing the same work."" About 150,000 foreigners travel to Australia every year on working holiday visas, with many finding work in the farming and hospitality industries. The Federal Court of Australia said the tax could not be applied to citizens of those eight countries who had been employed on category 417 or 462 visas. How the tax was imposed after controversy Australia backpacker exploitation 'endemic' This was due to treaties which required Australia to tax those foreign nationals in the same way as local workers. Unlike foreign workers in Australia, locals do not pay any tax until their yearly income exceeds A$18,200 (Â£9,700; $12,500). In contrast, foreign workers on 417 or 462 visas are taxed 15% on the first $37,000 they earn. About 150,000 foreigners travel to Australia annually on working holiday visas In his ruling, Justice John Logan described the tax as ""a disguised form of discrimination based on nationality"". During her working holiday, Ms Addy lived mainly in a house share in Sydney's Earlwood, a point that proved to be crucial to the case. This meant she was considered a ""resident"" for tax purposes in Australia, while other foreign nationals who move around may be considered ""non-residents"". The ruling may force the government to repay hundreds of millions of dollars in total, local media reported. Taxback.com, the accounting firm that organised the lawsuit, said it was clear the ""backpacker tax"" breached several international agreements when it was introduced in 2016. ""It also damaged Australia's reputation as a working holiday destination,"" Joanna Murphy, the firm's CEO, said.

Grenfell response must be 'national emergency',"This video can not be played Grenfell families: 'There was a serious lack of common sense' Survivors and bereaved relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire have called for London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton to resign - after ahighly critical report,externalfrom the inquiry into the blaze. The report said some of the 72 people who were killed could have been saved if the building was evacuated sooner. The Grenfell United group said it was ""heartbreaking"" to read, and some relatives want senior staff prosecuted. The LFB said it was ""disappointed"" by some of the criticism of individuals. The inquiry, which examined what happened on the night of 14 June 2017, concluded that ""many more lives"" could have been saved if the advice to residents to ""stay put"" had been abandoned earlier than 02:35 BST. It said London Fire Brigade's preparations for such a fire were ""gravely inadequate"". Survivors called for senior fire brigade staff to be sacked and prosecuted, saying that the brigade is ""in the hands of people that are incapable of their jobs"". Grenfell: Seven key points from the report What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Nazanin Aghlani, who lost two family members in the fire, said: ""If a fire happened tonight the same thing would happen again."" The brigade's commissioner Dany Cotton, who is due to retire in April 2020, expressed her ""deepest sorrow"" that firefighters had not been able to save those who died, but said the inquiry had no expert evidence to support its conclusion about evacuating the tower. This video can not be played LFB chief Dany Cotton: ""We are truly sorry we couldn't save everyone's life that night"" It would not have been possible or safe to evacuate residents through a ""narrow, smoke-clogged stairwell"" with the number of firefighters who would have been available for that task said Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. The report also concluded that cladding surrounding the tower did not comply with building regulations and was the main reason for the fire's ""shocking"" spread. Campaign group Grenfell United said the report showed ""the immediate and real dangers"" of ""highly combustible cladding and insulation"". ""Lives are at risk and the government need to treat this as a national emergency,"" the group said. The inquiry made 46 recommendations, including improvements in training for fire brigade staff and the development of national guidelines for evacuating high-rise buildings. Grenfell United called for the recommendations to be implemented in full, saying they would save lives. The report condemned the brigade for""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failuresin its response to the fire. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a ""major omission"" by the brigade and more lives could have been saved had the ""stay-put"" policy been abandoned sooner. Grenfell United responded: ""It is heartbreaking to read that more of our loved ones could have been saved that night if the building was evacuated earlier."" This video can not be played âFire chief should step down today,' relatives of those that died in the fire say At an emotional news conference, relatives of 20 victims of the fire called for an overhaul of the brigade, saying its leadership should resign and face prosecution. Sid-Ali Atmani, who escaped from the 15th floor, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Those in command had [the] opportunity to save everyone in that tower - we're talking about two hours."" Karim Mussilhy, vice-chairman of Grenfell United, told the BBC he blamed the fire brigade leadership, not the firefighters. ""Dany Cotton needs to step down today,"" he said. ""She should not have the luxury to retire early with this Â£2m pot."" But Moyra Samuels of the Justice4Grenfell group said the firefighters were being scapegoated. ""It wasn't the firefighters who put the cladding on the building. The firefighters went into a building that was a deathtrap,"" she said. The report said evidence from Ms Cotton that she would not have changed anything about the brigade's response was ""insensitive"". Ms Cotton said many of the recommendations were welcome and would be ""carefully considered"". She expressed her ""deepest sorrow at not being able to save all those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire"". White doves were released at a memorial service earlier this year to mark two years since the tragedy She added: ""We welcome the chairman's recognition of the courage, commitment and bravery of firefighters on the night, but we are disappointed at some of the criticism of individual staff members who were placed in completely unprecedented circumstances and faced the most unimaginable conditions while trying to save the lives of others."" However, Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United who was rescued with her six-year-old daughter from the 11th floor, said Dany Cotton's statement was ""too little too late"". ""She stood up in the inquiry, in a room full of bereaved and survivors and said there's nothing she would do to change that night,"" she told the BBC. ""If she'd expressed that sorrow that day in that room, that potentially would have washed with us today."" Grenfell United expressed concern at the report's finding that the LFB were ""at risk of not learning the lessons from Grenfell"", adding that firefighters were ""let down by their training, procedures, equipment and leadership"". Other issues highlighted in the report included: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" In the House of Commons, MPs held a minutes' silence to remember victims of the fire, before a debate on the inquiry. This video can not be played ""No words... will ever make good the loss suffered"" - Johnson, May and Corbyn responded to the report Boris Johnson told MPs that survivors and the bereaved had been ""overlooked and ignored"" before the fire and ""shamefully failed"" afterwards. He said the government planned to name companies who were failing to replace unsafe cladding on their buildings, adding: ""Too many building owners have not acted responsibly."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response had been ""too slow and not strong enough on every front"", from rehousing the survivors to replacing Grenfell-style cladding. Eight out of 10 buildings residential blocks have still not had their cladding replaced, he said. The second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. This video can not be played What do survivors and bereaved families want from the inquiry? While this was not the focus of the first phase, the report found there was ""compelling evidence"" external walls of the building failed to comply with building regulations and ""actively promoted"" the spread of fire. It said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a ""source of fuel"". Grenfell United said the second phase of the inquiry ""must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment [of the building] lies"", with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and the companies involved facing ""serious questions"".

What do Workington men think of 'Workington Man',"We asked people in the town what they thought of the so-called Workington Man The men of Workington have found themselves in a spotlight of sorts - or a flurry of political headlines at least - after a think tank marked them out as a key election target. Workington Man is 2019's Worcester Woman. But who is he? And what do men in Workington - a former mining town on the Cumbrian coast - think of the stereotype? According to Onward - the right-of centre-think tank that gave birth to the creation - Workington Man is older, white and Northern. The imagined poster boy for ""middle England"" likes rugby league and Labour. He voted for Brexit and feels the country is moving away from his views. Tony still plans to vote for the Conservative Party Workington resident Tony Bland, 66, would like to see industry return to his home town, which has a rich industrial history of coal mining and steel making. He said: ""A lot of the big traditional industries have gone. ""I'd love to see more investment in the place, in this area, instead of it all being down south."" He says he'll be voting Conservative in December, and has done so in the past. Allan Mitchell, 53, a civil servant from Workington, said people were ""offended by the Conservatives' northern stereotyping"", adding: ""This may backfire."" ""People expect a campaign, but they don't like being patronised,"" he said. ""I'd expect all the parties to target voters in some way, and with Workington being a fairly marginal seat I can understand the Conservatives looking for any angle to gain more votes. ""The idea that we're all simple northerners without the university degrees they seem to think are standard, and all attend rugby league matches at the weekend, is causing widespread offence. It's a cliche that belongs in the 1970s."" Paul Wright said he couldn't bring himself to vote for the Liberal Democrats Workington, which has a population of about 25,000, has been Labour for the last century except for a brief spell in the 1970s. Since the constituency was created in 1918, the Tories have never won the seat at a general election. Conservative MP Richard Page held the seat for three years following the 1976 by-election, and has been the only non-Labour MP to ever represent the constituency. Labour's Sue Hayman held the seat at the last general election in 2017 with 21,317 votes, ahead of Conservative Clark Vasey's 17,392. An estimated six in 10 voters in the town voted Leave in 2016. Paul Wright, 53, said: ""I don't think there'll be many people voting Tory in Workington, despite Brexit. ""I think there's more distrust of the Tories than there is of wanting Brexit."" Paul said he wanted to remain in the EU and would only vote Labour because voting for the Liberal Democrats would be a ""wasted"" vote. Workington hosted the Rugby League Four Nations match between Scotland and New Zealand in 2016 But supporting Remain is a minority view in Workington - the Brexit Party topped the polls in the area in the European elections. Geoff Bates, 59, says he is ""definitely"" voting for Nigel Farage's party. ""Getting out of Europe, the people have voted for that. Why's it gone over three years?"" he said. But if Geoff really is representative of ""Workington Man"", his answer to whether he would vote for Boris Johnson will worry Downing Street: ""Oh definitely not. He's a fruitcake. I want Farage.""

How much could Labour's nationalisation plan cost?,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson referred in Parliament on Wednesday to Labour's nationalisation plans, describing them as a ""Â£196bn programme taking away money from companies"". The figure comes from employers' organisation the CBI, whichpublished its research,externalinto how much it would cost a Labour government to nationalise the industries it currently plans to. The party is proposing a programme of nationalisation that would bring into public ownership: the Royal Mail rail-operating companies energy supply networks water and sewerage companies The CBI concluded the nationalisation would cost an initial Â£196bn, which is a lot of money even for a government - it's about 9% of the output of the economy in a year. This is a very difficult figure to arrive at - the Labour Party has not put a figure to this and has not been clear about how it would go about nationalising these industries. Also, the CBI has not broken down how much it thinks each business is worth - it has released only the overall figure. One problem with the analysis is it does not take account of the value of the assets bought. If, for example, the government were to issue bonds to buy the Royal Mail at its current market value of about Â£2.1bn, it would then have an extra Â£2.1bn of debt but also an extra Â£2.1bn of assets. And it seems a mistake to consider only one of those figures. Labour has also proposed a new set of fiscal targets that exclude money borrowed for investment for precisely this reason. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has described this idea as having ""much to commend it"". The whole CBI analysis is based on the upfront cost without considering any value or benefit from the assets. The water companies, for example, would be expected to provide an income from customers' bills, which should pay to service the debt and even provide some money to the government on top of that. If the nationalised industries would be significantly better run by the public sector than the private sector, the benefits to the nation would be considerable. If not, then the opposite would be true. Another key question is how much a Labour government would end up having to pay for these assets. This could vary. The rail-operating companies would be relatively cheap to nationalise over time, because the franchises have time limits on them. The government could just wait for them to end and then take them into public ownership. The CBI included the cost of buying the companies that own the rolling stock, although Labour has now indicated it would not be buying them straight away. With the Royal Mail, we have a pretty good idea how much it is worth because it is listed on the stock-market, although it is not currently clear whether a Labour government would buy 51% of the shares to take control or 100% to nationalise it. There is also a question of which figure a Labour government would take for its value and whether it would pay a premium above that price to compensate shareholders. The CBI research has assumed it would have to pay a 30% premium, based on the prices of historical takeovers of utility companies by other companies. Labour says the 30% premium is ""arbitrary, fanciful and reflects the kind of profiteering that public ownership will end"". Cat Hobbs, from the pro-nationalisation group We Own It, told the BBC: ""We don't think the 30% mark-up is realistic at all. It's typical takeover practice but nationalisation is not the same as a takeover."" Labour's shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics: ""Parliament will determine a fair rate for compensation at the time."" But while she said a Labour government would not break the law and would pay a fair rate, she would not be drawn on whether it would pay the market price. It is hard to find recent examples of the UK government buying healthy companies. It did not pay anything to shareholders of Northern Rock in 2008 because it concluded (and the courts agreed) the lender had no value without government support. But the businesses Labour wants to buy are not in trouble. A better analogy would be the aircraft and shipbuilding industries nationalised in the 1970s (not all of which were in great health), for which the Labour government paid a price based on the average share price of the companies in the six months before it was elected. And when the War-damaged railways were nationalised, in 1948, the government issued bonds to pay for the shares based on their price in November 1946. The current Labour Party has said it would also make deductions based on things such as taking on pension-fund deficits, debts and subsidies given to the companies by previous governments. Furthermore, if the markets consider the threat of nationalisation under a Labour government is a credible one and shareholders may not receive the full value of their shares, the share prices could be depressed. That means the share price before the election could be considerably higher than after it - and which price the government chooses to take would be important. Meanwhile, Labour also wants to nationalise parts of the water and energy industries that are not stand-alone listed companies. And to assess that, the CBI has taken the views of their respective regulators of the value of the assets. But Labour has rejected that as ""misguided"", saying: ""These are purely notional values created by the regulator and include companies' enormous debts."" While the regulatory valuations are not a perfect figure to take - because of both debt issues and the exclusion of goodwill (that's the value of the opportunities to make money from the business in addition to the actual value of the assets), however, they are not a bad starting point. But clearly more work would be needed on the valuation if the process were actually under way. The CBI has also warned if the government does not pay a premium, then UK pension funds and savers would take a hit of Â£9bn, which is Â£327 per UK household. That is based on a calculation assuming 20% of the targeted assets are owned by UK investors. But there would be a corresponding benefit to the taxpayer if the government did not pay a premium. Clarification: This piece has been amended to reflect that it is understood Labour does not plan to purchase rolling stock companies. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Meanwhile, peers have approved the legislation needed to bring about the 12 December election. The House of Lords passed the early election bill - which wasapproved by MPs on Tuesday- in less than four hours, with no changes. In their final encounter in Parliament before the election, the two leaders exchanged barbs over their political values and disputed their parties' respective records on the NHS. The Labour leader accused the PM - who he has challenged to a one-on-one TV debate - of running down the health service, saying cuts to funding had contributed to rising waiting times for cancer treatment and operations. He said a Labour government would reverse what he said was the growing privatisation of the NHS, saying it existed to ""make people better, not make the wealthy few richer"".

""Make no mistake, I stand ready to take on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate to be prime minister,"" she said. Twitter bans all political advertising ""We have a bold vision to stop Brexit and build a better, brighter future for the country."" For the Scottish National Party, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said an election was anopportunity for the country to hold another independence referendum. ""A win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland's right to choose our own future,"" she said. But the Scottish Conservatives claimed voting for their party would keep Scotland in the UK. Meanwhile, an attempt by Boris Johnson to unite his party by re-admitting 10 Tory Brexit rebels has been hit bya row over the party's refusal to give the whip backto Amber Rudd - the former home secretary who has said she is standing down as an MP. The smaller parties are already talking about striking deals with each other, which could see candidates standing aside in areas where their Remain-supporting rivals have a better chance of winning. Ms Swinson said there were a ""small number of seats"" where ""arrangements"" could be struck with other parties to give an anti-Brexit candidate the best chance of winning.

Which MPs are standing down at the election?,"Clockwise from top left: Keith Vaz, Heidi Allen, Philip Hammond, Rory Stewart, Amber Rudd, Nick Boles, Tom Watson and Nicky Morgan The general election date is fast approaching and many familiar faces from the House of Commons have cleared their desks for the last time. The Commons will lose more than 1,000 years of parliamentary experience as more than 70 incumbents have decided not to stand for election again. All sitting MPs lost their titles when Parliament was dissolved for the election to take place. Most of them will be seeking re-election on 12 December but here are the ones we know who will not be coming back: Ken Clarkeis the longest-serving MP in the House of Commons, known as the father of the house, having served his Rushcliffe constituency for almost half a century. A long-time supporter of the UK's membership of the EU, he was expelled from the Conservative Party by Boris Johnson, after he rebelled against the government over Brexit. Clockwise from left: Ken Clarke, Justine Greening, Nicholas Soames, Vince Cable, John Bercow, Kate Hoey, Jo Johnson and Gloria de Piero Sir Oliver Letwin, the former Conservative minister and West Dorset MP, was recently at the forefront of Parliamentary attempts to delay Brexit. ""With great sadness"" former Chancellor and Foreign SecretaryPhilip Hammond(Runnymede & Weybridge) said he would quit the House of Commons after not being restored to the Conservative Party before the election. Former Education Secretary and Tory Brexit rebelJustine Greening(Putney), thinks she can ""achieve more positive change outside Parliament"" and will now focus specifically on improving social mobility. One-time Conservative leadership candidate and walking enthusiastRory Stewart(Penrith and the Border), has switched his focus to next year's London mayoral election, in which he will try to beat Labour's Sadiq Khan as an independent candidate. Former Home, and Work and Pensions, SecretaryAmber Rudd- MP for the ultra-marginal Hastings and Rye seat - resigned from the cabinet and surrendered the Tory whip over Brexit in September. She was not among those who later had the whip restored by the PM and is not standing again. Guto Bebb(Aberconwy), is another Brexit rebel kept out in the cold by Boris Johnson, who won't be standing again. Nick Boles(Grantham & Stamford) also quit the Conservative Party over Brexit and has chosen not to stand again as an independent. Suspended ConservativeCharlie Elphicke(Dover), who lost the Conservative whip after being accused of sexual assault - which he denies - will not stand again this time. He is being replaced as Tory candidate by his wife, Natalie. Ian Austin- a former minister for regional affairs under Gordon Brown -quit the Labour Party in February, when he criticised the party's approach to tackling anti-Semitism. In November, Mr Austin announced he would be standing down andcalled on voters to back Boris Johnson's Conservative Partyin the polling booths. Louise Ellman(Liverpool Riverside) also quit Labour over claims of anti-Semitism within the party. Suspended ex-Labour MPKelvin Hopkins(Luton North) is retiring, saying he wants to spend more time with his wife, who is in ill health. Another former Labour MP,John Woodcock(Barrow and Furness), announced he wouldn't stand because he was having a baby with his partner, Isabel Hardman. He has also been appointed as an ""extremism envoy"" by the Home Office. The only person actually elected as an independent in 2017 wasSylvia Hermon(North Down). The one-time Ulster Unionist is standing down after 18 years as an MP, saying she wants to spend more time with her family. Nicky Morgan(Loughborough), the current culture secretary, surprised Westminster watchers by announcing her departure. She gave as her reasons the ""clear impact"" on her family and ""the other sacrifices involved in and the abuse for doing the job of a modern MP"". Her decision prompted some to question whether abuse aimed at female MPs was prompting them to step down in disproportionate numbers - and whether women were standing down at a younger age and after fewer years of service. However, just 26% of those standing down are women - compared with 32% overall. While they are on average a little younger - at 59, compared with 61 for men, the difference is not large. Women do seem to be standing down after less time in the Commons than men - four and a half years sooner on average. Claire Perry(Devizes), a former energy minister and president of COP26, a UN climate change conference, stepped down after nine years, saying she still backed Mr Johnson and his ""brave"" Brexit strategy. Sir Nicholas Soames(Mid Sussex), grandson of wartime leader Sir Winston Churchill, was among those kicked out of the party by Boris Johnson over his opposition to a no-deal Brexit. He has since been welcomed back into the fold, but is standing down. Other readmitted rebelsAlistair Burt(North East Bedfordshire),Richard Harrington(Watford),Richard Benyon(Newbury) will all leave the Commons too. Famous family: Sir Nicholas Soames with his grandfather Sir Winston Churchill Former Defence SecretarySir Michael Fallonwho has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 and before that MP for Darlington, said he had always intended to stand down in the next few years. Sir David Lidington(Aylesbury) de-facto deputy PM under Theresa May wants to spend more time with his family while he is ""still in active and good health"". Former miner - and former minister -Sir Patrick McLoughlin(Derbyshire Dales), is retiring after 33 years of service. Dame Caroline Spelman(Meriden), blamed the ""intensity of abuse arising out of Brexit"" for her decision to resign. Jo Johnson(Orpington), the PM's brother, resigned from the cabinet over Brexit and quit as an MP, saying he was ""torn between family loyalty and the national interest"". Other Tory MPs leaving the green benches will be: Jeremy Lefroy(Stafford) Glyn Davies(Montgomeryshire) Keith Simpson(Broadland) Nick Hurd(Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner) Mark Prisk(Hertford and Stortford) Bill Grant(Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock) Sir Hugo Swire(East Devon) David Tredinnick(Bosworth) Mark Field(Cities of London and Westminster) Seema Kennedy(South Ribble) Sarah Newton(Truro and Falmouth) Sir Alan Duncan(Melton and Rutland) Peter Heaton-Jones(North Devon) Margot James(Stourbridge) Mark Lancaster(Milton Keynes North) Ross Thomson(Aberdeen South) Sir Henry Bellingham(North West Norfolk) Nick Herbert(Arundel & South Downs) Ed Vaizey(Wantage and Didcot) Sir George Hollingbery(Meon Valley) Andrew Griffiths(Burton) Deputy leaderTom Watson(West Bromwich East) is to step down from his role and not run again for Parliament citing ""personal not political"" reasons. He will continuing campaigning on gambling regulation, public health and preventing press intrusion. Former ministerKeith Vaz(Leicester East) is standing down, after he was suspended from the Commons over an inquiry into his conduct by the standards committee. Watson has been in frontline politics for 35 years Of the other Labour MPs who have announced their intention to step aside, a good number are either Brexiteers or against a second referendum. Jim Fitzpatrick(Poplar and Limehouse) andSir Kevin Barron(Rother Valley) have both voted for Theresa May's Brexit deal at some stage. Veteran trade unionistRonnie Campbell(Blyth Valley) andKate Hoey(Vauxhall) backed leave in the 2016 referendum. John Mann(Bassetlaw) has already left and now sits in the House of Lords after being nominated by previous PM Theresa May. Ex-shadow justice ministerGloria De Piero(Ashfield), expressed concern over the ""lack of tolerance for different viewpoints"" within her party in her resignation speech. One-time leadership challengerOwen Smith(Pontypridd), who was sacked from the shadow cabinet over Brexit, cited both personal and political reasons for not standing again. Ann Clwyd(Cynon Valley), who at 82 is the oldest woman to sit in the House of Commons, is leaving after 35 years. Other Labour MPs stepping down are: Stephen Pound(Ealing North) Stephen Twigg(Liverpool West Derby) Roberta Blackman-Woods(City of Durham) Geoffrey Robinson(Coventry North West) Teresa Pearce(Erith and Thamesmead) Paul Farrelly(Newcastle-Under-Lyme) Albert Owen(Ynys Mon) Jim Cunningham(Coventry South) Ian Lucas(Wrexham) Helen Jones(Warrington North) Adrian Bailey(West Bromwich West) Vince Cable was the second politician to appear on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing Former Lib Dem party leaderSir Vince Cable(Twickenham) and colleagueSir Norman Lamb(North Norfolk) - both former ministers in the coalition government - both announced their decisions to stand down back in August. Sir Norman will focus on setting up a fund for people with mental health issues and learning disabilities. Former Conservative and Change UK MPHeidi Allen(Cambridgeshire South), who only joined the Lib Dems a few weeks ago, said she had suffered ""utterly dehumanising abuse"" as an MP in a letter to her constituents announcing her intention to quit. Joan Ryan(Enfield North) andAnn Coffey(Stockport) are both former Labour MPs who quit to join Change UK.Heidi Allen to stand down as MP The DUP'sDavid Simpson(Upper Bann) is leaving the green benches after a reported affair with a party colleague. In addition to being the House of Commons referee, former ConservativeJohn Bercowhas been the MP for Buckingham since 1997. Before he announced his decision to step down, the Conservative Party said it intended to break convention and run a candidate against him at the next election.

A really simple guide to the UK general electionDid my MP vote for a 12 December election?,"The UK is gearing up to hold a general election on Thursday. These national votes, to choose a government to run the country, are supposed to be held every five years. But this would be the third since 2015. A total of 650 people will be chosen asmembers of Parliament (MPs), to decide laws and policies. Members of Parliament are elected by voters to represent the interests of their constituency in the House of Commons. Most belong to a political party, but some do stand as independents. There are 650 MPs in the House. MPs are elected to the House of Commons, one of two chambers of Parliament in London, where the government is based. The government passes laws that help it run the country. This compares with local governments which deal with issues such as bin collections and schools in each area. In a general election, the UK's 46 million voters are invited to choose an MP for their area - one of 650 constituencies. Anyone aged 18 or over can vote, as long as they are registered and a British citizen or qualifying citizen of the Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland. Older people are more likely than younger ones to vote. At the 2017 general election, 59% of 20- to 24-year-olds voted, compared with 77% of 60- to 69-year-olds. However, about two-thirds of the more than 3.1 million people who registered to vote between the election being called and the registration deadline were under the age of 35, with more than a million of them under 25. Voting takes place at local polling stations, set up in places such as churches and school halls. Voters put a cross on the ballot paper beside the name of their chosen candidate and drop it into a sealed ballot box. Most people over 18 on polling day can stand as a candidate - as long as they are a British citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen resident in the UK. They must also pay a Â£500 deposit, which will be lost if they do not get at least 5% of the votes in their constituency. Candidates must meet certain conditions - prisoners, civil servants, judges and members of the police and armed forces cannot stand. A total of 3,322 candidates are standing across the 650 seats this year. There are 91 Davids standing for election - the most popular name among the candidates - while the first female name on the list is Sarah in 18th place. There are 22 candidates with that first name standing. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency is elected, even if they are chosen by less than half the electorate in their seat. Most MPs represent a political party but some stand for election as independent candidates. Any party with more than half the MPs (326) in the Commons usually forms the government. Parties with well below 50% of the national vote can take power as a result of theUK's voting system. The UK uses a first past the post voting system. It means a local candidate who receives the most votes wins â and the party with the most winning candidates forms a government. So the overall number of votes parties get nationally does not have any bearing on who wins the election. If no party has a majority of MPs, the one with the most can form a coalition - or partnership - with one or more other parties to gain control. The prime minister is not directly voted for by the public. He or she is chosen by the winning party's MPs and appointed bythe Queen, who is duty bound to follow their advice. The Queen is the UKâs head of state, although she is not in charge of the government. Elizabeth II is the countryâs longest-serving monarch, having ascended to the throne in 1952. She performs state duties, which include formally opening Parliament, representing the country at events such as the annual Remembrance Day parade, and making official visits overseas. She is also head of the armed forces and Church of England. Detailed proposals for everything from the economy to defence and policing are set out before any general election inmanifestos. A manifesto is basically a brochure containing all of a party's ideas and policies. Manifestos are usually published during the general election campaign. If a party wins the election, it is often judged by how many of its manifesto promises it manages to deliver as a government. These come from the UK's political parties - groups of people with similar political beliefs who come together to try to win power. The issues UK voters care most about have changed a lot, according to the polls. TheNational Health Service (NHS)and immigration were the things that most concerned voters in 2015. The National Health Service (NHS), which started in 1948, is the government-funded national healthcare service that provides free diagnosis and treatment for UK citizens. TheEuropean Union (EU)was of far less interest. European Union: the political and economic union of 28 member states, which the UK is planning to leave. Now, however,Brexit- the UK's departure from the EU - is a huge issue. Short for British exit - refers to the UK leaving the European Union. Neither the Conservative orLabourparties had enough votes to form a majority government after the 2017 election. The Labour Party was founded by the trade union movement in 1900 to give workers a voice in Parliament. It believes in the redistribution of wealth and opportunity, greater rights for working people and strong, state-run public services. The Conservatives were the bigger of the two parties and formed a partnership with the Democratic Unionist PartyDUPin order to win votes in the Commons. The Democratic Unionist Party was founded in 1971, during the time of conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles. As unionists, the DUP support Northern Ireland being part of the UK and are known for their socially conservative beliefs on abortion and same-sex marriage. After the 2017 election, DUP MPs helped keep the Conservatives in power by agreeing to support them in Commons votes. Since the election, the Conservatives and Labour have both lost MPs, while theLiberal Democratshave made gains. Often called the Lib Dems, the Liberal Democrats were formed in 1988 by the merger of one of Britain's oldest political institutions, the Liberal Party, which stood for free trade and individual liberty, and the Social Democratic Party, a centrist offshoot of the Labour Party. The party likes to see itself as being on the centre ground of British politics. Parliament's second chamber is theHouse of Lords. The House of Lords is the second chamber of the UK Parliament. It is independent from the House of Commons but shares with it the role of making laws, while it also checks the governmentâs work. Members are given a title, such as Lord, are not elected, do not represent constituencies and most do not belong to any party. Its members are not elected but are appointed by the Queen, on the prime minister's advice. On general election day, voting takes place between 07:00 and 22:00. The results are declared through the night and the following day. When the overall result is known, the leader of the winning party, if there is one, visits Buckingham Palace to ask the Queen for permission to form a new government. Once they have that, which is a formality, they return to the traditional home of the prime minister10 Downing Street. This terraced house is the official residence and office of the UK prime minister. Often they will stand outside to deliver a speech about their party's plans for the coming years.

"Husband jailed for pregnant wife's murderKeen sailor Andrew Griggs probably dumped Debbie's body at sea after killing her in 1999, a judge says.","Andrew Griggs was sentenced at Canterbury Crown Court A man who murdered his pregnant wife and disposed of her body in 1999 has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years. The body of Debbie Griggs, who disappeared without trace from the family home in Deal, Kent, on 5 May 1999, has never been found. Sentencing Andrew Griggs at Canterbury Crown Court, His Honour Justice Robin Spencer said it was likely the keen sailor had ""dumped her body at sea"". Griggs, 57, of St Leonards in Dorset, was convicted on Monday. Jurors rejected his claims that his wife, then aged 34, had walked out on him and their three young sons. ""Only you know how you killed her and where you disposed of her body,"" Justice Spencer told Griggs. He said Griggs knew the coast ""like the back of his hand,"" adding: ""It would not have been difficult to weigh her body down so that it sank without trace."" Debbie Griggs was devoted to her three sons, the jury heard Justice Spencer said Mrs Griggs was ""an adored and adoring mother of three little boys,"" adding: ""They were her life, she would never have left them."" He told Griggs by murdering his wife, who was four and half months pregnant, he had also ""killed her unborn child"". Mrs Griggs's mother died of a ""broken heart"" in January just weeks before Griggs was charged, her father told the court. ""I know she longed to know where Debbie was,"" Brian Cameron said. The wife killer who escaped justice for 20 years Murder accused 'dumped wife's body at sea' Teenage girl 'groomed' by murder suspect The court heard Mrs Griggs believed her husband was having a ""sexual relationship"" with a 15-year-old girl and would have been entitled to half of the family's fishmonger business if they divorced. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC said: ""The murder was committed to avoid the consequences, both in terms of the financial impact that divorce would otherwise have had, but also in the context of the illegal relationship that the defendant was engaged in at the time."" He told jurors Griggs had attacked his wife at their home in Cross Road ""at a time where the children were asleep upstairs"". Her car was found 1.3 miles away on 12 May with a smear of her blood discovered in the boot. The boot lining of Mrs Griggs's car had been removed, police found The length of time Griggs maintained his lie and concealed the location of his wife's body were aggravating factors, the judge said. ""You robbed the mother of her children and her family of the very thing you have enjoyed over those 20 years,"" he said. Griggs had been a prime suspect ever since police abandoned a missing persons inquiry and launched a murder investigation in late-May 1999. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) looked at the evidence in 2003 and decided there was ""no realistic prospect of conviction"". But in 2018, cold case detectives reviewed the evidence against him and early this year the CPS authorised a murder charge. Asked what had changed, prosecutors said while there was no new evidence the passage of time helped disprove the idea that Mrs Griggs was still alive or had taken her own life.

Sea level rise to affect 'three times more people',"Heavy rain on a high tide flooded Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok in 2011 Millions more people will be at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea-level rise later this century. That's the conclusion of new research conducted byClimate Central,external, a US-based non-profit news organisation. It finds that 190 million people will be living in areas that are projected to be below high-tide lines come 2100. Today, the group calculates roughly 110 million are presently occupying these lands, protected by walls, levees, and other coastal defences. The future at-risk total assumes only moderate global warming and therefore limited ocean encroachment. Climate Central's investigations,published in the journal Nature Communications,external, have sought to correct the biases in the elevation datasets previously used to work out how far inland coastlines will be inundated. UN panel signals red alert on 'Blue Planet' Warming to drive 'robust increase' in UK flooding Satellites sense Earth's lumps and bumps The most famous of these datasets comes from a space shuttle mission. The Endeavour orbiter used a radar instrument in 2000 to map heights across the globe.This 3D model of the planet,externalhas become one of the most used Earth observation datasets in history. But the Climate Central team, of Scott Kulp and Benjamin Strauss, says it suffers from biases that in places make the land look higher than it really is. This problem occurs particularly in locations where there is thick vegetation, such as forests; the radar tends to see the tree canopy, not the ground. Kulp and Strauss used more modern, higher-resolution information from airborne lidar (laser) instruments to train a computer to make corrections to the shuttle's digital elevation model (DEM). When this new CoastalDEM is used in tandem with population statistics and the latest forecasts for sea level rise, it becomes apparent that many more people are entering a precarious future. The improved elevation data finds that even with moderate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, six Asian countries (China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand), where 237 million people live today, could face annual coastal flooding threats by 2050. That's roughly 183 million more than assessments based on prevailing elevation data. New estimate versus old estimate China -93 million vs 29 million Bangladesh -42 million vs 5 million India -36 million vs 5 million Vietnam -31 million vs 9 million Indonesia -23 million vs 5 million Thailand -12 million vs 1 million The team has producedan interactive map,externalthat illustrates the difference between estimates based solely on the shuttle legacy data and the reworked elevations. And it's possible to see on this map how circumstances change depending on how well the world manages to constrain climate warming, which is pushing up ocean levels by heating the seas and melting ice stored in Antarctica and Greenland. Under a pessimistic future of continued high emissions, CoastalDEM suggests up to 630 million people live today on land that is projected to have annual flood events by 2100. For 2050, this number is 340 million, up from the estimated 250 million people who already live in this predicament. In general, the CoastalDEM-derived estimates of the global population at risk from coastal flooding are three times greater than the values produced using just the shuttle information. ""We estimate one billion people now occupy land less than 10m above current high tide lines, including 250 million below 1m,"" the team tells Nature Communications. Sea levels have been rising globally by over 3mm per year in recent decades, with an acceleration in this trend now observable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated last month in a special report on the oceans that global average sea levels could rise by up to 1.1m by 2100, in the worst warming scenario. Kulp and Strauss stress some limitations in their analysis. For example, it assumes a static population - future growth and migration are not considered. Nor are improvements in coastal defences. On a regional basis, the Climate Central analysis will be less surprising where coastal lidar surveys are already used to assess future flood risk. But its value is significant for those places which don't enjoy such good coverage. And in a number of locations, the future risks are only partly to do with sea-level rise. Some of the world's coastal megacities have the additional challenge of subsidence. In places, the ground is going down 10 times faster than the water is coming up. This has been true of places like Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Bangkok wheretoo much groundwater has been extracted from underlying soils.

Brexit deal means âÂ£70bn hit to UK by 2029',"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will leave the UK Â£70bn worse off than if it had remained in the EU, a study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has found. It concluded that GDP would be 3.5% lower in 10 years' time under the deal. The independent forecaster's outlook is one of the first assessments of how the economy will fare under the new deal. But the Treasury said it plans on a 'more ambitious' agreement with the EU than 'NIESR is basing its findings on'. A spokesman said: ""We are aiming to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union, which is more ambitious than the standard free trade deal that NIESR has based its findings on."" NIESR said approval of the prime minister's deal ""would reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome, but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU"". Despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ""hinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would be if the UK stayed in the EU,"" NIESR said. ""We estimate that, in the long run, the economy would be 3.5% smaller with the deal compared to continued EU membership,"" it added. The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa May's deal of last year. Her deal would have reduced the size of the economy by 3% over the same period, NIESR said. Founded in 1938, NIESR has no party political ties and is the UK's oldest independent economic research institute. A year ago, it conducted a study commissioned by the People's Votewhich said GDP would be 3.9% lower by 2030. Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney welcomed the new Brexit deal, saying it was a ""net economic positive"" as it ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"". However, the governor said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated with the EU meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the UK economyas the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor Mrs May. Chancellor Sajid Javid has refused to recalculate Treasury assessments on the impact of the government's Brexit deal, saying it is ""self-evidently in our economic interest"". NIESR's study modelled different Brexit scenarios against a baseline of the UK staying in the EU. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, it said GDP would be 5.6% lower than if the UK remained in the EU. The government would dearly love to compare its agreement to the prospect of no deal. On that basis, Boris Johnson's renegotiation looks better - on standard economic models such as those deployed by the respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research. ""New deal versus no deal"" was the argument put to MPs when the Prime Minister was still trying to pass his deal. It was the position of the Chancellor, when he refused to publish his own version of such an analysis saying it was ""self-evidently"" better. But we are now in a different situation. The Prime Minister's deal is being put to the electorate versus a remain option or a different, far softer form of Brexit. Crucially, NIESR calculates that the Johnson renegotiation leads to a slightly worse economic outcome than Theresa May's deal which it replaces, as the Bank of England Governor hinted to me earlier this month. What is driving these results? The new deal creates more distance from the European Union economy, with more regulatory barriers to trade. Unlike May's deal, there could be checks on the origin of parts in the car industry, for example. The overall impact of these extra barriers outweighs the benefit from extra certainty of ""getting Brexit done"". Individual businesses may well disagree. But the Treasury itself has chosen not to issue its own version of analysis such as this, even though it has the capacity to do so. If the terms of trade with the EU remained unchanged, but ""chronic uncertainty"" persisted, GDP would be 2% lower. ""The economic outlook is clouded by significant economic and political uncertainty and depends critically on the United Kingdom's trading relationships after Brexit,"" NIESR said. ""Domestic economic weakness is further amplified by slowing global demand."" According to NIESR, the effects of Brexit on the UK economy are already being felt. ""The economy is estimated to be 2.5% smaller now than it would otherwise have been as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote,"" it said. Correction 17th January 2020: An earlier version of this story said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, NIESR forecast that the economy would shrink by 5.6%.

Facebook agrees to pay Cambridge Analytica fine,"Facebook's chief executive has repeatedly declined to answer questions from UK MPs about the scandal Facebook has agreed to pay a Â£500,000 fine imposed by the UK's data protection watchdog for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It had originally appealed the penalty, causing the Information Commissioner's Office to pursue its own counter-appeal. As part of the agreement, Facebook has made no admission of liability. The US firm said it ""wished it had done more to investigate Cambridge Analytica"" earlier. James Dipple-Johnstone, deputy commissioner of the ICO said: ""The ICO's main concern was that UK citizen data was exposed to a serious risk of harm. Protection of personal information and personal privacy is of fundamental importance, not only for the rights of individuals, but also as we now know, for the preservation of a strong democracy."" Harry Kinmonth, a Facebook lawyer, noted that the social network had made changes to restrict the information app developers could access following the scandal. ""The ICO has stated that it has not discovered evidence that the data of Facebook users in the EU was transferred to Cambridge Analytica,"" he added. ""However, we look forward to continuing to cooperate with the ICO's wider and ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes."" Researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR used a personality quiz to harvest the Facebook data of up to 87 million people. Some of this data was shared with London-based Cambridge Analytica. The ICO argued that Facebook did not do enough to protect users' information.

Car giants plot US-European mega-merger,"PSA Group, the French owner of Peugeot, is set to announce a merger with its US-Italian rival Fiat Chrysler shortly, reports say. A deal between the two carmakers would create a business with a combined market value of nearly $50bn (Â£39.9bn). This is Fiat Chrysler's second attempt at a merger this year after it pulled out of an agreement with Renault in June. Fiat Chrysler shares jumped more than 9% in trading on Wednesday. Sources have told Reuters, AFP and the Wall Street Journal that the merger could be announced as early as Thursday. The potential merger would face significant political and financial hurdles. Discussions remain in the early stages and there is no guarantee of a final deal. However, if the two companies do combine, PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares is expected to lead the enlarged group. PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares may lead the combined group John Elkann, Fiat Chrysler's chairman and the head of Italy's Agnelli industrial dynasty, which controls the business, would retain the same position at the new company. The talks come months after a proposed tie-up between Fiat Chrysler and French carmaker Renault collapsed with Renault in June. Mr Elkann broke off talks after French government officials intervened and pushed for Renault first to resolve tensions with its Japanese partner Nissan. Fiat Chrysler withdraws bid for Renault After ditching the proposed merger Mr Elkann confirmed the group's bid to pursue an alternative deal. Car makers face huge investments for electrification, emission reduction and autonomous driving technologies, which gives them an incentive to merge. A merger of the two groups would create one of the world biggest car makers, and bring a number of brands under one roof including Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Jeep, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. Morningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert said that the total sales of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, including China joint venture partners, were 8.7 million vehicles last year. This would rank the eventual combined group fourth behind Volkswagen, Toyota and the Renault-Nissan Alliance, each at more than 10 million units. ""We view the combination of these two companies as reasonable given global competition, high capital intensity, and industry disruption from electrified powertrain as well as autonomous technologies, Mr Hilgert said. Fiat Chrysler had described its bid for Renault as a ""transformative"" proposal that would create a global automotive leader.

Grenfell Tower survivors welcome report,"This video can not be played Grenfell families: 'There was a serious lack of common sense' Survivors and bereaved relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire have called for London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton to resign - after ahighly critical report,externalfrom the inquiry into the blaze. The report said some of the 72 people who were killed could have been saved if the building was evacuated sooner. The Grenfell United group said it was ""heartbreaking"" to read, and some relatives want senior staff prosecuted. The LFB said it was ""disappointed"" by some of the criticism of individuals. The inquiry, which examined what happened on the night of 14 June 2017, concluded that ""many more lives"" could have been saved if the advice to residents to ""stay put"" had been abandoned earlier than 02:35 BST. It said London Fire Brigade's preparations for such a fire were ""gravely inadequate"". Survivors called for senior fire brigade staff to be sacked and prosecuted, saying that the brigade is ""in the hands of people that are incapable of their jobs"". Grenfell: Seven key points from the report What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Nazanin Aghlani, who lost two family members in the fire, said: ""If a fire happened tonight the same thing would happen again."" The brigade's commissioner Dany Cotton, who is due to retire in April 2020, expressed her ""deepest sorrow"" that firefighters had not been able to save those who died, but said the inquiry had no expert evidence to support its conclusion about evacuating the tower. This video can not be played LFB chief Dany Cotton: ""We are truly sorry we couldn't save everyone's life that night"" It would not have been possible or safe to evacuate residents through a ""narrow, smoke-clogged stairwell"" with the number of firefighters who would have been available for that task said Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. The report also concluded that cladding surrounding the tower did not comply with building regulations and was the main reason for the fire's ""shocking"" spread. Campaign group Grenfell United said the report showed ""the immediate and real dangers"" of ""highly combustible cladding and insulation"". ""Lives are at risk and the government need to treat this as a national emergency,"" the group said. The inquiry made 46 recommendations, including improvements in training for fire brigade staff and the development of national guidelines for evacuating high-rise buildings. Grenfell United called for the recommendations to be implemented in full, saying they would save lives. The report condemned the brigade for""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failuresin its response to the fire. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a ""major omission"" by the brigade and more lives could have been saved had the ""stay-put"" policy been abandoned sooner. Grenfell United responded: ""It is heartbreaking to read that more of our loved ones could have been saved that night if the building was evacuated earlier."" This video can not be played âFire chief should step down today,' relatives of those that died in the fire say At an emotional news conference, relatives of 20 victims of the fire called for an overhaul of the brigade, saying its leadership should resign and face prosecution. Sid-Ali Atmani, who escaped from the 15th floor, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Those in command had [the] opportunity to save everyone in that tower - we're talking about two hours."" Karim Mussilhy, vice-chairman of Grenfell United, told the BBC he blamed the fire brigade leadership, not the firefighters. ""Dany Cotton needs to step down today,"" he said. ""She should not have the luxury to retire early with this Â£2m pot."" But Moyra Samuels of the Justice4Grenfell group said the firefighters were being scapegoated. ""It wasn't the firefighters who put the cladding on the building. The firefighters went into a building that was a deathtrap,"" she said. The report said evidence from Ms Cotton that she would not have changed anything about the brigade's response was ""insensitive"". Ms Cotton said many of the recommendations were welcome and would be ""carefully considered"". She expressed her ""deepest sorrow at not being able to save all those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire"". White doves were released at a memorial service earlier this year to mark two years since the tragedy She added: ""We welcome the chairman's recognition of the courage, commitment and bravery of firefighters on the night, but we are disappointed at some of the criticism of individual staff members who were placed in completely unprecedented circumstances and faced the most unimaginable conditions while trying to save the lives of others."" However, Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United who was rescued with her six-year-old daughter from the 11th floor, said Dany Cotton's statement was ""too little too late"". ""She stood up in the inquiry, in a room full of bereaved and survivors and said there's nothing she would do to change that night,"" she told the BBC. ""If she'd expressed that sorrow that day in that room, that potentially would have washed with us today."" Grenfell United expressed concern at the report's finding that the LFB were ""at risk of not learning the lessons from Grenfell"", adding that firefighters were ""let down by their training, procedures, equipment and leadership"". Other issues highlighted in the report included: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" In the House of Commons, MPs held a minutes' silence to remember victims of the fire, before a debate on the inquiry. This video can not be played ""No words... will ever make good the loss suffered"" - Johnson, May and Corbyn responded to the report Boris Johnson told MPs that survivors and the bereaved had been ""overlooked and ignored"" before the fire and ""shamefully failed"" afterwards. He said the government planned to name companies who were failing to replace unsafe cladding on their buildings, adding: ""Too many building owners have not acted responsibly."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response had been ""too slow and not strong enough on every front"", from rehousing the survivors to replacing Grenfell-style cladding. Eight out of 10 buildings residential blocks have still not had their cladding replaced, he said. The second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. This video can not be played What do survivors and bereaved families want from the inquiry? While this was not the focus of the first phase, the report found there was ""compelling evidence"" external walls of the building failed to comply with building regulations and ""actively promoted"" the spread of fire. It said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a ""source of fuel"". Grenfell United said the second phase of the inquiry ""must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment [of the building] lies"", with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and the companies involved facing ""serious questions"".

Other issues highlighted in the report included: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" In the House of Commons, MPs held a minutes' silence to remember victims of the fire, before a debate on the inquiry. This video can not be played ""No words... will ever make good the loss suffered"" - Johnson, May and Corbyn responded to the report Boris Johnson told MPs that survivors and the bereaved had been ""overlooked and ignored"" before the fire and ""shamefully failed"" afterwards. He said the government planned to name companies who were failing to replace unsafe cladding on their buildings, adding: ""Too many building owners have not acted responsibly."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response had been ""too slow and not strong enough on every front"", from rehousing the survivors to replacing Grenfell-style cladding. Eight out of 10 buildings residential blocks have still not had their cladding replaced, he said. The second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. This video can not be played What do survivors and bereaved families want from the inquiry? While this was not the focus of the first phase, the report found there was ""compelling evidence"" external walls of the building failed to comply with building regulations and ""actively promoted"" the spread of fire. It said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a ""source of fuel"". Grenfell United said the second phase of the inquiry ""must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment [of the building] lies"", with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and the companies involved facing ""serious questions"".

"Brexit deal means âÂ£70bn hit to UK by 2029'The UK economy will be 3.5% smaller than if it had stayed in the EU, claims a new study.BusinessComments","Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will leave the UK Â£70bn worse off than if it had remained in the EU, a study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has found. It concluded that GDP would be 3.5% lower in 10 years' time under the deal. The independent forecaster's outlook is one of the first assessments of how the economy will fare under the new deal. But the Treasury said it plans on a 'more ambitious' agreement with the EU than 'NIESR is basing its findings on'. A spokesman said: ""We are aiming to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union, which is more ambitious than the standard free trade deal that NIESR has based its findings on."" NIESR said approval of the prime minister's deal ""would reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome, but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU"". Despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ""hinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would be if the UK stayed in the EU,"" NIESR said. ""We estimate that, in the long run, the economy would be 3.5% smaller with the deal compared to continued EU membership,"" it added. The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa May's deal of last year. Her deal would have reduced the size of the economy by 3% over the same period, NIESR said. Founded in 1938, NIESR has no party political ties and is the UK's oldest independent economic research institute. A year ago, it conducted a study commissioned by the People's Votewhich said GDP would be 3.9% lower by 2030. Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney welcomed the new Brexit deal, saying it was a ""net economic positive"" as it ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"". However, the governor said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated with the EU meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the UK economyas the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor Mrs May. Chancellor Sajid Javid has refused to recalculate Treasury assessments on the impact of the government's Brexit deal, saying it is ""self-evidently in our economic interest"". NIESR's study modelled different Brexit scenarios against a baseline of the UK staying in the EU. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, it said GDP would be 5.6% lower than if the UK remained in the EU. The government would dearly love to compare its agreement to the prospect of no deal. On that basis, Boris Johnson's renegotiation looks better - on standard economic models such as those deployed by the respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research. ""New deal versus no deal"" was the argument put to MPs when the Prime Minister was still trying to pass his deal. It was the position of the Chancellor, when he refused to publish his own version of such an analysis saying it was ""self-evidently"" better. But we are now in a different situation. The Prime Minister's deal is being put to the electorate versus a remain option or a different, far softer form of Brexit. Crucially, NIESR calculates that the Johnson renegotiation leads to a slightly worse economic outcome than Theresa May's deal which it replaces, as the Bank of England Governor hinted to me earlier this month. What is driving these results? The new deal creates more distance from the European Union economy, with more regulatory barriers to trade. Unlike May's deal, there could be checks on the origin of parts in the car industry, for example. The overall impact of these extra barriers outweighs the benefit from extra certainty of ""getting Brexit done"". Individual businesses may well disagree. But the Treasury itself has chosen not to issue its own version of analysis such as this, even though it has the capacity to do so. If the terms of trade with the EU remained unchanged, but ""chronic uncertainty"" persisted, GDP would be 2% lower. ""The economic outlook is clouded by significant economic and political uncertainty and depends critically on the United Kingdom's trading relationships after Brexit,"" NIESR said. ""Domestic economic weakness is further amplified by slowing global demand."" According to NIESR, the effects of Brexit on the UK economy are already being felt. ""The economy is estimated to be 2.5% smaller now than it would otherwise have been as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote,"" it said. Correction 17th January 2020: An earlier version of this story said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, NIESR forecast that the economy would shrink by 5.6%. This has been amended to make clear that the study said that GDP would be 5.6% lower than if the UK had remained in the EU.

Clutha report blames pilot's 'failure' for crash,"This video can not be played New footage from the Crown Office shows the aftermath of the helicopter crash An inquiry into the Clutha helicopter crash has found that the pilot ""took a chance"" and ignored low fuel warnings. Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull said the tragedy happened because Captain David Traill had ignored the five warnings he received during the flight. He said that was a ""conscious decision"" which had ""fatal consequences"" for the 10 people who died. The police helicopter crashed into the roof of the busy Glasgow bar at 22:22 on 29 November 2013. The tragedy claimed the lives of the pilot, his two crew members and seven customers in the pub. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker Those who died were Capt Traill, 51;  PC Tony Collins, 43; PC Kirsty Nelis, 36, and customers Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44. Another 31 people were injured. Mr O'Prey's father Ian said he was ""really angry"" at the inquiry's findings and that Capt Traill had been made ""a fall guy"". The Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the report and how ""brutal"" it had been towards Capt Traill. He said questions remained over the reasons why the pilot had ignored the low fuel warnings. What we know about the minutes before the tragedy Clutha crash inquiry: The key questions During the fatal accident inquiry, Sheriff Turnbull heard testimony from families, experts and eyewitnesses. In his findings,external, he said there was ""no doubt"" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines ""flamed out"" due to a lack of fuel. The fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on. ""The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?"" said Sheriff Turnbull. ""The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received."" This video can not be played Clutha helicopter crash: how the events unfolded He said the accident would not have happened if the pilot had followed the normal procedure for dealing with low fuel warnings. The Pilot's Checklist stipulated that he should land the aircraft within 10 minutes of a fuel warning. The sheriff described Capt Traill's failure to follow that procedure as ""inexplicable"". He said: ""Capt Traill took a chance that the low fuel warnings he received were erroneous. ""That was a conscious decision on his part. It was a decision that had fatal consequences for 10 people."" Sheriff Turnbull also said that the Eurocopter EC135, manufactured by Airbus, should have had a visible and audible warning which would activate when both fuel transfer pumps had been switched off. The pumps, which were both switched off during the flight, supplied fuel from the main tank to the helicopter's twin engines. Sheriff Turnbull said: ""The circumstances of the accident are so unusual that it is improbable they will be repeated, even without the introduction of the safety actions taken since the accident."" He added that the tragedy ""changed forever the lives of many people"" and praised the dignity of those who attended the 32-day inquiry. More than 100 people were inside the bar at the time of the crash Sheriff Turnbull noted it was ""surprising"" that it took two years fromthe 2015 publication of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) report on the crashto confirm that there would be no criminal proceedings. He added: ""It took far too long to lodge a notice of inquiry in this case."" Sheriff Turnbull also said the Crown Office's Helicopter Incidents Investigation Team were ""not sufficiently resourced"" to enable the FAI to start sooner. He added that an FAI into the deaths caused by theSumburgh helicopter crashin August 2013 was still to be held. A Crown Office spokesperson said: ""This was an exceptionally complex and challenging investigation and the Crown acknowledges that the time taken from the tragedy occurring to convening the inquiry was longer than desirable, and that this compounded the distress suffered by bereaved relatives."" The spokesperson said additional funding had been made available to recruit additional staff, and that improvements were being made. A spokesman for the aircraft's manufacturer, Airbus Helicopters, said it was ""deeply saddened by this tragic accident and the heavy loss of life"". ""We took immediate action to understand the root cause and we have taken note of the findings of both the AAIB and FAI,"" he said. ""The safety of our fleet remains our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything possible to ensure the safe operation of our helicopters."" 29 November 2013: A police helicopter crashes onto the Clutha bar in Glasgow,killing 10 people 9 December 2013:AAIB preliminary reportfinds no evidence of a ""major"" engine or gearbox failure, and says there was 95 litres of fuel on board the aircraft 14 February 2014: An AAIB special report findsboth engines ""flamed out""but does not pinpoint the cause 23 October 2015: The AAIB's final report finds the main cause of accident to bemismanagement of the fuel system by the pilot 24 November 2017:Fatal accident inquiry announced 8 April 2019:Fatal accident inquiry beginsat Hampden Stadium in Glasgow Clutha: How the events unfolded.

University appoints history of slavery professor,"Professor Otele's doctoral area of specialisation was European colonial and post-colonial history The University of Bristol has appointed its first Professor of the History of Slavery. Professor Olivette Otele, the UK's first black female history professor, will take up the new role in January. One of her tasks will be to look at the university's and Bristol's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. She said she wanted that research project to be ""a landmark in the way Britain examines, acknowledges and teaches the history of enslavement"". Much of Bristol's prestige and wealth in the 17th Century came as a result of slave traders such as Edward Colston, whose legacy can still be seen on the city's streets, memorials and buildings. Professor Otele, who lives in Newport in Wales, became the UK's first black female history professor when she was awarded a professorship and a chair in history by Bath Spa University in October last year. Speaking about her new appointment, she said: ""I hope to bring together Bristolians from all communities, and scholars, artists and educators who are willing to contribute to a stronger and fairer society. ""I want students to see me as a facilitator of a dialogue that needs to take place and that is about the role of the University of Bristol in the transatlantic slave trade."" In 1750 Bristol ships transported 8,000 of the 20,000 slaves sent to the Americas Her new job will include responsibility for working with staff, students and communities in Bristol to help the university better understand its past and use that knowledge to shape its future. Exhibit reveals 'empowering' slave trade stories The awkward questions about slavery from US tourists Are British slavery victims being failed in the UK? Provost and deputy vice-chancellor Judith Squires said the University of Bristol was ""proud to be appointing someone of Professor Otele's experience and standing"". ""As an institution founded in 1909, we are not a direct beneficiary of the slave trade, but we fully acknowledge that we financially benefited indirectly via philanthropic support from families who had made money from businesses involved in the transatlantic slave trade,"" Professor Squires said. ""This new role provides us with a unique and important opportunity to interrogate our history, working with staff, students and local communities to explore the university's historical links to slavery and to debate how we should best respond to our past in order to shape our future as an inclusive university community.""

Peugeot owner in merger talks with Fiat Chrysler,"PSA Group, the French owner of Peugeot, is set to announce a merger with its US-Italian rival Fiat Chrysler shortly, reports say. A deal between the two carmakers would create a business with a combined market value of nearly $50bn (Â£39.9bn). This is Fiat Chrysler's second attempt at a merger this year after it pulled out of an agreement with Renault in June. Fiat Chrysler shares jumped more than 9% in trading on Wednesday. Sources have told Reuters, AFP and the Wall Street Journal that the merger could be announced as early as Thursday. The potential merger would face significant political and financial hurdles. Discussions remain in the early stages and there is no guarantee of a final deal. However, if the two companies do combine, PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares is expected to lead the enlarged group. PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares may lead the combined group John Elkann, Fiat Chrysler's chairman and the head of Italy's Agnelli industrial dynasty, which controls the business, would retain the same position at the new company. The talks come months after a proposed tie-up between Fiat Chrysler and French carmaker Renault collapsed with Renault in June. Mr Elkann broke off talks after French government officials intervened and pushed for Renault first to resolve tensions with its Japanese partner Nissan. Fiat Chrysler withdraws bid for Renault After ditching the proposed merger Mr Elkann confirmed the group's bid to pursue an alternative deal. Car makers face huge investments for electrification, emission reduction and autonomous driving technologies, which gives them an incentive to merge. A merger of the two groups would create one of the world biggest car makers, and bring a number of brands under one roof including Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Jeep, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. Morningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert said that the total sales of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, including China joint venture partners, were 8.7 million vehicles last year. This would rank the eventual combined group fourth behind Volkswagen, Toyota and the Renault-Nissan Alliance, each at more than 10 million units. ""We view the combination of these two companies as reasonable given global competition, high capital intensity, and industry disruption from electrified powertrain as well as autonomous technologies, Mr Hilgert said. Fiat Chrysler had described its bid for Renault as a ""transformative"" proposal that would create a global automotive leader.

Hundreds of koalas feared dead in wildfire,"Koala numbers have suffered significant decline in recent decades Hundreds of koalas are feared to have died in an Australian bushfire, animal rescuers say. The blaze burnt through 2,000 hectares of bush containing a prime koala breeding ground in New South Wales, around 250 miles north of Sydney. Rescuers said the deaths were particularly tragic as the koalas were a diverse breed, with one expert calling it a ""national tragedy"". The native species has suffered significant decline in recent decades. Monitoring groups say koala numbers are falling, with as few as 43,000 left in the wild. Their decline has been blamed on habitat loss, disease, dog attacks and climate change. The marsupial is listed as ""vulnerable"",externalby Australia's Environment Ministry. Koala rescuer Cheyne Flanagan said the large blaze near Port Macquarie had engulfed a sanctuary where hundreds of genetically diverse koalas lived. ""Because it was of such high intensity, I think that the amount of deaths will be very high, unfortunately,"" Ms Flanagan told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Australia pledges cash to save koalas Cuddly koala's genes could halt sex disease Koala conservation scheme 'working despite death' Up to 30 homes destroyed in Australian bushfires She said rescuers feared ""carnage"", and had not been able to look for survivors because the fire was still burning. Koalas are common wildlife fatalities in bushfires. The tree-dwelling mammals usually cope by climbing to the top of trees and curling into a ball. ""If the fire goes through quickly and just singes their fur, they are fine and the fur will grow back,"" Sue Ashton of the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital told news agency AFP. But if the fire continues to burn up the tree ""they'll perish"", she said. ""It's a national tragedy because this koala population is so unique.""

Australia's 'backpacker tax' ruled invalid,"This video can not be played Backpacker Alex Sinchak: ""A little bit of a win"" Australia has used a so-called ""backpacker tax"" to illegally tax foreign workers from eight countries, according to a landmark ruling. In 2017, the government imposed a controversial 15% tax rate on two visa categories for working holiday-makers. But a court on Wednesday found the levy was in breach of existing treaties with the UK, US, Germany, Finland, Chile, Japan, Norway and Turkey. Tens of thousands of foreign nationals may be owed money, local media said. The Australian Tax Office said it was considering whether to appeal against the ruling. The levy was challenged by an international tax company on behalf of a British tourist, Catherine Addy, who worked in Australia between 2015 and 2017. She welcomed the ruling, telling ABC News: ""I think it is wrong that foreigners should be taxed more harshly than Australians when they are doing the same work."" About 150,000 foreigners travel to Australia every year on working holiday visas, with many finding work in the farming and hospitality industries. The Federal Court of Australia said the tax could not be applied to citizens of those eight countries who had been employed on category 417 or 462 visas. How the tax was imposed after controversy Australia backpacker exploitation 'endemic' This was due to treaties which required Australia to tax those foreign nationals in the same way as local workers. Unlike foreign workers in Australia, locals do not pay any tax until their yearly income exceeds A$18,200 (Â£9,700; $12,500). In contrast, foreign workers on 417 or 462 visas are taxed 15% on the first $37,000 they earn. About 150,000 foreigners travel to Australia annually on working holiday visas In his ruling, Justice John Logan described the tax as ""a disguised form of discrimination based on nationality"". During her working holiday, Ms Addy lived mainly in a house share in Sydney's Earlwood, a point that proved to be crucial to the case. This meant she was considered a ""resident"" for tax purposes in Australia, while other foreign nationals who move around may be considered ""non-residents"". The ruling may force the government to repay hundreds of millions of dollars in total, local media reported. Taxback.com, the accounting firm that organised the lawsuit, said it was clear the ""backpacker tax"" breached several international agreements when it was introduced in 2016. ""It also damaged Australia's reputation as a working holiday destination,"" Joanna Murphy, the firm's CEO, said. Many foreign nationals find work in the farming and hospitality industries in Australia The Australian Tax Office sought to play down the ruling, saying it would have no impact for most working holidaymakers. ""This decision only affects the tax rates applying to a minority of working holiday-makers who are also residents, and only those from countries affected by a similar clause in the double tax agreement with their home country,"" it said. Colin Mathews, 25, from Cornwall, lived and worked in Australia between October 2018 and May 2019, with his fiancÃ©e Emily. When he returned from Australia, Mr Mathews said he had 15% deducted from wages he earned at a call centre. Colin Mathews said Australians ""couldn't believe we had to pay extra tax"" ""Local Australians couldn't believe we had to pay extra tax,"" Mr Mathews told the BBC. ""I'm not averse to paying tax - I was using Australian services - but it should be on the same terms."" Oliver Bastock, from Derbyshire, is currently living in Melbourne and works in marketing, after moving to Australia in June 2018. He said the tax system was confusing, adding he had no idea ""why you don't get anything back"". Are backpackers worried about Australia?

Peugeot owner 'in merger talks with Fiat Chrysler',"PSA Group, the French owner of Peugeot, is set to announce a merger with its US-Italian rival Fiat Chrysler shortly, reports say. A deal between the two carmakers would create a business with a combined market value of nearly $50bn (Â£39.9bn). This is Fiat Chrysler's second attempt at a merger this year after it pulled out of an agreement with Renault in June. Fiat Chrysler shares jumped more than 9% in trading on Wednesday. Sources have told Reuters, AFP and the Wall Street Journal that the merger could be announced as early as Thursday. The potential merger would face significant political and financial hurdles. Discussions remain in the early stages and there is no guarantee of a final deal. However, if the two companies do combine, PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares is expected to lead the enlarged group. PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares may lead the combined group John Elkann, Fiat Chrysler's chairman and the head of Italy's Agnelli industrial dynasty, which controls the business, would retain the same position at the new company. The talks come months after a proposed tie-up between Fiat Chrysler and French carmaker Renault collapsed with Renault in June. Mr Elkann broke off talks after French government officials intervened and pushed for Renault first to resolve tensions with its Japanese partner Nissan. Fiat Chrysler withdraws bid for Renault After ditching the proposed merger Mr Elkann confirmed the group's bid to pursue an alternative deal. Car makers face huge investments for electrification, emission reduction and autonomous driving technologies, which gives them an incentive to merge. A merger of the two groups would create one of the world biggest car makers, and bring a number of brands under one roof including Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Jeep, Opel, Peugeot and Vauxhall. Morningstar senior equity analyst Richard Hilgert said that the total sales of Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, including China joint venture partners, were 8.7 million vehicles last year. This would rank the eventual combined group fourth behind Volkswagen, Toyota and the Renault-Nissan Alliance, each at more than 10 million units. ""We view the combination of these two companies as reasonable given global competition, high capital intensity, and industry disruption from electrified powertrain as well as autonomous technologies, Mr Hilgert said. Fiat Chrysler had described its bid for Renault as a ""transformative"" proposal that would create a global automotive leader.

WhatsApp sues Israeli firm over hacking claims,"Facebook-owned WhatsApp has filed a lawsuit against Israel's NSO Group, alleging the firm was behind cyber-attacks that infected devices with malicious software. WhatsApp accuses the company of sending malware to roughly 1,400 mobile phones for the purposes of surveillance. Users affected included journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, and diplomats. NSO Group, which makes software for surveillance, disputed the allegations. In a court filing,external, WhatsApp said NSO Group ""developed their malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted on target devices"". It said NSO Group created various WhatsApp accounts and caused the malicious code to be transmitted over the WhatsApp servers in April and May. ""We believe this attack targeted at least 100 members of civil society, which is an unmistakable pattern of abuse,""WhatsApp said in a statement,external. The affected users had numbers from several countries, including Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Mexico, according to the lawsuit. WhatsApp said it is seeking a permanent injunction banning NSO from using its service. The firm, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014, said it was the first time an encrypted messaging provider had taken legal action of this kind. WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are end-to-end encrypted. This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device. WhatsApp discovers surveillance attack Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran NSO Group said it would fight the allegations. ""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,"" the company said in a statement to the BBC.

Democrats unveil next stage of impeachment bid,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said a vote on the resolution would take place on Thursday Democrats in the US House of Representatives have published a resolution setting out the next steps in their impeachment efforts against President Donald Trump. The motion sets out a more public phase of the inquiry and hands the lead role in hearings to the chairman of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff. The House, controlled by the Democrats, will vote on the measure on Thursday. A White House spokeswoman said the resolution was an ""illegitimate sham"". So far, hearings have been held behind closed doors. This vote to make the impeachment process public is about the procedure, and not a ballot on whether or not to impeach the president. Republicans have criticised Democrats for the closed hearings up to this point, in which Republican lawmakers have also taken part. But Democrats insist they were needed to gather evidence ahead of the public stage of the inquiry, and deny allegations they have been secretive. The Trump impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means President Trump is accused of trying to pressure Ukraine into investigating unsubstantiated corruption claims against his political rival, Joe Biden, and his son who worked with Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Mr Trump denies wrongdoing and calls the impeachment inquiry a ""witch hunt"". On Tuesday, the impeachment inquiry heard from Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a White House official who had monitored a phone call on 25 July between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That call sparked a whistleblower complaint and led to the impeachment probe. Col Vindman said he was ""concerned"" by the call as he ""did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a US citizen"". Some details of the call were omitted from the official transcript, despite his attempts to have them included, Col Vindman added, according to US media citing sources. The eight-page document sets out a two-stage process for the next phase of the inquiry. In the first, the House Intelligence Committee will continue its investigations and hold public hearings. It will have the right to make public transcripts of depositions taken in private. This video can not be played Trump impeachment: Last week was the most dramatic so far In the second phase, a public report on the findings will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee which will conduct its own proceedings and report on ""such resolutions, articles of impeachment, or other recommendations as it deems proper"". President Trump's lawyers will be allowed to take part in the Judiciary Committee stage. Republicans on the committees will be able to subpoena documents or witnesses - although they could still be blocked as both committees are Democrat-controlled. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said a House vote on the resolution would take place on Thursday. She has previously said such a vote is not required under the US Constitution. ""The resolution put forward by Speaker Pelosi confirms that House Democrats' impeachment has been an illegitimate sham from the start as it lacked any proper authorisation by a House vote,"" said White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, speaking before the resolution was unveiled, said the entire process was a ""sham."" Leading Democrat Adam Schiff will oversee public hearings in the next stage Referring to the closed-door meetings and depositions he said: ""You can't put the genie back in the bottle. Due process starts at the beginning."" In an opening statement released ahead of Tuesday's closed-door testimony, Col Vindman said his worries began at a 10 July meeting between US and Ukrainian national security officials. The meeting was cut short by then-National Security Adviser John Bolton when talk arose of Ukraine opening investigations for the White House, Col Vindman said. Decorated veteran Alexander Vindman is a Ukraine specialist within the US National Security Council US ambassador Gordon Sondland had brought up ""Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure [a] meeting with the president"", which alarmed Mr Bolton and Col Vindman. At a debriefing afterwards, Col Vindman said the ambassador had again ""emphasised the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma"". ""I stated to Ambassador Sondland that his statements were inappropriate, that the request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security."" Following this incident, Col Vindman reported his concerns to the National Security Council's lead counsel. He reported his objections again after the 25 July call. Col Vindman said he attempted to edit a White House transcript of the call to include some missing details, US media cite sources as saying. While some amendments were accepted, other omissions remained, including a reference to Burisma by Mr Zelensky, and Mr Trump alleging there were recordings of Mr Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine,the New York Times,externalandWashington Post,externalreport. President Trump has previously described the transcript as ""exact"". As the testimony was due to begin, Mr Trump suggested Col Vindman was a ""Never Trumper witness"" in a tweet. Other conservatives have also attacked Col Vindman's credibility because he was born in Ukraine - though some have since defended the veteran officer. Allow Twitter content?

Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney denounced these gibes as ""shameful"", while Senator Mitt Romney called the criticism ""absurd"" and ""disgusting"". ""This is a decorated American soldier and he should be given the respect that his service to our country demands,"" he said. But many other Republicans stood by Mr Trump. House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy said Col Vindman was ""wrong"". ""Nothing in that phone call is impeachable,"" he said. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted and removed. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

Where do parties stand on Brexit?,"The government's Brexit legislation is on hold as the UK gears up for the general election on 12 December. But where do the parties stand on Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants the UK to leave the European Union (EU) with the revised deal he agreed. He says that with a majority Conservative government,he would start the process to ""get Brexit done"" on day one,externalof the new Parliament. He previously said the UK would leave on 31 October ""do or die"". However, Mr Johnson was forced to write a Brexit extension letter to the EU, after MPs failed to approve his revised deal. Mr Johnson secured changes to the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May. It includes scrappingthe controversial Irish backstopand replacing it witha new customs arrangement. Boris Johnson's revised Brexit deal has not yet been approved by the UK Parliament Brexit left the Conservative Party heavily divided, with 21 MPs expelled for failing to follow the government's line. Ten were later welcomed back. What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal? Key Conservative Party manifesto promises explained If it wins the election, Labour wants to renegotiate Mr Johnson's Brexit deal and put it to another public vote. It says it will achieve this within six months. Labour says its referendumwould be a choice between a ""sensible"" Leave option versus Remain.,external Under its Leave option, Labour says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union, and retain a ""close"" single market relationship. This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. If a referendum was held,Mr Corbyn has said he would remain neutralif he was prime minister ""so I can credibly carry out the results"". Just like the Conservatives, Labour has had to deal with internal divisions over its Brexit policy. More than 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn in June, saying another public vote would be ""toxic to our bedrock Labour voters"". While Labour's election strategy early on was to emphasise that the vote was about more than Brexit, it is changing its focus. The message now is thatLabour's leadership is not opposing Brexit by opposing Mr Johnson's deal- it wants to find what it believes is a better one. What is Labour's Brexit plan? Key Labour Party manifesto promises explained The SNP is pro-Remain and wants the UK to stay a member of the EU. It has been campaigning for another referendum,externalon Brexit. Alternatively,it wants Article 50 revokedif it is the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is ""catastrophic"" The SNP's ultimate objective is for an independent Scotland that is a full member of the EU. SNP launch: Scotland's Remain party? The Liberal Democrats have pledged to cancel Brexit if they win power at the general election. Party leader Jo Swinson says a Lib Dem majority government would cancel Brexit The policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference. If the Lib Dems do not win a majority, they would support another referendum. Leader Jo Swinson says thatstopping Brexit would free up Â£50bn, over five years, to spend on public services. She says that so-called ""Remain bonus"" would pay for 20,000 new teachers, extra money for schools and to help support low-paid workers. Lib Dems promise Â£50bn 'windfall' from stopping Brexit Key Lib Dems manifesto promises explained The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had an agreement with the Conservatives whereby it lent it support in the Commons during the last Parliament. However,while the DUP wants the UK to leave the EU,,externalit opposes elements of Mr Johnson's Brexit deal which relate to Northern Ireland,. The DUP is unhappy with the revised Brexit deal At its manifesto launch,the party said it will seek further changes to the dealif he is still prime minister after the election. The deal includes special arrangements for Northern Ireland. One gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a majority vote on how customs arrangements would work after Brexit. The DUP wants such a vote to be taken on a cross-community basis, rather than a straight majority. Johnson 'should seek Brexit deal changes' This party is made up of MPs who left the Conservatives and Labour, in part because of their positions on Brexit. It backs another referendum, or ""People's Vote"",,externaland wants the UK to remain in the EU. The party backs remaining in the EU, despite Wales voting Leave in the referendum.It wants a further referendum,externaland to Remain. In a bid to get as many pro-Remain MPs as possible into Parliament,Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and Greens have agreed an electoral pactin 11 of the 40 seats in Wales.

Peanut-allergy therapy 'protection not a cure',"Treating peanut allergy with regular exposure to small amounts of the food is effective - but only if a patient stays on the therapy, a study suggests. King's College London scientists looked at the underlying behaviour of patients' cells - and found it did not change. They say that shows immunotherapy offers ""protection but not a cure"" for peanut allergies. Allergy UK said that, even so, the treatment was a ""positive step"". It is estimated about one in 50 UK children has a peanut allergy. There is no cure. The only way most people can manage it is by trying to avoid peanuts - which can be difficult and restrictive. In immunotherapy, people are given a small amount of the substance they are allergic to - in this case peanut - every day. Peanut allergy treatment 'in sight' Why the world is becoming more allergic Peanut allergy: Could treatment change Wrexham boy's life? It works by prompting the immune system to produce antibodies that reduce the body's allergic response, so if someone is accidentally exposed to a small amount of peanut, they can tolerate it and are less at risk of a serious reaction. More than 100 people in the UK are taking part in trials of the treatment, though it is not yet available on the NHS. In this study researchers, from King's and Evelina London Children's Hospital, wanted to see how cells behaved, so they could see if patients were still allergic and so needed to continue treatment or if they were no longer allergic and could eat peanuts without worrying. In the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, they tested samples from 14 patients before and after treatment. They found if the antibodies were removed, the allergic cells reacted in the same way as they had done before treatment. Peanuts are one of a whole host of allergic triggers Dr Alexandra Santos, who led the study, said: ""Definitive treatments for peanut and other food allergies are highly needed. ""Currently, immunotherapy is the only treatment option we can offer peanut allergic patients. ""The question was whether the immunotherapy could switch off the allergic response. ""Some patients and parents hoped they would be able to eat the food but this will only be able to give them protection against accidental exposure."" She said it was useful to be able to tell people the protection would continue only while they were on the immunotherapy. ""For example, teens aren't particularly consistent,"" she said. ""They can stop taking it, meaning they are more at risk of having accidental exposure."" Allergy UK clinical services head Amena Warner said: ""Fear of a life-threatening severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), anxiety and stress associated with managing a peanut allergy has a serious impact of quality of life. ""Having new treatments to address risks of accidental exposure by tolerating small amounts of peanut protein can bring hope to those affected by peanut allergy. ""This may not be a cure (hopefully one day one will be found) but immunotherapy is a positive step in providing a treatment to give a level of protection where previously one had not existed.""

Meanwhile, peers have approved the legislation needed to bring about the 12 December election. The House of Lords passed the early election bill - which wasapproved by MPs on Tuesday- in less than four hours, with no changes. In their final encounter in Parliament before the election, the two leaders exchanged barbs over their political values and disputed their parties' respective records on the NHS. The Labour leader accused the PM - who he has challenged to a one-on-one TV debate - of running down the health service, saying cuts to funding had contributed to rising waiting times for cancer treatment and operations.

The Lib Dems say they will fight their most ambitious election campaign ever Speaking outside Parliament, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said her party was ""on the up"" and had a larger war chest at its disposal than ever before going into an election. ""Make no mistake, I stand ready to take on Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn as a candidate to be prime minister,"" she said. Twitter bans all political advertising ""We have a bold vision to stop Brexit and build a better, brighter future for the country."" For the Scottish National Party, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said an election was anopportunity for the country to hold another independence referendum. ""A win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland's right to choose our own future,"" she said. But the Scottish Conservatives claimed voting for their party would keep Scotland in the UK. Meanwhile, an attempt by Boris Johnson to unite his party by re-admitting 10 Tory Brexit rebels has been hit bya row over the party's refusal to give the whip backto Amber Rudd - the former home secretary who has said she is standing down as an MP. The smaller parties are already talking about striking deals with each other, which could see candidates standing aside in areas where their Remain-supporting rivals have a better chance of winning. Ms Swinson said there were a ""small number of seats"" where ""arrangements"" could be struck with other parties to give an anti-Brexit candidate the best chance of winning. Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley told BBC Breakfast it was ""no secret"" that the Greens were ""talking to the Lib Dems and Plaid"" but ""nothing has been finalised"".

Plaid leader Adam Price said his party was ""open to working with others to secure our European future"". Details of which candidates are standing and where will be published at 17:00 GMT on 14 November - as will information about the location of polling stations. The party leaders are also facing questions about whether they would form a coalition, if the election resulted in another hung Parliament. Asked if she would join forces with Labour or the Conservatives, Jo Swinson said: ""I can't be clearer - neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn is fit to be prime minister.""

PM: Grenfell fire report 'gives victims the truth',"This video can not be played Grenfell families: 'There was a serious lack of common sense' Survivors and bereaved relatives of the Grenfell Tower fire have called for London Fire Brigade chief Dany Cotton to resign - after ahighly critical report,externalfrom the inquiry into the blaze. The report said some of the 72 people who were killed could have been saved if the building was evacuated sooner. The Grenfell United group said it was ""heartbreaking"" to read, and some relatives want senior staff prosecuted. The LFB said it was ""disappointed"" by some of the criticism of individuals. The inquiry, which examined what happened on the night of 14 June 2017, concluded that ""many more lives"" could have been saved if the advice to residents to ""stay put"" had been abandoned earlier than 02:35 BST. It said London Fire Brigade's preparations for such a fire were ""gravely inadequate"". Survivors called for senior fire brigade staff to be sacked and prosecuted, saying that the brigade is ""in the hands of people that are incapable of their jobs"". Grenfell: Seven key points from the report What happened at Grenfell Tower? Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Nazanin Aghlani, who lost two family members in the fire, said: ""If a fire happened tonight the same thing would happen again."" The brigade's commissioner Dany Cotton, who is due to retire in April 2020, expressed her ""deepest sorrow"" that firefighters had not been able to save those who died, but said the inquiry had no expert evidence to support its conclusion about evacuating the tower. This video can not be played LFB chief Dany Cotton: ""We are truly sorry we couldn't save everyone's life that night"" It would not have been possible or safe to evacuate residents through a ""narrow, smoke-clogged stairwell"" with the number of firefighters who would have been available for that task said Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. The report also concluded that cladding surrounding the tower did not comply with building regulations and was the main reason for the fire's ""shocking"" spread. Campaign group Grenfell United said the report showed ""the immediate and real dangers"" of ""highly combustible cladding and insulation"". ""Lives are at risk and the government need to treat this as a national emergency,"" the group said. The inquiry made 46 recommendations, including improvements in training for fire brigade staff and the development of national guidelines for evacuating high-rise buildings. Grenfell United called for the recommendations to be implemented in full, saying they would save lives. The report condemned the brigade for""serious shortcomings"" and systemic failuresin its response to the fire. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a ""major omission"" by the brigade and more lives could have been saved had the ""stay-put"" policy been abandoned sooner. Grenfell United responded: ""It is heartbreaking to read that more of our loved ones could have been saved that night if the building was evacuated earlier."" This video can not be played âFire chief should step down today,' relatives of those that died in the fire say At an emotional news conference, relatives of 20 victims of the fire called for an overhaul of the brigade, saying its leadership should resign and face prosecution. Sid-Ali Atmani, who escaped from the 15th floor, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""Those in command had [the] opportunity to save everyone in that tower - we're talking about two hours."" Karim Mussilhy, vice-chairman of Grenfell United, told the BBC he blamed the fire brigade leadership, not the firefighters. ""Dany Cotton needs to step down today,"" he said. ""She should not have the luxury to retire early with this Â£2m pot."" But Moyra Samuels of the Justice4Grenfell group said the firefighters were being scapegoated. ""It wasn't the firefighters who put the cladding on the building. The firefighters went into a building that was a deathtrap,"" she said. The report said evidence from Ms Cotton that she would not have changed anything about the brigade's response was ""insensitive"". Ms Cotton said many of the recommendations were welcome and would be ""carefully considered"". She expressed her ""deepest sorrow at not being able to save all those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire"". White doves were released at a memorial service earlier this year to mark two years since the tragedy She added: ""We welcome the chairman's recognition of the courage, commitment and bravery of firefighters on the night, but we are disappointed at some of the criticism of individual staff members who were placed in completely unprecedented circumstances and faced the most unimaginable conditions while trying to save the lives of others."" However, Natasha Elcock, chairwoman of Grenfell United who was rescued with her six-year-old daughter from the 11th floor, said Dany Cotton's statement was ""too little too late"". ""She stood up in the inquiry, in a room full of bereaved and survivors and said there's nothing she would do to change that night,"" she told the BBC. ""If she'd expressed that sorrow that day in that room, that potentially would have washed with us today."" Grenfell United expressed concern at the report's finding that the LFB were ""at risk of not learning the lessons from Grenfell"", adding that firefighters were ""let down by their training, procedures, equipment and leadership"". Other issues highlighted in the report included: A lack of training in how to ""recognise the need for an evacuation or how to organise one"" Incident commanders ""of relatively junior rank"" being unable to change strategy Control room officers lacking training on when to advise callers to evacuate An assumption that crews would reach callers, resulting in ""assurances which were not well founded"" Communication between the control room and those on the ground being ""improvised, uncertain and prone to error"" A lack of an organised way to share information within the control room, meaning officers had ""no overall picture of the speed or pattern of fire spread"" In the House of Commons, MPs held a minutes' silence to remember victims of the fire, before a debate on the inquiry. This video can not be played ""No words... will ever make good the loss suffered"" - Johnson, May and Corbyn responded to the report Boris Johnson told MPs that survivors and the bereaved had been ""overlooked and ignored"" before the fire and ""shamefully failed"" afterwards. He said the government planned to name companies who were failing to replace unsafe cladding on their buildings, adding: ""Too many building owners have not acted responsibly."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government's response had been ""too slow and not strong enough on every front"", from rehousing the survivors to replacing Grenfell-style cladding. Eight out of 10 buildings residential blocks have still not had their cladding replaced, he said. The second phase of the inquiry will focus on wider circumstances of the fire, including the design of the building. This video can not be played What do survivors and bereaved families want from the inquiry? While this was not the focus of the first phase, the report found there was ""compelling evidence"" external walls of the building failed to comply with building regulations and ""actively promoted"" the spread of fire. It said the principal reason the flames shot up the building so fiercely was the combustible aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding with polyethylene cores which acted as a ""source of fuel"". Grenfell United said the second phase of the inquiry ""must now focus on where responsibility for the devastating refurbishment [of the building] lies"", with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, the tenant management organisation and the companies involved facing ""serious questions"".

Brexit deal means âÂ£70bn hit a year to UK by 2029',"Boris Johnson's Brexit deal will leave the UK Â£70bn worse off than if it had remained in the EU, a study by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has found. It concluded that GDP would be 3.5% lower in 10 years' time under the deal. The independent forecaster's outlook is one of the first assessments of how the economy will fare under the new deal. But the Treasury said it plans on a 'more ambitious' agreement with the EU than 'NIESR is basing its findings on'. A spokesman said: ""We are aiming to negotiate a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union, which is more ambitious than the standard free trade deal that NIESR has based its findings on."" NIESR said approval of the prime minister's deal ""would reduce the risk of a disorderly outcome, but eliminate the possibility of a closer trading relationship with the EU"". Despite the agreement between the EU and the UK removing uncertainty, customs and regulatory barriers would ""hinder goods and services trade with the continent leaving all regions of the United Kingdom worse off than they would be if the UK stayed in the EU,"" NIESR said. ""We estimate that, in the long run, the economy would be 3.5% smaller with the deal compared to continued EU membership,"" it added. The report also found the proposed free trade deal with the EU was slightly worse for the economy than Theresa May's deal of last year. Her deal would have reduced the size of the economy by 3% over the same period, NIESR said. Founded in 1938, NIESR has no party political ties and is the UK's oldest independent economic research institute. A year ago, it conducted a study commissioned by the People's Votewhich said GDP would be 3.9% lower by 2030. Earlier this month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney welcomed the new Brexit deal, saying it was a ""net economic positive"" as it ""takes away the tail risk of a disorderly Brexit"". However, the governor said that the ""different"" future relationship negotiated with the EU meant it ""remains to be seen"" if overall the deal would be as positive for the UK economyas the deal put forward by Mr Johnson's predecessor Mrs May. Chancellor Sajid Javid has refused to recalculate Treasury assessments on the impact of the government's Brexit deal, saying it is ""self-evidently in our economic interest"". NIESR's study modelled different Brexit scenarios against a baseline of the UK staying in the EU. In the case of a no-deal Brexit, it said GDP would be 5.6% lower than if the UK remained in the EU. The government would dearly love to compare its agreement to the prospect of no deal. On that basis, Boris Johnson's renegotiation looks better - on standard economic models such as those deployed by the respected National Institute of Economic and Social Research. ""New deal versus no deal"" was the argument put to MPs when the Prime Minister was still trying to pass his deal. It was the position of the Chancellor, when he refused to publish his own version of such an analysis saying it was ""self-evidently"" better. But we are now in a different situation. The Prime Minister's deal is being put to the electorate versus a remain option or a different, far softer form of Brexit. Crucially, NIESR calculates that the Johnson renegotiation leads to a slightly worse economic outcome than Theresa May's deal which it replaces, as the Bank of England Governor hinted to me earlier this month. What is driving these results? The new deal creates more distance from the European Union economy, with more regulatory barriers to trade. Unlike May's deal, there could be checks on the origin of parts in the car industry, for example. The overall impact of these extra barriers outweighs the benefit from extra certainty of ""getting Brexit done"". Individual businesses may well disagree. But the Treasury itself has chosen not to issue its own version of analysis such as this, even though it has the capacity to do so. If the terms of trade with the EU remained unchanged, but ""chronic uncertainty"" persisted, GDP would be 2% lower. ""The economic outlook is clouded by significant economic and political uncertainty and depends critically on the United Kingdom's trading relationships after Brexit,"" NIESR said. ""Domestic economic weakness is further amplified by slowing global demand."" According to NIESR, the effects of Brexit on the UK economy are already being felt. ""The economy is estimated to be 2.5% smaller now than it would otherwise have been as a result of the 2016 Brexit vote,"" it said. Correction 17th January 2020: An earlier version of this story said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, NIESR forecast that the economy would shrink by 5.6%. This has been amended to make clear that the study said that GDP would be 5.6% lower than if the UK had remained in the EU.

University appoints history of slavery professorOne of Olivette Otele's first tasks is to look at Bristol's role in the transatlantic slave trade.Bristol,"Professor Otele's doctoral area of specialisation was European colonial and post-colonial history The University of Bristol has appointed its first Professor of the History of Slavery. Professor Olivette Otele, the UK's first black female history professor, will take up the new role in January. One of her tasks will be to look at the university's and Bristol's involvement in the transatlantic slave trade. She said she wanted that research project to be ""a landmark in the way Britain examines, acknowledges and teaches the history of enslavement"". Much of Bristol's prestige and wealth in the 17th Century came as a result of slave traders such as Edward Colston, whose legacy can still be seen on the city's streets, memorials and buildings. Professor Otele, who lives in Newport in Wales, became the UK's first black female history professor when she was awarded a professorship and a chair in history by Bath Spa University in October last year. Speaking about her new appointment, she said: ""I hope to bring together Bristolians from all communities, and scholars, artists and educators who are willing to contribute to a stronger and fairer society. ""I want students to see me as a facilitator of a dialogue that needs to take place and that is about the role of the University of Bristol in the transatlantic slave trade."" In 1750 Bristol ships transported 8,000 of the 20,000 slaves sent to the Americas Her new job will include responsibility for working with staff, students and communities in Bristol to help the university better understand its past and use that knowledge to shape its future. Exhibit reveals 'empowering' slave trade stories The awkward questions about slavery from US tourists Are British slavery victims being failed in the UK? Provost and deputy vice-chancellor Judith Squires said the University of Bristol was ""proud to be appointing someone of Professor Otele's experience and standing"". ""As an institution founded in 1909, we are not a direct beneficiary of the slave trade, but we fully acknowledge that we financially benefited indirectly via philanthropic support from families who had made money from businesses involved in the transatlantic slave trade,"" Professor Squires said. ""This new role provides us with a unique and important opportunity to interrogate our history, working with staff, students and local communities to explore the university's historical links to slavery and to debate how we should best respond to our past in order to shape our future as an inclusive university community.""

Student housing told to fix 'awful' problems,"Students were expecting to move into this building in Portsmouth at the beginning of term The universities minister has told a summit of student-accommodation providers to sort out the ""awful and disappointing"" problems that have seen more than 20 student housing schemes not completed on time. Chris Skidmore summoned housing providers after students had been put into temporary accommodation at the beginning of the autumn term. ""Students can pay significant amounts for their accommodation and it is unacceptable to let them down at a stressful time,"" said the minister. Students in Portsmouth were among those affected, when a private housing block was not completed, leaving about 250 without accommodation. The University of Portsmouth's vice-chancellor, Graham Galbraith, also complained of a lack of scrutiny of the private student-housing sector. Student housing failures 'deeply concerning' Students feel cheated by rise in unfinished housing Bristol students get temporary accommodation in Wales Responding to concerns, Mr Skidmore called a meeting of housing providers, both private and university-owned, along with student representatives and mental health experts. ""Poor accommodation, high living costs and a lack of information can seriously affect student welfare and mental health, so providers must be held to account,"" he said. ""With the number of students expected to rise sharply due to demographic changes in the 2020s, now is the time to prepare and think ahead about how we deliver and regulate student accommodation for the future."" Accommodation is funded from student maintenance loans - which means billions of public spending goes into the student-housing sector. Parents also often contribute to the cost of student accommodation. But there have been concerns this autumn about how this is regulated and how value and quality can be assured. ""Accommodation is a central issue of the student experience and it is the duty of accommodation providers, higher-education institutions and government to think carefully about what needs to happen in the future,"" said Mr Skidmore. Universities UK said student accommodation increasingly involved private-sector organisations. ""It is important that all providers meet high standards, demonstrate value, and are accountable to students,"" said the universities' organisation.
