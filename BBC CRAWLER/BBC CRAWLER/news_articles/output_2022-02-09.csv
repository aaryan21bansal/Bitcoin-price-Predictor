Truckers block vital Canada-US border crossing,"This video can not be played Truckers 'don't have the right to hold us hostage' Truck drivers are blocking a key border crossing between the US and Canada, sparking fears of economic disruption. While limited US-bound traffic is being allowed to cross the Ambassador Bridge in Ontario, Canada-bound lanes from Detroit remain closed. Business associations have called for the bridge to be immediately cleared to ensure the steady flow of goods. The protests across Canada against vaccine rules and Covid restrictions are now two weeks old. Truckers are demonstrating against a rule that requires them to be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border. But the protests have grown to include anger at restrictions and at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government generally. They have mostly centred on the capital, Ottawa, and another border crossing between Montana and Alberta has also been blocked. The closure of the Ambassador Bridge is particularly significant because nearly 30% of annual trade between the US and Canada comes through it. ""I've already heard from automakers and food grocers,"" Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on Tuesday. ""This is really a serious cause for concern"". On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the White House was watching the situation ""very closely"". She noted that authorities were tracking potential disruptions that the blockade could cause to agricultural exports from Michigan to Canada and the movement of workers back and forth across the border. Lorry drivers rallying in solidarity with the demonstrators in Ottawa first blocked the bridge on Monday afternoon. While the bridge was reopened to limited traffic from Canada into the US by Tuesday morning, authorities in Michigan have said that traffic flows into Canada remain blocked. They continue to advise drivers to divert to nearby Port Huron to cross the border. How might Canada's trucker protest end? Patience running thin at truckers' protest in Ottawa Windsor Police told the BBC that no arrests have so far been made in relation to the protests, but between seven and 10 tickets had been issued, primarily for moving violations. ""The Windsor Police Service wants to resolve this situation through the use of diplomacy and negotiation, seeking a solution that is safe and sustainable for our community,"" the police force said in a statement. On Tuesday night, dozens of business associations based on both sides of the border called for a swift re-opening of the bridge, as well as the Alberta-Montana crossing. ""The disruption of the Ambassador Bridge is an attack on the well-being of our citizens and the businesses that employ them,"" a statement from the organisations said. ""As our economies emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, we cannot allow any group to undermine the cross-border trade that supports families on both sides of the border."" Late on Tuesday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that protesters had also blocked the border crossing between Alberta and Montana for the second time in less than a week. Over the weekend, the RCMP said that while most of the protesters have been respectful of officers and followed their directions, a number of investigations have been opened in relation to the blockade at the Alberta border. In Alberta, the province's proof-of-vaccination system expires on Wednesday at midnight. Additionally, from next Monday the province will drop a requirement that students wear masks in schools. Children under 12 will not be required to wear masks anywhere. On Tuesday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said that pandemic-related restrictions had ""disrupted and even destroyed livelihoods"" in the province.

Trudeau slams 'unacceptable' trucker protests,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has hit out at protests by truckers around the country as ""unacceptable"". Speaking to parliament in Ottawa, he defended the Covid restrictions that have prompted truckers to converge on the nation's capital. Ottawa police meanwhile warned protesters could be arrested, and a conviction might cost them their jobs. The protests in Ottawa and at two Canada-US border crossings have been going on for two weeks. ""Blockages, illegal demonstrations are unacceptable, and are negatively impacting businesses and manufacturers,"" Mr Trudeau said on Wednesday. ""We must do everything to bring them to an end."" He said the protesters are ""trying to blockade our economy, our democracy and our fellow citizens' daily lives"". ""It has to stop.""Â How do you remove a 30-tonne truck? Patience running thin at truckers' protest in Ottawa Mr Trudeau returned to parliament on Monday following a week-long isolation after he caught coronavirus. Since Monday drivers have been blocking the largest international suspension bridge in the world at a border crossing that makes up around a quarter of US-Canada trade. The closure of the Ambassador Bridge by about 100 protesters in their big rigs has been denounced by trade groups. The span connects Windsor, Ontario, to Detroit, Michigan. Car manufacturers in the region say that they have had to reduce production and shift hours due to parts shortages caused by the ongoing blockade. Industry experts say that it could result in company layoffs and increase the prices that consumers pay for vehicles. The world's biggest manufacturer, Toyota, has halted production at three factories in Ontario, saying no more vehicles will be produced there this week. The White House has called for an end to the protests saying they risk hurting the car industry and US agricultural exports. About 400 trucks remain in central Ottawa after arriving there late last month. Police said on Wednesday the protesters could be charged with ""mischief to property"" because they were inhibiting local residents' ""lawful use, enjoyment and operation of their property"". Ottawa police warned that ""anyone blocking streets or assisting others in the blocking of streets may be committing a criminal offence"". They added that a criminal conviction could result in seizure of their vehicles, and an inability to enter the US. The police force also hiked penalties for noise, engine idling and other infractions in the city to C$1,000 ($790, Â£585) per offence. This video can not be played Watch: Truckers block key US-Canada border crossing The truckers are protesting against a rule requiring truckers entering Canada to be fully immunised against coronavirus. The demonstrators have also voiced opposition to Covid passports and mask mandates. Mr Trudeau has refused to budge on federal Covid measures, even as provinces begin lifting their restrictions. Alberta, Saskatchewan, Quebec and Prince Edward Island have all announced plans to lift most mitigation measures this month. Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are also easing some restrictions. On Tuesday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said pandemic-related rules had ""disrupted and even destroyed livelihoods"" in the province. In Coutts, Alberta, on the border with the US state of Montana, RCMP officers began issuing tickets on Wednesday to remove dozens of trucks that have been blocking that international crossing for about two weeks. No arrests have been reported, and authorities said that enforcement would take place in ""stages"" beginning with information gathering. ""Really it's going to be up to them,"" said RCMP Superintendent Roberta McKale, calling on them to move on their own. ""Up until this point it's been us asking them and this afternoon we don't have an option, we're going to have to use our enforcement options to have that happen."" Mr Trudeau has faced criticism from within his own party over his handling of the protests, which come as infections from the Omicron variant decline significantly. Quebec MP JoÃ«l Lightbound, a fellow Liberal, criticised the prime minister this week for ""demonising"" groups that disagree with Covid mandates. ""It's becoming harder and harder to know when public health stops and where politics begins,"" Mr Lightbound said. ""It's time to stop dividing Canadians and pitting one part of the population against another."" Interim Conservative leader Candice Bergen accused Mr Trudeau on Wednesday of wanting a ""permanent pandemic"". ""The prime minister needs to put his ego aside,"" she said. ""He needs to do what's right for the country. He needs to to end the mandates. He needs to end the restrictions."" Protests continue at the Ambassador Bridge At a news conference on Wednesday, organisers of the Freedom Convoy said protesters were ""upbeat"". They added that the truckers were resting so as to be ""re-energised"" for weekend protests, which they likened to a ""festival"". Reacting to the police warning, a lawyer for the protesters maintained in a statement that their actions were lawful. ""Noisy, inconvenient or unwanted protests are protected and must be facilitated,"" the lawyer said. The protesters have raised $7.8m on website GiveSendGo as of Wednesday after GoFundMe cancelled their fundraiser and began refunding some $10m in donations. Republican officials in at least two US states - Texas and Missouri - have opened investigations into GoFundMe over the decision. The protests in Canada have inspired similar events around the worldfrom Australia and New Zealandto France. Online chatter is building for a trucker protest in Washington DC.

Four men found guilty of gangland 'execution',"Kenny Reilly was murdered in the Maryhill area of Glasgow in April 2018 Four men have been found guilty of the ""planned execution"" of a man as he sat in a car at a set of traffic lights. John Kennedy, 41, shot 29-year-old Kenny Reilly in the Maryhill area of Glasgow in April 2018. His co-accused Morton Eadie, 56, his son Darren Eadie and Ross Fisher, both 30, were also found guilty of murder. All four were jailed for life. Kennedy must serve at least 26 years, Darren Eadie at least 24 years, and Morton Eadie and Fisher at least 22 years. Kennedy was also accused of the murder of Jamie Campbell in March 2006 but the case against him was found not proven. The verdicts came after a three-month trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. Murder was 'planned execution' in street Murder accused left country on day 'victim' died Four men on trial for murder over Glasgow shooting The judge Lord Beckett said that people who were ""prepared to engage in such meticulously planned and ruthlessly perpetrated assassination on the streets of our cities can expect substantial punishment"". The court heard Mr Reilly's murder was linked to a feud between rival factions in the Possilpark and Maryhill areas of Glasgow. Detectives believe he was killed because Kennedy and his accomplices thought he was responsible for assaulting their friend, Ryan McAteer. And the court also heard claims Mr Reilly owed Â£100,000 to a high-profile criminal. Kennedy told another inmate in Barlinnie that he had carried out the attack One of the key witnesses in the trial said Kennedy had confessed to the killings while in prison. Kevin McGinn, who shared a cell with Kennedy in Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison for 11 days in October 2018, said he had ""whispered in my ear and said to me 'it was me'."" He told police that Kennedy had said the attack was over ""drugs and money"". Mr Reilly was a passenger in a BMW being driven by his friend Emma MacDougall when he was targeted at about 22:20 on 16 April. The pair were travelling to a Chinese restaurant and had stopped at traffic lights at the junction at Bilsland Drive and Maryhill Road. Ms MacDougall, 25, told the court a black Ford S-Max car pull up on the right hand lane. She recalled: ""Somebody came out of the back seats wearing all black - a black balaclava - and started shooting at my car. ""I don't think I have any words for it. It was every single emotion ever. I didn't know whether to drive - I know I needed to phone the police, I knew I needed to phone an ambulance. ""I was trying to remain calm because I knew Kenny had obviously suffered a severe injury."" Police at the scene of the attack in Maryhill Mr Reilly died in hospital two days later from a single gunshot to the head. His attackers sped off to Craigieburn Gardens in Maryhill, where they set the car on fire. But forensic experts found Fisher's DNA on the wreckage and the breakthrough helped officers narrow the list of suspects. The court heard that when Kennedy was arrested in May 2018 he owned a phone which contained Encrochat software. The secure, encrypted messaging app which was mainly used by members of organised crime gangs to plan schemes. Police also learned that Ryan McAteer had been seriously assaulted on 8 April 2018. Police at the scene of Kenny Reilly's murder in Maryhill The jury was told that Darren Eadie blamed Mr Reilly, who was described in court as a ""Possil boy"", for the attack. Police uncovered evidence which showed that Darren Eadie had started planning a revenge attack for which he recruited his father Morton, Ross Fisher and John Kennedy. Officers recovered a mobile phone from Mr McAteer and found a number of incriminating messages in a WhatsApp group in which he and Darren Eadie had participated. Detectives found that the accused were in regular contact with each other in the days leading up to the fatal attack on Mr Reilly, but that the calls stopped afterwards. On the day Mr Reilly died in hospital, Kennedy and his partner flew to Jamaica for a two-week holiday. In the following days Darren and Morton Eadie both left the country. The jury heard this was an attempt to avoid police attention. Prosecutor Steven Borthwick said the evidence showed that Darren Eadie organised the plot, Morton Eadie acted as the getaway driver, Fisher stole the S-Max and set fire to it following the murder, and Kennedy was the gunman. He described Mr Reilly's death as ""a planned execution, brazenly carried out in the street in a residential area of Glasgow"". All four were found guilty of murder and of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by setting fire to the car used in the attack. The offences were aggravated by a connection with serious organised crime. Det Supt Stevie Wallace sad it had been a ""long, complex and challenging"" police investigation. ""Kenny Reilly left behind a family who has sought answers on how and why their loved one was killed,"" he said. ""Although he cannot be brought back, I hope this result will bring some comfort to his family and friends."" Jamie Campbell was shot dead in Drumchapel in 2006 As detectives built their case against Kennedy, they believed they had made a breakthrough in an unsolved murder from March 2006. Jamie Campbell was shot dead in Essenside Drive, Drumchapel. Six spent bullets were found at the scene, which contained the DNA from three different people. Analysis found that one of the forensic profiles may belong to Kennedy. A white burned-out Fiat Ducato van which was found near where Mr Campbell was shot contained items which had Kennedy's DNA on them. His lawyers claimed Glasgow gangster Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who wasshot deadin an Asda car park in Robroyston, Glasgow in 2010, had been responsible for Mr Campbell's murder. The court heard that police had investigated the claims at the time, and that Carroll gave a statement to officers denying any involvement. But the jury concluded that the case against Kennedy was not proven.

Man who killed author guilty of murdering wife,"Diane Stewart was found dead at the house she shared with her husband on 25 June 2010 A man who murdered a children's author in 2016 has been convicted of killing his wife six years earlier. Ian Stewart, 61, was found guilty of murdering Diane Stewart at their home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire. Her death had been treated as epilepsy-related until he murdered his fiancee Helen Bailey and dumped her body in a cesspit at their Hertfordshire home. Mr Justice Bryan sentenced Stewart to a whole-life order, meaning he will never be released from prison. Evidence from Mrs Stewart's brain, which was donated to medical science, was used to help convict her husband. How a donated brain helped convict a double killer In 2017, Stewart was convicted of secretly drugging and suffocating Ms Bailey in Royston, in a plot to inherit her fortune of some Â£4m. He wasjailed for lifewith a minimum 34-year term, and police then began to investigate the death of his wife in the garden of their home on 25 June 2010. Ian Stewart drugged and suffocated Helen Bailey In his evidence at Huntingdon Crown Court, Stewart claimed on the day of Mrs Stewart's death he had driven to the supermarket to getFrench bread and pateto ""celebrate"" after their son's driving test, but returned home when he realised he had forgotten his wallet. He said he saw Mrs Stewart ""crumpled on the floor"" and gave her CPR. He then told a 999 operator: ""My wife had a fit. She's in the garden."" He told the operator his wife had epilepsy, but Mrs Stewart had not suffered a fit since 1992. Mr Justice Bryan said: ""Knowing, as we do, that you had killed your wife, it is harrowing to listen to that 999 call, which I am sure was a charade from start to finish. ""Diane was already dead, and you had murdered her."" The judge said Stewart had ""in all probability"" killed his wife ""by a method that incapacitated her before she had any chance to fight back, most likely either a choke hold rendering her unconscious, or a plastic bag placed over the head from behind"". The judge said: ""Whether or not you had drugged Diane, as you had Helen, to assist you in your killing we will never know"" The couple's sons, Oliver and Jamie, were out of the house at the time of the killing, the court heard. In a statement released after the verdict, they called their mother ""amazing"". ""We were privileged to have a wonderful caring upbringing and we were supported through all the activities and hobbies that we undertook,"" they said. ""It's been really upsetting the last six years to have to recall the events of the toughest time of our life. ""We now look forward to recalling the many happy moments we had growing up as a family."" In a statement, Mrs Stewart's sister Wendy Bellamy-Lee and brother Christopher Lem said: ""Diane was a very special, caring and capable person. ""She will always be greatly loved and hugely missed by her family and all who knew her."" This video can not be played Ian Stewart: Murderer's reaction to new arrest caught on camera An inquest concluded Mrs Stewart had suffered sudden death in epilepsy (SUDEP), which kills about 600 people in the UK each year. While her body had been cremated, which police believe was done upon Stewart's instruction, he had consented to her brain being donated to medical science. Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer QC told jurors scientists and pathologists were instructed to re-examine the circumstances, and analysis of the brain tissue indicated Mrs Stewart's death was ""most likely caused by a prolonged restriction to her breathing from an outside source"". One consultant neurologist gave her risk of SUDEP at the time as ""extremely low - one in 100,000"", Mr Trimmer said. The Stewarts had lived on Poplar Farm Close in Bassingbourn Jurors also heard he received nearly Â£100,000 after Mrs Stewart died, including Â£28,500.21 in life insurance and the rest from her bank accounts. Stewart went on to buy a red two-seater MG car, the court heard. In evidence, Stewart claimed that he ""didn't need that money, it was for the boys' futures"" and said that type of vehicle was ""what Diane and I had up until [their son] Jamie was born"". The judge, though, said he was satisfied that ""the major motive for Diane's murder was for financial gain"". Jurors also heard from Alexandra Bailey, Mrs Stewart's friend from Salford University in the 1980s, who recalled Stewart's behaviour at the funeral as ""a little odd."" ""He seemed totally unbothered and seemed quite aloof,"" she said. ""I just didn't feel it was right."" This video can not be played Ian Stewart: Murderer's 999 call as wife lay unconscious Six years after killing his wife, Stewart would go on to murder Ms Bailey, who wrote more than 20 books, including the popular Electra Brown series. Ms Bailey was also known for her blog - Planet Grief - in which she talked about the death of her husband John Sinfield in 2011. She had met Stewart through a bereavement website. He had reported her missing three months before her body was found in the ""foul-smelling"" cesspit under their home in Royston alongside the corpse of her dachshund Boris. Sentencing Stewart on Wednesday, Mr Justice Bryan told him the two women's deaths were in ""chillingly similar circumstances"". He told Stewart: ""You successfully passed off a murder as an epileptic fit in the circumstance I have identified, playing out an elaborate, and indeed sophisticated, charade over a period of time. ""A charade that succeeded at the time, and would have succeeded for all time but for your subsequent murder of Helen Bailey."" Det Supt Jerome Kent, who investigated both murders, revealed that when officers arrested Stewart - who by that time was serving a life sentence - for the murder of Mrs Stewart, the killer said: ""Haven't you got anything better to do?"" ""He's an intelligent man,"" Det Supt Kent said. ""He finds manipulating very easy to do. He can manipulate people, he can persuade people, he is extremely devious. ""I believe he is a narcissist, that it is all about him and about what he wants and the control he must have in his life.""

Major breakthrough on nuclear fusion energy,"This video can not be played Watch the five-second pulse light up the JET reactor European scientists say they have made a major breakthrough in their quest to develop practical nuclear fusion - the energy process that powers the stars. TheUK-based JET laboratory,externalhas smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion can be successfully recreated on Earth it holds out the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy. The experiments produced 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds (11 megawatts of power). This is more than double what was achieved in similar tests back in 1997. It's not a massive energy output - only enough to boil about 60 kettles' worth of water. But the significance is that it validates design choices that have been made for an even bigger fusion reactor now being constructed in France. ""The JET experiments put us a step closer to fusion power,"" said Dr Joe Milnes, the head of operations at the reactor lab. ""We've demonstrated that we can create a mini star inside of our machine and hold it there for five seconds and get high performance, which really takes us into a new realm."" US lab takes further step towards fusion goal Five sites named in nuclear fusion plant shortlist Science leaders: Europe spat will weaken research Ultimately, the process would be used to drive steam turbines to generate electricity The ITER facility in southern France is supported by a consortium of world governments, including from EU member states, the US, China and Russia. It is expected to be the last step in proving nuclear fusion can become a reliable energy provider in the second half of this century. Operating the power plants of the future based on fusion would produce no greenhouse gases and only very small amounts of short-lived radioactive waste. ""These experiments we've just completed had to work,"" said JET CEO Prof Ian Chapman. ""If they hadn't then we'd have real concerns about whether ITER could meet its goals. ""This was high stakes and the fact that we achieved what we did was down to the brilliance of people and their trust in the scientific endeavour,"" he told BBC News. The walls of the JET reactor were changed to a material made from beryllium and tungsten Fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them, as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations. In the core of the Sun, huge gravitational pressures allow this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million Celsius. At the much lower pressures that are possible on Earth, temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million Celsius. No materials exist that can withstand direct contact with such heat. So, to achieve fusion in a lab, scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas, or plasma, is held inside a doughnut-shaped magnetic field. The Joint European Torus (JET), sited at Culham in Oxfordshire, has been pioneering this fusion approach for nearly 40 years. And for the past 10 years, it has been configured to replicate the anticipated ITER set-up. The fusion announcement is great news but sadly it won't help in our battle to lessen the effects of climate change. There's huge uncertainty about when fusion power will be ready for commercialisation. One estimate suggests maybe 20 years. Then fusion would need to scale up, which would mean a delay of perhaps another few decades. And here's the problem: the need for carbon-free energy is urgent - and the government has pledged that all electricity in the UK must be zero emissions by 2035. That means nuclear, renewables and energy storage. In the words of my colleague Jon Amos: ""Fusion is not a solution to get us to 2050 net zero. This is a solution to power society in the second half of this century."" The French lab's preferred ""fuel"" to make the plasma will be a mix of two forms, or isotopes, of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium. JET was asked to demonstrate a lining for the 80-cubic-metre toroidal vessel enclosing the magnetic field that would work efficiently with these isotopes. For its record-breaking experiments in 1997, JET had used carbon, but carbon absorbs tritium, which is radioactive. So for the latest tests, new walls for the vessel were constructed out of the metals beryllium and tungsten. These are 10 times less absorbent. The JET science team then had to tune their plasma to work effectively in this new environment. ""This is a stunning result because they managed to demonstrate the greatest amount of energy output from the fusion reactions of any device in history,"" commented Dr Arthur Turrell, the author of The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion And The Race To Power The Planet. ""It's a landmark because they demonstrated stability of the plasma over five seconds. That doesn't sound very long, but on a nuclear timescale, it's a very, very long time indeed. And it's very easy then to go from five seconds to five minutes, or five hours, or even longer."" French President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and the Queen formally opened JET in 1984 JET can't actually run any longer because its copper electromagnets get too hot. For ITER, internally cooled superconducting magnets will be used. Fusion reactions in the lab famously consume more energy to initiate than they can output. At Jet, two 500 megawatt flywheels are used to run the experiments. But there is solid evidence that this deficit can be overcome in the future as the plasmas are scaled up. ITER's toroidal vessel volume will be 10 times that of JET. It's hoped the French lab will get to breakeven. The commercial power plants that come after should then show a net gain that could be fed into electricity grids. This is a long game and it's significant that of the 300 or so scientists working as JET, a quarter are in the early part of their careers. They will have to carry the baton of research forward. ""Fusion takes a long time, it is complex, it is difficult,"" said Dr Athina Kappatou, who's in her thirties. ""This is why we have to ensure that from one generation to the next, there are the scientists, there are the engineers and the technical staff who can take things forward."" Many technical challenges remain, however. In Europe, these challenges are being worked on by the Eurofusion consortium, which comprises some 5,000 science and engineering experts from across the EU, Switzerland and Ukraine. The UK is a participant, too. Its full involvement in ITER, however, will require first for Britain to ""associate"" to certain EU science programmes, something that so far has been held up by disagreements over post-Brexit trading arrangements, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. JET is likely to be decommissioned after 2023 with ITER beginning plasma experiments in 2025, or soon after.

Watchdog to review Capt Sir Tom charity accounts,"Captain Sir Tom Moore raised almost Â£33m in direct donations for charities supporting the NHS The Charity Commission says it is to review the accounts of the charity set up in honour of Capt Sir Tom Moore. Grants of Â£160,000 were given to four charities by the Captain Tom Foundation which paid more than Â£162,000 in management costs in its first year. Capt Sir Tom walked 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden at the start of lockdown, raising Â£33m for NHS Charities Together. The foundation said it welcomed the Charity Commission's input. The Army veteran, who was born in Keighley in West Yorkshire anddied last year aged 100, carried out the fundraising walk at his home in Marston Moretaine when Covid restrictions were first introduced in 2020. The Â£33m raised was managed and distributed by NHS Charities Together before the JustGiving account was closed down. After he became a national figure, his family set up a separate charity in his name called the Captain Tom Foundation. According to the publishedaccounts,external, covering the charity's first year from 5 May 2020 to 31 May 2021, it paid out grants to four charities worth Â£40,000 each but spent Â£209,433 on support costs including Â£162,336 on ""management"". The financial statement also showed reimbursement costs of Â£16,097 paid to Club Nook Limited, a company run by Hannah Ingram-Moore, Capt Sir Tom's daughter. These costs were for accommodation, security and transport relating to Capt Sir Tom ""travelling around the UK to promote the charitable company"". Captain Tom Day planned to empower older people Captain Sir Tom honoured by memorial arboretum Capt Sir Tom's family embark on 100-lap challenge Payments of Â£37,942 were also made to Maytrix Group Limited, a company run by Ms Ingram-Moore and her husband, relating to photography, office rental, telephone and third-party consultancy costs. ""These costs were initially funded by Maytrix Group Limited on behalf of the charitable company, and reimbursed when sufficient funds were available,"" the financial statement said. Expense payments of Â£1,686 were also made to Ms Ingram-Moore to cover ""motor, post, subscription and travel costs"". Payments were made from the charity to reimburse costs incurred by companies run by Sir Capt Tom's daughter Hannah Ingram-Moore, accounts showed The Charity Commission, which is an independent, non-ministerial government department, said: ""We have been in ongoing contact with the trustees of the Captain Tom Foundation on its set-up and governance arrangements and as part of this work will now assess the charity's recently submitted accounts."" It said it had an open regulatory compliance case into the charity, but that did not mean it had made any finding of wrongdoing. Stephen Jones, chair of trustees for The Captain Tom Foundation, said: ""As a young charity, we have been working closely with the Charity Commission since we launched, and we welcome their input following the publication of our recent audited annual accounts."" The Fundraising Regulator and Information Commissioner's Office had also looked at concerns regarding the foundation but those matters have since been resolved.

Homophobic abuse 'normalised' in primary schools,"This video can not be played Rory Wade said he found ""homophobia was very normalised in daily conversation"" during his school days Primary school children are targeting each other with homophobic and anti-trans abuse, a professor has warned. Cardiff University's EJ Renold said they had noticed an increase in young children reporting homophobic and sexist comments. Maisie Awen said she was ""terrified anyone would find out"" she was gay after experiencing homophobia in school from the age of six. The Welsh government said any bullying was ""unacceptable"". Last year an Estyn report found homophobic bullying was the most common kind in secondary schools and happened ""all the time"". LGBT tolerance 'going backwards' as hate crimes up 'I don't want to just survive. I want to be happy' LGBT pupils 'need better support' from schools Prof Renold, who advised on that report, told BBC Wales it was ""not unusual"" to find anti-gay comments ""normalised"" in primary schools. ""It might be more underground, but it's going on,"" they said. Prof EJ Renold said it was not unusual to find anti-gay comments normalised in primary schools ""You will have children who are maybe gender non-conforming who can become targets of homophobic abuse, and I would say increasingly, transphobic abuse as well."" The Estyn report in December found many LGBTQ+ pupils at secondary schools had ""substantial personal experiences"" of homophobia, including name calling, body shaming and in some instances being told to kill themselves. The first time Maisie Awen heard the word ""lesbian"" it was being used as a slur The first time Maisie Awen from Pembrokeshire heard the word ""lesbian"" it was being used as a slur at her primary school. She was about six and it was being aimed at her as a term of abuse. ""The whole of primary school I told my friends I had a crush on every boy just to stay on that side of things,"" she said. Ms Awen, now 19, realised she was gay as a teenager and had already encountered homophobia for so many years that it felt like ""the end of the world"". ""I was already bullied for being gay, even before I came to that conclusion myself,"" she said. ""I was terrified that anyone would find out. ""There weren't really adults in school who I felt could see it in a positive way. ""With those teachers I did have a good relationship with, I was too scared to jeopardise that relationship by telling them about my sexuality."" Prof Renold, who advises the Welsh government, said the findings were ""shocking"" but would not be surprising to those working with schools. Alex Thomas, who supports Viva LGBTQ+ youth groups in Rhyl, Denbighshire, believed every young LGBTQ+ pupil would be affected by homophobia. Alex Thomas believes teachers often do not know how to respond to homophobia ""Young people are facing increased levels of oppression of isolation of bullying and negative experiences based around their identity,"" he said. Mr Thomas said for many young children the biggest problem was teachers not knowing what to do. He said one young person had recently told him they had left a lesson to cry after being targeted. ""When the teacher found out they seemed more put out about the fact the pupil hadn't come to them in the first place than actually responding to what had happened,"" Mr Thomas said. Director of teaching union NAHT Cymru, Laura Doel, said discrimination against LGBTQ+ pupils harmed their mental health. ""School leaders will need time, some extra resources as well as further training and confidence to be able to deal with these matters,"" she said. Reagan said it was important to teach children why certain words shouldn't be used At Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Plasmawr, in Cardiff, pupils caught using homophobic or transphobic language are asked to sit down with LGBTQ+ peers to discuss what happened. Reagan, 17, of the school's LGBTQ+ group, Digon, said homophobia in younger children was often the result of ""genuine naivety"" and it was easier for them to talk to peers than teachers. Megan said they could usually be ""rehabilitated"". ""Other times it's not always a positive response,"" the 15-year-old said. Maisie, 17, said some pupils were surprised to learn of the impact of their words. ""We educate pupils about the words and what you can use and can't use in context,"" she said. Megan said homophobic pupils could usually be ""rehabilitated"" Prof Renold said the new curriculum in Wales would help schools to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying, but a ""serious investment of resources"" was needed to help train teachers and create inclusive environments. The Welsh government said its new curriculum for Wales, due to start in September at some schools, would be inclusive of everyone and included a mandatory relationships and sexuality education (RSE) code. It said it had commissioned training for school leaders to tackle homophobic bullying. ""Any form of bullying or sexual harassment is completely unacceptable, and we want to encourage any children and young people who are experiencing this kind of harassment to come forward and report it.""

DUP and Sinn FÃ©in row delays cultural bill,"Legislation on the Irish and Ulster-Scots languages was included in the New Decade, New Approach agreement in January 2020 A political row over the title of the new commissioner for Ulster Scots is being partly blamed for the delay in legislating for a new cultural bill at Westminster, the BBC understands. Last year the government promised to bring legislation for Irish language and Ulster Scots through Westminster. It stepped inafter the Stormont executive failed to pass the cultural billbut the process has been stalled. Now it seems the DUP and Sinn Fein are at odds over the commissioner's title. It is understood the Democratic Unionist Party has argued that the title Ulster Scots commissioner is too narrow and the post should instead be named Ulster British Commissioner. But Sinn FÃ©in say the role is about promoting language, arts and literature and the title should be Ulster Scots Commissioner. The Northern Ireland Office now has been tasked with resolving the stand-off. Irish language law 'due in Parliament next week' Irish language talks back on at Stormont What plans are ahead for NI language and culture? Meanwhile, the NIO Minister Conor Burns yesterdayconfirmed that the government still plans to pass the cultural bill at Westminster before the Assembly electionbut he provided no specific timeline. Mr Burns said the government wanted to pass the legislation to avoid the issue dominating the May election campaign. The DUP's Jonathan Buckley said that was ""disappointing"" and accused the government of being ""tone deaf"" to unionist concerns. However, nationalist parties have questioned the delay in introducing language legislation, with Sinn FÃ©in saying the British government ""must stop dragging its feet"" on the issue. New legislation to protect and enhance both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots was planned as part of the2020 New Decade New Approach agreement. The wide-ranging deal restored Stormont's power-sharing government after a three-year gap, but much of its terms are still to be implemented, including language protections. The 2020 agreement stated legislation would be introduced to""provide official recognition of the status"" of both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots,externalwith a commissioner appointed for each. Conor Burns appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Tuesday and was asked if language legislation would be pushed through before the forthcoming assembly election on 5 May. ""What I can say, very candidly, is that is our expectation that this is not going to be passed by Stormont before the end of the mandate and dissolution and that we are absolutely expecting that we are going to have to do this in Westminster, and we remain committed to bringing this legislation forward in Westminster,"" he said. NIO minister Conor Burns told MPs on Tuesday it would be ""a good thing if this was completed"" before May's election Mr Burns said he could not reveal the expected date. But he added: ""This is not a nationalist or a unionist piece of legislation but I think we can all agree, it's definitely the government's view that it would be a good thing if this was completed and didn't become a contentious element of what is already going to be a contentious election campaign."" Mr Buckley said the Westminster government could not ""cherry pick"" language provisions of the New Decade New Approach deal while at the same time failing to deal with unionist concerns over post-Brexit trade arrangements at the Irish Sea border. ""Unionism is at its wit's end with hollow commitments from Her Majesty's government on the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" the DUP assembly member told theBBC's Nolan Show. ""While I respect everybody's right to value a language, to participate in speaking a language, my concern primarily is the constitutional and economic impact of the Irish Sea border on the people of Northern Ireland. ""And you know what? If nationalists and indeed those that push for Irish language elements of New Decade New Approach really value that agreement and really value the input of unionists, they would recognise that a key pledge in that agreement was a pledge to protect and strengthen the UK internal market."" The party's West Belfast assembly member Aisling Reilly called on the government to ""get on with implementing its commitments and legislate for an Acht Gaeilge [Irish language legislation]"". ""That legislation needs to faithfully reflect what was negotiated and agreed by the two governments and the political parties in the New Decade New Approach,"" she said. ""Irish language legislation is crucial to delivering rights and guaranteeing protections in law to an ever-growing community of GaeilgeoirÃ­ [Irish speakers] across our island."" Ms Reilly added: ""The British government needs to end the delays, honour its commitments and implement its agreements and end the denial of rights to the Irish language community."" Disputes over Irish language rights have been a source of division between Northern Ireland's two largest parties for several years and it has threatened the future of power-sharing. Last summer, after another crisis at Stormont,Sinn FÃ©in said it would not agree to the appointment of a new DUP first ministerwithout movement on Irish language legislation. The party then asked Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to introduce the laws at Westminster, saying it was the ""only way forward to finally resolve"" the standoff. The DUP's Sammy Wilson objected at the time, warning the government it ""must not interfere in devolved issues at the behest of Sinn FÃ©in"". Late last year, the Northern Ireland Office said it was ""disappointing that the executive has not progressed legislation"" on language and cultural issues. It added that""in the absence of progress on this matter, the UK government is taking the necessary stepsto introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows."" Meanwhile, a bill that allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to continue to meet for at least six months has received royal assent. The Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill removes the duty on the government to set an assembly election date, if the roles of first and deputy first minister are not replaced this week. It comes as the executive cannot meet due to theresignation of the DUP's Paul Givan as first ministerin protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol, which unionists argue has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem On Wednesday, DUP MP Ian Paisley told the House of Commons that the protocol had ""zero support from unionists"" and that a ""one-sided solution will not stand"". Ian Paisley said the Northern Ireland Protocol had zero support from unionists Instead, a resolution must be agreed that ""united people"", he told prime minister's questions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded that any solution required cross-community support and could be fixed with ""good will"". He repeated his threat that if negotiations failed between the UK and the European Union then the government would trigger Article 16, a means of taking unilateral safeguarding measures.

Truckers block vital Canada-US border crossingBusiness associations warn that the closure of the Ambassador Bridge threatens the US and Canadian economies.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Truckers 'don't have the right to hold us hostage' Truck drivers are blocking a key border crossing between the US and Canada, sparking fears of economic disruption. While limited US-bound traffic is being allowed to cross the Ambassador Bridge in Ontario, Canada-bound lanes from Detroit remain closed. Business associations have called for the bridge to be immediately cleared to ensure the steady flow of goods. The protests across Canada against vaccine rules and Covid restrictions are now two weeks old. Truckers are demonstrating against a rule that requires them to be vaccinated to cross the US-Canada border. But the protests have grown to include anger at restrictions and at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government generally. They have mostly centred on the capital, Ottawa, and another border crossing between Montana and Alberta has also been blocked. The closure of the Ambassador Bridge is particularly significant because nearly 30% of annual trade between the US and Canada comes through it. ""I've already heard from automakers and food grocers,"" Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on Tuesday. ""This is really a serious cause for concern"". On Wednesday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the White House was watching the situation ""very closely"". She noted that authorities were tracking potential disruptions that the blockade could cause to agricultural exports from Michigan to Canada and the movement of workers back and forth across the border. Lorry drivers rallying in solidarity with the demonstrators in Ottawa first blocked the bridge on Monday afternoon. While the bridge was reopened to limited traffic from Canada into the US by Tuesday morning, authorities in Michigan have said that traffic flows into Canada remain blocked. They continue to advise drivers to divert to nearby Port Huron to cross the border. How might Canada's trucker protest end? Patience running thin at truckers' protest in Ottawa Windsor Police told the BBC that no arrests have so far been made in relation to the protests, but between seven and 10 tickets had been issued, primarily for moving violations. ""The Windsor Police Service wants to resolve this situation through the use of diplomacy and negotiation, seeking a solution that is safe and sustainable for our community,"" the police force said in a statement. On Tuesday night, dozens of business associations based on both sides of the border called for a swift re-opening of the bridge, as well as the Alberta-Montana crossing. ""The disruption of the Ambassador Bridge is an attack on the well-being of our citizens and the businesses that employ them,"" a statement from the organisations said. ""As our economies emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, we cannot allow any group to undermine the cross-border trade that supports families on both sides of the border."" Late on Tuesday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said that protesters had also blocked the border crossing between Alberta and Montana for the second time in less than a week. Over the weekend, the RCMP said that while most of the protesters have been respectful of officers and followed their directions, a number of investigations have been opened in relation to the blockade at the Alberta border. In Alberta, the province's proof-of-vaccination system expires on Wednesday at midnight. Additionally, from next Monday the province will drop a requirement that students wear masks in schools. Children under 12 will not be required to wear masks anywhere. On Tuesday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said that pandemic-related restrictions had ""disrupted and even destroyed livelihoods"" in the province.

The English test that ruined thousands of lives,"A BBC investigation has raised fresh doubts about the evidence used to throw thousands of people out of the UK for allegedly cheating in an English language test. Whistleblower testimony and official documents obtained by Newsnight reveal the Home Office has continued to try to remove people based on the claims of the international testing organisation ETS - despite knowing of serious concerns about its conduct and flaws in its data. More than 2,500 people were deported and at least 7,200 more were forced to leave Britain after ETS accused them of cheating in an exam it set and marked. Others who remain in the UK continue to fight to clear their names after enduring years of hardship. The crackdown was sparked by a 2014 BBC Panorama investigation that revealed two London test centres were running fraudulent exams so people could falsely obtain a pass they could use to apply for a visa. Following those revelations, the government asked ETS to assess the scale of student cheating across more than 100 independent centres, which were contracted as test venues. ETS gave them a massive list of alleged cheats - but despite proof that this included some innocent people who had been wrongly accused, the Home Office continues to stand by ETS's evidence. Labour MP Stephen Timms said: ""Clearly, ETS was a discredited witness and yet the Home Office relied on them totally."" Newsnight has also uncovered further evidence - much of which has been known to the department for several years - which raises additional questions about why ETS has been trusted to investigate what went on. In the new investigation - by the same journalists who exposed the original fraud - the BBC can reveal: Past and present ETS staff told the Home Office they had found significant evidence of organised cheating almost two years before it was exposed by Panorama They told Home Office investigators their efforts to close some fraudulent test centres were blocked by managers who were worried test fee income would fall From these accounts, the Home Office learned it had been kept in the dark about the fraud Investigators were also given eyewitness testimony that some tests were faked with a method known as ""remote testing"", which lawyers believe undermines ETS's evidence. The chair of the Public Accounts Committee, Labour MP Meg Hillier, told the BBC: ""Given what you found, I think the Home Office can no longer rely on this ETS data."" Dame Meg said the government's actions have created ""huge injustice"" and it should now drop outstanding legal action against alleged cheats, most of whom came to Britain as international students. She suggested they should instead be allowed to sit fresh English tests for new visas. Wahidur Rahman, who won a seven-year battle to overturn the Home Office's allegations against him, said: ""They should hang their heads in shame for not apologising, not just to me but all the other innocent students."" Many alleged cheats were thrown out of Britain without any opportunity to challenge or even see the evidence against them. The Home Office simply cancelled their visas, with no right to appeal in Britain. Nomi Raja was 22 when immigration officers raided his student house in June 2014. ""They asked me for my ID. Then this guy had a radio and he was like: 'Target achieved.'"" Only when he arrived at a detention centre at Gatwick Airport did an officer reveal why he had been arrested: ""She's like, 'You've done Toeic, you have cheated and then we are sending you back to Pakistan'."" Toeic -Test of English for International Communication - was the name of the exam set by ETS. Nomi Raja's house was raided by immigration officers Mr Raja managed to halt his deportation and was released after 125 days. But like others who protested their innocence, he was banned from working, studying or using the NHS. Many became estranged from relatives who didn't believe the British government would make such shameful allegations without good reason. Finding themselves unwelcome both in Britain and back home was devastating for those affected, said Nazek Ramadan, director of the charity Migrant Voice. ""Most of them have mental health issues and some were on medication to stop them killing themselves,"" she said. The 2014 Panorama followed a tip-off that bogus students who spoke virtually no English were being offered ""guaranteed"" Toeic exam passes at two London test centres. An undercover researcher secretly filmed an exam in East London where test centre staff provided every candidate with a paid cheat, or proxy, who spoke good English. The tests were then uploaded to ETS in the US for marking. Student visa system fraud exposed in BBC investigation Nine convicted over student visa English test plot Panorama's undercover footage shocked then Home Secretary Theresa May. ""I want to do something about it,"" she said at the time. Her department had revoked the licences of hundreds of colleges to sponsor international students to come to the UK, because they were suspected of being a cover for immigration fraud. Investigations were now launched into Toeic fraud. ETS, also now under scrutiny, offered to help with voice recognition software. It looked to see if the same voice turned up on multiple test recordings, indicating the same proxy had faked exams for several people. If a test was flagged and two ETS staff agreed, it was classified as ""invalid"" - meaning the candidate had definitely cheated. Even if that didn't indicate cheating, ETS might designate a test as ""questionable"" if it was taken at a centre with many ""invalid"" results. Watch thefull investigation on iPlayer. The final results were startling: 97% of 58,000 Toeics taken in Britain between 2011 and 2014 were judged suspicious - 33,663 were invalid and 22,476 questionable. If that had been accurate, it would have represented the largest exam cheating scandal in British history. Labour MP Stephen Timms believes the figures weren't challenged because they suited the government's agenda of creating a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants. ""They saw here an opportunity, tragically, to do that and thousands of innocent people have paid a very high price as a result,"" he said. Lord Willetts, universities minister in 2014, says although the 97% figure was ""implausibly high"" officials believed them. ""The Home Office assumed this whole thing was totally abused and corrupt, and so they didn't get into the detail,"" he said. Mrs May declined to comment. A huge list of names was passed to the Home Office which revoked the visa of anybody with an invalid test. It wasn't until 2017 that people in Toeic cases won the right to appeal in Britain. In 2016, two years after the deportations started, ETS began providing alleged cheats with their test recordings. Shakil Rathore's story raises the question of how many before then might have proved their innocence if they had also been given this key evidence. The audio, which supposedly showed the 50-year-old civil engineer had cheated, actually proved the opposite. When we listened to his test recording there was no mistaking the distinctive stutter. ""Yes, it's my voice,"" he exclaimed. Shakil Rathore and Richard Watson listen back to the recording of Shakil's test Mr Rathore struggled for three years to get hold of the recording. Even then the Home Office only withdrew its allegation after he had paid for an expert report confirming it was his voice. Another man waited six years for his test recording to be played in court. The judge ruled it was obviously his voice and criticised officials for never having compared the two. In fact, most people who received a test recording found it didn't contain their voice, which appeared to support claims that they had cheated. Digital forensics expert Professor Peter Sommer said: ""What seems to have happened is that the voice files became somehow separated from the individuals."" However, it was impossible to verify the files were what ETS said they were because they contained no electronic metadata showing when and where they were created. Nomi Raja discovered significant errors in the allegations against him: ""It says that I'm a Bangladeshi national. But I'm from Pakistan. It also says the test centre was in Leicester, and I gave my exam in London."" When after five years his appeal was heard the judge ruled there was ""no case for him to answer"". In addition to concerns about the reliability of ETS's data there are also worrying questions about what the Home Office knows about the organisation itself. The BBC can reveal that inspectors from the international arm of ETS - ETS Global BV, which oversaw the British operation - had been finding significant evidence of organised cheating at some test centres for almost two years before it was publicly exposed by Panorama. Two people who worked for ETS in the UK say the Home Office was kept in the dark about the fraud at the time to ensure Toeic kept its government licence for visa applications. Following the Panorama broadcast, they were interviewed by Home Office investigators and the department learned shocking details about what had been known about the scale of the fraud in some locations. MP Stephen Timms is appalled that despite those revelations the Home Office continued to base its enforcement action on ETS's evidence: ""What Newsnight has shown is that the Home Office knew that ETS was behaving appallingly. And that makes it even more extraordinary that the Home Office relied totally on ETS's claims."" The BBC interviewed former inspector Richard Shury, whose testimony has been used by the Home Office in immigration cases, but who has not spoken to the media before. His account is supported by a 2018 statement made by his former boss Ahmad Bdour, who still works for ETS Global BV. Richard Shury That document recently became public when it was disclosed by the Home Office and used as evidence in an immigration appeal by two students known as DK and RK. Mr Bdour was so concerned about organised cheating that around May 2012 he suggested that the company ""needed to stop working in the UK"". Mr Shury says when he joined ETS in December 2012, Mr Bdour warned him some test centres were riddled with fraud. ""He said they would often see people waiting outside the locations and when they saw him coming, would make a call or dart back inside, which would essentially serve as a warning to the location to swap the test takers - proxies - out and bring the real test takers back."" Both Mr Shury and Mr Bdour allege that while a few fraudulent test centres had their contracts cancelled, their efforts to close others were blocked by bosses. Innocent people would have no clue they were booking a test at a centre which, months earlier, might have been discovered to have been riddled with fraud. Mr Shury said: ""As an ordinary member of the public, you would have had no way to differentiate between one which was proper and one which wasn't."" Mr Bdour said there was no whistleblower policy in place and he was told if he kept recommending closing test centres he would lose his job. He did not respond to our request for comment. In a statement ETS said it took prompt action when it was made aware of serious allegations about UK tests in 2014, including significant changes to the management team of ETS Global BV. Mr Shury said he also gave the Home Office his eyewitness account of ""remote testing"" - a method of faking tests which potentially further undermines the ETS voice recognition evidence. Inspectors believed some centres had remote access software that allowed test computers to be secretly controlled from other rooms. Immigration barrister Nick Armstrong said it would have been simpler for fraudsters to discard all the test entries from the exam hall - including those by genuine candidates - and just upload those from a secret room. The same faked test could be sent for multiple candidates, he believes. This meant that when the recordings were scrutinised with voice recognition software, people who thought they had passed on their own merits would be wrongly branded cheats. ""It is an explanation for why the numbers of so-called fraudulent tests were as high as they were found to be,"" Mr Armstrong said. Mr Shury told the BBC he saw evidence of remote testing at several locations. ""We've seen a test taker sitting at a computer not typing anything and words appearing on the screen,"" he says. He and Mr Bdour were tipped-off about allegations of remote testing at Queensway College in Walthamstow, but found nothing suspicious in the exam room. Then, he said, Mr Bdour went to a secret room they had been told about, where he ""saw people hunched shoulder-to-shoulder and controlling the test with what looked like remote testing software"". In May 2015 the inspectors' experiences were summarised in reports by the Home Office investigators. These reports are still presented at immigration appeals as part of the case against students. We have obtained the reports for two test centres, including Queensway College, which state evidence of remote testing was found at both. But in 2019 Home Office civil servants denied there was any such evidence when MPs on the Public Accounts Committee raised the issue. Dame Meg said she was shocked to learn from the BBC that officials had apparently been unaware of its existence when they gave evidence to her committee. ""We now need to get the full set of documents,"" she said. In a statement the Home Office said it ""has been, and continues to be, completely transparent with select committee requests for information"". In 2018 ETS Global BV paid a Â£1.6m settlement to the department, but by then the Toeic scandal had already cost taxpayers Â£21m. Twenty-five people who faked tests have been convicted, including 11 involved with the frauds Panorama filmed. The government is continuing to contest Immigration appeals against accusations based on ETS's evidence. But by 2019 more than 3700 people had won their cases. Immigration barrister Paul Turner says: ""I think the government will die in a ditch defending ETS's data. But the courts are finding that an awful lot of people did not cheat."" In February 2021 the Home Secretary Priti Patel told MPs she accepted some innocent people had been wrongly accused. ""We need to find a resolution and actually to bring not just clarification, but some justice around what has happened."" She promised to look at solutions after the conclusion of a test case, but a year on that judgement is still awaited. However, the Home Office doesn't accept there are major flaws in ETS's evidence. In a statement it said it had consistently been found that the evidence it had at the time was sufficient to take immigration enforcement action. ""Where somebody's test has been identified as having been taken by use of a proxy test taker, they are able to challenge a consequent adverse decision by taking it to either judicial review or appeal, which is independent of the Government."" The department added that it had made significant improvements to ensure large-scale abuse could never happen again. The BBC asked ETS if it has reviewed the reliability of its evidence. ETS didn't directly respond but in a statement it said it had taken prompt action when it was made aware of serious allegations about UK tests in 2014. It said these were conducted by third-party contractors and overseen by its UK office. ""ETS shared our methodology and findings with the UK Home Office but did not make any recommendations in relation to the same nor was ETS involved in determining how such information was utilised by the Home Office in its subsequent actions."" ETS added that it would continue to improve test security.

LiveLivePM: Encouraging trends mean Covid rules could end earlyLess than a minute ago,"During Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson says he plans to end self-isolation rules in England ahead of time Thanks to ""encouraging"" Covid trends, he says he wants to end the last domestic restrictions a ""full month early"" He has been facing MPs in the Commons for the first time since conducting a mini-reshuffle of his cabinet Labour MPs press the PM on fraud and rising energy prices The reshuffle follows weeks of Tory discord over parties at Downing Street and fresh controversy over the PM's Jimmy Savile remarks Fifteen Tory MPs have publicly told Johnson to go but more are believed to have submitted letters of no confidence The Daily Mirror has published a new photo that it says shows Johnson at a virtual Christmas quiz with an open bottle of champagne Edited by Lauren Turner We're pausing our live coverage of the day's political events. Your writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Chris Giles, Jennifer Meierhans, Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon and Nathan Williams. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. From all of us, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage today. Here's a recap of what's been happening.    Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said the prime minister's announcement on the early lifting of remaining Covid restrictions in England were intended to detract attention from his current political difficulties. ""The fact we had no notice this was coming, no sense it was coming, suggests that some throwaway remarks at the start of Prime Minister's Questions were more about digging the prime minister out of a political hole than dealing with the serious challenge facing the country,"" he told the BBC. Streeting also said the government needed a ""real plan for living well with Covid"", adding Labour had published its own plan ""weeks ago"" and that the prime minister was ""welcome to nick it"". People in the ""real world"" don't care about parties held in Downing Street during lockdown, the new leader of the House of Commons says. Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham ""what really mattered"" to people was their energy bills, NHS backlogs and jobs. Spencer replaced Jacob Rees-Mogg as Commons leader in a cabinet reshuffle. He was formerly the government chief whip, in charge of party discipline. The Sherwood MP said he could not comment further on government lockdown parties because of the police investigation, but said: ""Clearly people were having a drink, I've done that. I've had a drink of alcohol during Covid."" He said: ""When you get out into the real world and you talk to real people, my experience is they are saying to me 'you know what really matters to me is the cost of my energy bills, the NHS backlog post-Covid,making sure the economy is growing and my job is secure'."" On the issue of the Downing Street parties, Conservative MP Robbie Moore has given ascathing interview to a local newspaper,external. He said he shared the ""rage and anger"" felt by his constituents. Moor said he had spoken with the prime minister following the publication of an interim report into the parties. The report by senior civil servant Sue Gray ""confirmed the fury and disgust I already had about the reported parties and social events, and indeed the culture of rule-breaking in Downing Street"", Moore said. He said he told Johnson the current situation ""is not sustainable and that things must changeâ. In the interview, Moore did not say whether he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson's leadership. If 54 of Tory MPs send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs the party's leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, Labour's Fabian Hamilton asked Boris
Johnson to explain aphoto that appears to show the PM and others with a bottle of bubbly and food at a Christmas partyduring lockdown. During PMQs, Hamilton asked
the PM if it showed an event ""like one of the Christmas parties he told us
never happened"". Earlier, the PM said encouraging trends could mean the UK's Covid rules end early - so let's have a look at what today's data tells us. A further68,214new coronavirus infections have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This is the lowest number of cases since Friday. It puts the average number of cases over the last seven days at485,074. This is down143,469or22.8%on the previous week. There have also been276deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data shows. That makes the weekly average1,526which is down298on the previous seven days and represents a16.3%drop. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Police will take no further action over accusations of bullying and intimidation towards MPs by government whips and Downing Street, the BBC has been told. The Conservative MP William Wragg confirmed that he had been told by the Metropolitan police that there was no evidence of any criminal offence, as first reported by the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Last month he told a committeethat Tory whips had threatened those suspected of wanting Boris Johnson out with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. The backbencher, who has called for the prime minister to resign, met detectives to discuss the allegations. Downing Street previously said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleged. Some Tory MPs are keen to see what one described as âsignificant culture changeâ in government and noted the removal of the former Chief Whip Mark Spencer from his post in yesterdayâs reshuffle. The Met has been approached for comment. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has arrived in Moscow ahead of talks about the crisis in eastern Ukraine with veteran Russian diplomat Sergei Lavrov. The UK is involved in diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions on Ukraineâs eastern borders, where more than 100,000 Russian troops have amassed. Truss tweeted to say she would âmake clear that Russia must immediately withdraw its forces and respect Ukraineâs sovereignty or face severe consequencesâ. She said an invasion would be âa huge mistakeâ and âdiplomacy is the only way forwardâ. Her visit is the first by a UK foreign secretary for more than four years after a period of rocky relations with Russia. The government has released more details about her agendahere,external.

Elsewhere in politics, the UK's national terror threat level has been reduced but an attack remains likely. Security and intelligence experts have downgraded the threat from ""severe"" - where an attack is deemed to be highly likely - to ""substantial"". Home Secretary Priti Patel says the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre assessment is based on the latest intelligence available. The ""substantial"" threat level still means a terrorist attack on the UK is likely. The threat level was increased to severe in November following the explosion outside a Liverpool hospital on Remembrance Sunday and the fatal stabbing of Southend West MP Sir David Amess at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on 15 October. Patel told MPs the current nature and scale of the UK terrorist threat is consistent with the level of threat seen prior to the attacks but thatpeople should not be ""complacent"". A scientist who advises government says Boris Johnson's plan to lift Covid self-isolation rules a month early ""doesn't seem very cautious"". Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said he was ""very concerned that the number of cases remains very high"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One he thought that as a population we had ""just become rather used to these rather stunning statistics"" of 300 deaths per day. He added: ""I think we're all really looking forward to being able to get back to some sort of normality and we know Omicron is generally fairly mild in people who have immunity and most adults have immunity now, either because we've been vaccinated or because we've been infected or both. ""So, we're going in the right direction, but this doesn't seem very cautious in terms of the potential health impact."" He added it would be ""wholly wrong to say that the pandemic is in any way over"". At the moment, anyone who hasCovid symptomsor who tests positive for Covid via a PCR or lateral flow test must immediately self-isolate. The current regulations expire on 24 March, butthe prime minister told MPs today that he expects to lift them a month earlier in England, as long as the current ""encouraging trends in data continue"". InEnglandandNorthern Irelandyou can leave self-isolation after five full daysif you have two negative lateral flow results, 24 hours apart. InScotlandandWalesyou must self-isolate for at least seven days - as soon assymptomsappear or you test positive. Here's our guide to the self-isolation rules across the UKandhere's how to look after yourself at home. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The latest figures from the ONS are a wrinkle in the ""positive
trends"" that the prime minister described earlier. These are our clearest picture of how many people have Covid:
they don't depend on who gets tested or changing rules about lateral flow and
PCR tests. That's because the ONS estimates infection rates in the community by swabbing people regardless of whether they think they might be infected. And they suggest that infections are on the rise again. After
falling sharply from their New Year peak, they're back up to about 3.3 million
again. Despite record numbers of infections, this January has seen
overall death rates that don't look very different to pre-Covid times. And the
number of people in hospital is still falling. So infections on their own might not change the direction of
travel. If youâre just joining us, youâve missed another tumultuous session of Prime Ministerâs Questions, and plenty of headlines besides. Letâs take stock of whatâs happened: The PM says he wants to end self-isolation rules, given encouraging Covid
trends. Hospital cases are continuing to fall and infections are lower than they once were - but there has been an uptick in rates for the second week running, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS survey suggests that just over 3.3 million people in the UK would test positive for coronavirus in the week ending 5 February. This is up from just under 3.1 million in the previous week. Infections rates were on the rise in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and falling Wales. The trend was uncertain in England. Here are the estimated numbers of people with Covid, for the week ending 5 February:  Boris Johnson will travel to Poland on Thursday as he steps up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine amid fears of a Russian invasion. The prime minister will visit British soldiers stationed in the country, and meetings with Polandâs prime minister and president are scheduled. A meeting with the chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to take place in Brussels on the same day. The trip comes as western countries attempt to defuse tensions on the Ukrainian border, where thousands of Russian troops have amassed. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine but has asked for security guarantees from Nato, including ruling out Ukraine becoming a member, Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was flying to Moscow on Wednesday for talks with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during a two-day trip. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Ministers had always said the rule on self-isolation could end before the planned date of 24 March. The trends are positive - hospital cases are continuing to fall and the huge wave of infections caused by Omicron has not pushed overall deaths above what would normally be seen in winter. But this decision has still taken most by surprise - as infection levels are still high and it's unclear what this will do to the spread of the virus. It is, though, worth bearing in mind that not every infected person was self-isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has only picking up half of all infections - at the peak it was missing around an estimated 200,000 cases a day. What's more, about one in five of those who test positive do not fully adhere to the self-isolation requirements. The move is also likely to pave the way for the dismantling of the community testing system, with many experts believing tests will soon only be used in settings such as care homes and hospitals - or to deal with major outbreaks. England is fast approaching the point where it treats Covid like any other respiratory illness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is touring the tea roomâ¦ again, BBC Newsnight's political editor, Nicholas Watt, hastweeted,external. When a prime minister enters the tea room in the House of Commons after PMQs, it can indicate they're seeking to shore up support among backbench MPs sceptical of their leadership. A series of political controversies - including the Partygate affair - have given those MPs reason to question Johnson's position in recent weeks. Some Conservative MPs have called for Johnson to resign, while others have said they're withholding judgement until the Met Police concludes its investigation into lockdown parties in Downing Street. This week,Johnson has sought to reset his government with a mini-cabinet reshuffle, which followed the departure of several senior advisers. But ultimately, it's MPs who will decide Johnson's fate. If 54 of them send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs Tory leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. Johnson's visit to the tea room may be an attempt to win over MPs whose fingers are on the trigger. His presence hasn't gone unnoticed by one MP, who said the prime minister was ""currently scrambling around the tea room"". ""Desperation"",tweeted,externalStephen Flynn, SNP MP for Aberdeen South. Reality Check Health minister Gillian Keegan
has apologised for continuing a meetingafter finding out she was Covid positivefollowing a lateral flow test. According to barrister Adam Wagner,the minister may have breached Covid guidelines but not necessarily the law,external. Under government guidance - which is
not legally enforced with fines and prosecution â anyone whohas symptomsor tests positive for Covid in
England should self-isolate âstraight awayâ. You no longer need to
take a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow test result. However, the legal requirement
to self-isolate in England is only triggered when you are notified by a
""relevant person"" (usually the NHS). Read more:What are the Covid self-isolation rules? Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the government plans to lift England's remaining Covid restrictions - which are due to end on 24 March - a month early. Asked at the daily lobby briefing if this meant people could go to work if they had Covid, the PM's spokesman said the government would not advise anyone who tests positive to go to work once legal restrictions end. The spokesman said everyone would be expected take steps to reduce the spread of the virus as they would if they had flu. ""What we would simply be doing is removing the domestic regulations which relate to isolation,"" the spokesman added. ""But obviously, in the same way that someone with flu, we wouldn't recommend they go to work, we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Hollywood owners to buy stadium for football club,"This video can not be played Welsh names, penalties and celebrity fans: Wrexham's Hollywood owners visit the Racecourse Wrexham are set to regain the Racecourse Stadium freehold, co-chairmen Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have confirmed. Wrexham's chairmen say talks with owners Wrexham Glyndwr University are at an advanced stage with the purchase expected to be completed before April. The Hollywood actors announced the news on the day they celebrated one year in charge of the National League club. Wrexham have not owned theground's freehold since 2011. ""It was clear even before we bought Wrexham that bringing the Racecourse Ground back to the club was massively important for the fans,"" said the co-chairmen. ""There is nothing more symbolic that owning your own home and while Wrexham Glyndwr University have always been supportive of our ambition, we are delighted to now have control of our own destiny."" Wrexham's Hollywood owners said in June 2021that they wanted the National League club to regain the freehold of their Racecourse Stadium, the oldest football stadium in the world still hosting international games. There are plans to redevelop the Kop as part of the wider Wrexham Gateway Project. The takeover of Wrexham by Hollywood stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney is to be the subject of a documentary series called Welcome to Wrexham. It was one year ago that Deadpool actor Reynolds and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia creator McElhenney invested an immediate Â£2m into Wrexham after completing their takeover. ""The year has gone in the blink of an eye, we have learned so much and more importantly feel like we are fully integrated into everything Wrexham,"" they said in a statement. ""There can be no doubt that the highlight of the year was our visit in October. ""The reception, experience and general feel of warmth moved both of us beyond anything we could have possibly imagined and made us even more determined to be successful. ""We have provided the manager with the playing resources to give ourselves the best chance of gaining promotion."" Wrexham broke their transfer record to sign striker Ollie Palmer from League One AFC Wimbledon for Â£300,000 during the January transfer window. Tom O'Connor and Callum McFadzean were also signed from EFL clubs in January following the high profile summer signings of Paul Mullin, Ben Tozer and Aaron Hayden.

Families avoid Spain for half-term over jab rules,"Canary Island hoteliers want restrictions eased to allow in more British travellers Many UK families have cancelled half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands because children over 12 must be double vaccinated to enter. Hoteliers in the islands say the restrictions have lost them millions of pounds' worth of trade. They have called on the Spanish government to relax its restrictions to allow in more British travellers. Europe's largest tour operator TUI says Mexico and Turkey are proving popular alternatives. From Friday, people travelling to the UK will no longer need to take any Covid tests if they are fully vaccinated. However, Britons going on holiday overseas still need to follow the rules which apply at their destination. How are travel rules being relaxed? It is thought more than 80 holiday destinations around the world will still require travellers from the UK to take a pre-departure PCR test before entering. Travel agents are having to keep up with a fast-changing international patchwork of restrictions. Travel operator Hazel Bryant: Many families are changing their plans Hazel Bryant from Travel with Kitts, an independent agency in Hertfordshire, said the Omicron variant meant a lot of people re-arranged Christmas trips for half-term instead. In February, the Canary Islands is popular with families seeking good weather without too long a flight. However, Hazel says that because the Canaries and mainland Spain require British children over the age of 12 to be double-jabbed, half the families she is dealing with have changed their plans. ""The reasons are, they're not double vaccinated or because they've had Covid in the last six weeks - which means they haven't gone for their second jab. Spain will not allow them in"". She said many affected families were switching destinations or postponing break plans until Easter. ""It is paramount to plan early, because so many people have moved holidays a year or even two years, so it will be busy and full."" Ben Fishlock and his family in Gran Canaria two years ago Ben Fishlock booked a trip to Gran Canaria for February last year for himself, his wife and three children. Travel restrictions meant that trip had to be postponed to this February half-term - that is now off too. Mr Fishlock said: ""The 12-year-old has only just turned 12 so doesn't have his second vaccination yet. The fact he couldn't get vaccinated in time just meant that we had to abort the mission. ""We only cancelled a few days ago. We thought we'd hold out until the first of February in case anything changed but unfortunately we've had to pull the plug."" He says his children were disappointed to learn the holiday would once again not happen. He's hoping to try again later in the year, though. Jorge Marichal from the Tenerife Hoteliers Association wants Spain's Covid rules to be eased Tourism businesses in the Canary Islands say they have lost a significant number of bookings at what is usually a crucial time of year. Jorge Marichal, president of the Tenerife Hoteliers Association, wants the Spanish government to change its rules so that more British families can come. He said: ""The loss could be nearly 400 million euros in the Canary Islands. That's only talking about the hotels - if we take into account the restaurant economy [too] it is a huge impact. ""For us the British market is the biggest one. We have more than 2.5 millon British citizens coming to Tenerife every normal year. For us this part of the year is one of the most important. All these profits will be lost."" Tour operator TUI said recent rule changes were ""a huge leap forwards in getting travel back to normal"". ""We're already seeing a trend of 'test-free holidays' for customers who are fully vaccinated, as people look to go abroad with ease and without the added expense of testing."" The firm said bookings for February half-term and Easter holidays are comparable to 2019, with Mexico, Dominican Republic, Cape Verde and the Canaries the most popular destinations.

Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Spain is not the only country with strict entry requirements for UK visitors, although travel agents say that country's policy on children is proving particularly disruptive. It is not only entry rules people need to pay attention to. In France, for example, over-16s need to prove they are vaccinated to gain access to certain activities, including getting a ski pass. Unvaccinated 12-15-year-olds can take a daily Covid test. Portugal and Greece have both announced an easing of their entry rules this week. Travel association Abta said it was working with its European counterparts to try and encourage greater consistency, and pressing the UK government to lead international efforts to align rules. Despite the travel complications, holiday bookings are rising fast, with the boss of one of Britain's biggest tour firms seeing a huge spike in recent weeks. Dame Irene says customers are flocking back to High Street travel agents Dame Irene Hays, owner of Hays Travel, told the BBC that in the last week of January bookings were back to the level of January 2020, before the pandemic hit. Spain, Greece, Turkey and the US were particularly popular, she said, adding that the average price per booking was up by Â£482 from 2019, with people wanting to treat themselves and stay longer. Dame Irene said customers were also flocking back to High Street travel agents rather booking online, driven by the concerns and complications caused by restrictions and form-filling. ""They want to speak to a human being,"" she said. ""They want to make sure they are getting the best advice before they book. They also need to know somebody will be there for them while they are on their holiday."" Covid map: Where are cases the highest? How are travel rules being relaxed?

Four men found guilty of 'planned execution',"Kenny Reilly was murdered in the Maryhill area of Glasgow in April 2018 Four men have been found guilty of the ""planned execution"" of a man as he sat in a car at a set of traffic lights. John Kennedy, 41, shot 29-year-old Kenny Reilly in the Maryhill area of Glasgow in April 2018. His co-accused Morton Eadie, 56, his son Darren Eadie and Ross Fisher, both 30, were also found guilty of murder. All four were jailed for life. Kennedy must serve at least 26 years, Darren Eadie at least 24 years, and Morton Eadie and Fisher at least 22 years. Kennedy was also accused of the murder of Jamie Campbell in March 2006 but the case against him was found not proven. The verdicts came after a three-month trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. Murder was 'planned execution' in street Murder accused left country on day 'victim' died Four men on trial for murder over Glasgow shooting The judge Lord Beckett said that people who were ""prepared to engage in such meticulously planned and ruthlessly perpetrated assassination on the streets of our cities can expect substantial punishment"". The court heard Mr Reilly's murder was linked to a feud between rival factions in the Possilpark and Maryhill areas of Glasgow. Detectives believe he was killed because Kennedy and his accomplices thought he was responsible for assaulting their friend, Ryan McAteer. And the court also heard claims Mr Reilly owed Â£100,000 to a high-profile criminal. Kennedy told another inmate in Barlinnie that he had carried out the attack One of the key witnesses in the trial said Kennedy had confessed to the killings while in prison. Kevin McGinn, who shared a cell with Kennedy in Glasgow's Barlinnie Prison for 11 days in October 2018, said he had ""whispered in my ear and said to me 'it was me'."" He told police that Kennedy had said the attack was over ""drugs and money"". Mr Reilly was a passenger in a BMW being driven by his friend Emma MacDougall when he was targeted at about 22:20 on 16 April. The pair were travelling to a Chinese restaurant and had stopped at traffic lights at the junction at Bilsland Drive and Maryhill Road. Ms MacDougall, 25, told the court a black Ford S-Max car pull up on the right hand lane. She recalled: ""Somebody came out of the back seats wearing all black - a black balaclava - and started shooting at my car. ""I don't think I have any words for it. It was every single emotion ever. I didn't know whether to drive - I know I needed to phone the police, I knew I needed to phone an ambulance. ""I was trying to remain calm because I knew Kenny had obviously suffered a severe injury."" Police at the scene of the attack in Maryhill Mr Reilly died in hospital two days later from a single gunshot to the head. His attackers sped off to Craigieburn Gardens in Maryhill, where they set the car on fire. But forensic experts found Fisher's DNA on the wreckage and the breakthrough helped officers narrow the list of suspects. The court heard that when Kennedy was arrested in May 2018 he owned a phone which contained Encrochat software. The secure, encrypted messaging app which was mainly used by members of organised crime gangs to plan schemes. Police also learned that Ryan McAteer had been seriously assaulted on 8 April 2018. Police at the scene of Kenny Reilly's murder in Maryhill The jury was told that Darren Eadie blamed Mr Reilly, who was described in court as a ""Possil boy"", for the attack. Police uncovered evidence which showed that Darren Eadie had started planning a revenge attack for which he recruited his father Morton, Ross Fisher and John Kennedy. Officers recovered a mobile phone from Mr McAteer and found a number of incriminating messages in a WhatsApp group in which he and Darren Eadie had participated. Detectives found that the accused were in regular contact with each other in the days leading up to the fatal attack on Mr Reilly, but that the calls stopped afterwards. On the day Mr Reilly died in hospital, Kennedy and his partner flew to Jamaica for a two-week holiday. In the following days Darren and Morton Eadie both left the country. The jury heard this was an attempt to avoid police attention. Prosecutor Steven Borthwick said the evidence showed that Darren Eadie organised the plot, Morton Eadie acted as the getaway driver, Fisher stole the S-Max and set fire to it following the murder, and Kennedy was the gunman. He described Mr Reilly's death as ""a planned execution, brazenly carried out in the street in a residential area of Glasgow"". All four were found guilty of murder and of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by setting fire to the car used in the attack. The offences were aggravated by a connection with serious organised crime. Det Supt Stevie Wallace sad it had been a ""long, complex and challenging"" police investigation. ""Kenny Reilly left behind a family who has sought answers on how and why their loved one was killed,"" he said. ""Although he cannot be brought back, I hope this result will bring some comfort to his family and friends."" Jamie Campbell was shot dead in Drumchapel in 2006 As detectives built their case against Kennedy, they believed they had made a breakthrough in an unsolved murder from March 2006. Jamie Campbell was shot dead in Essenside Drive, Drumchapel. Six spent bullets were found at the scene, which contained the DNA from three different people. Analysis found that one of the forensic profiles may belong to Kennedy. A white burned-out Fiat Ducato van which was found near where Mr Campbell was shot contained items which had Kennedy's DNA on them. His lawyers claimed Glasgow gangster Kevin ""Gerbil"" Carroll, who wasshot deadin an Asda car park in Robroyston, Glasgow in 2010, had been responsible for Mr Campbell's murder. The court heard that police had investigated the claims at the time, and that Carroll gave a statement to officers denying any involvement. But the jury concluded that the case against Kennedy was not proven.

"PM past point of no return, says big Tory donor","This video can not be played Tory donor John Armitage: Leaders who lose moral authority should quit Boris Johnson's premiership is past the point of no return and he should resign, a financier who has given the Conservatives more than Â£3m says. John Armitage told the BBC that challenges facing the West demanded ""serious, engaged"" politicians. He has given the Tories more than Â£500,000 since Mr Johnson became PM but donated Â£12,500 last year to Labour. A Conservative spokesperson said the government remained ""fully focused on delivering for the British people"". On Tuesday, Mr Johnson carried out a mini-reshuffle of his cabinet, as he attempts to reconnect with MPs questioning his future following revelations of parties held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and some of his own MPs are calling on him to resign. But Mr Johnson has insisted he will change the culture within No 10 and focus on delivering the agenda that won him a landslide in the 2019 election. Kuenssberg: Tory donor's candid words may unsettle party Rees-Mogg in new Brexit role as PM reshuffles team Sort it out or step aside, Tory donor tells PM Mr Armitage, co-founder of the hedge fund firm Egerton Capital, told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, he found the current political situation ""tremendously upsetting"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership has come under sustained political pressure in recent weeks Describing himself as a ""middle-of-the-road conservative"", Mr Armitage said he admired politicians on the left and right, and said current global challenges to the West required ''very serious, engaged politicians with a sense of purpose"". ""Politicians should go into politics to do good for their country,"" Mr Armitage added. ""That is the overwhelming reason to be in politics. I don't think it's about your own personal sense of getting to the top of a snakes-and-ladders game. ""And I feel that, if you lose moral authority, and if you do things which the average person - your mother, someone you try to explain to, someone who you admire -  if you do something or say something, which on the front page of the Sunday Times looks terrible, and you do that consistently, and you betray a sense of not really caring, I think you should leave ""And I find the lack of honour inherent in modern politics, incredibly distressing."" Asked if Mr Johnson was ""past the point of no return"", he replied: ""Well, personally yes."" Mr Armitage has given Â£3.1m to the Conservatives although he described himself as a ""very low-profile person"" who does not seek political influence. He has also given much smaller amounts of money to Labour, made individual donations to the former Labour MP Frank Field, and contributed to the Remain campaign in 2016. There's an important community, watching carefully what is going on - party donors, the group that pays the bills. Most of them rarely speak out, if at all. And beyond a few warning shots, they have mainly kept their counsel about the recent chaos. One of their number, though, now feels so strongly that he decided to go public with their concerns. The hedge-fund boss, John Armitage, is perhaps not a tribal Tory. He's no prominent loyalist like, for example, Lord Bamford, whose diggers and huge machines have graced many a Tory photo opportunity. He has also given some small donations to Labour of late. But Mr Armitage has given the Conservatives more than Â£3m in recent years, including more than Â£500,000 during Mr Johnson's time in charge. He is also still a member of the party, so his very candid words are going to hurt. Read more from Laura. It has been a turbulent few months for Mr Johnson, whose government has been dogged by a series of political controversies. The turmoil deepened at the end of January following the publication of a highly critical interim report by senior civil servant Sue Gray, who was investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street. In long-awaited findings,external, Ms Gray said there were ""failures of leadership and judgment"" and a culture of ""excessive"" alcohol consumption within Downing Street. No 10 set for more changes as PM seeks to calm MPs Who is in Boris Johnson's cabinet? Since then, several of Mr Johnson's senior advisers have resigned, leading to the appointment of a new communications director and chief of staff. Tuesday's cabinet reshuffle marked the latest attempt to improve the operation in Downing Street and move on from weeks of political discord within his party. But expressing concern about the standards of leadership in No 10, Mr Armitage said: ""It's about more than like, 'if I'm failing, I've done a few things wrong, oh gosh, I'm going to change my advisers, God above!'. ""What about a sense of personal responsibility? You know, 'I'm going to change my chief of staff and it will all be fine.' Oh, really?"" Mr Armitage said he had told the Conservative Party he would not be giving them any more financial support as things stand, but he does plan to remain a member to retain his vote. He said there were ""competent"" members of the current cabinet, but declined to name a potential successor to Mr Johnson.

Men's doubles Tobias Wendl and Tobis Arlt sparked joy for Germany in the men's luge doubles earlier. You can watch the speed, drama and celebrations below. Mystery still surrounds the team figure skating event after the International Olympic Committee said the medals have yet to be handed out because of a legal issue. The Russian Olympic Committee claimed the win on Monday, ahead of the United States and Japan. They had a mini ceremony at the venue, in which they were handed Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen teddy bears. However the official medal ceremony at a plaza in Beijing should have taken place on Tuesday evening.

Lindsey Jacobellis wins snowboard cross gold Ed LeighSnowboarding commentator on BBC TV Lindsay Jacobellis has won absolutely everything there is to
win in the world of snowboard cross, and yet that moment [at the 2006 Turin
Winter Olympics, when she lost gold by showboating near the finish line has
haunted her for her entire career. It is poetic that someone so talented has finally put that memory
to bed. Jacobellis wins stunning gold Katie FalkinghamBBC Sport in Zhangjiakou If ever there was a lesson in never giving up, Lindsey Jacobellis is its epitome. Showing perseverance at its finest, the American never relented in chasing her Winter Olympic dream, and her fifth Games finally delivered the gold medal she once threw away. Cast your mind back to Turin in 2006. A young Jacobellis, on her first Olympic outing, was seconds clear of the rest of the field in what was the first snowboard cross final on this stage. In a split-second decision she has no doubt long rued, she chose to showboat with the finish line in her sight. Her youthful confidence backfired, and she hit the deck as she watched Switzerland's Tanja Frieden steam past her for the golden moment she'd had within her grasp. Now, 16 years on, and at the age of 36, that gold is finally hers - victory in the Beijing final ensured the ghost was exorcised at long last. Read all of Katie's piece on day five's wonder moment here. Men's round robin Canadaare the first team to win in the men's curling. They were lying three in the eighth end to extend their lead to 10-5 whenDenmarkconceded. We are into the 10th and final end in the other three matches. TheUnited Stateshave fought back to lead theRussian Olympic Committee3-2. It's 4-4 betweenNorwayandSwitzerland, whileSwedenleadChina5-4. If matches are level at the end of 10 ends there will be an extra end, with the team that scores first winning the game. Men's 1500m Sarah LindsayThree-time Olympic short track speed skater on BBC TV Farrell Treacy had Covid last month so he was late coming into the games so he didn't have as much ice time as everybody else. The last few days he's had more ice time and started to settle in and feel more of the ice under his blades and found his way a little bit. This is huge for us, people don't get to watch short track, everybody that watches for the first time they love it, it is exciting, there's lots happening but it is only shown every four years really. To have somebody represent Great Britain so well on such a big stage is very encouraging and hopefully we'll get more people to the ice rinks wanting to try and follow in his footsteps. Men's 1500m Farrell Treacy denies he had a point to prove despite his mistake in the 1000m event, when he was eliminated in the heats after going for the finishing line too early:""That mistake in the 1000m was something I'd never imagined happening, still can't wrap my head around it to be honest, I'll just put it down to illness fog to the head. ""I regrouped, didn't let any of the comments affect me, I'm a big man so you can say what you like. ""I got a bit more ice time and then each round trying to find out a bit more about the ice.

"Brexit causing increased costs and delays, say MPsA cross-party committee of MPs warns things could get worse this year as new import controls come in.BusinessComments","There could be delays at the UK's borders later this year without prompt government action to prepare for new border checks, MPs have warned. A report from the Public Accounts Committee said there was potential for disruption as passenger volumes returned to normal. Logistics UK backed the committee's findings saying traffic could ""grind to a halt"" if more wasn't done soon. The government said there had been minimal border disruption so far. It continued to ensure businesses received the support they needed to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities, a government spokesperson said. But Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Select Committee said there was ""much more work that government should be doing"" to ensure the border was operating effectively and to minimise the current burden on firms trading with the EU. Logistics UK said it was calling on the government to ""take action now"" to ensure new post-Brexit border controls, including checks on agricultural and food products entering the UK, and biometric checks on passengers entering the EU, could be implemented smoothly in the second half of the year. ""We have just enough time,"" said Sarah Laouadi head of European policy at the trade body. But she said firms urgently needed more information about which ports would process which products after 1 July. ""Of course you need advance notice to act on this information,"" said Ms Laouadi. Without it ""the system could potentially grind to halt"" she said, with up to 29-mile-long queues at UK ports this summer. Dover queues: The firms struggling with red tape What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal In January new post-Brexit checks on goods contributed to tail-backs in Kent, due to teething troubles around the new paperwork required, Ms Laouadi said. Container lorries queuing at the Port of Dover The MPs' report said increased costs, delays and paperwork were making it harder for UK businesses to trade as before, and while it was difficult to disentangle the impact of Covid and global economic problems, the cross party committee found Brexit had reduced the UK's trade with the EU. John Grayson said things were already ""verging on the impossible, logistically and financially"" for his business, Earth Natural Foods in London. He has given up importing directly from EU suppliers and has dropped some specific products altogether, like one particular brand of olive oil. He relies on importers instead, but an order takes three weeks to arrive instead of one. ""A one tonne pallet of goods that used to cost Â£200, is now near to Â£600,"" he added. Mary Quicke, an artisan cheesemaker based in Devon said she now worries that her EU customers will run out of patience and stop taking her products if these kinds of problems persist. ""There are just all of these barriers to doing what used to be really, really simple which was agreeing to make a sale and then calling the haulier and off it went and you got paid,"" she told BBC 5 Live. ""Of course they want our cheese, but how long do you carry on doing something you want when it's really tedious and costly and you get charged much more money?"" From 1 July extra checks on agricultural and food imports from the EU will take place at ports around the UK, but with products varying from cut flowers to ready-made lasagne, firms need to know which ports will be authorised to process which products, what the operating hours will be and how they fit with ferry schedules, Logistics UK said. The Public Accounts Committee noted that some of the required infrastructure will not be completed in time and there were still concerns around staffing, including vets. In addition, later this year travellers including HGV drivers entering the EU will need to go through biometric passport checks, involve facial recognition and fingerprint scans, as part of the EU's Entry and Exit System. Ports such as Dover, where EU-entry checks take place on the UK side, therefore need to be adapted to avoid drivers having to get out of their vehicles and walk across lanes of traffic, Ms Laouadi said. The Public Accounts Committee said it was particularly concerned about what would happen when passenger traffic across the UK border returns to normal levels as the pandemic subsides. The PAC report urges the government to write to the committee, within six months, setting out the timetable for its planned programme of work on the ""noteworthy ambition"" to create the world's most effective border by 2025. A government spokeswoman said: ""Traders have adapted well to the introduction of full customs controls on 1 January, with minimal disruption at the border and inbound freight flowing effectively through ports. ""We are continuing to ensure that businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets, including one-to-one advice through the free-to-use Export Support Service."" This report serves as a reminder that in leaving the European Union, the UK did something that no other modern economy has really done before. It created permanent barriers to trade with its nearest neighbours. That may not have been the motivation for Brexit, not its intended purpose. But it has been the practical effect. It means small businesses in particular, which used to trade with the rest of Europe as easily as they trade with other parts of the country, have suddenly been caught in a thicket of bureaucracy. But this is not just about companies that are finding it more difficult to trade. It's about companies that have given up exporting altogether. There is less trade now between Britain and Europe than there used to be, and it hasn't bounced back from Covid lockdowns in the way that trade between other countries has. The government says it's time to look at new markets on the other side of the world instead. But that is a very long-term plan.

DUP criticises government's language law plan,"Legislation on the Irish and Ulster-Scots languages was included in the New Decade, New Approach agreement in January 2020 A political row over the title of the new commissioner for Ulster Scots is being partly blamed for the delay in legislating for a new cultural bill at Westminster, the BBC understands. Last year the government promised to bring legislation for Irish language and Ulster Scots through Westminster. It stepped inafter the Stormont executive failed to pass the cultural billbut the process has been stalled. Now it seems the DUP and Sinn Fein are at odds over the commissioner's title. It is understood the Democratic Unionist Party has argued that the title Ulster Scots commissioner is too narrow and the post should instead be named Ulster British Commissioner. But Sinn FÃ©in say the role is about promoting language, arts and literature and the title should be Ulster Scots Commissioner. The Northern Ireland Office now has been tasked with resolving the stand-off. Irish language law 'due in Parliament next week' Irish language talks back on at Stormont What plans are ahead for NI language and culture? Meanwhile, the NIO Minister Conor Burns yesterdayconfirmed that the government still plans to pass the cultural bill at Westminster before the Assembly electionbut he provided no specific timeline. Mr Burns said the government wanted to pass the legislation to avoid the issue dominating the May election campaign. The DUP's Jonathan Buckley said that was ""disappointing"" and accused the government of being ""tone deaf"" to unionist concerns. However, nationalist parties have questioned the delay in introducing language legislation, with Sinn FÃ©in saying the British government ""must stop dragging its feet"" on the issue. New legislation to protect and enhance both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots was planned as part of the2020 New Decade New Approach agreement. The wide-ranging deal restored Stormont's power-sharing government after a three-year gap, but much of its terms are still to be implemented, including language protections. The 2020 agreement stated legislation would be introduced to""provide official recognition of the status"" of both the Irish language and Ulster-Scots,externalwith a commissioner appointed for each. Conor Burns appeared before the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Tuesday and was asked if language legislation would be pushed through before the forthcoming assembly election on 5 May. ""What I can say, very candidly, is that is our expectation that this is not going to be passed by Stormont before the end of the mandate and dissolution and that we are absolutely expecting that we are going to have to do this in Westminster, and we remain committed to bringing this legislation forward in Westminster,"" he said. NIO minister Conor Burns told MPs on Tuesday it would be ""a good thing if this was completed"" before May's election Mr Burns said he could not reveal the expected date. But he added: ""This is not a nationalist or a unionist piece of legislation but I think we can all agree, it's definitely the government's view that it would be a good thing if this was completed and didn't become a contentious element of what is already going to be a contentious election campaign."" Mr Buckley said the Westminster government could not ""cherry pick"" language provisions of the New Decade New Approach deal while at the same time failing to deal with unionist concerns over post-Brexit trade arrangements at the Irish Sea border. ""Unionism is at its wit's end with hollow commitments from Her Majesty's government on the Northern Ireland Protocol,"" the DUP assembly member told theBBC's Nolan Show. ""While I respect everybody's right to value a language, to participate in speaking a language, my concern primarily is the constitutional and economic impact of the Irish Sea border on the people of Northern Ireland. ""And you know what? If nationalists and indeed those that push for Irish language elements of New Decade New Approach really value that agreement and really value the input of unionists, they would recognise that a key pledge in that agreement was a pledge to protect and strengthen the UK internal market."" The party's West Belfast assembly member Aisling Reilly called on the government to ""get on with implementing its commitments and legislate for an Acht Gaeilge [Irish language legislation]"". ""That legislation needs to faithfully reflect what was negotiated and agreed by the two governments and the political parties in the New Decade New Approach,"" she said. ""Irish language legislation is crucial to delivering rights and guaranteeing protections in law to an ever-growing community of GaeilgeoirÃ­ [Irish speakers] across our island."" Ms Reilly added: ""The British government needs to end the delays, honour its commitments and implement its agreements and end the denial of rights to the Irish language community."" Disputes over Irish language rights have been a source of division between Northern Ireland's two largest parties for several years and it has threatened the future of power-sharing. Last summer, after another crisis at Stormont,Sinn FÃ©in said it would not agree to the appointment of a new DUP first ministerwithout movement on Irish language legislation. The party then asked Secretary of State Brandon Lewis to introduce the laws at Westminster, saying it was the ""only way forward to finally resolve"" the standoff. The DUP's Sammy Wilson objected at the time, warning the government it ""must not interfere in devolved issues at the behest of Sinn FÃ©in"". Late last year, the Northern Ireland Office said it was ""disappointing that the executive has not progressed legislation"" on language and cultural issues. It added that""in the absence of progress on this matter, the UK government is taking the necessary stepsto introduce legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows."" Meanwhile, a bill that allows the Northern Ireland Assembly to continue to meet for at least six months has received royal assent. The Northern Ireland (Ministers, Elections and Petitions of Concern) Bill removes the duty on the government to set an assembly election date, if the roles of first and deputy first minister are not replaced this week. It comes as the executive cannot meet due to theresignation of the DUP's Paul Givan as first ministerin protest at the Northern Ireland Protocol, which unionists argue has disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem On Wednesday, DUP MP Ian Paisley told the House of Commons that the protocol had ""zero support from unionists"" and that a ""one-sided solution will not stand"". Ian Paisley said the Northern Ireland Protocol had zero support from unionists Instead, a resolution must be agreed that ""united people"", he told prime minister's questions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded that any solution required cross-community support and could be fixed with ""good will"". He repeated his threat that if negotiations failed between the UK and the European Union then the government would trigger Article 16, a means of taking unilateral safeguarding measures.

Major breakthrough on nuclear fusion energyA lab in Oxfordshire takes a big step towards harnessing the energy source of the stars.Science & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played Watch the five-second pulse light up the JET reactor European scientists say they have made a major breakthrough in their quest to develop practical nuclear fusion - the energy process that powers the stars. TheUK-based JET laboratory,externalhas smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion can be successfully recreated on Earth it holds out the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy. The experiments produced 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds (11 megawatts of power). This is more than double what was achieved in similar tests back in 1997. It's not a massive energy output - only enough to boil about 60 kettles' worth of water. But the significance is that it validates design choices that have been made for an even bigger fusion reactor now being constructed in France. ""The JET experiments put us a step closer to fusion power,"" said Dr Joe Milnes, the head of operations at the reactor lab. ""We've demonstrated that we can create a mini star inside of our machine and hold it there for five seconds and get high performance, which really takes us into a new realm."" US lab takes further step towards fusion goal Five sites named in nuclear fusion plant shortlist Science leaders: Europe spat will weaken research Ultimately, the process would be used to drive steam turbines to generate electricity The ITER facility in southern France is supported by a consortium of world governments, including from EU member states, the US, China and Russia. It is expected to be the last step in proving nuclear fusion can become a reliable energy provider in the second half of this century. Operating the power plants of the future based on fusion would produce no greenhouse gases and only very small amounts of short-lived radioactive waste. ""These experiments we've just completed had to work,"" said JET CEO Prof Ian Chapman. ""If they hadn't then we'd have real concerns about whether ITER could meet its goals. ""This was high stakes and the fact that we achieved what we did was down to the brilliance of people and their trust in the scientific endeavour,"" he told BBC News. The walls of the JET reactor were changed to a material made from beryllium and tungsten Fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them, as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations. In the core of the Sun, huge gravitational pressures allow this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million Celsius. At the much lower pressures that are possible on Earth, temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million Celsius. No materials exist that can withstand direct contact with such heat. So, to achieve fusion in a lab, scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas, or plasma, is held inside a doughnut-shaped magnetic field. The Joint European Torus (JET), sited at Culham in Oxfordshire, has been pioneering this fusion approach for nearly 40 years. And for the past 10 years, it has been configured to replicate the anticipated ITER set-up. The fusion announcement is great news but sadly it won't help in our battle to lessen the effects of climate change. There's huge uncertainty about when fusion power will be ready for commercialisation. One estimate suggests maybe 20 years. Then fusion would need to scale up, which would mean a delay of perhaps another few decades. And here's the problem: the need for carbon-free energy is urgent - and the government has pledged that all electricity in the UK must be zero emissions by 2035. That means nuclear, renewables and energy storage. In the words of my colleague Jon Amos: ""Fusion is not a solution to get us to 2050 net zero. This is a solution to power society in the second half of this century."" The French lab's preferred ""fuel"" to make the plasma will be a mix of two forms, or isotopes, of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium. JET was asked to demonstrate a lining for the 80-cubic-metre toroidal vessel enclosing the magnetic field that would work efficiently with these isotopes. For its record-breaking experiments in 1997, JET had used carbon, but carbon absorbs tritium, which is radioactive. So for the latest tests, new walls for the vessel were constructed out of the metals beryllium and tungsten. These are 10 times less absorbent. The JET science team then had to tune their plasma to work effectively in this new environment. ""This is a stunning result because they managed to demonstrate the greatest amount of energy output from the fusion reactions of any device in history,"" commented Dr Arthur Turrell, the author of The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion And The Race To Power The Planet. ""It's a landmark because they demonstrated stability of the plasma over five seconds. That doesn't sound very long, but on a nuclear timescale, it's a very, very long time indeed. And it's very easy then to go from five seconds to five minutes, or five hours, or even longer."" French President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and the Queen formally opened JET in 1984 JET can't actually run any longer because its copper electromagnets get too hot. For ITER, internally cooled superconducting magnets will be used. Fusion reactions in the lab famously consume more energy to initiate than they can output. At Jet, two 500 megawatt flywheels are used to run the experiments. But there is solid evidence that this deficit can be overcome in the future as the plasmas are scaled up. ITER's toroidal vessel volume will be 10 times that of JET. It's hoped the French lab will get to breakeven. The commercial power plants that come after should then show a net gain that could be fed into electricity grids. This is a long game and it's significant that of the 300 or so scientists working as JET, a quarter are in the early part of their careers. They will have to carry the baton of research forward. ""Fusion takes a long time, it is complex, it is difficult,"" said Dr Athina Kappatou, who's in her thirties. ""This is why we have to ensure that from one generation to the next, there are the scientists, there are the engineers and the technical staff who can take things forward."" Many technical challenges remain, however. In Europe, these challenges are being worked on by the Eurofusion consortium, which comprises some 5,000 science and engineering experts from across the EU, Switzerland and Ukraine. The UK is a participant, too. Its full involvement in ITER, however, will require first for Britain to ""associate"" to certain EU science programmes, something that so far has been held up by disagreements over post-Brexit trading arrangements, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. JET is likely to be decommissioned after 2023 with ITER beginning plasma experiments in 2025, or soon after.

Uni exam change pledge after student's suicide,"Mared Foulkes took her own life hours after being wrongly told she had failed an exam and would not be able to sit her third year Cardiff University has apologised to the family of a student who took her own life hours after being told she had failed an exam she had passed. Mared Foulkes, 21, from Menai Bridge, Anglesey, received a results email that did not take account of her resit mark. The university said it will simplify its exams process after acoroner said it was ""complex"" and ""confusing"". Iona and Glyngwyn Foulkes said they were sad it took their daughter's death to make changes. They said they would have ""wished for the courtesy and humanity of a personal apology"". Acting North West Wales Coroner, Katie Sutherland, wrote to Cardiff Universityurging them to clarify the systemfor sharing results after an inquest into Mared's death returned a conclusion of suicide. Mared Foulkes was a pharmacy student at Cardiff University when she died Mared had failed a practical assessment as part of the second year of her studies in March 2020, but she passed a resit a month later. But the automated email she received on 8 July 2020 referred only to the original result and indicated that she would not be able to proceed to her third year of study. That evening, Mared drove to a bridge near her home in north Wales, where her body was found. Vice Chancellor of Cardiff University Prof Colin Riordan said the correct process had been followed at the time, which meant resit marks were not confirmed until later. However, he acknowledged there was ""room for confusion"" which had since been ""corrected"" and all marks would now be confirmed at the same time. ""Exam results will be communicated in a way which leaves no room for confusion in the future"", he said. The university said it had set up a group to work on the tone and language used when sharing results, as well as making sure students were directed to support about their results, if they needed it. But Prof Riordan said it would be difficult to give prior notice to students if they were going to get a fail, despite the coroner raising it as a matter of concern. ""You have to be fair and you have to be consistent"", Prof Riordan said, ""so that means we have to inform all students in the same way at the same time of their results and we will need to continue to do that"". Prof Colin Riordan said he was ""deeply sorry for this sequence of events"" In response to Cardiff University's report to the coroner, Iona and Glyngwyn Foulkes said they believed that ""all students will benefit"" from changing the way exam results are shared and it ""may even save some young lives."" But they also questioned why key information about Mared's wellbeing had not been shared with her personal tutor. They added that Cardiff University should consider an opt-in system, similar to Bristol University, where students can consent to a parent or ""trusted person"" being contacted if there are serious concerns about wellbeing. ""Cardiff University can be better because of Mared,"" they said. This video can not be played ""We entrusted her wellbeing to the university,"" said Mared's parents in a statement in October Expressing ""deep condolences"" to Mared's parents, Professor Riordan apologised on behalf of the university. ""I apologise now, absolutely"", he said, speaking to BBC Wales. ""I'm deeply sorry for this sequence of events. It's a devastating set of circumstances and I absolutely understand the family's need for answers to their questions. ""I'm very happy of course to speak to Mared's parents, if that's what they would like."" In a statement her parents said: ""We are dismayed that Cardiff University has chosen to publicly share the actions it has taken since our daughter's death, with the BBC, without any reference to us. ""The university has chosen to go to the media with its account of the actions it has taken without waiting for our comments and reflections following our receipt of its submission to the coroner on 31 January 2022. ""We would have wished for the courtesy and humanity of a personal apology and not one shared with viewers in what appears to be a PR exercise."" The Vice Chancellor said the university had increased mental health support for students during the pandemic, and it took wellbeing and student support ""extremely seriously"". ""I acknowledge we have improvements to make, we have learned from the coroner's report and we will make sure those improvements are made"", he said.

When do you need to self-isolate?,"The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"". Many of the symptomsare similar to those for colds and flu,externaland include: high temperature, fever or chills continuous cough loss of, or change in, your normal sense of taste or smell shortness of breath feeling tired or exhausted aching body headache sore throat blocked or runny nose loss of appetite diarrhoea feeling sick or being sick Most people feel better within a few days or weeks - but for some, it can be more serious. Those concerned their or their child's symptoms are worsening should request an urgent GP appointment or help fromNHS 111,external. WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests. In March, the Office for National Statistics (ONS)estimated 1.9 million people in the UK (2.9% of the population),externalstill had symptoms more than four weeks after their initial infection. There is no simple test for long Covid, andpeople report a variety of symptoms,external, including: extreme tiredness shortness of breath muscle aches memory and concentration problems (""brain fog"") Some people have developed long Covid after an initial mild infection. What are the symptoms of long Covid? Get NHS help with Covid recovery,external Routine Covid testing is not recommended, and most people can't get free tests via the NHS. You may stillbe able to get free NHS tests,externalif you: have a health condition that makes you eligible for treatment if you test positive work in healthcare or a hospice You can buy a test for about Â£2 from High Street and online chemists, but cannot report these test results to the NHS. People are largely advised to treat Covid like any other respiratory disease. You no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive. However, the government recommends trying to stay home for five days - or three for under-18s, as younger people tend to be infectious for a shorter period. People at higher risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid who have been told they areentitled to treatments if they catch it,externalmust report their test result so the NHS can contact them about their options. How to look after yourself if you get Covid Some people are infectious for about five days but others may be contagious for up to 10. Those who have a high temperature or still feel unwell after five days are advised to stay home if they can until they: feel well enough for your normal activities no longer have a high temperature You don't have to tell your employer you have Covid. However, you are asked to avoid contact with others for five days, which means you should work from home if you can, especially if you have a high temperature. The specific schemes offering financial support to those isolating during the pandemic have ended. But you may be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external- worth Â£109.40 a week. Under-18s who test positive for Covid are advised to stay at home for three days.

"Brexit causing increased costs and delays, say MPs","There could be delays at the UK's borders later this year without prompt government action to prepare for new border checks, MPs have warned. A report from the Public Accounts Committee said there was potential for disruption as passenger volumes returned to normal. Logistics UK backed the committee's findings saying traffic could ""grind to a halt"" if more wasn't done soon. The government said there had been minimal border disruption so far. It continued to ensure businesses received the support they needed to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities, a government spokesperson said. But Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Select Committee said there was ""much more work that government should be doing"" to ensure the border was operating effectively and to minimise the current burden on firms trading with the EU. Logistics UK said it was calling on the government to ""take action now"" to ensure new post-Brexit border controls, including checks on agricultural and food products entering the UK, and biometric checks on passengers entering the EU, could be implemented smoothly in the second half of the year. ""We have just enough time,"" said Sarah Laouadi head of European policy at the trade body. But she said firms urgently needed more information about which ports would process which products after 1 July. ""Of course you need advance notice to act on this information,"" said Ms Laouadi. Without it ""the system could potentially grind to halt"" she said, with up to 29-mile-long queues at UK ports this summer. Dover queues: The firms struggling with red tape What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal In January new post-Brexit checks on goods contributed to tail-backs in Kent, due to teething troubles around the new paperwork required, Ms Laouadi said. Container lorries queuing at the Port of Dover The MPs' report said increased costs, delays and paperwork were making it harder for UK businesses to trade as before, and while it was difficult to disentangle the impact of Covid and global economic problems, the cross party committee found Brexit had reduced the UK's trade with the EU. John Grayson said things were already ""verging on the impossible, logistically and financially"" for his business, Earth Natural Foods in London. He has given up importing directly from EU suppliers and has dropped some specific products altogether, like one particular brand of olive oil. He relies on importers instead, but an order takes three weeks to arrive instead of one. ""A one tonne pallet of goods that used to cost Â£200, is now near to Â£600,"" he added. Mary Quicke, an artisan cheesemaker based in Devon said she now worries that her EU customers will run out of patience and stop taking her products if these kinds of problems persist. ""There are just all of these barriers to doing what used to be really, really simple which was agreeing to make a sale and then calling the haulier and off it went and you got paid,"" she told BBC 5 Live. ""Of course they want our cheese, but how long do you carry on doing something you want when it's really tedious and costly and you get charged much more money?"" From 1 July extra checks on agricultural and food imports from the EU will take place at ports around the UK, but with products varying from cut flowers to ready-made lasagne, firms need to know which ports will be authorised to process which products, what the operating hours will be and how they fit with ferry schedules, Logistics UK said. The Public Accounts Committee noted that some of the required infrastructure will not be completed in time and there were still concerns around staffing, including vets. In addition, later this year travellers including HGV drivers entering the EU will need to go through biometric passport checks, involve facial recognition and fingerprint scans, as part of the EU's Entry and Exit System. Ports such as Dover, where EU-entry checks take place on the UK side, therefore need to be adapted to avoid drivers having to get out of their vehicles and walk across lanes of traffic, Ms Laouadi said. The Public Accounts Committee said it was particularly concerned about what would happen when passenger traffic across the UK border returns to normal levels as the pandemic subsides. The PAC report urges the government to write to the committee, within six months, setting out the timetable for its planned programme of work on the ""noteworthy ambition"" to create the world's most effective border by 2025. A government spokeswoman said: ""Traders have adapted well to the introduction of full customs controls on 1 January, with minimal disruption at the border and inbound freight flowing effectively through ports. ""We are continuing to ensure that businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets, including one-to-one advice through the free-to-use Export Support Service."" This report serves as a reminder that in leaving the European Union, the UK did something that no other modern economy has really done before. It created permanent barriers to trade with its nearest neighbours. That may not have been the motivation for Brexit, not its intended purpose. But it has been the practical effect. It means small businesses in particular, which used to trade with the rest of Europe as easily as they trade with other parts of the country, have suddenly been caught in a thicket of bureaucracy. But this is not just about companies that are finding it more difficult to trade. It's about companies that have given up exporting altogether. There is less trade now between Britain and Europe than there used to be, and it hasn't bounced back from Covid lockdowns in the way that trade between other countries has. The government says it's time to look at new markets on the other side of the world instead. But that is a very long-term plan.

University in $250m payout for doctor's sex abuse,"Gynaecologist James Heaps also faces criminals sexual abuse charges The University of California has agreed to pay nearly $250m (Â£185m) to over 200 women who allege they were sexually assaulted by a campus gynaecologist. Multiple women accuse the university's Los Angeles site (UCLA) of deliberately hiding James Heaps' alleged sexual abuse of patients. Mr Heaps was based at the UCLA student health centre during his 35-year career between 1983 and 2018. Hundreds of women, some of whom had cancer, say they were abused by him. The university did not begin investigating complaints against Mr Heaps until 2017. It has been accused in hundreds of lawsuits of deliberately hiding the gynaecologist's alleged sexual abuse of patients. His medical licence was suspended by a judge in 2019 for the duration of the sex abuse case. The university said it hoped the financial settlement would provide ""healing and closure"" for the women involved. Mr Heaps faces 21 criminal counts of sexual abuse against seven women and has pleaded not guilty. ""The conduct alleged to have been committed by Heaps is reprehensible and contrary to the University's values,"" a UCLA statement said on Tuesday. ""Our first and highest obligation will always be to the communities we serve, and we hope this settlement is one step toward providing healing and closure for the plaintiffs involved."" But Kara Cagle, a breast cancer survivor who reported Mr Heaps while she was undergoing treatment at the university, told the Los Angeles Times: ""Today, after eight long years, I received recognition of what happened to me. ""Although there is some consolation in that, my heart breaks for all the women who were not spared, all the women who suffered after me, because UCLA refused to act."" Tuesday's settlement does not halt an ongoing lawsuit by more than 300 patients. Last July, a federal judge approved a $73m settlement against Mr Heaps, which was brought by more than 5,500 women. According to lawyers in the case, he was once the highest paid doctor in the entire University of California system. John C Manley, a lawyer representing one of the women who has filed criminal charges against Mr Heaps, alleged he was a sophisticated predator who committed abuse under the guise of normal medical examinations. ""He was a board-certified gynaecologist and a board-certified oncologist. Most of the women...  were there because they had cancer or they thought they had cancer,"" Mr Manley told the BBC. The federal lawsuits said that Mr Heaps was not properly investigated until the university received a complaint in 2017, and that he was allowed to continue seeing patients during the inquiry into his actions, and even after the university told him that his contract would not be renewed. The latest payout follows a series of a large settlements with US universities over patient abuse by campus doctors. Last month,the University of Michigan reached a $490msettlement with more than 1,000 people who say they were abused by a sports doctor during his four-decade career. Meanwhile, three women are suing another of America's most prestigious colleges, Harvard, on the grounds it also ignored sexual harassment allegations. Professor John Comaroff, an anthropologist, denies their allegations that he kissed and groped them.

Major breakthrough on nuclear fusion energyA lab in Oxfordshire takes a big step towards harnessing the energy source of the stars.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Watch the five-second pulse light up the JET reactor European scientists say they have made a major breakthrough in their quest to develop practical nuclear fusion - the energy process that powers the stars. TheUK-based JET laboratory,externalhas smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion can be successfully recreated on Earth it holds out the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy. The experiments produced 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds (11 megawatts of power). This is more than double what was achieved in similar tests back in 1997. It's not a massive energy output - only enough to boil about 60 kettles' worth of water. But the significance is that it validates design choices that have been made for an even bigger fusion reactor now being constructed in France. ""The JET experiments put us a step closer to fusion power,"" said Dr Joe Milnes, the head of operations at the reactor lab. ""We've demonstrated that we can create a mini star inside of our machine and hold it there for five seconds and get high performance, which really takes us into a new realm."" US lab takes further step towards fusion goal Five sites named in nuclear fusion plant shortlist Science leaders: Europe spat will weaken research Ultimately, the process would be used to drive steam turbines to generate electricity The ITER facility in southern France is supported by a consortium of world governments, including from EU member states, the US, China and Russia. It is expected to be the last step in proving nuclear fusion can become a reliable energy provider in the second half of this century. Operating the power plants of the future based on fusion would produce no greenhouse gases and only very small amounts of short-lived radioactive waste. ""These experiments we've just completed had to work,"" said JET CEO Prof Ian Chapman. ""If they hadn't then we'd have real concerns about whether ITER could meet its goals. ""This was high stakes and the fact that we achieved what we did was down to the brilliance of people and their trust in the scientific endeavour,"" he told BBC News. The walls of the JET reactor were changed to a material made from beryllium and tungsten Fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them, as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations. In the core of the Sun, huge gravitational pressures allow this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million Celsius. At the much lower pressures that are possible on Earth, temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million Celsius. No materials exist that can withstand direct contact with such heat. So, to achieve fusion in a lab, scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas, or plasma, is held inside a doughnut-shaped magnetic field. The Joint European Torus (JET), sited at Culham in Oxfordshire, has been pioneering this fusion approach for nearly 40 years. And for the past 10 years, it has been configured to replicate the anticipated ITER set-up. The fusion announcement is great news but sadly it won't help in our battle to lessen the effects of climate change. There's huge uncertainty about when fusion power will be ready for commercialisation. One estimate suggests maybe 20 years. Then fusion would need to scale up, which would mean a delay of perhaps another few decades. And here's the problem: the need for carbon-free energy is urgent - and the government has pledged that all electricity in the UK must be zero emissions by 2035. That means nuclear, renewables and energy storage. In the words of my colleague Jon Amos: ""Fusion is not a solution to get us to 2050 net zero. This is a solution to power society in the second half of this century."" The French lab's preferred ""fuel"" to make the plasma will be a mix of two forms, or isotopes, of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium. JET was asked to demonstrate a lining for the 80-cubic-metre toroidal vessel enclosing the magnetic field that would work efficiently with these isotopes. For its record-breaking experiments in 1997, JET had used carbon, but carbon absorbs tritium, which is radioactive. So for the latest tests, new walls for the vessel were constructed out of the metals beryllium and tungsten. These are 10 times less absorbent. The JET science team then had to tune their plasma to work effectively in this new environment. ""This is a stunning result because they managed to demonstrate the greatest amount of energy output from the fusion reactions of any device in history,"" commented Dr Arthur Turrell, the author of The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion And The Race To Power The Planet. ""It's a landmark because they demonstrated stability of the plasma over five seconds. That doesn't sound very long, but on a nuclear timescale, it's a very, very long time indeed. And it's very easy then to go from five seconds to five minutes, or five hours, or even longer."" French President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and the Queen formally opened JET in 1984 JET can't actually run any longer because its copper electromagnets get too hot. For ITER, internally cooled superconducting magnets will be used. Fusion reactions in the lab famously consume more energy to initiate than they can output. At Jet, two 500 megawatt flywheels are used to run the experiments. But there is solid evidence that this deficit can be overcome in the future as the plasmas are scaled up. ITER's toroidal vessel volume will be 10 times that of JET. It's hoped the French lab will get to breakeven. The commercial power plants that come after should then show a net gain that could be fed into electricity grids. This is a long game and it's significant that of the 300 or so scientists working as JET, a quarter are in the early part of their careers. They will have to carry the baton of research forward. ""Fusion takes a long time, it is complex, it is difficult,"" said Dr Athina Kappatou, who's in her thirties. ""This is why we have to ensure that from one generation to the next, there are the scientists, there are the engineers and the technical staff who can take things forward."" Many technical challenges remain, however. In Europe, these challenges are being worked on by the Eurofusion consortium, which comprises some 5,000 science and engineering experts from across the EU, Switzerland and Ukraine. The UK is a participant, too. Its full involvement in ITER, however, will require first for Britain to ""associate"" to certain EU science programmes, something that so far has been held up by disagreements over post-Brexit trading arrangements, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. JET is likely to be decommissioned after 2023 with ITER beginning plasma experiments in 2025, or soon after.

And for the past 10 years, it has been configured to replicate the anticipated ITER set-up. The fusion announcement is great news but sadly it won't help in our battle to lessen the effects of climate change. There's huge uncertainty about when fusion power will be ready for commercialisation. One estimate suggests maybe 20 years. Then fusion would need to scale up, which would mean a delay of perhaps another few decades. And here's the problem: the need for carbon-free energy is urgent - and the government has pledged that all electricity in the UK must be zero emissions by 2035. That means nuclear, renewables and energy storage. In the words of my colleague Jon Amos: ""Fusion is not a solution to get us to 2050 net zero. This is a solution to power society in the second half of this century."" The French lab's preferred ""fuel"" to make the plasma will be a mix of two forms, or isotopes, of hydrogen called deuterium and tritium. JET was asked to demonstrate a lining for the 80-cubic-metre toroidal vessel enclosing the magnetic field that would work efficiently with these isotopes. For its record-breaking experiments in 1997, JET had used carbon, but carbon absorbs tritium, which is radioactive. So for the latest tests, new walls for the vessel were constructed out of the metals beryllium and tungsten. These are 10 times less absorbent. The JET science team then had to tune their plasma to work effectively in this new environment. ""This is a stunning result because they managed to demonstrate the greatest amount of energy output from the fusion reactions of any device in history,"" commented Dr Arthur Turrell, the author of The Star Builders: Nuclear Fusion And The Race To Power The Planet. ""It's a landmark because they demonstrated stability of the plasma over five seconds. That doesn't sound very long, but on a nuclear timescale, it's a very, very long time indeed. And it's very easy then to go from five seconds to five minutes, or five hours, or even longer."" French President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and the Queen formally opened JET in 1984 JET can't actually run any longer because its copper electromagnets get too hot. For ITER, internally cooled superconducting magnets will be used. Fusion reactions in the lab famously consume more energy to initiate than they can output. At Jet, two 500 megawatt flywheels are used to run the experiments. But there is solid evidence that this deficit can be overcome in the future as the plasmas are scaled up. ITER's toroidal vessel volume will be 10 times that of JET. It's hoped the French lab will get to breakeven. The commercial power plants that come after should then show a net gain that could be fed into electricity grids. This is a long game and it's significant that of the 300 or so scientists working as JET, a quarter are in the early part of their careers. They will have to carry the baton of research forward. ""Fusion takes a long time, it is complex, it is difficult,"" said Dr Athina Kappatou, who's in her thirties. ""This is why we have to ensure that from one generation to the next, there are the scientists, there are the engineers and the technical staff who can take things forward."" Many technical challenges remain, however. In Europe, these challenges are being worked on by the Eurofusion consortium, which comprises some 5,000 science and engineering experts from across the EU, Switzerland and Ukraine. The UK is a participant, too. Its full involvement in ITER, however, will require first for Britain to ""associate"" to certain EU science programmes, something that so far has been held up by disagreements over post-Brexit trading arrangements, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. JET is likely to be decommissioned after 2023 with ITER beginning plasma experiments in 2025, or soon after.

Major breakthrough on nuclear fusion energyThe European JET facility takes a big step towards harnessing the energy source of the stars.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Watch the five-second pulse light up the JET reactor European scientists say they have made a major breakthrough in their quest to develop practical nuclear fusion - the energy process that powers the stars. TheUK-based JET laboratory,externalhas smashed its own world record for the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of hydrogen. If nuclear fusion can be successfully recreated on Earth it holds out the potential of virtually unlimited supplies of low-carbon, low-radiation energy. The experiments produced 59 megajoules of energy over five seconds (11 megawatts of power). This is more than double what was achieved in similar tests back in 1997. It's not a massive energy output - only enough to boil about 60 kettles' worth of water. But the significance is that it validates design choices that have been made for an even bigger fusion reactor now being constructed in France. ""The JET experiments put us a step closer to fusion power,"" said Dr Joe Milnes, the head of operations at the reactor lab. ""We've demonstrated that we can create a mini star inside of our machine and hold it there for five seconds and get high performance, which really takes us into a new realm."" US lab takes further step towards fusion goal Five sites named in nuclear fusion plant shortlist Science leaders: Europe spat will weaken research Ultimately, the process would be used to drive steam turbines to generate electricity The ITER facility in southern France is supported by a consortium of world governments, including from EU member states, the US, China and Russia. It is expected to be the last step in proving nuclear fusion can become a reliable energy provider in the second half of this century. Operating the power plants of the future based on fusion would produce no greenhouse gases and only very small amounts of short-lived radioactive waste. ""These experiments we've just completed had to work,"" said JET CEO Prof Ian Chapman. ""If they hadn't then we'd have real concerns about whether ITER could meet its goals. ""This was high stakes and the fact that we achieved what we did was down to the brilliance of people and their trust in the scientific endeavour,"" he told BBC News. The walls of the JET reactor were changed to a material made from beryllium and tungsten Fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them, as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations. In the core of the Sun, huge gravitational pressures allow this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million Celsius. At the much lower pressures that are possible on Earth, temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million Celsius. No materials exist that can withstand direct contact with such heat.

"PM past point of no return, says big Tory donorFinancier John Armitage says he believes the UK's challenges require ""serious, engaged"" politicians.UK Politics","This video can not be played Tory donor John Armitage: Leaders who lose moral authority should quit Boris Johnson's premiership is past the point of no return and he should resign, a financier who has given the Conservatives more than Â£3m says. John Armitage told the BBC that challenges facing the West demanded ""serious, engaged"" politicians. He has given the Tories more than Â£500,000 since Mr Johnson became PM but donated Â£12,500 last year to Labour. A Conservative spokesperson said the government remained ""fully focused on delivering for the British people"". On Tuesday, Mr Johnson carried out a mini-reshuffle of his cabinet, as he attempts to reconnect with MPs questioning his future following revelations of parties held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns. Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP and some of his own MPs are calling on him to resign. But Mr Johnson has insisted he will change the culture within No 10 and focus on delivering the agenda that won him a landslide in the 2019 election. Kuenssberg: Tory donor's candid words may unsettle party Rees-Mogg in new Brexit role as PM reshuffles team Sort it out or step aside, Tory donor tells PM Mr Armitage, co-founder of the hedge fund firm Egerton Capital, told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, he found the current political situation ""tremendously upsetting"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership has come under sustained political pressure in recent weeks Describing himself as a ""middle-of-the-road conservative"", Mr Armitage said he admired politicians on the left and right, and said current global challenges to the West required ''very serious, engaged politicians with a sense of purpose"". ""Politicians should go into politics to do good for their country,"" Mr Armitage added. ""That is the overwhelming reason to be in politics. I don't think it's about your own personal sense of getting to the top of a snakes-and-ladders game. ""And I feel that, if you lose moral authority, and if you do things which the average person - your mother, someone you try to explain to, someone who you admire -  if you do something or say something, which on the front page of the Sunday Times looks terrible, and you do that consistently, and you betray a sense of not really caring, I think you should leave ""And I find the lack of honour inherent in modern politics, incredibly distressing."" Asked if Mr Johnson was ""past the point of no return"", he replied: ""Well, personally yes."" Mr Armitage has given Â£3.1m to the Conservatives although he described himself as a ""very low-profile person"" who does not seek political influence. He has also given much smaller amounts of money to Labour, made individual donations to the former Labour MP Frank Field, and contributed to the Remain campaign in 2016. There's an important community, watching carefully what is going on - party donors, the group that pays the bills. Most of them rarely speak out, if at all. And beyond a few warning shots, they have mainly kept their counsel about the recent chaos. One of their number, though, now feels so strongly that he decided to go public with their concerns. The hedge-fund boss, John Armitage, is perhaps not a tribal Tory. He's no prominent loyalist like, for example, Lord Bamford, whose diggers and huge machines have graced many a Tory photo opportunity. He has also given some small donations to Labour of late. But Mr Armitage has given the Conservatives more than Â£3m in recent years, including more than Â£500,000 during Mr Johnson's time in charge. He is also still a member of the party, so his very candid words are going to hurt. Read more from Laura. It has been a turbulent few months for Mr Johnson, whose government has been dogged by a series of political controversies. The turmoil deepened at the end of January following the publication of a highly critical interim report by senior civil servant Sue Gray, who was investigating lockdown parties in Downing Street. In long-awaited findings,external, Ms Gray said there were ""failures of leadership and judgment"" and a culture of ""excessive"" alcohol consumption within Downing Street. No 10 set for more changes as PM seeks to calm MPs Who is in Boris Johnson's cabinet? Since then, several of Mr Johnson's senior advisers have resigned, leading to the appointment of a new communications director and chief of staff. Tuesday's cabinet reshuffle marked the latest attempt to improve the operation in Downing Street and move on from weeks of political discord within his party. But expressing concern about the standards of leadership in No 10, Mr Armitage said: ""It's about more than like, 'if I'm failing, I've done a few things wrong, oh gosh, I'm going to change my advisers, God above!'. ""What about a sense of personal responsibility? You know, 'I'm going to change my chief of staff and it will all be fine.' Oh, really?"" Mr Armitage said he had told the Conservative Party he would not be giving them any more financial support as things stand, but he does plan to remain a member to retain his vote. He said there were ""competent"" members of the current cabinet, but declined to name a potential successor to Mr Johnson.

Greggs and Primark to launch fashion range,"The collection contains a hoodie with the Greggs logo Fast food and fast fashion may not seem like natural bedfellows, but that is set to change. Retailer Primark has announced it will launch an exclusive clothing range with the bakery chain Greggs, sparking a mixed response on social media. A limited-edition, 11-piece clothing collection will be available in 60 Primark stores later this month. Greggs will also open a 130-seater cafÃ© in Primark's flagship Birmingham store. More details of what will be included in the clothing range will be shared nearer the launch date, but photos of a hoodie featuring the Greggs logo and the message ""It's a pastry thing"" written along one arm have been published. The two retailers teased the tie-up last week, when mannequins at several Primark stores were seen adorned with Greggs' sausage rolls and steak bakes. It has attracted a mixed response on social media, with some people asking if it was a parody and one tweeting: ""PR Stunt of the Day"". Allow Twitter content?

Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said the prime minister's announcement on the early lifting of remaining Covid restrictions in England were intended to detract attention from his current political difficulties. ""The fact we had no notice this was coming, no sense it was coming, suggests that some throwaway remarks at the start of Prime Minister's Questions were more about digging the prime minister out of a political hole than dealing with the serious challenge facing the country,"" he told the BBC. Streeting also said the government needed a ""real plan for living well with Covid"", adding Labour had published its own plan ""weeks ago"" and that the prime minister was ""welcome to nick it"". People in the ""real world"" don't care about parties held in Downing Street during lockdown, the new leader of the House of Commons says. Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham ""what really mattered"" to people was their energy bills, NHS backlogs and jobs. Spencer replaced Jacob Rees-Mogg as Commons leader in a cabinet reshuffle. He was formerly the government chief whip, in charge of party discipline. The Sherwood MP said he could not comment further on government lockdown parties because of the police investigation, but said: ""Clearly people were having a drink, I've done that. I've had a drink of alcohol during Covid."" He said: ""When you get out into the real world and you talk to real people, my experience is they are saying to me 'you know what really matters to me is the cost of my energy bills, the NHS backlog post-Covid,making sure the economy is growing and my job is secure'."" On the issue of the Downing Street parties, Conservative MP Robbie Moore has given ascathing interview to a local newspaper,external. He said he shared the ""rage and anger"" felt by his constituents. Moor said he had spoken with the prime minister following the publication of an interim report into the parties. The report by senior civil servant Sue Gray ""confirmed the fury and disgust I already had about the reported parties and social events, and indeed the culture of rule-breaking in Downing Street"", Moore said. He said he told Johnson the current situation ""is not sustainable and that things must changeâ. In the interview, Moore did not say whether he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson's leadership. If 54 of Tory MPs send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs the party's leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, Labour's Fabian Hamilton asked Boris
Johnson to explain aphoto that appears to show the PM and others with a bottle of bubbly and food at a Christmas partyduring lockdown. During PMQs, Hamilton asked
the PM if it showed an event ""like one of the Christmas parties he told us
never happened"". Earlier, the PM said encouraging trends could mean the UK's Covid rules end early - so let's have a look at what today's data tells us. A further68,214new coronavirus infections have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This is the lowest number of cases since Friday. It puts the average number of cases over the last seven days at485,074. This is down143,469or22.8%on the previous week. There have also been276deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data shows. That makes the weekly average1,526which is down298on the previous seven days and represents a16.3%drop. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Police will take no further action over accusations of bullying and intimidation towards MPs by government whips and Downing Street, the BBC has been told. The Conservative MP William Wragg confirmed that he had been told by the Metropolitan police that there was no evidence of any criminal offence, as first reported by the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Last month he told a committeethat Tory whips had threatened those suspected of wanting Boris Johnson out with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. The backbencher, who has called for the prime minister to resign, met detectives to discuss the allegations. Downing Street previously said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleged. Some Tory MPs are keen to see what one described as âsignificant culture changeâ in government and noted the removal of the former Chief Whip Mark Spencer from his post in yesterdayâs reshuffle. The Met has been approached for comment. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has arrived in Moscow ahead of talks about the crisis in eastern Ukraine with veteran Russian diplomat Sergei Lavrov. The UK is involved in diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions on Ukraineâs eastern borders, where more than 100,000 Russian troops have amassed. Truss tweeted to say she would âmake clear that Russia must immediately withdraw its forces and respect Ukraineâs sovereignty or face severe consequencesâ. She said an invasion would be âa huge mistakeâ and âdiplomacy is the only way forwardâ. Her visit is the first by a UK foreign secretary for more than four years after a period of rocky relations with Russia. The government has released more details about her agendahere,external.

Elsewhere in politics, the UK's national terror threat level has been reduced but an attack remains likely. Security and intelligence experts have downgraded the threat from ""severe"" - where an attack is deemed to be highly likely - to ""substantial"". Home Secretary Priti Patel says the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre assessment is based on the latest intelligence available. The ""substantial"" threat level still means a terrorist attack on the UK is likely. The threat level was increased to severe in November following the explosion outside a Liverpool hospital on Remembrance Sunday and the fatal stabbing of Southend West MP Sir David Amess at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on 15 October. Patel told MPs the current nature and scale of the UK terrorist threat is consistent with the level of threat seen prior to the attacks but thatpeople should not be ""complacent"". A scientist who advises government says Boris Johnson's plan to lift Covid self-isolation rules a month early ""doesn't seem very cautious"". Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said he was ""very concerned that the number of cases remains very high"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One he thought that as a population we had ""just become rather used to these rather stunning statistics"" of 300 deaths per day. He added: ""I think we're all really looking forward to being able to get back to some sort of normality and we know Omicron is generally fairly mild in people who have immunity and most adults have immunity now, either because we've been vaccinated or because we've been infected or both. ""So, we're going in the right direction, but this doesn't seem very cautious in terms of the potential health impact."" He added it would be ""wholly wrong to say that the pandemic is in any way over"". At the moment, anyone who hasCovid symptomsor who tests positive for Covid via a PCR or lateral flow test must immediately self-isolate. The current regulations expire on 24 March, butthe prime minister told MPs today that he expects to lift them a month earlier in England, as long as the current ""encouraging trends in data continue"". InEnglandandNorthern Irelandyou can leave self-isolation after five full daysif you have two negative lateral flow results, 24 hours apart. InScotlandandWalesyou must self-isolate for at least seven days - as soon assymptomsappear or you test positive. Here's our guide to the self-isolation rules across the UKandhere's how to look after yourself at home. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The latest figures from the ONS are a wrinkle in the ""positive
trends"" that the prime minister described earlier. These are our clearest picture of how many people have Covid:
they don't depend on who gets tested or changing rules about lateral flow and
PCR tests. That's because the ONS estimates infection rates in the community by swabbing people regardless of whether they think they might be infected. And they suggest that infections are on the rise again. After
falling sharply from their New Year peak, they're back up to about 3.3 million
again. Despite record numbers of infections, this January has seen
overall death rates that don't look very different to pre-Covid times. And the
number of people in hospital is still falling. So infections on their own might not change the direction of
travel. If youâre just joining us, youâve missed another tumultuous session of Prime Ministerâs Questions, and plenty of headlines besides. Letâs take stock of whatâs happened: The PM says he wants to end self-isolation rules, given encouraging Covid
trends. Hospital cases are continuing to fall and infections are lower than they once were - but there has been an uptick in rates for the second week running, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS survey suggests that just over 3.3 million people in the UK would test positive for coronavirus in the week ending 5 February. This is up from just under 3.1 million in the previous week. Infections rates were on the rise in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and falling Wales. The trend was uncertain in England. Here are the estimated numbers of people with Covid, for the week ending 5 February:  Boris Johnson will travel to Poland on Thursday as he steps up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine amid fears of a Russian invasion. The prime minister will visit British soldiers stationed in the country, and meetings with Polandâs prime minister and president are scheduled. A meeting with the chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to take place in Brussels on the same day. The trip comes as western countries attempt to defuse tensions on the Ukrainian border, where thousands of Russian troops have amassed. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine but has asked for security guarantees from Nato, including ruling out Ukraine becoming a member, Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was flying to Moscow on Wednesday for talks with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during a two-day trip. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Ministers had always said the rule on self-isolation could end before the planned date of 24 March. The trends are positive - hospital cases are continuing to fall and the huge wave of infections caused by Omicron has not pushed overall deaths above what would normally be seen in winter. But this decision has still taken most by surprise - as infection levels are still high and it's unclear what this will do to the spread of the virus. It is, though, worth bearing in mind that not every infected person was self-isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has only picking up half of all infections - at the peak it was missing around an estimated 200,000 cases a day. What's more, about one in five of those who test positive do not fully adhere to the self-isolation requirements. The move is also likely to pave the way for the dismantling of the community testing system, with many experts believing tests will soon only be used in settings such as care homes and hospitals - or to deal with major outbreaks. England is fast approaching the point where it treats Covid like any other respiratory illness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is touring the tea roomâ¦ again, BBC Newsnight's political editor, Nicholas Watt, hastweeted,external. When a prime minister enters the tea room in the House of Commons after PMQs, it can indicate they're seeking to shore up support among backbench MPs sceptical of their leadership. A series of political controversies - including the Partygate affair - have given those MPs reason to question Johnson's position in recent weeks. Some Conservative MPs have called for Johnson to resign, while others have said they're withholding judgement until the Met Police concludes its investigation into lockdown parties in Downing Street. This week,Johnson has sought to reset his government with a mini-cabinet reshuffle, which followed the departure of several senior advisers. But ultimately, it's MPs who will decide Johnson's fate. If 54 of them send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs Tory leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. Johnson's visit to the tea room may be an attempt to win over MPs whose fingers are on the trigger. His presence hasn't gone unnoticed by one MP, who said the prime minister was ""currently scrambling around the tea room"". ""Desperation"",tweeted,externalStephen Flynn, SNP MP for Aberdeen South. Reality Check Health minister Gillian Keegan
has apologised for continuing a meetingafter finding out she was Covid positivefollowing a lateral flow test. According to barrister Adam Wagner,the minister may have breached Covid guidelines but not necessarily the law,external. Under government guidance - which is
not legally enforced with fines and prosecution â anyone whohas symptomsor tests positive for Covid in
England should self-isolate âstraight awayâ. You no longer need to
take a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow test result. However, the legal requirement
to self-isolate in England is only triggered when you are notified by a
""relevant person"" (usually the NHS). Read more:What are the Covid self-isolation rules? Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the government plans to lift England's remaining Covid restrictions - which are due to end on 24 March - a month early. Asked at the daily lobby briefing if this meant people could go to work if they had Covid, the PM's spokesman said the government would not advise anyone who tests positive to go to work once legal restrictions end. The spokesman said everyone would be expected take steps to reduce the spread of the virus as they would if they had flu. ""What we would simply be doing is removing the domestic regulations which relate to isolation,"" the spokesman added. ""But obviously, in the same way that someone with flu, we wouldn't recommend they go to work, we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease."" Â© 2025 BBC.

The firms struggling with red tape,"On the approach into Dover, there are queues of lorries parked in one lane of the A20, stretching back for miles. They're being held along this road to avoid congesting the town, as they wait to board ferries across the Channel. Queues are not uncommon close to Britain's main trading hub with the EU, but they've been really long in recent weeks. And a month after more post-Brexit border bureaucracy came into force, many businesses, smaller ones especially, are struggling to cope. Drivers waiting at a customs facility in Dover - most of them from elsewhere in Europe - are phlegmatic, but fed up. ""I'm waiting maybe one hour, next week maybe five hours, it's always different,"" said one. ""When we're waiting, there's no money,"" said another. What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? Dover queues: Traffic builds on the A20 in Kent For drivers who are paid by the kilometre that's a real concern and it means some will be reluctant to come back. The drivers blame cancelled ferry crossings - there are temporarily fewer ferries in operation than normal. But they also cite the post-Brexit rules that now govern their working lives. Last year, which was Britain's first outside the EU single market and customs union, companies had 60 days to fill in UK customs documents after exporting goods to the EU. But since 1 January, those forms have to completed in full, before lorries and vans can board ferries heading for Europe every day. Thousands of drivers need to get their documents checked and the process is taking time. ""For us, the government is staging Brexit bit-by-bit,"" says John Shirley, who's run a freight-forwarding company in Dover for 25 years. ""That's caused all sorts of headaches for people, they don't know the paperwork properly or haven't prepared themselves - that's what's causing the delays here."" John Shirley says he suspects the situation will not improve He recounts meeting a driver earlier in the week who had been stuck in Dover for four days, with a lorry going to Germany in a journey which used to be routine. Won't it get better with time, I suggest, as companies get used to a new system? ""I don't know, I suspect it won't do,"" he replies. ""And in July we get an additional set of controls on foodstuffs."" That is a development David Pavon is having to prepare for. At the small Spanish deli he runs in Bristol, he relies on imports from his homeland. David Pavon says extra checks could mean he has to either raise prices or close his shop All businesses bringing goods into the country from Europe have also been dealing with new bureaucracy over the last few weeks. That means each individual consignment of the olives, chorizos or serrano ham that David imports now needs separate customs forms, where there used to be none at all. But later in the year, most of the food products he imports will need to be physically inspected as well, when they arrive in the UK. ""We will need to do more paperwork, and pay more, and we might need to increase the prices,"" he says. ""It's certainly more difficult, but there is no other way unless we close the doors and shut the business. We need to do it."" So, what happens in places like Dover will have a wider impact. The smoother the system can become, the better for businesses across the country. But while those who still believe they can make a profit are finding new ways to trade, and to cope with bureaucracy and delay, others have concluded that it is no longer worth the hassle. Global trade rebounded pretty well last year from the slump produced by the Covid pandemic in 2020. But there was not much bounce back for British trade with the EU. Many European exporters who used to trade into Great Britain seem to have decided to focus their attention elsewhere in the single market instead, or further afield. German exports to the rest of the EU, for example, grew by 17% in the first eleven months of last year, compared to the same period in 2020. They also rose by 18% to the US. But exports to the UK fell by 2%. That's a massive difference. Britain is doing much less trade with Europe than it used to. From the cliffs above Dover, you can watch ferries coming and going on a constant basis. The government says traders need to get used to new rules here, and also take advantage of new trade deals it is negotiating on the other side of the world. But two years after Britain left the EU, the idea of seamless trade across the narrow stretch of water beneath the white cliffs? That ship seems to have already sailed.

What's behind Dover lorry queues?,"There have been long queues of lorries outside Dover at various points this year, with some drivers taking to social media to share their frustration. So, what has been causing the delays and how big a factor are Brexit checks? According to Highways England, queues stretched back six miles (10km) west of Dover - from the Roundhill Tunnel to the Western Heights Roundabout - at 12:00 GMT on 19 January. There were reports on social media of even longer queues, of up to 18 miles in Calais. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Traffic restrictions at Dover have been needed to tackle the queues. Operation Travel Access Protocol (TAP) requires lorries to stay in the left lane of the A20, heading to the port. So far this year, TAP has been used at least 20 times. For the whole of 2021, it was used 69 times, according to Highways England. From 1 January 2022, lorries taking goods from Great Britain to the EU have had to use theGoods Vehicle Movement System (GVMS),external, to get through customs at Dover and the Channel Tunnel terminal at Folkestone. GVMS is the government's new IT system which deals with all the customs, transit and security declarations needed since Brexit. Until 1 January, goods could be exported and the paperwork completed afterwards (during a 60-day grace period). But now it has to be done before the lorry drives onto the ferry so this has led to additional checks in Dover, where no checks existed before Brexit. BBC trade correspondent Chris Morris has been told it's been taking about 15 minutes per vehicle to process the paperwork. He says that's likely to get faster as people get used to the new system, but delays aren't going to disappear altogether. And that's a problem when the roll-on roll-off ferry operation is so time-sensitive. Dover queues: The firms struggling with Brexit red tape The Port of Dover told us that increased customs checks were ""not the sole reason for queues"". It pointed to other factors including the volume of freight, work going on in the port and a number of ferries being out of action. Three ships were out for refitting at one stage in in January - a quarter of the fleet, according to port authorities. Currently, two are out of action, with the last expected to return on 15 April. On 24 January, a government spokesperson said this was ""the primary cause"" for the delays, along with higher than expected freight volumes. ""The Goods Vehicle Movement System and other customs systems are online and working as planned. Indications since 1 January are that traders and hauliers are adapting very well to the new processes. ""We continue to monitor the situation closely and are engaging with industry groups and local stakeholders in Kent"", they said. At the end of September, the EU is introducing itsEntry/Exit System,external, an automated IT scheme for registering travellers from non-EU countries. This could cause further delays at Dover, especially if the new system introduces body or facial scans which require drivers to step out of their vehicles. A report by Committee of MPs,externalsays the Home Office is in touch with the French authorities about how they might operate the new controls without causing queues, but the conversations are at an early stage. The report recommends that: ""Government must set out its scenario planning and modelling for passenger volumes in 2022 and clarify how it will manage the increased pressures and any contingencies that may be required, including those relating to new EU Entry and Exit System requirements."" Lorries queue on the A20 at Capel-le-Ferne for the Port of Dover in Kent, on 11 January 2022 Lorry drivers have to register on the GVMS when the goods come in the opposite direction too - causing potential disruption in Calais. There have been long delays on some days, but not on others. Since 1 January 2022, all EU goods entering Great Britain are subject tofull customs declarations and controls.,externalThis means they must be presented to customs and the export declarations must be entered into HMRC systems to decide if any further physical checks are required. There are additional requirements for those bringing into the UK: live animals meat and meat products high-risk animal-by products,external regulated plants and plant products,external high-risk foods of non-animal origin,external They now have to provide advance notice to the relevant bodies of their consignment's arrival into Great Britain. Physical checks on all these products are due to start on 1 July at Sevington, a new inland border facility. A spokesperson for Logistics UK, which represents hauliers, ferry companies, ports and customs agents, told Reality Check: ""The queues we are seeing now result from the implementation of UK import requirements combined with volumes that are now picking up."" At the start of the year, when the new requirements came in, there were lorries arriving at the border without the right documentation. Since then, the situation has improved but ""a small percentage of vehicles arriving at the border have incorrect documentation [and] when volumes of traffic are high, this results in queues"".

Your writers were Alexandra FouchÃ©, Chris Giles, Jennifer Meierhans, Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon and Nathan Williams. The page was edited by Lauren Turner and Alex Therrien. From all of us, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage today. Here's a recap of what's been happening.    Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said the prime minister's announcement on the early lifting of remaining Covid restrictions in England were intended to detract attention from his current political difficulties. ""The fact we had no notice this was coming, no sense it was coming, suggests that some throwaway remarks at the start of Prime Minister's Questions were more about digging the prime minister out of a political hole than dealing with the serious challenge facing the country,"" he told the BBC. Streeting also said the government needed a ""real plan for living well with Covid"", adding Labour had published its own plan ""weeks ago"" and that the prime minister was ""welcome to nick it"". People in the ""real world"" don't care about parties held in Downing Street during lockdown, the new leader of the House of Commons says. Mark Spencer told BBC Radio Nottingham ""what really mattered"" to people was their energy bills, NHS backlogs and jobs. Spencer replaced Jacob Rees-Mogg as Commons leader in a cabinet reshuffle. He was formerly the government chief whip, in charge of party discipline. The Sherwood MP said he could not comment further on government lockdown parties because of the police investigation, but said: ""Clearly people were having a drink, I've done that. I've had a drink of alcohol during Covid."" He said: ""When you get out into the real world and you talk to real people, my experience is they are saying to me 'you know what really matters to me is the cost of my energy bills, the NHS backlog post-Covid,making sure the economy is growing and my job is secure'."" On the issue of the Downing Street parties, Conservative MP Robbie Moore has given ascathing interview to a local newspaper,external. He said he shared the ""rage and anger"" felt by his constituents. Moor said he had spoken with the prime minister following the publication of an interim report into the parties. The report by senior civil servant Sue Gray ""confirmed the fury and disgust I already had about the reported parties and social events, and indeed the culture of rule-breaking in Downing Street"", Moore said. He said he told Johnson the current situation ""is not sustainable and that things must changeâ. In the interview, Moore did not say whether he had submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson's leadership. If 54 of Tory MPs send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs the party's leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, Labour's Fabian Hamilton asked Boris
Johnson to explain aphoto that appears to show the PM and others with a bottle of bubbly and food at a Christmas partyduring lockdown. During PMQs, Hamilton asked
the PM if it showed an event ""like one of the Christmas parties he told us
never happened"". Earlier, the PM said encouraging trends could mean the UK's Covid rules end early - so let's have a look at what today's data tells us. A further68,214new coronavirus infections have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This is the lowest number of cases since Friday. It puts the average number of cases over the last seven days at485,074. This is down143,469or22.8%on the previous week. There have also been276deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data shows. That makes the weekly average1,526which is down298on the previous seven days and represents a16.3%drop. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Police will take no further action over accusations of bullying and intimidation towards MPs by government whips and Downing Street, the BBC has been told. The Conservative MP William Wragg confirmed that he had been told by the Metropolitan police that there was no evidence of any criminal offence, as first reported by the Daily Telegraph newspaper. Last month he told a committeethat Tory whips had threatened those suspected of wanting Boris Johnson out with the removal of government investment in their constituencies. The backbencher, who has called for the prime minister to resign, met detectives to discuss the allegations. Downing Street previously said it had not seen any proof of the behaviour he alleged. Some Tory MPs are keen to see what one described as âsignificant culture changeâ in government and noted the removal of the former Chief Whip Mark Spencer from his post in yesterdayâs reshuffle. The Met has been approached for comment. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has arrived in Moscow ahead of talks about the crisis in eastern Ukraine with veteran Russian diplomat Sergei Lavrov. The UK is involved in diplomatic efforts to defuse tensions on Ukraineâs eastern borders, where more than 100,000 Russian troops have amassed. Truss tweeted to say she would âmake clear that Russia must immediately withdraw its forces and respect Ukraineâs sovereignty or face severe consequencesâ. She said an invasion would be âa huge mistakeâ and âdiplomacy is the only way forwardâ. Her visit is the first by a UK foreign secretary for more than four years after a period of rocky relations with Russia. The government has released more details about her agendahere,external.

Elsewhere in politics, the UK's national terror threat level has been reduced but an attack remains likely. Security and intelligence experts have downgraded the threat from ""severe"" - where an attack is deemed to be highly likely - to ""substantial"". Home Secretary Priti Patel says the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre assessment is based on the latest intelligence available. The ""substantial"" threat level still means a terrorist attack on the UK is likely. The threat level was increased to severe in November following the explosion outside a Liverpool hospital on Remembrance Sunday and the fatal stabbing of Southend West MP Sir David Amess at a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex on 15 October. Patel told MPs the current nature and scale of the UK terrorist threat is consistent with the level of threat seen prior to the attacks but thatpeople should not be ""complacent"". A scientist who advises government says Boris Johnson's plan to lift Covid self-isolation rules a month early ""doesn't seem very cautious"". Professor Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said he was ""very concerned that the number of cases remains very high"". He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One he thought that as a population we had ""just become rather used to these rather stunning statistics"" of 300 deaths per day. He added: ""I think we're all really looking forward to being able to get back to some sort of normality and we know Omicron is generally fairly mild in people who have immunity and most adults have immunity now, either because we've been vaccinated or because we've been infected or both. ""So, we're going in the right direction, but this doesn't seem very cautious in terms of the potential health impact."" He added it would be ""wholly wrong to say that the pandemic is in any way over"". At the moment, anyone who hasCovid symptomsor who tests positive for Covid via a PCR or lateral flow test must immediately self-isolate. The current regulations expire on 24 March, butthe prime minister told MPs today that he expects to lift them a month earlier in England, as long as the current ""encouraging trends in data continue"". InEnglandandNorthern Irelandyou can leave self-isolation after five full daysif you have two negative lateral flow results, 24 hours apart. InScotlandandWalesyou must self-isolate for at least seven days - as soon assymptomsappear or you test positive. Here's our guide to the self-isolation rules across the UKandhere's how to look after yourself at home. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The latest figures from the ONS are a wrinkle in the ""positive
trends"" that the prime minister described earlier. These are our clearest picture of how many people have Covid:
they don't depend on who gets tested or changing rules about lateral flow and
PCR tests. That's because the ONS estimates infection rates in the community by swabbing people regardless of whether they think they might be infected. And they suggest that infections are on the rise again. After
falling sharply from their New Year peak, they're back up to about 3.3 million
again. Despite record numbers of infections, this January has seen
overall death rates that don't look very different to pre-Covid times. And the
number of people in hospital is still falling. So infections on their own might not change the direction of
travel. If youâre just joining us, youâve missed another tumultuous session of Prime Ministerâs Questions, and plenty of headlines besides. Letâs take stock of whatâs happened: The PM says he wants to end self-isolation rules, given encouraging Covid
trends. Hospital cases are continuing to fall and infections are lower than they once were - but there has been an uptick in rates for the second week running, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS survey suggests that just over 3.3 million people in the UK would test positive for coronavirus in the week ending 5 February. This is up from just under 3.1 million in the previous week. Infections rates were on the rise in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and falling Wales. The trend was uncertain in England. Here are the estimated numbers of people with Covid, for the week ending 5 February:  Boris Johnson will travel to Poland on Thursday as he steps up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine amid fears of a Russian invasion. The prime minister will visit British soldiers stationed in the country, and meetings with Polandâs prime minister and president are scheduled. A meeting with the chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to take place in Brussels on the same day. The trip comes as western countries attempt to defuse tensions on the Ukrainian border, where thousands of Russian troops have amassed. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine but has asked for security guarantees from Nato, including ruling out Ukraine becoming a member, Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was flying to Moscow on Wednesday for talks with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during a two-day trip. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Ministers had always said the rule on self-isolation could end before the planned date of 24 March. The trends are positive - hospital cases are continuing to fall and the huge wave of infections caused by Omicron has not pushed overall deaths above what would normally be seen in winter. But this decision has still taken most by surprise - as infection levels are still high and it's unclear what this will do to the spread of the virus. It is, though, worth bearing in mind that not every infected person was self-isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has only picking up half of all infections - at the peak it was missing around an estimated 200,000 cases a day. What's more, about one in five of those who test positive do not fully adhere to the self-isolation requirements. The move is also likely to pave the way for the dismantling of the community testing system, with many experts believing tests will soon only be used in settings such as care homes and hospitals - or to deal with major outbreaks. England is fast approaching the point where it treats Covid like any other respiratory illness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is touring the tea roomâ¦ again, BBC Newsnight's political editor, Nicholas Watt, hastweeted,external. When a prime minister enters the tea room in the House of Commons after PMQs, it can indicate they're seeking to shore up support among backbench MPs sceptical of their leadership. A series of political controversies - including the Partygate affair - have given those MPs reason to question Johnson's position in recent weeks. Some Conservative MPs have called for Johnson to resign, while others have said they're withholding judgement until the Met Police concludes its investigation into lockdown parties in Downing Street. This week,Johnson has sought to reset his government with a mini-cabinet reshuffle, which followed the departure of several senior advisers. But ultimately, it's MPs who will decide Johnson's fate. If 54 of them send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs Tory leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. Johnson's visit to the tea room may be an attempt to win over MPs whose fingers are on the trigger. His presence hasn't gone unnoticed by one MP, who said the prime minister was ""currently scrambling around the tea room"". ""Desperation"",tweeted,externalStephen Flynn, SNP MP for Aberdeen South. Reality Check Health minister Gillian Keegan
has apologised for continuing a meetingafter finding out she was Covid positivefollowing a lateral flow test. According to barrister Adam Wagner,the minister may have breached Covid guidelines but not necessarily the law,external. Under government guidance - which is
not legally enforced with fines and prosecution â anyone whohas symptomsor tests positive for Covid in
England should self-isolate âstraight awayâ. You no longer need to
take a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow test result. However, the legal requirement
to self-isolate in England is only triggered when you are notified by a
""relevant person"" (usually the NHS). Read more:What are the Covid self-isolation rules? Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the government plans to lift England's remaining Covid restrictions - which are due to end on 24 March - a month early. Asked at the daily lobby briefing if this meant people could go to work if they had Covid, the PM's spokesman said the government would not advise anyone who tests positive to go to work once legal restrictions end. The spokesman said everyone would be expected take steps to reduce the spread of the virus as they would if they had flu. ""What we would simply be doing is removing the domestic regulations which relate to isolation,"" the spokesman added. ""But obviously, in the same way that someone with flu, we wouldn't recommend they go to work, we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease."" Â© 2025 BBC.

The ONS survey suggests that just over 3.3 million people in the UK would test positive for coronavirus in the week ending 5 February. This is up from just under 3.1 million in the previous week. Infections rates were on the rise in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and falling Wales. The trend was uncertain in England. Here are the estimated numbers of people with Covid, for the week ending 5 February:  Boris Johnson will travel to Poland on Thursday as he steps up diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine amid fears of a Russian invasion. The prime minister will visit British soldiers stationed in the country, and meetings with Polandâs prime minister and president are scheduled. A meeting with the chief of the Nato alliance, Jens Stoltenberg, is expected to take place in Brussels on the same day. The trip comes as western countries attempt to defuse tensions on the Ukrainian border, where thousands of Russian troops have amassed. Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine but has asked for security guarantees from Nato, including ruling out Ukraine becoming a member, Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was flying to Moscow on Wednesday for talks with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov during a two-day trip. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Ministers had always said the rule on self-isolation could end before the planned date of 24 March. The trends are positive - hospital cases are continuing to fall and the huge wave of infections caused by Omicron has not pushed overall deaths above what would normally be seen in winter. But this decision has still taken most by surprise - as infection levels are still high and it's unclear what this will do to the spread of the virus. It is, though, worth bearing in mind that not every infected person was self-isolating anyway. This winter, the testing system has only picking up half of all infections - at the peak it was missing around an estimated 200,000 cases a day. What's more, about one in five of those who test positive do not fully adhere to the self-isolation requirements. The move is also likely to pave the way for the dismantling of the community testing system, with many experts believing tests will soon only be used in settings such as care homes and hospitals - or to deal with major outbreaks. England is fast approaching the point where it treats Covid like any other respiratory illness. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is touring the tea roomâ¦ again, BBC Newsnight's political editor, Nicholas Watt, hastweeted,external. When a prime minister enters the tea room in the House of Commons after PMQs, it can indicate they're seeking to shore up support among backbench MPs sceptical of their leadership. A series of political controversies - including the Partygate affair - have given those MPs reason to question Johnson's position in recent weeks. Some Conservative MPs have called for Johnson to resign, while others have said they're withholding judgement until the Met Police concludes its investigation into lockdown parties in Downing Street. This week,Johnson has sought to reset his government with a mini-cabinet reshuffle, which followed the departure of several senior advisers. But ultimately, it's MPs who will decide Johnson's fate. If 54 of them send letters to the 1922 committee - the influential backbench group which runs Tory leadership contests - it will trigger a challenge. Johnson's visit to the tea room may be an attempt to win over MPs whose fingers are on the trigger. His presence hasn't gone unnoticed by one MP, who said the prime minister was ""currently scrambling around the tea room"". ""Desperation"",tweeted,externalStephen Flynn, SNP MP for Aberdeen South. Reality Check Health minister Gillian Keegan
has apologised for continuing a meetingafter finding out she was Covid positivefollowing a lateral flow test. According to barrister Adam Wagner,the minister may have breached Covid guidelines but not necessarily the law,external. Under government guidance - which is
not legally enforced with fines and prosecution â anyone whohas symptomsor tests positive for Covid in
England should self-isolate âstraight awayâ. You no longer need to
take a PCR test to confirm a positive lateral flow test result. However, the legal requirement
to self-isolate in England is only triggered when you are notified by a
""relevant person"" (usually the NHS). Read more:What are the Covid self-isolation rules? Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the government plans to lift England's remaining Covid restrictions - which are due to end on 24 March - a month early. Asked at the daily lobby briefing if this meant people could go to work if they had Covid, the PM's spokesman said the government would not advise anyone who tests positive to go to work once legal restrictions end. The spokesman said everyone would be expected take steps to reduce the spread of the virus as they would if they had flu. ""What we would simply be doing is removing the domestic regulations which relate to isolation,"" the spokesman added. ""But obviously, in the same way that someone with flu, we wouldn't recommend they go to work, we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Lindsey Jacobellis wins snowboard cross gold Ed LeighSnowboarding commentator on BBC TV Lindsay Jacobellis has won absolutely everything there is to
win in the world of snowboard cross, and yet that moment [at the 2006 Turin
Winter Olympics, when she lost gold by showboating near the finish line has
haunted her for her entire career. It is poetic that someone so talented has finally put that memory
to bed. Jacobellis wins stunning gold Katie FalkinghamBBC Sport in Zhangjiakou If ever there was a lesson in never giving up, Lindsey Jacobellis is its epitome. Showing perseverance at its finest, the American never relented in chasing her Winter Olympic dream, and her fifth Games finally delivered the gold medal she once threw away. Cast your mind back to Turin in 2006. A young Jacobellis, on her first Olympic outing, was seconds clear of the rest of the field in what was the first snowboard cross final on this stage. In a split-second decision she has no doubt long rued, she chose to showboat with the finish line in her sight. Her youthful confidence backfired, and she hit the deck as she watched Switzerland's Tanja Frieden steam past her for the golden moment she'd had within her grasp. Now, 16 years on, and at the age of 36, that gold is finally hers - victory in the Beijing final ensured the ghost was exorcised at long last.

If matches are level at the end of 10 ends there will be an extra end, with the team that scores first winning the game. Men's 1500m Sarah LindsayThree-time Olympic short track speed skater on BBC TV Farrell Treacy had Covid last month so he was late coming into the games so he didn't have as much ice time as everybody else. The last few days he's had more ice time and started to settle in and feel more of the ice under his blades and found his way a little bit. This is huge for us, people don't get to watch short track, everybody that watches for the first time they love it, it is exciting, there's lots happening but it is only shown every four years really. To have somebody represent Great Britain so well on such a big stage is very encouraging and hopefully we'll get more people to the ice rinks wanting to try and follow in his footsteps. Men's 1500m Farrell Treacy denies he had a point to prove despite his mistake in the 1000m event, when he was eliminated in the heats after going for the finishing line too early:""That mistake in the 1000m was something I'd never imagined happening, still can't wrap my head around it to be honest, I'll just put it down to illness fog to the head. ""I regrouped, didn't let any of the comments affect me, I'm a big man so you can say what you like. ""I got a bit more ice time and then each round trying to find out a bit more about the ice.

Record-high seizure of $5bn in stolen BitcoinTwo suspects allegedly conspired to launder the money after it was stolen by a hacker in 2016.US & Canada,"A hacker allegedly made off with nearly 120,000 Bitcoin - now valued at about $5bn - in 2016 after breaching the Bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange Stolen Bitcoin worth more than $4bn (Â£2.9bn) has been seized by the US Department of Justice - the largest ever confiscation of its kind. Officials also charged two people on Tuesday with attempting to launder the money, stolen by a hacker who breached a cryptocurrency platform in 2016. The hacker allegedly made off with nearly 120,000 Bitcoin. Then valued at about $71m, its value now exceeds $5bn. About 94,000 Bitcoin have been recovered. Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite Jr said the seizure was proof the government ""will not allow cryptocurrency to be a safe haven for money laundering or a zone of lawlessness within our financial system"". The money originates from the 2016 hack of a crypto exchange known as Bitfinex. According to Justice Department officials, a hacker breached the platform, made more than 2,000 unauthorised transactions and then funnelled the money into a digital wallet allegedly run by Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, of New York. A criminal complaint alleges Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, 31, laundered about 25,000 of the stolen Bitcoin through various accounts over the past five years and used various methods to cover their tracks, from fake identities to converting their Bitcoin into other digital currencies. Investigators from Washington DC, New York, Chicago and Ansbach, Germany collaborated on the lengthy probe. In a statement, Bitfinex said it had cooperated with the inquiry and was ""pleased"" the stolen funds had been recovered. Lichtenstein and Morgan will appear before a federal judge later on Tuesday, on counts of conspiracy to defraud the US and conspiracy to commit money laundering. If found guilty, they could each serve up to 25 years in prison. The asset seizure comes four months after the launch of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team  at the Justice Department. In what is believed to be its previous largest financial seizure, the team seized some $2.3m in cryptocurrency last year, recovering the ransom paid by the Colonial Pipeline company to end a crippling cyberattack. Correction 9th February: This article originally reported that the record seizure by the US Department of Justice amounted to $5bn in stolen Bitcoin. In fact 94,000 of the 120,000 stolen Bitcoin have been recovered, at a value of $4bn (Â£2.9bn) and so we have amended the article to make this clear.

UCLA in $250m payout for gynaecologist's sex abuseA campus gynaecologist at UCLA allegedly abused hundreds of patients over his 35-year career.US & Canada,"Gynaecologist James Heaps also faces criminals sexual abuse charges The University of California has agreed to pay nearly $250m (Â£185m) to over 200 women who allege they were sexually assaulted by a campus gynaecologist. Multiple women accuse the university's Los Angeles site (UCLA) of deliberately hiding James Heaps' alleged sexual abuse of patients. Mr Heaps was based at the UCLA student health centre during his 35-year career between 1983 and 2018. Hundreds of women, some of whom had cancer, say they were abused by him. The university did not begin investigating complaints against Mr Heaps until 2017. It has been accused in hundreds of lawsuits of deliberately hiding the gynaecologist's alleged sexual abuse of patients. His medical licence was suspended by a judge in 2019 for the duration of the sex abuse case. The university said it hoped the financial settlement would provide ""healing and closure"" for the women involved. Mr Heaps faces 21 criminal counts of sexual abuse against seven women and has pleaded not guilty. ""The conduct alleged to have been committed by Heaps is reprehensible and contrary to the University's values,"" a UCLA statement said on Tuesday. ""Our first and highest obligation will always be to the communities we serve, and we hope this settlement is one step toward providing healing and closure for the plaintiffs involved."" But Kara Cagle, a breast cancer survivor who reported Mr Heaps while she was undergoing treatment at the university, told the Los Angeles Times: ""Today, after eight long years, I received recognition of what happened to me. ""Although there is some consolation in that, my heart breaks for all the women who were not spared, all the women who suffered after me, because UCLA refused to act."" Tuesday's settlement does not halt an ongoing lawsuit by more than 300 patients. Last July, a federal judge approved a $73m settlement against Mr Heaps, which was brought by more than 5,500 women. According to lawyers in the case, he was once the highest paid doctor in the entire University of California system. John C Manley, a lawyer representing one of the women who has filed criminal charges against Mr Heaps, alleged he was a sophisticated predator who committed abuse under the guise of normal medical examinations. ""He was a board-certified gynaecologist and a board-certified oncologist. Most of the women...  were there because they had cancer or they thought they had cancer,"" Mr Manley told the BBC. The federal lawsuits said that Mr Heaps was not properly investigated until the university received a complaint in 2017, and that he was allowed to continue seeing patients during the inquiry into his actions, and even after the university told him that his contract would not be renewed. The latest payout follows a series of a large settlements with US universities over patient abuse by campus doctors. Last month,the University of Michigan reached a $490msettlement with more than 1,000 people who say they were abused by a sports doctor during his four-decade career. Meanwhile, three women are suing another of America's most prestigious colleges, Harvard, on the grounds it also ignored sexual harassment allegations. Professor John Comaroff, an anthropologist, denies their allegations that he kissed and groped them.

"Homophobic abuse 'normalised' in primary schoolsYoung children reporting homophobic language is rising, a professor says.Wales","This video can not be played Rory Wade said he found ""homophobia was very normalised in daily conversation"" during his school days Primary school children are targeting each other with homophobic and anti-trans abuse, a professor has warned. Cardiff University's EJ Renold said they had noticed an increase in young children reporting homophobic and sexist comments. Maisie Awen said she was ""terrified anyone would find out"" she was gay after experiencing homophobia in school from the age of six. The Welsh government said any bullying was ""unacceptable"". Last year an Estyn report found homophobic bullying was the most common kind in secondary schools and happened ""all the time"". LGBT tolerance 'going backwards' as hate crimes up 'I don't want to just survive. I want to be happy' LGBT pupils 'need better support' from schools Prof Renold, who advised on that report, told BBC Wales it was ""not unusual"" to find anti-gay comments ""normalised"" in primary schools. ""It might be more underground, but it's going on,"" they said. Prof EJ Renold said it was not unusual to find anti-gay comments normalised in primary schools ""You will have children who are maybe gender non-conforming who can become targets of homophobic abuse, and I would say increasingly, transphobic abuse as well."" The Estyn report in December found many LGBTQ+ pupils at secondary schools had ""substantial personal experiences"" of homophobia, including name calling, body shaming and in some instances being told to kill themselves. The first time Maisie Awen heard the word ""lesbian"" it was being used as a slur The first time Maisie Awen from Pembrokeshire heard the word ""lesbian"" it was being used as a slur at her primary school. She was about six and it was being aimed at her as a term of abuse. ""The whole of primary school I told my friends I had a crush on every boy just to stay on that side of things,"" she said. Ms Awen, now 19, realised she was gay as a teenager and had already encountered homophobia for so many years that it felt like ""the end of the world"". ""I was already bullied for being gay, even before I came to that conclusion myself,"" she said. ""I was terrified that anyone would find out. ""There weren't really adults in school who I felt could see it in a positive way. ""With those teachers I did have a good relationship with, I was too scared to jeopardise that relationship by telling them about my sexuality."" Prof Renold, who advises the Welsh government, said the findings were ""shocking"" but would not be surprising to those working with schools. Alex Thomas, who supports Viva LGBTQ+ youth groups in Rhyl, Denbighshire, believed every young LGBTQ+ pupil would be affected by homophobia. Alex Thomas believes teachers often do not know how to respond to homophobia ""Young people are facing increased levels of oppression of isolation of bullying and negative experiences based around their identity,"" he said. Mr Thomas said for many young children the biggest problem was teachers not knowing what to do. He said one young person had recently told him they had left a lesson to cry after being targeted. ""When the teacher found out they seemed more put out about the fact the pupil hadn't come to them in the first place than actually responding to what had happened,"" Mr Thomas said. Director of teaching union NAHT Cymru, Laura Doel, said discrimination against LGBTQ+ pupils harmed their mental health. ""School leaders will need time, some extra resources as well as further training and confidence to be able to deal with these matters,"" she said. Reagan said it was important to teach children why certain words shouldn't be used At Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Plasmawr, in Cardiff, pupils caught using homophobic or transphobic language are asked to sit down with LGBTQ+ peers to discuss what happened. Reagan, 17, of the school's LGBTQ+ group, Digon, said homophobia in younger children was often the result of ""genuine naivety"" and it was easier for them to talk to peers than teachers. Megan said they could usually be ""rehabilitated"". ""Other times it's not always a positive response,"" the 15-year-old said. Maisie, 17, said some pupils were surprised to learn of the impact of their words. ""We educate pupils about the words and what you can use and can't use in context,"" she said. Megan said homophobic pupils could usually be ""rehabilitated"" Prof Renold said the new curriculum in Wales would help schools to tackle homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying, but a ""serious investment of resources"" was needed to help train teachers and create inclusive environments. The Welsh government said its new curriculum for Wales, due to start in September at some schools, would be inclusive of everyone and included a mandatory relationships and sexuality education (RSE) code. It said it had commissioned training for school leaders to tackle homophobic bullying. ""Any form of bullying or sexual harassment is completely unacceptable, and we want to encourage any children and young people who are experiencing this kind of harassment to come forward and report it.""

Welby criticises delay in removing slavery plaqueThe Archbishop of Canterbury asks why a memorial to a slavery financier is taking so long to come down.UK Politics,"Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said the Church of England is taking too long to remove memorials linked to the slave trade. Mr Welby criticised delays in taking down a plaque to slavery financier Tobias Rustat at a Cambridge college chapel. ""Why is it so much agony to remove a memorial to slavery?"" he said. Earlier at the General Synod, the head of a Church racial justice body said the lack of change was ""a scandal"". A Church court is consideringwhether a plaque to 17th Century courtier Mr Rustat, who invested in the Royal African Company, can be removed from the wall of a chapel at Jesus College, Cambridge. The college, which proposed the removal, says Mr Rustat's financial involvement in the company helped it to enslave 150,000 African men, women and children over 50 years - more than any other institution. Mr Welby pointed out that Jesus College now has a black woman as its master, Sonita Alleyne, who has to look at a memorial to a man who financed slavery ""every time she sits in her stall"". The archbishop questioned why it was ""so difficult"" to remove the marble plaque, when the college only wanted to move it to another location where it can be interpreted and explained. ""We need to change our practices,"" he said. Tobias Rustat, a major benefactor of Jesus College, commissioned the memorial plaque himself Mr Welby was responding after Labour peer Lord Boateng - chair of the Archbishops' Racial Justice Commission, which aims to identify and root out systemic racism in the church - drew applause as he said the Church's lack of action on race issues was ""chilling"". He said statues and monuments to people involved in the slave trade caused him hurt, while the failure to improve diversity meant ""the government front bench looks better"" than the Church's leadership. Only one out of 42 senior bishops is from an ethnic minority, compared to six out of 23 members of the cabinet. ""Imagine what it is to go into a place of worship to look up and to see a monument to someone who was a party to the enslavement of your ancestors,"" said Lord Boateng. ""We are members in churches which have themselves benefitted from the horrors of the slave trade. That is the reality."" He referred to the church's missionary organisation, the Society of the Propagation of the Gospel, which owned a plantation in the 18th Century - and which branded the word ""Society"" on the skins of the people they enslaved.

"Further Brexit disruption to trade, warn MPs","There could be delays at the UK's borders later this year without prompt government action to prepare for new border checks, MPs have warned. A report from the Public Accounts Committee said there was potential for disruption as passenger volumes returned to normal. Logistics UK backed the committee's findings saying traffic could ""grind to a halt"" if more wasn't done soon. The government said there had been minimal border disruption so far. It continued to ensure businesses received the support they needed to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities, a government spokesperson said. But Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Select Committee said there was ""much more work that government should be doing"" to ensure the border was operating effectively and to minimise the current burden on firms trading with the EU. Logistics UK said it was calling on the government to ""take action now"" to ensure new post-Brexit border controls, including checks on agricultural and food products entering the UK, and biometric checks on passengers entering the EU, could be implemented smoothly in the second half of the year. ""We have just enough time,"" said Sarah Laouadi head of European policy at the trade body. But she said firms urgently needed more information about which ports would process which products after 1 July. ""Of course you need advance notice to act on this information,"" said Ms Laouadi. Without it ""the system could potentially grind to halt"" she said, with up to 29-mile-long queues at UK ports this summer. Dover queues: The firms struggling with red tape What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal In January new post-Brexit checks on goods contributed to tail-backs in Kent, due to teething troubles around the new paperwork required, Ms Laouadi said. Container lorries queuing at the Port of Dover The MPs' report said increased costs, delays and paperwork were making it harder for UK businesses to trade as before, and while it was difficult to disentangle the impact of Covid and global economic problems, the cross party committee found Brexit had reduced the UK's trade with the EU. John Grayson said things were already ""verging on the impossible, logistically and financially"" for his business, Earth Natural Foods in London. He has given up importing directly from EU suppliers and has dropped some specific products altogether, like one particular brand of olive oil. He relies on importers instead, but an order takes three weeks to arrive instead of one. ""A one tonne pallet of goods that used to cost Â£200, is now near to Â£600,"" he added. Mary Quicke, an artisan cheesemaker based in Devon said she now worries that her EU customers will run out of patience and stop taking her products if these kinds of problems persist. ""There are just all of these barriers to doing what used to be really, really simple which was agreeing to make a sale and then calling the haulier and off it went and you got paid,"" she told BBC 5 Live. ""Of course they want our cheese, but how long do you carry on doing something you want when it's really tedious and costly and you get charged much more money?"" From 1 July extra checks on agricultural and food imports from the EU will take place at ports around the UK, but with products varying from cut flowers to ready-made lasagne, firms need to know which ports will be authorised to process which products, what the operating hours will be and how they fit with ferry schedules, Logistics UK said. The Public Accounts Committee noted that some of the required infrastructure will not be completed in time and there were still concerns around staffing, including vets. In addition, later this year travellers including HGV drivers entering the EU will need to go through biometric passport checks, involve facial recognition and fingerprint scans, as part of the EU's Entry and Exit System. Ports such as Dover, where EU-entry checks take place on the UK side, therefore need to be adapted to avoid drivers having to get out of their vehicles and walk across lanes of traffic, Ms Laouadi said. The Public Accounts Committee said it was particularly concerned about what would happen when passenger traffic across the UK border returns to normal levels as the pandemic subsides. The PAC report urges the government to write to the committee, within six months, setting out the timetable for its planned programme of work on the ""noteworthy ambition"" to create the world's most effective border by 2025. A government spokeswoman said: ""Traders have adapted well to the introduction of full customs controls on 1 January, with minimal disruption at the border and inbound freight flowing effectively through ports. ""We are continuing to ensure that businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world's fastest growing markets, including one-to-one advice through the free-to-use Export Support Service."" This report serves as a reminder that in leaving the European Union, the UK did something that no other modern economy has really done before. It created permanent barriers to trade with its nearest neighbours. That may not have been the motivation for Brexit, not its intended purpose. But it has been the practical effect. It means small businesses in particular, which used to trade with the rest of Europe as easily as they trade with other parts of the country, have suddenly been caught in a thicket of bureaucracy. But this is not just about companies that are finding it more difficult to trade. It's about companies that have given up exporting altogether. There is less trade now between Britain and Europe than there used to be, and it hasn't bounced back from Covid lockdowns in the way that trade between other countries has. The government says it's time to look at new markets on the other side of the world instead. But that is a very long-term plan.

Dover queues: The firms struggling with red tape,"On the approach into Dover, there are queues of lorries parked in one lane of the A20, stretching back for miles. They're being held along this road to avoid congesting the town, as they wait to board ferries across the Channel. Queues are not uncommon close to Britain's main trading hub with the EU, but they've been really long in recent weeks. And a month after more post-Brexit border bureaucracy came into force, many businesses, smaller ones especially, are struggling to cope. Drivers waiting at a customs facility in Dover - most of them from elsewhere in Europe - are phlegmatic, but fed up. ""I'm waiting maybe one hour, next week maybe five hours, it's always different,"" said one. ""When we're waiting, there's no money,"" said another. What's been causing lorry queues at Dover? Dover queues: Traffic builds on the A20 in Kent For drivers who are paid by the kilometre that's a real concern and it means some will be reluctant to come back. The drivers blame cancelled ferry crossings - there are temporarily fewer ferries in operation than normal. But they also cite the post-Brexit rules that now govern their working lives. Last year, which was Britain's first outside the EU single market and customs union, companies had 60 days to fill in UK customs documents after exporting goods to the EU. But since 1 January, those forms have to completed in full, before lorries and vans can board ferries heading for Europe every day. Thousands of drivers need to get their documents checked and the process is taking time. ""For us, the government is staging Brexit bit-by-bit,"" says John Shirley, who's run a freight-forwarding company in Dover for 25 years. ""That's caused all sorts of headaches for people, they don't know the paperwork properly or haven't prepared themselves - that's what's causing the delays here."" John Shirley says he suspects the situation will not improve He recounts meeting a driver earlier in the week who had been stuck in Dover for four days, with a lorry going to Germany in a journey which used to be routine. Won't it get better with time, I suggest, as companies get used to a new system? ""I don't know, I suspect it won't do,"" he replies. ""And in July we get an additional set of controls on foodstuffs."" That is a development David Pavon is having to prepare for. At the small Spanish deli he runs in Bristol, he relies on imports from his homeland. David Pavon says extra checks could mean he has to either raise prices or close his shop All businesses bringing goods into the country from Europe have also been dealing with new bureaucracy over the last few weeks. That means each individual consignment of the olives, chorizos or serrano ham that David imports now needs separate customs forms, where there used to be none at all. But later in the year, most of the food products he imports will need to be physically inspected as well, when they arrive in the UK. ""We will need to do more paperwork, and pay more, and we might need to increase the prices,"" he says. ""It's certainly more difficult, but there is no other way unless we close the doors and shut the business. We need to do it."" So, what happens in places like Dover will have a wider impact. The smoother the system can become, the better for businesses across the country. But while those who still believe they can make a profit are finding new ways to trade, and to cope with bureaucracy and delay, others have concluded that it is no longer worth the hassle. Global trade rebounded pretty well last year from the slump produced by the Covid pandemic in 2020. But there was not much bounce back for British trade with the EU. Many European exporters who used to trade into Great Britain seem to have decided to focus their attention elsewhere in the single market instead, or further afield. German exports to the rest of the EU, for example, grew by 17% in the first eleven months of last year, compared to the same period in 2020. They also rose by 18% to the US. But exports to the UK fell by 2%. That's a massive difference. Britain is doing much less trade with Europe than it used to. From the cliffs above Dover, you can watch ferries coming and going on a constant basis. The government says traders need to get used to new rules here, and also take advantage of new trade deals it is negotiating on the other side of the world. But two years after Britain left the EU, the idea of seamless trade across the narrow stretch of water beneath the white cliffs? That ship seems to have already sailed.

What's been causing lorry queues at Dover?,"There have been long queues of lorries outside Dover at various points this year, with some drivers taking to social media to share their frustration. So, what has been causing the delays and how big a factor are Brexit checks? According to Highways England, queues stretched back six miles (10km) west of Dover - from the Roundhill Tunnel to the Western Heights Roundabout - at 12:00 GMT on 19 January. There were reports on social media of even longer queues, of up to 18 miles in Calais. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Traffic restrictions at Dover have been needed to tackle the queues. Operation Travel Access Protocol (TAP) requires lorries to stay in the left lane of the A20, heading to the port. So far this year, TAP has been used at least 20 times. For the whole of 2021, it was used 69 times, according to Highways England. From 1 January 2022, lorries taking goods from Great Britain to the EU have had to use theGoods Vehicle Movement System (GVMS),external, to get through customs at Dover and the Channel Tunnel terminal at Folkestone. GVMS is the government's new IT system which deals with all the customs, transit and security declarations needed since Brexit. Until 1 January, goods could be exported and the paperwork completed afterwards (during a 60-day grace period). But now it has to be done before the lorry drives onto the ferry so this has led to additional checks in Dover, where no checks existed before Brexit. BBC trade correspondent Chris Morris has been told it's been taking about 15 minutes per vehicle to process the paperwork. He says that's likely to get faster as people get used to the new system, but delays aren't going to disappear altogether. And that's a problem when the roll-on roll-off ferry operation is so time-sensitive. Dover queues: The firms struggling with Brexit red tape The Port of Dover told us that increased customs checks were ""not the sole reason for queues"". It pointed to other factors including the volume of freight, work going on in the port and a number of ferries being out of action. Three ships were out for refitting at one stage in in January - a quarter of the fleet, according to port authorities. Currently, two are out of action, with the last expected to return on 15 April. On 24 January, a government spokesperson said this was ""the primary cause"" for the delays, along with higher than expected freight volumes. ""The Goods Vehicle Movement System and other customs systems are online and working as planned. Indications since 1 January are that traders and hauliers are adapting very well to the new processes. ""We continue to monitor the situation closely and are engaging with industry groups and local stakeholders in Kent"", they said. At the end of September, the EU is introducing itsEntry/Exit System,external, an automated IT scheme for registering travellers from non-EU countries. This could cause further delays at Dover, especially if the new system introduces body or facial scans which require drivers to step out of their vehicles. A report by Committee of MPs,externalsays the Home Office is in touch with the French authorities about how they might operate the new controls without causing queues, but the conversations are at an early stage. The report recommends that: ""Government must set out its scenario planning and modelling for passenger volumes in 2022 and clarify how it will manage the increased pressures and any contingencies that may be required, including those relating to new EU Entry and Exit System requirements."" Lorries queue on the A20 at Capel-le-Ferne for the Port of Dover in Kent, on 11 January 2022 Lorry drivers have to register on the GVMS when the goods come in the opposite direction too - causing potential disruption in Calais. There have been long delays on some days, but not on others. Since 1 January 2022, all EU goods entering Great Britain are subject tofull customs declarations and controls.,externalThis means they must be presented to customs and the export declarations must be entered into HMRC systems to decide if any further physical checks are required. There are additional requirements for those bringing into the UK: live animals meat and meat products high-risk animal-by products,external regulated plants and plant products,external high-risk foods of non-animal origin,external They now have to provide advance notice to the relevant bodies of their consignment's arrival into Great Britain. Physical checks on all these products are due to start on 1 July at Sevington, a new inland border facility. A spokesperson for Logistics UK, which represents hauliers, ferry companies, ports and customs agents, told Reality Check: ""The queues we are seeing now result from the implementation of UK import requirements combined with volumes that are now picking up."" At the start of the year, when the new requirements came in, there were lorries arriving at the border without the right documentation. Since then, the situation has improved but ""a small percentage of vehicles arriving at the border have incorrect documentation [and] when volumes of traffic are high, this results in queues"".
