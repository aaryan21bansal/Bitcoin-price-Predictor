Seven sports lose funding appeals,"This video can not be played Nicholl defends funding cuts to seven UK sports Badminton is one of seven sports to have lost appeals against UK Sport funding cuts for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic cycle. The decision comes despite Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge winning bronze for Great Britain in the men's doubles at the Rio 2016 Olympics. Archery, goalball, fencing, table tennis, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby will also receive no funding. However, powerlifting was successful in its appeal to UK Sport. It means the sport's Â£1.3m funding will be managed by British Weightlifting and not the English Institute of Sport, as was the case before the 2016 Olympics. GB Badminton said it was""staggered"",externalby the decision to reject its appeal. But UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl said none of the seven sports had provided ""critically compelling new evidence"" that changed the assessment of their medal potential. Mike Reilly, CEO of Goalball UK, said his organisation was hopeful UK Sport would find ""other ways to help us secure a clear and sustained talent pathway"" to Tokyo 2020. Wheelchair rugby has been stripped of Â£750,000, and BBC Sport understands the Rugby Football Union (RFU) will not step in to increase support for its disability counterpart. The RFU gives about Â£100,000 per year to the sport known as 'murderball', and England full-backMike Brown headed a recent campaign,externalto help raise funds, but there are now fears its elite team could fold. Great Britain came second in the medal tables at both the 2016 Olympics and 2016 Paralympics Compared with the four-year build-up to the Rio Games, badminton is the biggest loser in cash terms, as it was given Â£5.7m last time. The cut comes despite the sport hitting its medal target thanks to Ellis and Langridge winning only Britain's third Olympic badminton medal. GB Badmintonsaid in a statement: ""Given the strength of evidence we were able to present to justify investment, we cannot believe UK Sport has concluded they should stand by their decision and award zero funding to our GB programme. ""We have players who are on track to win medals for the nation at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and our belief in those players remains as great as it's ever been. We will now take some time to consider our next steps."" Gail Emms, a silver medallist for Great Britain at Athens 2004, said she was ""gutted"". She said: ""It is heart-wrenching. It was bad enough in December when the initial decision was made but now we are super devastated. ""The players out there were really pinning their hopes on this. I was such an optimist; I thought it was going to be OK. We put forward a strong case. It is going to be tough now for the sport."" This video can not be played Emms 'devastated' by badminton funding loss Dan Roan, BBC sports editor: UK Sport's money has transformed Britain into an Olympic and Paralympic superpower, but its 'no-compromise' approach is under more scrutiny than ever. With falling ticket sales hitting crucial National Lottery funding, resources are undoubtedly stretched but, for the first time, sports with real podium potential are being excluded from funding, and many are now asking whether the focus on medals has gone too far. Table tennis was another sport to be disappointed, despite Britain winning a bronze medal at the 2016 World Team Championships. Sara Sutcliffe,Table Tennis Englandchief executive, said: ""We're naturally disappointed, having made what we believe was a very strong case for a relatively small amount of funding. ""We overachieved on everything we were asked to do in the 2016 cycle, and did so without funding. We were left without funding because, effectively, the goalposts were moved. We will take time to absorb this decision before we decide on the best course of action."" Georgina Usher, chief executive ofBritish Fencing,said the organisation would try to hold fundraising events to support its athletes. ""This has been an incredibly difficult period for the athletes and programme staff,"" she said. ""Our staff, coaches and athletes have worked incredibly hard to have got to the point where we are absolutely good enough to target an Olympic medal. Having to explain to them why the programme funding will be coming to an end is extremely tough. ""We will be appealing against this decision as we owe it to our athletes to pursue every avenue open to us to challenge this funding decision process."" Goalballchief executive Reilly was more upbeat, saying: ""Though we did not fit the UK Sport criteria to move up categories, and so secure funding, we were very much encouraged by their response to our representation. ""There is certainly a sense of the board understanding the difficulties we face and an acknowledgement of our incredible success."" Great Britain reached the quarter-finals in the men's team event at the 2016 Rio Olympics, before losing to 2012 gold medallists China, who went on to win gold again Nicholl said: ""The sports that made representations were unable to provide any critically compelling new evidence that changed our assessment of their medal potential for Tokyo. ""Their position in our meritocratic table therefore remains unchanged and they remain in a band we cannot afford to invest in. ""This is the first time we've been unable to support every sport that has athletes with the potential to deliver medals at the next Games. We don't take these decisions lightly as we're acutely aware of the impact they have on sports, athletes and support personnel. ""To support those affected, we have put in place a comprehensive transition and support package and are working closely with these sports to help staff and athletes move out of UK Sport funding."" In December,UK Sport announced the fundingfor the cycles for the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo in 2020. Archery, badminton, fencing, goalball, table tennis, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby appealed to UK Sport to review the decision on what they had been awarded. UK Sport says it must prioritise sports with the strongest medal potential for Tokyo and the appeal process was essentially a second opportunity for officials to demonstrate why they deserve funding. A total of Â£345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - Â£2m less than the record Â£347m allocated for the Rio Games. UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning between 51 and 85 Olympic medals, and 115 to 162 Paralympic medals in 2020. Nick Hope, BBC senior Olympic sports reporter: Understandably, the headlines will be dominated by news of the seven sports - including British Weightlifting's Olympics team - who have not been able to overturn UK Sport's initial funding decisions. However, the victory for British Weightlifting's Paralympic programme should not be overlooked. UK Sport had planned to move control of the funding award for the disability sport set-up to the English Institute of Sport (EIS). This would not only have seen the closure of the entire GB Weightlifting programme (for Olympic and Paralympic athletes), but also potentially set a new precedent for how funding could be allocated in the future. The EIS is essentially an extended arm of UK Sport - looking after anything from nutrition to physiotherapy and athlete lifestyle/welfare. Figures from several other Olympic and Paralympic sports have told me of their concerns about what giving EIS greater power would have meant for future funding decisions beyond Tokyo. As it stands, those concerns will have been allayed somewhat - but it will be interesting to see whether UK Sport will continue to push in this direction and essentially seek greater control and governance of the funding it awards over each four-year-cycle.

Gibraltar seizes Russian's superyacht,"The seized Sailing Yacht A is among the creme de la creme of private yachts - seen here off Denmark Gibraltar has impounded a Russian billionaire's superyacht - one of the world's biggest - because the German shipbuilder says he still owes 15.3m euros (Â£13.3m; $16.3m) in fees. The claim has kept Andrey Melnichenko's Sailing Yacht A stuck in Gibraltar, a British territory, since Wednesday. His spokesman voiced confidence that the order would be lifted soon. The Bermuda-registered vessel, built by Nobiskrug, left the Kiel shipyard in northern Germany two weeks ago. It is 143m (469ft) long and has three masts, the main one 100m high. The superyacht, boasting a gross tonnage of 12,600, is reported to have cost at least â¬400m.Nobiskrug says,externalit has an underwater observation pod, hybrid diesel-electric propulsion and ""state-of-the-art"" navigation systems. It was designed by Philippe Starck. According to documents seen by Germany's NDR news, Nobiskrug is demanding an outstanding payment of â¬9.8m, as well as â¬5.5m for subcontractors and interest charges. Valla Yachts Ltd, a Bermuda company, is the yacht's registered owner. A top Gibraltar court official, Admiralty Marshal Liam Yeats, told the BBC on Monday: ""The vessel is under arrest and is currently at anchor in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters."" A spokesman for Mr Melnichenko described it as ""a technical problem"". He told the BBC: ""We are confident that the yacht will be handed over to the owner's project team in the coming days and this unfortunate episode will be over."" The wealthy Russian also owns Motor Yacht A - seen here next to HMS Belfast on the Thames Motor Yacht A was an imposing sight on the Thames last September Mr Melnichenko, an industrialist with big stakes in Russia's fertiliser, coal and energy sectors, has a $13.2bn fortune, business websiteForbes reports,external.

It was built by Germany's Blohm & Voss shipyard and launched in 2008. It is 119m long - smaller than Sailing Yacht A - and was also designed by Philippe Starck. In September 2016 it moored alongside the old British light cruiser HMS Belfast on the River Thames, in central London. What happens when a ship is arrested? The Gibraltar Port Authority says ship arrests happen when ""banks and creditors seek recompense from shipowners who find themselves unable to pay up on mortgages or loans"". ""Most arrested ships are sold in a sealed-bids auction within six to eight weeks, once the claim has been proved and judgment given."" In astatement on its website,external, it says ""we put 'ship keepers' on board - two security guards to protect the vessel and its contents. ""We provide the crew with everything, from bunkers (fuel storage compartments) so they can keep the generators going, to provisions of food and water."" A launch is also arranged ""so that the crew, who would otherwise be stuck onboard, can have some shore leave"".

Slippery bottle solves ketchup problem,"This video can not be played The BBC's Pallab Ghosh reports: The invention means the ketchup ""just glides out"" Scientists in Boston have found a way to get every last drop of ketchup out of the bottle. They have developed a coating that makes bottle interiors super slippery. The coating can also be used to make it easier to squeeze out the contents of other containers, such as those holding toothpaste, cosmetics and even glue. The researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) believe that their innovation could dramatically reduce waste. It is always an effort getting that last drop of ketchup out of the bottle. Everyone has their own technique. Some karate chop the bottle, others furiously shake it and many simply bash it. But the MIT team has developed a system that banishes all that frustration. When incorporated into the bottle, it enables the ketchup or any other liquid to just slide out without leaving a trace. In its manufacture, the container must first be coated on the inside with a rough surface. A very thin layer is then placed over this. And, finally, a liquid is added that fills in any troughs to form a very slippery surface - like an oily floor. The ketchup hovers on top and just glides out of the bottle. According to Prof Kripa Varanasi, who developed the slippery surface, the technology is completely safe. ""The cool thing about it is that because the coating is a composite of solid and liquid, it can be tailored to the product. So for food, we make the coating out of food-based materials and so you can actually eat it."" The technology's co-inventor Dr David Smith told me that it could also help reduce waste. ""With the manufacture of these sticky products there is about 200 million gallons of material each year that gets stuck to tanks and then gets washed off and thrown away.

Man grades his ex's apology letter,"An American student who graded his ex-girlfriend's break-up letter says he now regrets that it went viral. Nick Lutz decided to get a red marker out and critique the four-page note before sending it back to his former partner. ""I feel a little but guilty but at the same time, I don't believe the letter at all,"" he told Newsbeat. ""I've been lied to before by her. ""I feel like it was another way to make me feel like I was stupid."" When Newsbeat asked him if he regretted sharing the personal letter on social media, Nick said: ""Yes I do. I would say so."" Nick who studies at the University of Central Florida, says he received the apology shortly after calling time on the relationship and admits it probably wasn't the best decision to tweet it. This is the letter that Nick graded.,external In his critique, he starts off by saying the introduction is too long and that there's lots of repetition. The 20-year-old says his ex needs to show reasoning when saying she ended up failing to keep the relationship working. He also says she needs to back her claims up with proof, like saying she never cheated on him. ""It came to an end after she told me she was going to a theme park with her best friend, who's a girl, but I later found out she went with a dude,"" he said. ""I haven't spoken to her since this happened but I am not planning on talking to her anytime soon. ""We started dating in February of last year and dated for about eight months. ""Four months in she started hiding her phone and I heard she had code names for guys in her contacts list."" The second page calls for his ex-girlfriend to provide more details after this line: ""I took all the promises we had and broke them."" Then there's a spelling mistake with ""loose"" changed to ""lose"". Nick then calls his ex out when she says she has ""no reason to hide, lie or hold anything back"" from him. He writes in the margin: ""If there is no reason to lie, why isn't the truth being told?"" Nick says he decided to annotate the letter as a ""joke"" between him and his friends. But his original tweet where he graded the letter has been shared more than 100,000 times. ""She's not the happiest but I didn't expect it to go viral. She talks to my mum but I haven't spoken to her and I'm not sure I will."" He says he hasn't thought about her when she asks if he has and again accuses her of ""using useless fillers"" to pad out her letter. Nick even says she used ""lackadaisical"" handwriting near the end of her note. The final page contains a question mark after ""I love you"" and also the rest of Nick's final conclusion. ""If you want to be believed, back it up with proof,"" he writes. ""You claimed that cheating never occurred, but place blame on yourself - then what for? ""Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side. While this gesture is appreciated, I would prefer details over statements. ""Revision for half credit will be accepted."" Other people pointed out other mistakes in the letter too. After posting the note on Twitter, Nick was asked out on a date. He said he'd be up for it.,external Nick also told another Twitter user that his ex-girlfriend had seen the changes and was ""okay with her grade"".

Hitler's phone sold in US,"A telephone used by Adolf Hitler during World War Two has been sold for $243,000 (Â£195,744) at a US auction. The identity of the buyer, who bid by phone, has not been revealed. The bidding in Chesapeake City, Maryland, started at $100,000. The red phone, which has the Nazi leader's name engraved on it, was found in his Berlin bunker in 1945. Soviet soldiers gave it to British officer Sir Ralph Rayner as a souvenir shortly after Germany surrendered. The phone was sold by auction house Alexander Historical Auctions. Auction house officials said the phone was a ""weapon of mass destruction"", as it was used by Hitler to give orders that took many lives during the war. A porcelain figure of an Alsatian dog, also owned by Hitler, fetched $24,300. It was bought by a different bidder.

Wolff and Lauda sign new Mercedes deals,"Lauda and Wolff have worked together at Mercedes since 2013 Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff and non-executive chairman Niki Lauda have signed new deals to stay with the team until the end of 2020. Their new contracts coincide with the duration of Mercedes' own current commitment to F1. In common with the rest of the teams, Mercedes will begin negotiations for beyond 2020 with new owner Liberty Media during this year. Wolff retains his 30% shareholding in the team and Lauda his 10% stake. Team boss Wolff joined Mercedes from Williams in February 2013, and Lauda took up his position in late 2012. The deals conclude a busy winter of off-track activity for Mercedes, who have dominated the sport since the advent of turbo hybrid engines in 2014 with three consecutive world title doubles. Mercedes have signed Valtteri Bottas as Lewis Hamilton's team-mate this season, with the Finn replacing world champion Nico Rosberg, who announced his retirement five days after winning the title last November. Executive director (technical) Paddy Lowe is on gardening leave before his departure from Mercedes and is to join Williams in the coming weeks. Mercedes have won the constructors' championship every year since 2014 Lowe's position as technical boss has been taken by James Allison, who has been given the title technical director, a new role within the team as part of a slight re-alignment of responsibility at the head of the company. Wolff has run the team with Lowe as his right-hand man since the departure of former team principal Ross Brawn at the end of 2013. Dieter Zetsche, the chairman and chief executive officer of Mercedes' parent company Daimler, said: ""In 2013, we restructured the management of the team with the clear goal of improving our performance. ""Since then, however, the results have exceeded our expectations. A key factor in this success has been the combination of Toto's entrepreneurial skills and Niki's experience. ""Their renewed commitment gives our programme important continuity for the next four years."" F1 has introduced major regulation changes for this season in an attempt to make the cars faster and more dramatic - and to give the sport greater appeal. The cars are wider with bigger tyres and are expected to be between three and five seconds a lap faster than in 2016. Mercedes' new F1 car will be revealed to the public on Thursday, before the start of pre-season testing three days later. The first 2017 car to be unveiled will be that of Swiss team Sauber on Monday, followed by the Renault on Tuesday, Force India on Wednesday and Ferrari, McLaren and Williams on Friday.

How far into the red will the NHS sink?Hugh PymHealth editor20 February 2017 (17:08:29),"Call it overspending, underfunding or deficits, the latest news from NHS Improvement involves plenty of red ink on the books of hospitals and other trusts. And the picture is worse than it looked last November, which will lead to speculation that NHS finances in England are close to being out of control. As recently as November, Jim Mackey, head of the regulator NHS Improvement, was saying that trusts in England would run up a total deficit of Â£580m for the full financial year. Now that has been revised up to a range of Â£750m to Â£850m. That will hardly win him many friends at the Department of Health where ministers are anxious to demonstrate that a tighter grip has been applied to the NHS purse strings. So what's changed? NHS Improvement is pointing the finger at higher than expected patient demand, with emergency hospital admissions 3.5% higher in the final three months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The regulator had anticipated an increase of more like 2%. Social care problems are also being blamed. NHS Improvement says there was a 28% jump in the number of ""bed days"" lost because of problems discharging medically fit patients, who had to be kept in hospital when they were medically fit to leave. Difficulties finding the right community or social care were cited as reasons for that increase. Rising numbers of non-urgent operations and procedures were cancelled because of bed shortages.  That hit hospital finances as trusts lost the flow of income they would normally have received for carrying out the operations. It's easy to see why NHS England leaders and hospital chiefs have been calling for urgent action on social care. A delayed transfer is bad news for the patient stuck in the hospital bed, frustrating for the patient who has an operation postponed, and a real headache for hospital finance directors who lose income. NHS Improvement argues that more cost controls have been applied, resulting in a 24% lower bill for agency staff in December compared to 12 months earlier. Paul Briddock, of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, said staff had done a ""remarkable job in trying to keep services going while also delivering over Â£2bn of efficiencies"". A deficit overshoot of a few hundred million pounds should of course been seen in the context of total trust revenue of nearly Â£80bn and annual NHS spending in England of more than Â£100bn. To get to the real picture, though, you need to take into account the Â£1.8bn ""sustainability fund"" run by NHS Improvement. This, in effect, is financial support for trusts who follow the regulator's plans for cost reduction. Add that to the possible year end deficit of Â£850m, as already stated, and you get to a total overspend of around Â£2.6bn which would be higher than last year. A year ago we reported the pressure being exerted from on high on trusts to ensure they did not end the year too far into the red. The Department of Health has to ensure that trust deficits are covered by surpluses elsewhere so it does not overspend the budget agreed by Parliament. The process went to the wire last year and seems set to do so again. Remember this was supposed to be the ""year of plenty"" for NHS funding with annual increases tailing off in future years. The fact that trusts are struggling now is alarming. The government will argue the NHS could be more efficient and make better use of its resources. Critics will say the service in England is underfunded.

Tim Harford: Computing's hidden hero20 February 2017 (01:47:50),"One, zero, zero, one, zero, one. Zero, one, oneâ¦ That is the language of computers. Every clever thing your computer does - make a call, search a database, play a game - comes down to ones and zeroes. Actually, it comes down to the presence (one) or absence (zero) of a current in tiny transistors on a semiconductor chip. Thankfully, we do not have to program computers in zeroes and ones. Microsoft Windows, for example, uses 20GB, or 170 billion ones and zeroes. Printed out, the stack of A4 paper would be two and a half miles (4km) high. Imagine setting every transistor manually. Ignoring how fiddly this would be - transistors measure just billionths of a metre - if it took a second to flip each switch, installing Windows would take 5,000 years. Lt Grace Hopper using a new calculating machine invented by Howard Aiken for the US Navy's use during World War Two 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Early computers really were programmed rather like this. Consider the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, later known asthe Harvard Mark 1,external. It was a 15m-long (50ft), 2.5m-high concatenation of wheels, shafts, gears and switches. It contained 530 miles (850km) of wires. It whirred away under instruction from a roll of perforated paper tape. If you wanted it to solve a new equation, you had to work out which switches should be on or off, which wires should be plugged in where. Then, you had to flip all the switches, plug all the wires, and punch all the holes in the paper tape. Programming it was not just difficult, but involved tedious, repetitive and error-prone manual labour. Four decades on from the Harvard Mark 1, more compact and user-friendly machines such as the Commodore 64 found their way into schools. You may remember the childhood thrill of typing this: 10 print ""Hello world"" 20 go to 10 ""Hello world"" would fill the screen, in chunky, low-resolution text. You had instructed the computer in words that were recognisably, intuitively human. It seemed like a minor miracle. One reason for computers' astonishing progression since the Mark 1 is certainly ever-tinier components. But it is also because programmers can write software in human-like language, and have it translated into the ones and zeroes, the currents or not-currents, that ultimately do the work. The thing that began to make that possible was called a compiler. And behind the compiler was a woman called Grace Hopper. Nowadays, there is much discussion about how to get more women into tech. In 1906, when Grace was born, not many people cared about gender equality. Fortunately for Grace, her father wanted his daughters to get the same education as his son. Sent to a good school, Grace turned out to be brilliant at maths. Her grandfather was a rear admiral, and her childhood dream was to join the US Navy, but girls were not allowed. Then, in 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into World War Two. Male talent was called away. The US Navy started taking women. Grace signed up at once. If you are wondering why the navy needs mathematicians, consider aiming a missile. At what angle and direction should you fire? The answer depends on many things: target distance, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. These are not complex calculations, but they were time-consuming for a human ""computer"" armed only with pen and paper. As Lt (junior grade) Hopper graduated from midshipmen's school in 1944, the navy was intrigued by the potential of an unwieldy machine recently devised by Harvard professor Howard Aiken - the Mark 1. The navy sent Lt Hopper to help Prof Aiken work out what it could do. Grace Hopper with Howard Aitken (middle, bottom row) and the rest of the Harvard Mark 1 computer team in 1944 Prof Aiken was not thrilled to have a female join the team, but Lt Hopper impressed him enough that he asked her to write the operating manual. This involved plenty of trial and error. More often than not, the Mark 1 would grind to a halt soon after starting - and there was no user-friendly error message. Once, it was because a moth had flown into the machine - that gave us the modern term ""debugging"". More often, the bug was metaphorical - a wrongly flipped switch, a mispunched hole in the paper tape. The detective work was laborious and dull. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The simple steel box that transformed global trade How the barcode changed retailing Why the falling cost of light matters Lt Hopper and her colleagues started filling notebooks with bits of tried-and-tested, re-useable code. By 1951, computers had advanced enough to store these chunks - called ""subroutines"" - in their own memory systems. By then, Grace was working for a company called Remington Rand. She tried to persuade her employers to let programmers call up these subroutines in familiar words - to say things such as: ""Subtract income tax from pay."" She later said: ""No-one thought of that earlier, because they weren't as lazy as I was."" In fact, Grace was famed for hard work. Grace Hopper was posthumously granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 But what Grace called a ""compiler"" did involve a trade-off. It made programming quicker, but the resulting programmes ran more slowly. That is why Remington Rand were not interested. Every customer had their own, bespoke requirements for their shiny new computing machine. It made sense, the company thought, for its experts to program them as efficiently as they could. Grace was not discouraged: she simply wrote the first compiler in her spare time. And others loved how it helped them to think more clearly. Kurt Beyer's book, Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age, relates many tales of impressed users. One of them was an engineer called Carl Hammer, who used the compiler to attack an equation his colleagues had struggled with for months. Mr Hammer wrote 20 lines of code, and solved it in a day. Like-minded programmers all over the US started sending Grace new chunks of code, and she added them to the library for the next release. In effect, she was single-handedly pioneering open-source software. Grace's compiler evolved into one of the first programming languages, COBOL. More fundamentally, it paved the way for the now-familiar distinction between hardware and software. Dr Telle Whitney co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration in 1994 to encourage women into computing With one-of-a-kind machines such as the Harvard Mark 1, software was hardware. No pattern of switches would also work on another machine, which would be wired completely differently. But if a computer can run a compiler, it can also run any program that uses it. Further layers of abstraction have since come to separate human programmers from the nitty-gritty of physical chips. And each one has taken a further step in the direction Grace realised made sense: freeing up programmer brainpower to think about concepts and algorithms, not switches and wires. Grace had her own views of why colleagues had been initially resistant: not because they cared about making programs run more quickly, but because they enjoyed the prestige of being the only ones who could communicate with the godlike computer. The ""high priests"", Grace called them. She thought anyone should be able to programme. Now, anyone can. And computers are far more useful because of it.

Amy's Place,"Grace, a recovering alcoholic, is one of 16 young women living in Amy's Place Set up in memory of the late singer Amy Winehouse, Amy's Place is the UK's only recovery house dedicated to helping young women overcome their addictions. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme is the first to go inside and meet the women aiming to go clean for good. ""I'm not that long sober, but I've come so far. You forget that my life was sitting in a homeless hostel planning how to kill myself,"" Grace says. The 19-year-old is one of the first occupants of Amy's Place - a recovery house established by the Amy Winehouse Foundation. She is a recovering alcoholic, and has been dry for just over a year. It is a marked turnaround from the life she used to lead. ""It started when I had my first drink aged eight, and by 12, I was sneaking around doing things that I shouldn't have been doing,"" she says. ""Between 13 and 14 I went into care, and that's where [the drinking] took off and I could be more sneaky about it, as I didn't have my parents around."" Amy Winehouse struggled with drug and alcohol addiction Grace says she drank as a coping mechanism, but it soon became a habit. The problem ""rocketed"" when she began living in a homeless hostel, until one incident shook her into realising the full extent of the damage being caused. ""It was in November 2015, when I took 57 antidepressants on a litre of vodka and a litre of [liqueur], and nearly died. I woke up frothing at the mouth, terrified. ""They were detoxing me in 'resus' [resuscitation area] in hospital and they told me, 'It's a waiting game now to see if your organs are failing or not.' ""It was four days of me sitting in resus hoping and praying I wasn't dying."" Watch Jean Mackenzie's full film about Amy's Place onthe Victoria Derbyshire website. Grace decided to take steps to overcome her addiction but living in a homeless hostel meant it wasn't easy. ""When your room was next to somebody who is selling drugs, you can never get well in a sense,"" she says. ""You're always stuck in the conundrum of, 'Do I go back to my old habits or do I go to a [support] meeting?' ""I was living a life of recovery in a using and drinking world."" Jane Winehouse says the house's potential to change lives is a ""wonderful thing"" It is stories like Grace's that motivated Amy Winehouse's step-mother, Jane Winehouse, to set up the house - designed to help young women stay clean while taking their first steps without drugs and alcohol once they have left rehab. ""We met people in treatment who were scared to death of what was going to happen when they finished treatment [in rehab],"" she says. ""For a lot of them, all they could think about was, 'If I have to go back to where I was before, I'm just not going to stand a chance.'"" Set up in partnership with the housing provider Centra, Amy's Place is the only recovery house in the UK designed specifically to help women under 30. Winehouse died aged 27 in July 2011 from alcohol poisoning. She had previously struggled with drug addiction for many years and had spent time in rehab. In the London house each of the 16 occupants gets her own flat, paid for using housing benefit. They can stay for up to two years. There is a strict policy of no drugs, no alcohol and no overnight guests and they must agree to random drugs tests - Grace passed her latest one. This video can not be played Amy Winehouse home 'has given me a future' Another resident, 26-year-old Judith Heryka, is also working towards a more stable future, without drugs. Her main motivation is her children, aged five and seven. The catalyst for her deciding to seek help came when she was told proceedings would begin to take them into the adoption system. She says it saved her life. Judith had become hooked on crack cocaine and says she had become ""very depressedâ¦ bitterly, bitterly, bitterly, like suicidal, depressed"". As part of the programme at Amy's Place, the women must take part in activities outside the house that can help them stay clean and prepare them for living by themselves. It could be re-entering education, doing voluntary work or - in Judith's case - finding a passion, such as kickboxing. ""I can really zone out, do something that I love,"" she explains, while taking part in a local class. Judith says the house is ""100%"" the reason why she is managing to stay clean and the first time she has lived somewhere and felt safe. House manager Hannah Crystal says she is ""really excited"" to see the women progress. ""I think the girls here are going to get to a point where they're ready to move on,"" she adds. ""And we'll have new arrivals, and I think we'll keep growing from strength to strength."" The road to recovery, however, is not without its difficulties. Some of the women in the house have relapsed, and Grace admits she recently came close to drinking. The house is working with Grace to help her achieve her ambitions. She hopes to become a forensic psychologist one day and at the moment she's learning woodwork with the charity the Spitalfields Crypt Trust.

Tim Harford: Computing's hidden hero,"One, zero, zero, one, zero, one. Zero, one, oneâ¦ That is the language of computers. Every clever thing your computer does - make a call, search a database, play a game - comes down to ones and zeroes. Actually, it comes down to the presence (one) or absence (zero) of a current in tiny transistors on a semiconductor chip. Thankfully, we do not have to program computers in zeroes and ones. Microsoft Windows, for example, uses 20GB, or 170 billion ones and zeroes. Printed out, the stack of A4 paper would be two and a half miles (4km) high. Imagine setting every transistor manually. Ignoring how fiddly this would be - transistors measure just billionths of a metre - if it took a second to flip each switch, installing Windows would take 5,000 years. Lt Grace Hopper using a new calculating machine invented by Howard Aiken for the US Navy's use during World War Two 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Early computers really were programmed rather like this. Consider the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, later known asthe Harvard Mark 1,external. It was a 15m-long (50ft), 2.5m-high concatenation of wheels, shafts, gears and switches. It contained 530 miles (850km) of wires. It whirred away under instruction from a roll of perforated paper tape. If you wanted it to solve a new equation, you had to work out which switches should be on or off, which wires should be plugged in where. Then, you had to flip all the switches, plug all the wires, and punch all the holes in the paper tape. Programming it was not just difficult, but involved tedious, repetitive and error-prone manual labour. Four decades on from the Harvard Mark 1, more compact and user-friendly machines such as the Commodore 64 found their way into schools. You may remember the childhood thrill of typing this: 10 print ""Hello world"" 20 go to 10 ""Hello world"" would fill the screen, in chunky, low-resolution text. You had instructed the computer in words that were recognisably, intuitively human. It seemed like a minor miracle. One reason for computers' astonishing progression since the Mark 1 is certainly ever-tinier components. But it is also because programmers can write software in human-like language, and have it translated into the ones and zeroes, the currents or not-currents, that ultimately do the work. The thing that began to make that possible was called a compiler. And behind the compiler was a woman called Grace Hopper. Nowadays, there is much discussion about how to get more women into tech. In 1906, when Grace was born, not many people cared about gender equality. Fortunately for Grace, her father wanted his daughters to get the same education as his son. Sent to a good school, Grace turned out to be brilliant at maths. Her grandfather was a rear admiral, and her childhood dream was to join the US Navy, but girls were not allowed. Then, in 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into World War Two. Male talent was called away. The US Navy started taking women. Grace signed up at once. If you are wondering why the navy needs mathematicians, consider aiming a missile. At what angle and direction should you fire? The answer depends on many things: target distance, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. These are not complex calculations, but they were time-consuming for a human ""computer"" armed only with pen and paper. As Lt (junior grade) Hopper graduated from midshipmen's school in 1944, the navy was intrigued by the potential of an unwieldy machine recently devised by Harvard professor Howard Aiken - the Mark 1. The navy sent Lt Hopper to help Prof Aiken work out what it could do. Grace Hopper with Howard Aitken (middle, bottom row) and the rest of the Harvard Mark 1 computer team in 1944 Prof Aiken was not thrilled to have a female join the team, but Lt Hopper impressed him enough that he asked her to write the operating manual. This involved plenty of trial and error. More often than not, the Mark 1 would grind to a halt soon after starting - and there was no user-friendly error message. Once, it was because a moth had flown into the machine - that gave us the modern term ""debugging"". More often, the bug was metaphorical - a wrongly flipped switch, a mispunched hole in the paper tape. The detective work was laborious and dull. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The simple steel box that transformed global trade How the barcode changed retailing Why the falling cost of light matters Lt Hopper and her colleagues started filling notebooks with bits of tried-and-tested, re-useable code. By 1951, computers had advanced enough to store these chunks - called ""subroutines"" - in their own memory systems. By then, Grace was working for a company called Remington Rand. She tried to persuade her employers to let programmers call up these subroutines in familiar words - to say things such as: ""Subtract income tax from pay."" She later said: ""No-one thought of that earlier, because they weren't as lazy as I was."" In fact, Grace was famed for hard work. Grace Hopper was posthumously granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 But what Grace called a ""compiler"" did involve a trade-off. It made programming quicker, but the resulting programmes ran more slowly. That is why Remington Rand were not interested. Every customer had their own, bespoke requirements for their shiny new computing machine. It made sense, the company thought, for its experts to program them as efficiently as they could. Grace was not discouraged: she simply wrote the first compiler in her spare time. And others loved how it helped them to think more clearly. Kurt Beyer's book, Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age, relates many tales of impressed users. One of them was an engineer called Carl Hammer, who used the compiler to attack an equation his colleagues had struggled with for months. Mr Hammer wrote 20 lines of code, and solved it in a day. Like-minded programmers all over the US started sending Grace new chunks of code, and she added them to the library for the next release. In effect, she was single-handedly pioneering open-source software. Grace's compiler evolved into one of the first programming languages, COBOL. More fundamentally, it paved the way for the now-familiar distinction between hardware and software. Dr Telle Whitney co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration in 1994 to encourage women into computing With one-of-a-kind machines such as the Harvard Mark 1, software was hardware. No pattern of switches would also work on another machine, which would be wired completely differently. But if a computer can run a compiler, it can also run any program that uses it. Further layers of abstraction have since come to separate human programmers from the nitty-gritty of physical chips. And each one has taken a further step in the direction Grace realised made sense: freeing up programmer brainpower to think about concepts and algorithms, not switches and wires. Grace had her own views of why colleagues had been initially resistant: not because they cared about making programs run more quickly, but because they enjoyed the prestige of being the only ones who could communicate with the godlike computer. The ""high priests"", Grace called them. She thought anyone should be able to programme. Now, anyone can. And computers are far more useful because of it.

Facing the robotic revolution,"Pepper awakes. ""Hi, I am a humanoid robot, and I am 1.2m [4ft] tall. I was born atAldebaran,externalin Paris. You can keep on asking me questions if you want."" Michael Szollosy, who looks at the social impact and cultural influence of robots, has just switched on the new arrival at theSheffield Robotics,externalcentre, at the University of Sheffield. He asks: ""What do you do,Pepper,external?"" ""Human."" ""You do human?"" I interject. ""Of course not,"" says Pepper, ""but that shouldn't keep us from chatting."" I say indeed not, and ask what he thought of Paris. ""You can caress my head or hands for example,"" is the reply. ""Very Parisian,"" I observe, stroking the sensors atop of Pepper. ""I like it when you touch my head. Ah, miaow."" ""You're a scream, Pepper."" Mark Mardell meets Milo ""Miaow ! I feel like a cat!"" Pepper is slim white robot, with skeletal hands, a plastic body and big black eyes. Mr Szollosy  says: ""Human beings don't need very much to identify something as alive. ""So a couple of black dots and a line underneath and we see a face every time. ""People say, 'Oh he's smiling at me,' - his mouth doesn't move. But that's what humans bring to the equation. ""We invent these things. I say robots were invented in the imagination long before they were built in labs."" The rise of the robots? Will a robot take your job? All about intelligent machines Do we really need to fear AI? This project is less about developing the technology and more about examining the way we relate to it - most people working in this field are convinced Pepper and and his kind will have huge implications for all of us, changing the way we work, the way we live, even the way we relate to each other. ""I think it is going to be increasingly the case that robots do more and more of the jobs that people used to do,"" says the centre's director, Prof Tony Prescott. ""We have lots of Eastern Europeans weeding fields because nobody in the UK wants to do that. It could be automated. It's a perfect job for a robot to do."" We are now at a tipping point. The advances in AI (artificial intelligence) mean robots can now do much more. But it hasn't developed in the way people might have expected 50 years ago. A computer can do really clever stuff -beating a chess grandmaster,externalwith ease, and now winning at Go. But a robot butler, which could make you a cup of coffee and run your bath, remains out of reach. Taking jobs, not terminating humans, may be the biggest threat posed by robots The very idea of robots excites and scares. It is part of the reason behind this centre. After the development of genetically modified (GM) food, also known in the tabloids as ""Frankenstein food"", and the backlash against it, they decided some education was called for. Mr Szollosy says people are frightened by the wrong things. He bemoans the fact that any story about robotics is accompanied by a picture of the Terminator. ""If artificial intelligence does want to take over the world, eradicate the human race, there are much more efficient ways of doing it,"" he says. ""Gun-wielding bipedal robots - we could beat them no problem. Daleks can't go upstairs. ""My job is to make people understand what not to fear but also explain that robots may well take 60% of the jobs in 20 years' time and that is of deep concern, if we don't restructure society to go along with that."" Prof Prescott hopes robots are part of the solution to a problem that haunts politicians. ""We have a shortage of trained carers, and it is often migrant labour,"" he says. ""Those jobs are very poorly paid. ""The quality of life for people in care is low, the quality of life for the carers is also low. ""I would like to protect the right to human contact in law, but people with dementia may need a lot of physical help and a lot of that can be provided by robots."" Paro is a furry communications robot Milo, with a chunky body and a mobile face under anime-style hair, is designed to mimic human expressionsto help autistic children,external. But some of those he manages I've never seen on a real person. MiRo,externalis much cuter, looking somewhat like a dog, a donkey or a rabbit. ""It's designed to mimic the behaviour of animals,"" says Sheffield Robotics' senior experimental officer Dr James Law. ""For patients, particularly the elderly, particularly with Alzheimer's and dementia it is akin to pet therapy, which can have a lot of value for people who need more social interaction in their lives."" Still MiRo is not very cuddly. UnlikeParo,external. I would say he's a very sophisticated furry toy seal, squeaking as you stroke his sensors, flashing big black eyes as you caress him. Dr Emily Collins is interested in using such robots in children's wards, where real animals and even fur is a danger. ""I'm very interested in what mechanism is going on between a human and an animal which results in increased neuropeptide release, so they need less pain medication,"" she says. ""Being able to replicate that in paediatric wards, where you cannot have animals, would be fantastic. ""I don't see the point in a humanoid robot, apart from the fact people like the form and the shape. ""As soon as you make a robot look like a human analogue, people have expectations that the robot is going to do the same as a person, and we can't replicate that."" Many car production lines have been automated, but what next? It is a really interesting debate, and one that maybe one day we'll have to face. But there are far more pressing problem. If Mr Szollosy is right and robots take 60% of the jobs by 2037, what does he think will happen? ""The jobs are going to go,"" he says. ""There is going to be greater unemployment. Maybe we need to recast our society so that becomes a good thing, not a bad thing."" Prof Prescott says: ""If people aren't able to sell their labour, then the whole market struggles because the people producing still need people to buy. ""So maybe we need to pay people to consume, maybe through somebasic income,external. ""I think it is inevitable that we go in that direction. It's good news. ""The possibility now exists we can put over a lot of the work we don't like to robots and AIs."" The idea of ""the basic,external"" would face huge political opposition. But it's worth noting that many who work in the field think there are few alternatives, even if there has to be an economic crisis before it's taken seriously. This is not the same as interesting questions for the future about robot rights or consciousness - these problems are coming toward us with, well, the speed and ferocity of the Terminator. Mainstream politicians are only just beginning to take notice.

Jonathan Marcus: US and Europe weigh each other up,"Germany's Angela Merkel, seen here with US Vice-President Mike Pence, asked in a speech whether countries would return to ""parochial policies"" The Munich Security Conference is at one and the same time an annual jamboree for senior officials and think-tankers and a place where former officials and corporate movers-and-shakers meet up. But it also affords an opportunity for a whole series of behind the scenes bilateral meetings. And once every four years it is the place where Europe takes stock of a new US administration. This year the meeting had added significance since the man in the White House, Donald Trump, is unlike any other president in living memory. His supporters believe he is the man to overturn the ""establishment"" in Washington and to get things done. His detractors believe he is unfit for high office, his erratic behaviour leading some even to question his mental state. Remember this was a man who on the campaign traildescribed Nato as ""obsolete""and who said that he would end the free ride that he believed many allies - especially in Europe - were taking at the American taxpayers' expense. So this encounter in Munich was an opportunity for Nato allies to weigh up the new Trump team and to try to gauge the new administration's likely direction. Mr Trump sent his Vice-President Mike Pence to Munich to deliver a series of clearly worded messages. Trump 'unwavering' in support for Nato allies, says Pence What does Nato want from Trump? And to avoid any doubt his new defence chief, General James Mattis, provided awarm-up act at Nato headquartersat the end of last week - and to ensure nobody mistakes the message Mr Pence himself will be heading to Brussels, the seat of Nato, once the Munich conference is over. Mr Pence used his Munich speech to bring a message of reassurance from the new president. ""The US,"" he said, strongly supports Nato and will be ""unwavering in its commitment to the trans-Atlantic alliance"" . Mike Pence's words were an attempt to calm nerves ruffled when President Trump called the alliance 'obsolete' But with so few allies actually meeting the agreed target for defence spending, there was a warning too. ""Let me be clear on this point,"" he stressed, ""the president of the United States expects our allies to keep their word to fulfil this commitment and for most that means the time has come to do more"". This statement was met with hesitant applause - an indication that many Europeans do not welcome being bullied by the Trump White House. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had emphasised that military spending alone was not the only measure of the Europeans' commitment to security. She calmly - but pointedly - took issue with many of the Trump team's putative policies, noting the importance of international multilateral institutions like the EU and the UN (both of which have been condemned by Mr Trump). Indeed at the end of her speech she seemed to take on the central tenet of the Trump campaign - enshrined in the slogan ""America First!"" Looking to the future she posed a fundamental question. ""Will we be able,"" she asked, ""to act in concert together or (will we) fall back into parochial policies?"" One of Europe's greatest fears has been Mr Trump's apparent willingness to do a deal with Moscow - not to mention his evident admiration for Russia's leader Vladimir Putin. Mr Trump's emissaries pretty much convinced their European hosts that on key issues - at least for now - there would be no change. General Mattis insisted that Russia had to abide by international law and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, on a recent visit to Bonn, stressed that agreements like the Minsk accords to end the fighting in Ukraine had to be fully implemented by all sides - including Moscow. Sergei Lavrov, represented Russia, who were almost bystanders at this Nato conference Vice-President Pence emphasised the message saying here in Munich that the US would continue to hold Russia to account, even as it searched for areas of common ground. The Russians have almost been bystanders here watching the internal Nato debate from the sidelines. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov returned to a familiar theme - that Nato was essentially an institution of the past. The expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, he said, had led to an unprecedented level of tensions. What was now needed was what he called a ""post-western world order"". So there seems little chance here for President Trump's hope for fresh understanding with Moscow - or at the very least that it will not come at the expense of the European Nato allies, or perhaps even of Ukraine. If there is a deal to be done between Washington and Moscow it will lie elsewhere, perhaps over Syria. This Munich conference will end on Sunday with many of the concerns of the Europeans only partially stilled. For they relate more to the character and outlook of the new US president himself. One of his tweets can undermine policies that have received bipartisan support in Washington for decades.

Cake or biscuit?,"It's a delicious structure consisting of a small sponge with a chocolate cap covering a veneer of orange jelly. It is arguably Britain's greatest invention after the steam engine and the light bulb. But is a Jaffa Cake actually a biscuit, asks David Edmonds. This question reheats a confectionery conundrum first raised in 1991. A tax is charged on chocolate-covered biscuits, but not on cakes. The manufacturer, McVities, had always categorised them as cakes and to boost their revenue the tax authorities wanted them recategorised as biscuits. A legal case was fought in front of a brilliant adjudicator, Mr D C Potter. For McVities, this produced a sweet result. The Jaffa Cake has both cake-like qualities and biscuit-like qualities, but Mr Potter's verdict was that, on balance, a Jaffa Cake is a cake. He examineda dozen possible criteria,external. There was, for example, the name. They are called Jaffa Cakes, not Jaffa Biscuits. This, Mr Potter concluded, was a trifling consideration, though he noted that Jaffa Cakes are more biscuit than cake in several ways. They are packaged like biscuits, and they are marketed like biscuits: they are usually found in the biscuit aisle in shops. On the other hand, they have fundamental cake-esque qualities. Thus, they have ingredients of a traditional sponge cake: eggs, flour and sugar. And when Jaffa Cakes go stale they become hard, unlike biscuits, which become soft. Does size matter? Jaffa Cakes are more biscuit-sized than cake-sized. Linked to this, cakes are often eaten with a fork, while biscuits tend to be held in the hand.  To test the significance of size, I asked the winner of The Great British Bake Off 2013, Frances Quinn, to bake the most ginormous Jaffa Cake the world has ever seen - the size of a flying saucer, at 124cm in diameter, weighing in at 50kg, and containing 120 eggs and 30 litres of jelly. Frances Quinn brandishes a suitably giant mixer attachment Tim Crane, Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge University, does not believe that this XXXXXXXXXXXL Jaffa Cake is any more cake-like than its normal-sized Jaffa Cake sibling. ""These days you see all sorts of tiny cakes for sale, some of them much smaller than Jaffa Cakes,"" he says. ""And there's nothing incoherent about a giant biscuit."" This video can not be played How do you make the world's biggest Jaffa Cake? The immediate implication of Mr Potter's ruling was financial.  But Prof Crane says the question ""Cake or Biscuit?"" touches on a profound philosophical problem. ""How do our concepts relate to reality?"" Which aspects of our classification of the world come from the world itself and which come from us? There is no record of the 20th Century philosopher, Ludwig Wittgenstein, ever tasting a Jaffa Cake, though there is evidence that he was partial towards a bun. But his ideas are relevant to the Jaffa Cake puzzle. We are tempted to think that every concept must have a strict definition to be useable.  But Wittgenstein pointed out that there are many ""family-resemblance"" concepts, as he called them. Family members can look alike without sharing a single characteristic. Some might have distinctive cheek bones, others a prominent nose, etc.  Equally, some concepts can operate with overlapping similarities. Take the concept of ""game"". Some games involve a ball, some don't. Some involve teams, some don't. Some are competitive, some are not. There is no characteristic that all games have in common. And there is no strict definition of ""cake"" or ""biscuit"" that compels us to place the Jaffa Cake under either category. Ponder the philosophy of the Jaffa Cake in thePhilosopher's Armson BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 on Monday 20 February Or catch up laterhere Another temptation is to believe that all that is at stake here is an arbitrary issue of semantics. It is, the thought goes, a mere verbal convention whether one labels a Jaffa Cake a cake or a biscuit. It has nothing to do with the real world. The distinction between statements that are true as a matter of convention or language (""All triangles have three sides""), and those that make a claim about the empirical world (""It is possible to eat 13 Jaffa Cakes in a minute,external"") - is a longstanding one in philosophy. But in the middle of the last century the American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine disputed whether such a rigid distinction could be maintained - and Tim Crane agrees with him that it cannot. ""Do you know what an Umiak is?"" Tim Crane asks? ""No?  Well, it's a flat-bottomed Inuit canoe. So have I told you something about the word, or have I told you something about the world? Well, I think you've learned something about both."" And if it's true to say, ""a Jaffa Cake is a cake"" (or ""a Jaffa Cake is a biscuit"") then that also tells us something about the world, i.e. about the properties of a Jaffa Cake, as well as about the meaning of the word ""cake"". But could Jaffa Cakes be neither cakes nor biscuits - and instead something in between? It may be interesting to compare Jaffa Cakes with people here, even though they differ in several ways - most Jaffa Cakes have no opinion about how they should be identified, for example, and most humans are not topped by a thin but scrumptious layer of chocolate. Until recently, people have not been free to choose their gender, and have been restricted to being described as either male or female. More and more discoveries in science are undermining this binary mapping.  It used to be thought that men were defined by their having a Y chromosome.  Now we know that whether an embryo develops as a male depends upon a single gene: the SRY gene. It's possible for a person with XY chromosomes to have the appearance of a woman if they are lacking this gene. Similarly, a person with XX chromosomes can have the appearance of a male if they carry this gene. There are many genes at play when it comes to the male versus female development. Genetics, hormones, chromosomes can all combine to complicate a complicated picture. As a result, says Dr Helen O'Neill, a geneticist at University College London, ""I think we should revise our definitions of male and female, there are many gradations in between"". In fact, for some purposes, she thinks we should get rid of the male-female distinction, for example on passports. After all, she says, we are all homo sapiens. This video can not be played Is it a cake or is it a biscuit? Multifaceted expressions of identity inject a further layer of complexity.  Mx Pips Bunce, who is married with two children and works for Credit Suisse as head of Global Markets Integration Components, identifies as ""gender-fluid"".  Sometimes Pips wakes up choosing to express as Pippa and other times as Phil. The world at present is set up for binary categorisation despite as many as 4% of people now identifying as non-binary, according to some studies.  Two obvious and tricky areas are bathrooms and sport.  Pips uses the female bathrooms as Pippa and the male ones as Phil, whereas some people who identify as non-binary or trans would rather bathrooms were intersex.  The topic of which bathrooms transgender people use ishighly contentious. Equally contentious are intersex athletes in sport, like the South African Olympic 800m champion, Caster Semenya, who competes as a woman. Is it possible, or desirable, to break down the binary categories in sport - to introduce new categories perhaps? The idea is not preposterous. Boxing, with its different weights - flyweight, heavyweight etc. - is one of several sports carved up into more nuanced groupings than simply male/female. Craig from Guinness World Records measures the Jaffa Cake But back to the Jaffa Cake mystery. Cake or biscuit? ""Definitely cake,"" says Tim Crane, echoing the judgement of Mr Potter. This is an assertion about the world, not just about language. A Jaffa Cake, in its essence, is more cake-like than biscuit like. Its cake features are more elemental than its biscuit features. And with that riddle solved, the Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy shrinks the world's largest Jaffa Cake by taking a giant bite.

Grunge's greatest icon,"Kurt Cobain was 27 when he died in 1994 The shoulder-length blond hair. The stubble. The youthful face with its permanently weary gaze. Kurt Cobain is still instantly recognisable as one of the most iconic faces of the 1990s, and the most important musician of the grunge scene. It is almost staggering to realise he would now be in his fifties. On the 23rd anniversary of his death, what explains his enduring influence? Kurt was outspoken on gay rights, homophobia and sexism. He said he wished he'd been gay, just to annoy homophobes, and often wore dresses to protest against sexism. ""Wearing a dress shows I can be as feminine as I want,"" he told the LA Times, in a jab at the macho undercurrents he detested in rock. ""I'm a heterosexual... big deal. But if I was a homosexual, it wouldn't matter either."" He admitted to spray-painting cars with ""God is gay"" and was once arrested for graffitiing by police in Aberdeen, Washington State. Kurt was 19 when he was arrested by Aberdeen police The band came to represent Generation X but he had no time for apathy. ""I'm disgusted by my own and my generation's apathy. I'm disgusted at what we allow to go on, by how spineless, lethargic and guilty we are of not standing up against racism, sexism and all those other 'isms' that the counterculture has been whining about for years while they sit and enforce those same attitudes every night on their televisions and in the magazines."" Headlining Reading Festival was Nirvana's last UK performance ""What's alternative? What's counterculture? What's cool? Who knows? Who cares? If chasing cool is important to you, you're an idiot!"", Kurt said ina 1991 interview,external. And, for someone who came to be seen as a spokesperson for his generation, Kurt rejected any hype about their so-called ""overnight"" success (actually five years in the making). ""I'm not into ambition or salesmanship, we're not some new trend. We never meant or tried to be cool, or be a 'buzz' band. It never even entered our minds."" Frances Bean was not yet two when her father Kurt died It would be easier to list who Nirvana didn't influence than who they did. Lana Del Rey, Blink-182, Justin Timberlake and Jay Z have all quoted Nirvana songs in their own lyrics, while Weezer once played an entire concert of Nirvana covers. ""Cobain changed the course of where the music went,"" said Vernon Reid of rock band Living Colour. ""There are certain people where you can see the axis of musical history twisting on them: Hendrix was pivotal, Prince was pivotal, Cobain was pivotal."" Nirvana launched a million garage bands - the simple barre chords that open Smells Like Teen Spirit are the first song many guitarists learn - and helped foster a do-it-yourself attitude that now permeates everything from indie to pop and grime. They introduced legions of fans to alternative music, pushing associated acts like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Kurt's favourites The Pixies into the mainstream. Butspeaking in 1991,external, Kurt downplayed his own musical talents. ""I don't understand anything technical about music at all. I don't understand any of it, why you can't put these sounds together with those sounds. I only know what sounds good to us. ""I, or we as a band, never really copied anybody or spent time learning other people's songs. We were never good enough or had the patience to do it! So we put that energy into putting our own stuff together. We're from the learn-Â­asÂ­-you-Â­play school. We're still in it."" In his performance on Top of the Pops, at one point he sang with the microphone in his mouth Anyone lucky enough to have seen Nirvana play live would attest to the power of their live performances. But some became remembered for other reasons. When they played at Top of the Pops in 1991, the band were advised to sing live over a pre-recorded backing track. Nirvana decided they'd rather not, thanks all the same. Instead, Kurt sang Smells Like Teen Spirit in a much lower voice, changed some of the lyrics and barely touched his guitar. The rest of the band performed in a similar vein, emphasising the fact they were very much not playing it live. At Reading Festival Kurt came on stage on a wheel chair before singing one line and then pretending to collapse on stage. Similarly striking was their appearance at the 1992 Reading Festival. It was August bank holiday weekend and rumours had been circulating that Kurt and his wife Courtney Love, who'd just given birth to Frances Bean, were deeply unwell. In response, he came on stage in a wheelchair, wearing a hospital gown and a blond wig, sticking two fingers up at the music press. It was Nirvana's first time headlining the festival - but it would also be their last UK performance. Dave Grohl said they had barely rehearsed but, somehow, that didn't matter. Given the cult that has grown around Nirvana's music and Kurt's death, it's easy to forget the star was unusually eloquent and passionate. Dig out some archive interviews and his quotes sound surprisingly contemporary. Others, though, seem chilling with the benefit of hindsight. ""I never wanted to sing. I just wanted to play rhythm guitar - hide in the back and just play."" ""I definitely feel closer to the feminine side of the human being than I do the male."" ""The duty of youth is to challenge corruption."" ""I wanted to have the adoration of John Lennon, but have the anonymity of Ringo Starr."" ""I really miss being able to blend in with people."" ""Rap music is the only vital form of music introduced since punk rock."" Kurt tore himself to shreds worrying about fame and selling out. In Utero, the follow-up to Nevermind, was deliberately abrasive while Nirvana often refused to play Smells Like Teen Spirit in concert. But their MTV Unplugged concert - released as an album after Kurt's death - showed how the band could have survived in the longer term. It's unusual for a live record - in that it sidesteps the band's hits in favour of more obscure songs and a slate of covers very few people had ever heard of (including three tunes by The Meat Puppets). But it is beautifully, nakedly emotional. Kurt performed the set in one unbroken take, surrounded by lilies (the flowers of death) hunched over in his oversized cardigan. His fingers sometimes fumbled on the unfamiliar acoustic guitar, but that only heightened the frailty of his lyrics. If the band needed to find a way out of the corner they'd backed themselves into, this was it. Like Dylan going electric, but in reverse. ""I'll never forget after we did Unplugged, how happy Kurt was - he was so happy,"" bassist Krist Novoselic told the BBC's Seven Ages of Rock programme. ""He was really really happy after that. He was relieved, and we pulled it off."" The star himself had previously hinted this was a path he wanted to explore. ""It might be nice to start playing acoustic guitar and be thought of as a singer and a songwriter, rather than a grunge rocker because then I might be able to take advantage of that when I'm older,"" he told a French journalist in 1993. ""I could sit down on a chair and play acoustic guitar like Johnny Cash or something, and it won't be a big joke.""

Walls of sound,"David Bowie already has a plaque but who else deserves one? Rock and pop's most influential figures are to be honoured with blue plaques on BBC Music Day this year - and you can decide who gets one. Over the next week, every BBC local radio station in England and the Channel Islands is accepting nominations for a local artist (or venue) that changed the course of musical history. The winners will be honoured with a plaque on a building where they lived or a venue where they became famous. To be considered the nominee must be: Innovative Influential Successful Dead The candidates will be submitted to The British Plaque Trust - and the 40 recipients will be unveiled on Friday, 9 June as part of BBC Music Day. Surprisingly few pop musicians have one - with a notable exception being David Bowie, who is honoured at the location of the photoshoot for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust in London's West End. But who else deserves one? To get you thinking, here are five people and places that could benefit from a blue plaque. Long before he could grow that designer stubble, George Michael met Andrew Ridgeley at Bushey Meads school and pop history changed forever. Bonding over a love of music, the duo initially formed a five-piece band called The Executive, who played everything from ska to Beethoven's Fur Elise. Their friendship was vital in sustaining George through the whirlwind success of Wham! and eventually giving him the courage to go solo. Estimated to be more than 100 million years old, Peak Cavern is undoubtedly the oldest music venue in the UK. The natural limestone cavern has hosted gigs by the likes of Richard Hawley, Mystery Jets and The Vaccines, who all benefit from the site's remarkable acoustics. Fun fact: It used to be called The Devil's Arse (because of the flatulent sound caused by flood water draining from the cave) but received a more demure name in 1880, so Queen Victoria wouldn't be offended when she visited for a concert. While Queen were still a struggling young pop band, Freddie Mercury ran a stall in London's Kensington Market with drummer Roger Taylor. They sold clothes and bric-a-brac, as well as a thesis Freddie had written about Jimi Hendrix while attending Ealing College. The stall did well enough to fund the band in their early days -  so much so that they kept it going after Queen released their first album. Delia Derbyshire is one of the earliest and most influential pioneers of electronic sound. Working in a time before synthesisers, samplers and multi-track tape recorders, the musician, assisted by her engineer Dick Mills, created not only the original Dr Who theme but countless other experimental and ground-breaking recordings. She was born in Coventry, but was evacuated to Preston, Lancashire, during World War Two. A blue plaque at either of her childhood homes would be a fitting memorial. Not the most rock'n'roll of locations, Beachy Head nonetheless deserves its place in music history. David Bowie filmed elements of the video for Ashes to Ashes there; and The Cure used it as the backdrop for both Just Like Heaven and Close To Me. Industrial noise terrorists Throbbing Gristle used it in the deeply-ironic cover for their album, 20 Jazz Funk Greats; and, most famously of all, it stars in the final scene of The Who's Quadrophenia, where the young Jimmy throws his scooter over the edge of those chalky cliffs. To make your suggestion for a musical blue plaque, you can contact your BBC local radio station via email, Twitter or Facebook; or email localmusiclegends@bbc.co.uk. You can also share suggestions on social media using #localmusiclegends. The British Plaque Trust criteria is to commemorate innovative, influential and successful people who have died - but any genre of music is permissible, and significant locations which have played a part in our musical heritage are also eligible. The initiative is not a vote - so the final decision on who or what the plaques commemorate, and where they are located, will not be based on the number of suggestions received. Nominations close at midnight on Sunday, 26 February. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

But their MTV Unplugged concert - released as an album after Kurt's death - showed how the band could have survived in the longer term. It's unusual for a live record - in that it sidesteps the band's hits in favour of more obscure songs and a slate of covers very few people had ever heard of (including three tunes by The Meat Puppets). But it is beautifully, nakedly emotional. Kurt performed the set in one unbroken take, surrounded by lilies (the flowers of death) hunched over in his oversized cardigan. His fingers sometimes fumbled on the unfamiliar acoustic guitar, but that only heightened the frailty of his lyrics. If the band needed to find a way out of the corner they'd backed themselves into, this was it. Like Dylan going electric, but in reverse. ""I'll never forget after we did Unplugged, how happy Kurt was - he was so happy,"" bassist Krist Novoselic told the BBC's Seven Ages of Rock programme. ""He was really really happy after that. He was relieved, and we pulled it off."" The star himself had previously hinted this was a path he wanted to explore. ""It might be nice to start playing acoustic guitar and be thought of as a singer and a songwriter, rather than a grunge rocker because then I might be able to take advantage of that when I'm older,"" he told a French journalist in 1993. ""I could sit down on a chair and play acoustic guitar like Johnny Cash or something, and it won't be a big joke.""

Who are 'Antifa'?,"A protester lobs a brick at police during protests in Washington during the inauguration of Donald Trump In a divided America, two groups at the extreme ends of the political spectrum are doing battle online, and on the streets. The alt-right -a disparate group of pro-Donald Trump provocateurs who critics say are bigoted white nationalists- has a reputation for trolling and online bullying. Now some believe they may have met their match in the form of a group of left-wing anarchists whose tactics are arguably more extreme. They're called ""antifa"", short for ""anti-fascist"". The movement has its roots in 1930s Europe, but has had a low profile for much of the intervening period. Now the recent surge in nationalist movements across the globe has given it a new enemy to fight. Antifa activists say they are committed to fighting fascism and racism in all its forms. Some aren't averse to violence, and the movement wasted little time in making its presence felt. Protests held during Donald Trump's inaugurationturned violent. Restaurant windows were smashed, a car was set on fire and objects were thrown at the police. More than 200 arrests were made. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external A Trump campaign hat set on fire by protesters during demonstrations in Washington But the video which went viral that day wasn't of the rioters; it was one that featured the white nationalist Richard Spencer being punched by a masked man. Almost immediately mocking memes flooded the internet, including a number of videos of the attack set to music. Far from condemning the attack, many antifa activists revelled in it. ""Every time anyone replays that video, 11 million ghosts rejoice along with them,"" an anonymous activist who runs an antifa Reddit group told BBC Trending. The 11 million figure, they say, refers to the victims of fascist regimes through the ages. ""We as a society are so unwilling to condone Neo-Nazi philosophies ... that the video has become a part of the popular zeitgeist is a beautiful thing."" Not surprisingly, the fact that an act of violence has been turned into a propaganda coup infuriated many on the alt-right, amongst them Chuck Johnson, an influential figure in the movement. ""We've certainly reached a very tribal point in the culture where people cheer on violence,"" he told Trending. ""Richard is not my favourite person on the right, but you should be able to give an interview on the street without being assaulted. ""I thought that was pretty disturbing to say the least."" Hear this story in fullon the BBC World Service, ordownload our podcast Last week the alt-right got a measure of revenge when Johnson published, on his website, the names, dates of birth and addresses of the 223 people who've been charged in connection with the Washington protests. In internet speak, this is called ""doxxing"" - publishing someone's details without their permission, potentially laying them open to the threat of being harassed by anyone with a personal or ideological grudge against them. It's a tactic used both by the alt-right and antifa. Johnson himself is perhaps most famous forpublishing the home addresses of New York Times reporters,externalandtrying to reveal,externalthe personal information of a woman who was subject of a retracted Rolling Stone article about an alleged campus rape. He runs another site which crowdsources ""bounty"" rewards for actions against liberals. Some of the rewards are offered for revealing personal information. Johnson defended the doxxing of the Washington protesters to BBC Trending. ""I don't have an issue with accused criminals having their addresses published,"" he says. ""I don't think it's a problem."" The antifa activist whom we spoke to was equally unapologetic. ""Antifascists absolutely do engage in doxxing active members of hate groups."" the anonymous activist said. ""To ensure the safety of those who they would victimise from the shadows, we must bring them into the light."" At the same time, they don't like doxxing - when it happens to them. ""Many of those arrested in DC had absolutely no connection to any illegal action,"" the activist claimed. ""Now, they face the threat of harassment by the most hate filled elements of society."" Online, there's a constant cat-and-mouse game. On alt-right and antifa message boards there's waves of trolling, spies, and constant rumours about infiltration. But the fight is also happening on the streets. In addition to the Washington protests, in recent weeks there have been a number of incidents in which both sides say they have been targeted for attack solely on the basis of their political beliefs.

'Explosion' of bric-a-brac saves church,"This video can not be played An eclectic collection of ""exploded"" bric-a-brac suspended from the ceiling of a former church in Norfolk aims to keep the building ""alive"" as part of a conservation project. St John's Church, in Great Yarmouth, has not been used for worship in about a decade. Great Yarmouth Preservation Trust now plans to repair and conserve the Grade II-listed landmark as a cultural heritage hub. Its first exhibition - Suspended between Art, Architecture and Preservation - features a collection of everyday objects suspended on fishing lines to give the impression the entire nave is filled with floating items. Bernard Williamson, chairman of the trust, said: ""The trust is blessed to be the custodian of this charismatic community building. ""We have already undertaken urgent roof repairs... and are now seeking external funding for its light-touch repair and conservation. ""In the meantime, through using it for events, exhibitions and installations, we hope to keep it âaliveâ, allowing people to access it again and engage with it, the artwork and each other."" The eclectic objects were put in place over the course of a week by architecture students from the University of Sofia, in Bulgaria, who were in East Anglia as part of the trustâs partnership work to share knowledge about traditional buildings skills and conservation.

Perfect storm,"Model Jillian Mercado has broken the mould and is signed to a mainstream agency Acting and modelling are notoriously fickle industries often trading on perfection, but in the 1990s one woman challenged the status quo by setting up a professional talent agency for disabled people. It was 1993 when Louise Dyson's agency was approached by Sunrise Medical for disabled models to promote its wheelchairs. She was stumped. At that time the Louise Dyson Agency Ltd dealt only in providing flawless models for clients such as Rolls-Royce and Laura Ashley. ""We didn't know any models with a disability and I immediately thought that was such an obvious thing for advertising - to be representative of the consumer,"" she says. ""But until that point it had never crossed my mind."" The request led to Dyson helping to organise the Sunrise Model in a Million competition - the UK's first professional modelling contest for people with disabilities - which was won by Sharron Murray and Jason Ward who both received modelling contracts. The popularity of the contest piqued Dyson's interest and she put out a call for disabled models and actors interested in representation - she was flooded with more than 600 requests. Louise Dyson has run VisABLE for 23 years Emboldened by the response she took a leap of faith, sold shares in her first agency and established VisABLE - an agency for disabled actors, presenters and models. But the doors were not as open as she had anticipated. ""Although everybody said all the right things I knew they thought I'd gone mad and no one gave us any business in advertising for a long time. ""We really had to make a business case as to why to include disabled people in advertising."" It's a situation she is still perplexed by given that the market surrounding disability - known as the Purple Pound - is worth an estimated Â£249bn in the UK. ""If you use a disabled actor in a campaign it means not only will disabled people support a company, so will friends and relatives."" Crucially, she says, ""It's a way of distinguishing against your competition."" Signed to Dyson's books is Shannon Murray, the original winner of the Sunrise competition. She took the crown aged 17, three years after she was paralysed from the waist down in a diving accident. Shannon Murray has appeared in series such as Co-Owner Of A Lonely Heart Murray had harboured dreams of becoming an actress but gave up on them after her accident ""because there weren't any actors in wheelchairs on TV"". The modelling career thrust upon her gave her a chance to challenge that. ""I loved doing shoots but I wanted to put out a much stronger message, that fashion should be inclusive. ""I was very aware that the teenagers I was meeting in the spinal injuries unit were still young, fashionable, wanting to go to nightclubs and had dilemmas over boys but that wasn't what I saw in the media."" Her moment in the spotlight, which challenged perceptions, was warmly received, but she says, only because the fashion houses had requested a model in a wheelchair. ""If I'd turned up wanting to walk down the runway it would have been a slightly different reaction."" It is this exclusive inclusivity that is the challenge facing the industry in 2017. Shannon Murray continues to work both in the modelling and acting industries The notion that a fashion house or casting agent would request a woman in her 40s to play a mother, regardless of whether she is disabled or not is the ideal they are aiming for. Murray says: ""Lots of people are talking about it and saying they're prepared to do it, but it hasn't happened yet. ""It's the place we want to be in, the same way that black or Asian actors would like colour-blind casting, so we're chosen on our skill."" In New York model Jillian Mercado seems to have cracked the surface. The 29-year-old, who has muscular dystrophy, is signed to the mainstream IMG Models and was used by Beyonce in a recent merchandise campaign which Murray describes as ""brilliant"" and proves ""we're getting there"". Murray, a model-turned-actress, who has appeared in the likes of CLASS and Casualty, says the acting world is a little ahead of the fashion industry. ""Fashion is about trying to sell an aspirational view but in acting there's much less focus on looks, it's what you can do to bring the character off the page, and writers are finally waking up to the fact that there is drama in disabled lives."" Dyson agrees that TV was more open with a greater ""desire to embrace diversity"" and many of her clients have appeared in dramas including Casualty, Silent Witness and Downton Abbey. Jillian Mercado during a fashion shoot ahead of New York Fashion Week But VisABLE's aim remains to seek work for its clients where their disability is ""incidental"". ''The whole point of VisABLE is to persuade advertisers and producers to offer bookings to artists irrespective of the fact that they have characteristics,"" Murray says. ""If someone's advertising a product like shampoo and they happen to have a disability which is not directly relevant it's the perfect form of inclusivity."" Twenty-three years into the business and Dyson says the situation has ""improved massively"" since her first days with the business expanding globally with recent work in Mexico, South Africa and France. ""It began to improve just before the Paralympics,"" she says. ""That gave a boost to everybody regarding preconceptions and disability."" Drama schools and theatre spaces have also been brought up to date and made much more accessible, but Dyson says improvements still need to be made. ""The biggest obstacle in everything we're trying to do is that people still tend to think of a disabled role and who they can put into that role instead of seeing it the other way round. Eddie Redmayne received praise from many for his depiction of Stephen Hawking but should a disabled actor have been given a shot at the role? ""They should see everyone for every role and filter out people because of their unsuitability. If they need a 70-year-old, everyone under 70 is unsuitable. Disability shouldn't be the reason to exclude people, everyone should be considered for each role. ""Then if the person isn't good enough, fair enough."" Broadcasters have set up initiatives over the years aimed at improving the on-screen presence of disabled people. The BBC is hoping to hit a target of quadrupling the number of people on screen by the end of the year and 2016 was the Year of Disability for Channel Four. ""There are some moves in that direction but in practice it hasn't happened much yet,"" Dyson says. ""I try to stun them with the professionalism and capabilities of artists from VisABLE and leave them reviewing their own preconceptions."" The BBC's business and economics unit is looking at how businesses work with people with disabilities and how disabled people have made business work for them A range of stories will feature across online, TV and radio from 20-24 February 2017 On Twitter and Facebook you can follow the hashtag #DisabilityWorks and at the end of the week you can download theOuch podcast Breaking down barriers in business Why are so many disabled roles played by non-disabled actors?

NewsbeatMan grades his ex's apology letter,"An American student who graded his ex-girlfriend's break-up letter says he now regrets that it went viral. Nick Lutz decided to get a red marker out and critique the four-page note before sending it back to his former partner. ""I feel a little but guilty but at the same time, I don't believe the letter at all,"" he told Newsbeat. ""I've been lied to before by her. ""I feel like it was another way to make me feel like I was stupid."" When Newsbeat asked him if he regretted sharing the personal letter on social media, Nick said: ""Yes I do. I would say so."" Nick who studies at the University of Central Florida, says he received the apology shortly after calling time on the relationship and admits it probably wasn't the best decision to tweet it. This is the letter that Nick graded.,external In his critique, he starts off by saying the introduction is too long and that there's lots of repetition. The 20-year-old says his ex needs to show reasoning when saying she ended up failing to keep the relationship working. He also says she needs to back her claims up with proof, like saying she never cheated on him. ""It came to an end after she told me she was going to a theme park with her best friend, who's a girl, but I later found out she went with a dude,"" he said. ""I haven't spoken to her since this happened but I am not planning on talking to her anytime soon. ""We started dating in February of last year and dated for about eight months. ""Four months in she started hiding her phone and I heard she had code names for guys in her contacts list."" The second page calls for his ex-girlfriend to provide more details after this line: ""I took all the promises we had and broke them."" Then there's a spelling mistake with ""loose"" changed to ""lose"". Nick then calls his ex out when she says she has ""no reason to hide, lie or hold anything back"" from him. He writes in the margin: ""If there is no reason to lie, why isn't the truth being told?"" Nick says he decided to annotate the letter as a ""joke"" between him and his friends. But his original tweet where he graded the letter has been shared more than 100,000 times. ""She's not the happiest but I didn't expect it to go viral. She talks to my mum but I haven't spoken to her and I'm not sure I will."" He says he hasn't thought about her when she asks if he has and again accuses her of ""using useless fillers"" to pad out her letter. Nick even says she used ""lackadaisical"" handwriting near the end of her note. The final page contains a question mark after ""I love you"" and also the rest of Nick's final conclusion. ""If you want to be believed, back it up with proof,"" he writes. ""You claimed that cheating never occurred, but place blame on yourself - then what for? ""Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side. While this gesture is appreciated, I would prefer details over statements. ""Revision for half credit will be accepted."" Other people pointed out other mistakes in the letter too. After posting the note on Twitter, Nick was asked out on a date. He said he'd be up for it.,external Nick also told another Twitter user that his ex-girlfriend had seen the changes and was ""okay with her grade"".

Battle for western Mosul will be toughest yet,"The battle for western Mosul is expected to be slow and difficult Iraq's campaign to take back the western section of its second-largest city, Mosul, from so-called Islamic State (IS) will be Baghdad's last major showdown with the group, which, at its height, had controlled a third of the country's territory. This will also be the toughest fight yet, as losing its most cherished prize will present IS with an existential challenge incomparable to any other loss it has suffered over the past two years. Four months ago, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced the official start of comprehensive operations to retake all of Mosul - east and west. The timing of the announcement of the latest phase of the campaign has more to do with rallying the morale of his beleaguered forces than any significant changes in military strategy. The fight for the east proved more difficult and time consuming than the Iraqi government had predicted. The initial hope from the Barack Obama administration had been that Mosul would be liberated before the handover of power in Washington. It is becoming clear that liberating all of Mosul will take several more months. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appeared at the Great Mosque in west Mosul in July 2014 In taking the east of Mosul, the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) suffered considerable losses. According to Pentagon insiders, the casualty rates for certain forces on the front line was as high as 50%. While this figure is denied by Iraqi military personnel in Baghdad, the government is concerned with attrition rates. In battle, a winning side could be expected to suffer a much lower casualty rate. Incurring considerably more losses would heighten the risk of combat ineffectiveness. For Prime Minister Abadi, just as important as weapons and funding is ensuring that his fighters on the frontline maintain battlefield morale and so far they have done so. Time, however, is not on his side, as a prolonged campaign could erode troop resolve. Mosul is the IS heartland. It was here, in the west, that the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his first and only public appearance, at al-Nuri mosque. What has become clear from the battle thus far is that IS fighters will not retreat as easily from Mosul as they did in Falluja and Ramadi. To them, losing the city means losing a  capital. Even before the group declared its caliphate, it was an underground organisation with a strong presence in western Mosul. Residents recall that its fighters began performing public executions in the old market long before June 2014, without any punitive action from the provincial council. Another challenge for the ISF will be the risk of civilian casualties. As many as 800,000 residents could be trapped in the densely populated and narrow streets. They are staying put as the battle rages. Rather than fighting in the outskirt villages, IS is looking to draw the ISF to the urban centres of the west. For the ISF, this means having to go door-to-door to flush out IS fighters, who are hiding among the population. The battle is already being dubbed the ""war of the streets"". IS fighters are also relying on car bombs, which drive towards ISF troops and checkpoints. The jihadists would send up to 10 suicide bombers per day in the east. To divert attention away from looming defeat, the IS leadership is looking to make a show of strength elsewhere. When the ISF began operations in western Mosul, IS fighters launched attacks in the east, which Iraqi forces liberated over a month ago. By doing this, IS looks to discredit ISF victories, and challenge the idea that Iraqi government forces are truly in control there. Beyond Mosul, IS has also increased its attacks in other Iraqi cities. This includes recently liberated cities such as Falluja, but also, the capital, Baghdad. The July 2016 bombing in Karada district, for instance, left more than 300 dead - becoming one of the largest attacks since 2003. Since the beginning of this year, IS has killed almost 100 people in bombings in Baghdad alone. Although challenging, short-term military successes are the easy part. The key to a sustainable victory is the political settlement. Unlike most battles raging in the Middle East, in Mosul everyone bar IS is on the same side, albeit as uneasy bedfellows in some cases. This includes Shia and Sunni Muslims and Kurds, as well as Iranians, Americans and others. The various anti-IS groups in Mosul are uneasy bedfellows Despite that, each party is looking to gain the most out of a victory. This contest for power may squander successes. IS emerged not only because of its military prowess, but also because a considerable portion of Iraq's Sunni Arabs felt disenfranchised by the Shia-led government in Baghdad, as well as their own Sunni leaders. Although many of these original supporters have since grown wary of the harsh IS rule, they will cautiously re-engage with their liberators, in hope of a better settlement. Political infighting is the fuel that IS needs to survive, as military power alone will not do it for them. At the moment, though, there are no clear signs of this settlement, as Prime Minister Abadi will have to juggle powerful competing forces all vying for influence in a post-IS Iraq.

Blurred lines,"London Fashion Week has traditionally only been aimed at women, but seven of the major catwalk shows this season have mixed in menswear. Added to that, we've seen men modelling women's wear, unisex clothing brands and androgynous designs that would work on anyone. It seems like British fashion is going through a gender revolution at the moment. Newsbeat meets the designers leading the way. J. W. Anderson Irish-born designer Jonathan Anderson started his J. W. Anderson brand as menswear in 2008, before launching his first women's collection two years later. He designs with the idea that men can borrow clothes from women and vice versa. ""It's something that we play with each season, this idea,"" he tells Newsbeat backstage at his London Fashion Week show. ""We'll do a mac on a guy and a mac on a woman. They are the same thing, but on a man and a woman they can mean different things."" J. W. Anderson used androgynous looks in both his men's and women's collections Anderson is seen by many in the fashion world as a pioneer for taking this unisex approach years ago. Although he now presents his women's and menswear collections separately, he says he doesn't want to dictate who should wear what. ""I can give you an idea of how I see it on both a man and a woman, but I'm not going to tell you if it's for a man or a woman."" Nicola Formichetti The artistic director of Diesel, and founder of the unisex range Nicopanda, Nicola Formichetti was also Lady Gaga's stylist for three years (yes, he was responsible for the meat dress). ""Fashion has always been about mixing gender, but now it's becoming such an issue,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Now there are products like jeans and hoodies and military jackets that are becoming very very unisex."" He thinks designers have a ""duty"" to create clothes that every gender can feel comfortable in. ""We have a voice and we need to use it."" Julien Macdonald Julien Macdonald's sequin-studded ball gowns are a favourite with some of the world's most glamorous women, including Beyonce and Gigi Hadid. So it surprised some in the fashion world when he launched a menswear collection in 2015. And at this London Fashion Week, male models walked alongside women in tight-fitting sequin jackets and lycra bodysuits - looks that would traditionally be considered very feminine. He says men are becoming more comfortable experimenting with the way they dress. Julien Macdonald escorts Canadian model Winnie Harlow down the catwalk ""We live in a metrosexual community,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""When you see your girlfriend going out in an amazing dress, you think, 'I want to look just as good as you,' so men do want to have fun. Julien Macdonald featured men and women together on his catwalk ""Nobody cares if you look camp or gay - you know what? Now everybody's got a mixed community of friends. It doesn't matter."" Robert Sanders and Oliver Thame Robert and Oliver are both menswear designers who presented their debut collections as part of the Central Saint Martins MA show at London Fashion Week. Robert Sanders, 25, uses layers of recycled fabric to create tunics, skirts and shorts that drape over the models in an androgynous way.

Driverless race car crashes at speed,"The red Devbot 1 completed the race, but the yellow Devbot 2 crashed A landmark race between two driverless electric cars has ended badly for one of the contestants. The unfortunate Devbot vehicle crashed out of the Roborace competition after misjudging a corner while travelling at high speed. The incident occurred ahead of the start of the latest Formula E electric car race in Buenos Aires. The other vehicle managed to complete the course after achieving a top speed of 186km/h (116mph). ""One of the cars was trying to perform a manoeuvre, and it went really full-throttle and took the corner quite sharply and caught the edge of the barrier,"" Roborace's chief marketing officer Justin Cooke told the BBC. ""It's actually fantastic for us because the more we see these moments the more we are able to learn and understand what was the thinking behind the computer and its data. ""The car was damaged, for sure, but it can be repaired. And the beauty is no drivers get harmed because... there is no-one in them."" Photos of theresulting damage have been published,externalby an Argentinian blog. Roborace also plans to upload footage from the event onto its YouTube channel this Friday. The cars communicate with each other to avoid contact The Devbots are controlled by artificial intelligence software - rather than being remote-controlled by humans - and use a laser-based Lidar (light detection and ranging) system and other sensors to guide themselves. They also communicate to avoid collisions with each other. Roborace's organisers had previously showed off one of their Devbots speeding round theUK's Donington Park circuitlast August, but this was the first time they had publicly displayed two vehicles competing against each other. Roborace intends to replace the Devbots with sleeker models when the competition formally launches Even so, they billed the event as a test run ahead of future plans to pit 10 teams of robotic cars against each other, each powered by different AI software. Mr Cooke stressed that crash barriers and a limit on the Devbot's top speed had meant spectators in the Argentine capital had not been put at risk. And he added that another incident involving the winning car illustrated built-in safety measures. ""A dog ran on to the track, and the car was able to slow down, avoid it and take another path,"" he said. The winning Devbot 1 managed to avoid running over a dog Roborace's chief executive Denis Sverdlov will reveal more details about his company's plans, at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona next week. The company then intends to show off its tech again at the next Formula E race, in Mexico City on 1 April. Driverless racing car makes track debut.

Attenborough returns for Blue Planet II,"Bottlenose dolphins were filmed surfing in South Africa for Blue Planet II Sir David Attenborough will present the sequel to 2001's The Blue Planet, the BBC has announced. The seven-part series, to be shown later this year, will aim to highlight recent scientific discoveries. Filming innovations include suction cameras fitted to the backs of orcas. ""I am truly thrilled to be joining this new exploration of the underwater worlds which cover most of our planet, yet are still its least known,"" Sir David said. Sir David said he was ""truly thrilled"" to be involved in the new series The BBC's Natural History Unit spent four years filming off every continent and in every ocean for Blue Planet II, with support from marine scientists. James Honeyborne, the series' executive producer, said: ""The oceans are the most exciting place to be right now, because new scientific discoveries have given us a new perspective of life beneath the waves. ""Blue Planet II is taking its cue from these breakthroughs, unveiling unbelievable new places, extraordinary new behaviours and remarkable new creatures. Showing a contemporary portrait of marine life, it will provide a timely reminder that this is a critical moment for the health of the world's oceans."" Film-makers captured giant cuttlefish in Australia gathering in their thousands for their annual mating aggregation Among the recent discoveries caught on camera are a tuskfish that uses tools and a new species of crab with a hairy chest -nicknamed the ""Hoff crab""after Baywatch star David Hasselhoff. The Natural History Unit's new filming techniques include ""tow cams"" that can capture predatory fish and dolphins head-on, suction cams which attach to the back of whale sharks and orcas for a creature's-eye view, and a probe camera that can record miniature marine life. The BBC said the crew caught unusual examples of marine behaviour on camera, such as a coral grouper and reef octopus with sophisticated hunting techniques, a giant trevally fish that catches birds in flight, and a dive with a sperm whale mother and her calf. A walrus mother and pup appear in the series, resting on an iceberg in the Arctic It said the series would also explore new landscapes from methane volcanoes erupting in the Gulf of Mexico to the Antarctic deep at 1,000m, filmed using manned submersibles. The Blue Planet was watched by more than 12 million people in 2001 and won Baftas and Emmy awards for both cinematography and music. The sequel will be broadcast on BBC One later this year.

The compiler: Computing's hidden hero,"One, zero, zero, one, zero, one. Zero, one, oneâ¦ That is the language of computers. Every clever thing your computer does - make a call, search a database, play a game - comes down to ones and zeroes. Actually, it comes down to the presence (one) or absence (zero) of a current in tiny transistors on a semiconductor chip. Thankfully, we do not have to program computers in zeroes and ones. Microsoft Windows, for example, uses 20GB, or 170 billion ones and zeroes. Printed out, the stack of A4 paper would be two and a half miles (4km) high. Imagine setting every transistor manually. Ignoring how fiddly this would be - transistors measure just billionths of a metre - if it took a second to flip each switch, installing Windows would take 5,000 years. Lt Grace Hopper using a new calculating machine invented by Howard Aiken for the US Navy's use during World War Two 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Early computers really were programmed rather like this. Consider the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, later known asthe Harvard Mark 1,external. It was a 15m-long (50ft), 2.5m-high concatenation of wheels, shafts, gears and switches. It contained 530 miles (850km) of wires. It whirred away under instruction from a roll of perforated paper tape. If you wanted it to solve a new equation, you had to work out which switches should be on or off, which wires should be plugged in where. Then, you had to flip all the switches, plug all the wires, and punch all the holes in the paper tape. Programming it was not just difficult, but involved tedious, repetitive and error-prone manual labour. Four decades on from the Harvard Mark 1, more compact and user-friendly machines such as the Commodore 64 found their way into schools. You may remember the childhood thrill of typing this: 10 print ""Hello world"" 20 go to 10 ""Hello world"" would fill the screen, in chunky, low-resolution text. You had instructed the computer in words that were recognisably, intuitively human. It seemed like a minor miracle. One reason for computers' astonishing progression since the Mark 1 is certainly ever-tinier components. But it is also because programmers can write software in human-like language, and have it translated into the ones and zeroes, the currents or not-currents, that ultimately do the work. The thing that began to make that possible was called a compiler. And behind the compiler was a woman called Grace Hopper. Nowadays, there is much discussion about how to get more women into tech. In 1906, when Grace was born, not many people cared about gender equality. Fortunately for Grace, her father wanted his daughters to get the same education as his son. Sent to a good school, Grace turned out to be brilliant at maths. Her grandfather was a rear admiral, and her childhood dream was to join the US Navy, but girls were not allowed. Then, in 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into World War Two. Male talent was called away. The US Navy started taking women. Grace signed up at once. If you are wondering why the navy needs mathematicians, consider aiming a missile. At what angle and direction should you fire? The answer depends on many things: target distance, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. These are not complex calculations, but they were time-consuming for a human ""computer"" armed only with pen and paper. As Lt (junior grade) Hopper graduated from midshipmen's school in 1944, the navy was intrigued by the potential of an unwieldy machine recently devised by Harvard professor Howard Aiken - the Mark 1. The navy sent Lt Hopper to help Prof Aiken work out what it could do. Grace Hopper with Howard Aitken (middle, bottom row) and the rest of the Harvard Mark 1 computer team in 1944 Prof Aiken was not thrilled to have a female join the team, but Lt Hopper impressed him enough that he asked her to write the operating manual. This involved plenty of trial and error. More often than not, the Mark 1 would grind to a halt soon after starting - and there was no user-friendly error message. Once, it was because a moth had flown into the machine - that gave us the modern term ""debugging"". More often, the bug was metaphorical - a wrongly flipped switch, a mispunched hole in the paper tape. The detective work was laborious and dull. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The simple steel box that transformed global trade How the barcode changed retailing Why the falling cost of light matters Lt Hopper and her colleagues started filling notebooks with bits of tried-and-tested, re-useable code. By 1951, computers had advanced enough to store these chunks - called ""subroutines"" - in their own memory systems. By then, Grace was working for a company called Remington Rand. She tried to persuade her employers to let programmers call up these subroutines in familiar words - to say things such as: ""Subtract income tax from pay."" She later said: ""No-one thought of that earlier, because they weren't as lazy as I was."" In fact, Grace was famed for hard work. Grace Hopper was posthumously granted the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 But what Grace called a ""compiler"" did involve a trade-off. It made programming quicker, but the resulting programmes ran more slowly. That is why Remington Rand were not interested. Every customer had their own, bespoke requirements for their shiny new computing machine. It made sense, the company thought, for its experts to program them as efficiently as they could. Grace was not discouraged: she simply wrote the first compiler in her spare time. And others loved how it helped them to think more clearly. Kurt Beyer's book, Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age, relates many tales of impressed users. One of them was an engineer called Carl Hammer, who used the compiler to attack an equation his colleagues had struggled with for months. Mr Hammer wrote 20 lines of code, and solved it in a day. Like-minded programmers all over the US started sending Grace new chunks of code, and she added them to the library for the next release. In effect, she was single-handedly pioneering open-source software. Grace's compiler evolved into one of the first programming languages, COBOL. More fundamentally, it paved the way for the now-familiar distinction between hardware and software. Dr Telle Whitney co-founded the Grace Hopper Celebration in 1994 to encourage women into computing With one-of-a-kind machines such as the Harvard Mark 1, software was hardware. No pattern of switches would also work on another machine, which would be wired completely differently. But if a computer can run a compiler, it can also run any program that uses it. Further layers of abstraction have since come to separate human programmers from the nitty-gritty of physical chips. And each one has taken a further step in the direction Grace realised made sense: freeing up programmer brainpower to think about concepts and algorithms, not switches and wires. Grace had her own views of why colleagues had been initially resistant: not because they cared about making programs run more quickly, but because they enjoyed the prestige of being the only ones who could communicate with the godlike computer. The ""high priests"", Grace called them. She thought anyone should be able to programme. Now, anyone can. And computers are far more useful because of it.

Bric-a-brac 'explosion' saves church,"This video can not be played An eclectic collection of ""exploded"" bric-a-brac suspended from the ceiling of a former church in Norfolk aims to keep the building ""alive"" as part of a conservation project. St John's Church, in Great Yarmouth, has not been used for worship in about a decade. Great Yarmouth Preservation Trust now plans to repair and conserve the Grade II-listed landmark as a cultural heritage hub. Its first exhibition - Suspended between Art, Architecture and Preservation - features a collection of everyday objects suspended on fishing lines to give the impression the entire nave is filled with floating items. Bernard Williamson, chairman of the trust, said: ""The trust is blessed to be the custodian of this charismatic community building. ""We have already undertaken urgent roof repairs... and are now seeking external funding for its light-touch repair and conservation. ""In the meantime, through using it for events, exhibitions and installations, we hope to keep it âaliveâ, allowing people to access it again and engage with it, the artwork and each other."" The eclectic objects were put in place over the course of a week by architecture students from the University of Sofia, in Bulgaria, who were in East Anglia as part of the trustâs partnership work to share knowledge about traditional buildings skills and conservation.

Wheelchair rugby loses funding appeal,"This video can not be played Nicholl defends funding cuts to seven UK sports Badminton is one of seven sports to have lost appeals against UK Sport funding cuts for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic cycle. The decision comes despite Marcus Ellis and Chris Langridge winning bronze for Great Britain in the men's doubles at the Rio 2016 Olympics. Archery, goalball, fencing, table tennis, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby will also receive no funding. However, powerlifting was successful in its appeal to UK Sport. It means the sport's Â£1.3m funding will be managed by British Weightlifting and not the English Institute of Sport, as was the case before the 2016 Olympics. GB Badminton said it was""staggered"",externalby the decision to reject its appeal. But UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl said none of the seven sports had provided ""critically compelling new evidence"" that changed the assessment of their medal potential. Mike Reilly, CEO of Goalball UK, said his organisation was hopeful UK Sport would find ""other ways to help us secure a clear and sustained talent pathway"" to Tokyo 2020. Wheelchair rugby has been stripped of Â£750,000, and BBC Sport understands the Rugby Football Union (RFU) will not step in to increase support for its disability counterpart. The RFU gives about Â£100,000 per year to the sport known as 'murderball', and England full-backMike Brown headed a recent campaign,externalto help raise funds, but there are now fears its elite team could fold. Great Britain came second in the medal tables at both the 2016 Olympics and 2016 Paralympics Compared with the four-year build-up to the Rio Games, badminton is the biggest loser in cash terms, as it was given Â£5.7m last time. The cut comes despite the sport hitting its medal target thanks to Ellis and Langridge winning only Britain's third Olympic badminton medal. GB Badmintonsaid in a statement: ""Given the strength of evidence we were able to present to justify investment, we cannot believe UK Sport has concluded they should stand by their decision and award zero funding to our GB programme. ""We have players who are on track to win medals for the nation at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and our belief in those players remains as great as it's ever been. We will now take some time to consider our next steps."" Gail Emms, a silver medallist for Great Britain at Athens 2004, said she was ""gutted"". She said: ""It is heart-wrenching. It was bad enough in December when the initial decision was made but now we are super devastated. ""The players out there were really pinning their hopes on this. I was such an optimist; I thought it was going to be OK. We put forward a strong case. It is going to be tough now for the sport."" This video can not be played Emms 'devastated' by badminton funding loss Dan Roan, BBC sports editor: UK Sport's money has transformed Britain into an Olympic and Paralympic superpower, but its 'no-compromise' approach is under more scrutiny than ever. With falling ticket sales hitting crucial National Lottery funding, resources are undoubtedly stretched but, for the first time, sports with real podium potential are being excluded from funding, and many are now asking whether the focus on medals has gone too far. Table tennis was another sport to be disappointed, despite Britain winning a bronze medal at the 2016 World Team Championships. Sara Sutcliffe,Table Tennis Englandchief executive, said: ""We're naturally disappointed, having made what we believe was a very strong case for a relatively small amount of funding. ""We overachieved on everything we were asked to do in the 2016 cycle, and did so without funding. We were left without funding because, effectively, the goalposts were moved. We will take time to absorb this decision before we decide on the best course of action."" Georgina Usher, chief executive ofBritish Fencing,said the organisation would try to hold fundraising events to support its athletes. ""This has been an incredibly difficult period for the athletes and programme staff,"" she said. ""Our staff, coaches and athletes have worked incredibly hard to have got to the point where we are absolutely good enough to target an Olympic medal. Having to explain to them why the programme funding will be coming to an end is extremely tough. ""We will be appealing against this decision as we owe it to our athletes to pursue every avenue open to us to challenge this funding decision process."" Goalballchief executive Reilly was more upbeat, saying: ""Though we did not fit the UK Sport criteria to move up categories, and so secure funding, we were very much encouraged by their response to our representation. ""There is certainly a sense of the board understanding the difficulties we face and an acknowledgement of our incredible success."" Great Britain reached the quarter-finals in the men's team event at the 2016 Rio Olympics, before losing to 2012 gold medallists China, who went on to win gold again Nicholl said: ""The sports that made representations were unable to provide any critically compelling new evidence that changed our assessment of their medal potential for Tokyo. ""Their position in our meritocratic table therefore remains unchanged and they remain in a band we cannot afford to invest in. ""This is the first time we've been unable to support every sport that has athletes with the potential to deliver medals at the next Games. We don't take these decisions lightly as we're acutely aware of the impact they have on sports, athletes and support personnel. ""To support those affected, we have put in place a comprehensive transition and support package and are working closely with these sports to help staff and athletes move out of UK Sport funding."" In December,UK Sport announced the fundingfor the cycles for the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo in 2020. Archery, badminton, fencing, goalball, table tennis, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby appealed to UK Sport to review the decision on what they had been awarded. UK Sport says it must prioritise sports with the strongest medal potential for Tokyo and the appeal process was essentially a second opportunity for officials to demonstrate why they deserve funding. A total of Â£345m will be invested in 31 Olympic and Paralympic sports - Â£2m less than the record Â£347m allocated for the Rio Games. UK Sport has set Team GB a target of winning between 51 and 85 Olympic medals, and 115 to 162 Paralympic medals in 2020. Nick Hope, BBC senior Olympic sports reporter: Understandably, the headlines will be dominated by news of the seven sports - including British Weightlifting's Olympics team - who have not been able to overturn UK Sport's initial funding decisions. However, the victory for British Weightlifting's Paralympic programme should not be overlooked. UK Sport had planned to move control of the funding award for the disability sport set-up to the English Institute of Sport (EIS). This would not only have seen the closure of the entire GB Weightlifting programme (for Olympic and Paralympic athletes), but also potentially set a new precedent for how funding could be allocated in the future. The EIS is essentially an extended arm of UK Sport - looking after anything from nutrition to physiotherapy and athlete lifestyle/welfare. Figures from several other Olympic and Paralympic sports have told me of their concerns about what giving EIS greater power would have meant for future funding decisions beyond Tokyo. As it stands, those concerns will have been allayed somewhat - but it will be interesting to see whether UK Sport will continue to push in this direction and essentially seek greater control and governance of the funding it awards over each four-year-cycle.

Baby Ciao,"Piccolo products are influenced by Catherine Gazzoli's Italian roots Few small entrepreneurs have a contacts book as bulging as Catherine Gazzoli's. But then not everyone has enjoyed an illustrious career involving working as chief executive of Slow Food UK, a not-for-profit body that promotes and supports local food networks across the world, as well as running food and agricultural programmes for the United Nations. So when Ms Gazzoli, 39, spotted an opportunity for a Mediterranean-influenced organic baby food brand, she was able to get some big names from the food industry on board. Her business plan for Piccolo developed on the kitchen table of Green & Blacks co-founder Craig Sams. Shortly before launching the brand last year, she won seed funding from an impressive list of investors including food campaigner Prue Leith, former Pizza Express chief executive Mark Angela and ex-Duchy Originals boss Andrew Baker. Catherine Gazzoli has continued to expand the number of products in the Piccolo range ""It was important for me to have investors who knew the food industry. While I was coming from a non-profit background which involved helping the public eat better, I needed support in creating a company that would be commercial as well as have social values,"" says Ms Gazzoli, who was born in Geneva to Italian parents and grew up in Rome. The investment allowed Ms Gazzoli, who left Slow Food UK in 2014 after a six-year stint, to set up a development kitchen for testing recipes. ""Sometimes investment gets a bad rap but if it's the right investment it can help you,"" she says. ""The directors involved have helped steer the company and have been extremely important in the initial success."" The funds also helped Ms Gazzoli to attract the right talent. Her recruits included Alice Fotheringham as head of nutrition and product development, who had previously worked with the leading baby food author, Annabel Karmel. And Kane O'Flaherty - a former Itsu and Metcalfe's Food Company's design expert - joined as head of creative. Catherine Gazzoli (centre) with Kane O'Flaherty and Alice Fotheringham Ms Gazzoli reveals how she managed to poach Mr O'Flaherty: ""I kept making him his favourite dish - a Maltese rabbit stew - which takes 24 hours to make."" Whether it was the cooking or her tenacity, Mr O'Flaherty eventually left MetCalfe's to join Piccolo. Ms Gazzoli's aim was to create nutritious, organic baby food packed with flavour. For this, she turned to her Italian roots. ""My family had a grocery store in the north of Italy and I grew up with a room just for making pasta, where ravioli and fresh pesto was made every day,"" she says. ""I wanted to include lots of grains, pulses and herbs to create variety and a healthy balance."" Piccolo started with six products, such as fruit and yogurt blends, and now has 16 offerings including vegetable risotto and sweet tomato and ricotta spaghetti that cost between Â£1 and Â£1.60 a pouch. The range - most of which are made in the Mediterranean - will rise to 30 products by the summer. Piccolo is expanding its range Since launching in April 2016, the brand has found favour from both retailers and consumers. Piccolo products are available from 750 stores in the UK including Asda, Planet Organic, Whole Foods Market and Abel & Cole, and has just started selling in stores in China too. Turnover for its first year is expected to reach Â£2m, but the Covent Garden-based company is yet to turn a profit. Although the path from idea to production may appear smooth, Ms Gazzoli says the reality was more challenging as she hadn't done any negotiations with supermarkets before. The slide in the value of the pound following the Brexit vote has also created problems. ""We source from all over the Mediterranean, for example, apples from the Dolomites, and there's price fluctuations... prices are all over and it's a difficult time for grocers too. It's a very special time to be learning."" A recent vegetable shortage has been another spanner in the works. ""I've had these sourcing issues and trouble getting products on time. I can't change courgettes to peas [in her products], so it's a very complicated scenario."" Catherine Gazzoli's daughter Juliet is often in the Piccolo office Like many business owners, Ms Gazzoli has to balance managing a fast-growing firm with childcare, raising her three-year-old daughter Juliet. ""During the week there's no separation between my child and the business,"" she says. ""Juliet is often in the office, and if I'm stuck in a meeting the staff help me with the nursery run. They're both my babies and are both interweaved. Juliet loves Kane and Alice, she's grown up with them. I don't think you can separate when you're a start-up."" Her ""very supportive"" Italian husband and his parents help out with childminding duties as well. Piccolo products have arrived on shelves as sales in the baby food sector are now worth about Â£700m, according to market research firm Mintel. Daniel Selwood, food and drink editor at trade magazine The Grocer, says that while Ella's Kitchen - the top baby food brand - dominates the market, Piccolo still stands out. ""The focus on Mediterranean variants makes it a bit different to existing players. It offers a good rate of new variants, and also Catherine has got some pulse in the industry from being chief executive of Slow Food UK,"" he says.
