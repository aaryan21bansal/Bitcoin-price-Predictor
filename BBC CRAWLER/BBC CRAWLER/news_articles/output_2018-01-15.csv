UKIP leader splits with partner after texts,"This video can not be played Leader of UKIP tells Today Jo Marney views not in line with her 'core beliefs' UKIP leader Henry Bolton says he has ended his relationship with his girlfriend after she reportedly made racist comments about Meghan Markle. He said their romance was ""obviously quite incompatible"" with his leader role but he had no intention to quit. Jo Marney had sent texts saying black people were ugly and Prince Harry's fiancee would ""taint"" the Royal Family. UKIP's chairman said it ""remains to be seen"" whether Mr Bolton would stay as party leader. UKIP leader 'won't go' over partner's texts Who is new UKIP leader Henry Bolton? Ms Marney has apologised for her remarks, which were reported in theMail on Sunday,external, and claimed they were taken out of context. Mr Bolton, a former army officer, took over as UKIP leader in September,  becoming the party's fourth leader in 18 months. He said it was against UKIP's constitution ""to be racist in any way"". But senior party members have questioned his judgement, calling his private life an ""unhelpful distraction"". MEP Bill Etheridge, who stood in the last leadership election, has called on Mr Bolton to quit, saying he had ""handled the situation appallingly badly"". ""Now he thinks by throwing a relationship with this young lady under the bus, he can save his skin,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show. ""Frankly it is another example of this man not knowing what he is doing."" Henry Bolton faced a stark choice. Either give up his girlfriend or give up his leadership. After a weekend  considering his options, he chose the former - saying ""the romantic element of our relationship should end"". Whether that will be sufficient to safeguard Mr Bolton's position as leader is less clear. Some senior figures in the party believe since he became leader just three months ago Mr Bolton has failed to make a mark or get a grip of the party's problems. Quite apart from Mr Bolton's position - he is UKIP's fourth leader since the referendum - the party is facing mounting financial pressure and a loss of members. Above all it is struggling to find a role for itself since the Brexit referendum. Mr Bolton told BBC Breakfast Ms Marney's ""utterly indefensible"" comments were made ""some time ago"". While there was ""some context to them"" which will be revealed in time, he added that no context ""defends or justifies"" some of the comments, adding he was ""appalled and shocked"" when he first heard them. Asked about the state of his marriage on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said he and his wife had lived ""under the same roof"" for about five of the 12 years they had been together and had been living apart since July when they reached a mutual decision that she and their children should move to Austria where she is working. ""We are still married, we are not legally separated at all... I have tremendous respect for my wife. She is an outstanding mother to our children but we have had difficulties."" Asked when he told his wife about the relationship with Ms Marney, he replied: ""My wife did not know about it at the time it started. She knew three days into it. Jo Marney and I went out first on Boxing Day. I told my wife exactly what was going on the 30th."" Mr Bolton, 54, said the 25-year-old model had had her party membership suspended immediately after the party found out about the comments and he would support the outcome of an internal investigation. The messages were sent three weeks before the couple began their relationship, according to the Mail on Sunday. They confirmed their relationship in a letter to UKIP supporters earlier this month.

Responding to criticism, Mr Bolton said certain individuals ""should start working towards the betterment of the party itself, working as part of a team rather than coming up with divisive and self interested comments"". UKIP chairman Paul Oakden told BBC News lots of party members wanted their say on what had happened, and there would be a ""process"" for this over the next week. ""Whether or not at the end of that, Henry will still be in a position that he wants to carry this forward with the support of the party remains to be seen."" Former deputy leader Peter Whittle said Mr Bolton faced a ""crunch"" meeting of the party's NEC next weekend at which he would have to show he had the trust of party officials. ""It is a very big task,"" he told Victoria Derbyshire. However, he said a fresh leadership contest would be ""a hell of a distraction"" at a time when the focus should be on May's local elections and seeing Brexit through.

Westminster attacker 'took steroids',"The man who killed five people in the Westminster Bridge attack last year took steroids in the days and hours before the attack, a court has heard. Khalid Masood was shot in the Palace of Westminster grounds after driving into four people on Westminster Bridge, and fatally stabbing a police officer. A pre-inquest hearing ruled that Masood's inquest would be held separately to the attack victims. The inquests will be held at the Old Bailey on 10 September. Speaking at the hearing, Judge Mark Lucraft QC said ""the lives of many were torn apart by less than two minutes of high drama"" on 22 March 2017. During the hearing, it emerged that a toxicology report from a urine sample suggested Masood had taken anabolic steroids before the attack. Mother-of-two Aysha Frade, US tourist Kurt Cochran, and retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes died after Masood drove his rental car into people on Westminster Bridge. Romanian tourist Andreea Cristea was knocked into the River Thames from the bridge. She died just over two weeks later. (From left) PC Keith Palmer, Kurt Cochran and Aysha Frade all died in the attack Retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes was one of three people to have died after being hit on Westminster Bridge Moments after the bridge attack, PC Keith Palmer, 48, was stabbed to death outside the Houses of Parliament. At the hearing, it was heard the two firearms officers who confronted Masood will not be identified at the inquests. Gareth Patterson QC, who is acting on behalf of four of the families of those who died, asked the coroner to examine how Masood was radicalised, looking specifically at his time in prison. The counsel said the families ""did not understand"" the need for end-to-end encryption on online messenger services such as Whatsapp, used by Masood to access jihadi material. Andreea Cristea, who died as a result of the attack more than two weeks later, was on holiday with Andrei Burnaz, who survived Mr Patterson added: ""Terrorist trial after terrorist trial shows the same problems featuring in the evidence. ""Why is it that radical material continues to be freely available on the internet, we do not understand."" The inquest will also look at the body armour worn by PC Palmer when he was stabbed by Masood. Family members who live abroad will be able to watch the proceedings, expected to last four weeks, via video link at British embassies.

Carillion collapse raises job fears,"Construction giant Carillion has gone into liquidation, threatening thousands of jobs. The move came after talks between the firm, its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal to save the UK's second biggest construction company. Carillion ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up huge debts of around Â£1.5bn. Its failure means the government will have to provide funding to maintain the public services run by Carillion. This video can not be played David Lidington says wages will be paid to staff working on public sector contracts ""All employees should keep coming to work, you will continue to get paid. Staff that are engaged on public sector contracts still have important work to do,"" said government minister David Lidington. Carillion is involved in major projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. It is the second biggest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs there would be a meeting of the government's Cobra emergency committee on Monday to discuss the situation. Live: Reaction to Carillion's collapse 'They've literally locked the gate' Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Soldiers to schools - Carillion's place in public life Carillion collapse: What next? Carillion chairman Philip Green said it was a ""very sad day"" for the company's workers, suppliers and customers. The company has 43,000 staff worldwide - 20,000 in the UK. This video can not be played Labour asks why the government did not act when profit warnings were issued There are also thousands of small firms that carry out work on Carillion's behalf -  many of those have contacted the BBC with concerns about whether they will be paid. One company, which provided services for Carillion's prisons contract, told the BBC that it might fail if it is not paid the Â£80,000 owed to it. A worker on the Midland Metropolitan Hospital, who wanted to only be identified as Philip,told the BBC: ""Everyone on the site got told: 'That's it, go home.' My company said, 'You've been laid off.' ""They've literally locked the gate. They've told us we can get our personal tools off the site if they're small, but that's it."" Damned if they did, damned if they didn't? The government refused to insure Carillion's debts, so the banks pulled the plug. If it had offered guarantees to big banks on behalf of a private company it might have been accused of nationalising losses while privatising profits. The whole point of having private companies do public work is that they shoulder some of the risk. The truth is the government has been helping out Carillion for a while. Awarding it contracts when it knew it was in trouble raised eyebrows last year. The government constructed the HS2 contracts so that Carillion's joint venture partners would take on the work if the company went bust - meanwhile it hoped the new contracts would be enough to make Carillion's lenders feel reassured. Industry sources tell me that if the company hadn't been awarded new government work it would have been curtains for Carillion months ago. What happens next depends on the actions of a court-appointed official receiver. With the help of a team of experts from accountants PwC, the receiver will review Carillion's business - a process which could take months. The government has already said it is supporting public services and other firms are likely to take on some of Carillion's other contracts and staff. Thousands of current and former staff have money in Carillion pension funds, which have a total deficit of almost Â£600m. Those funds will now be managed by the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). The PPF said it was aware news of the liquidation would ""raise serious concerns for all people involved"". ""We want to reassure members of Carillion's defined benefit pension schemes that their benefits are protected by the PPF."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said Labour wanted a full investigation into the government's dealings with Carillion: ""This company issued three profit warnings in the last six months, yet despite those profit warnings the government continued to grant contracts to this company."" Carillion might not be a household name, but over the years it has absorbed better-known businesses, including Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. It also has a big international business, including projects in Qatar and Canada. In addition it is a big supplier of construction services to the Canadian government. Its biggest problems were cost overruns on three UK public sector construction projects: The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell: opening delayed to 2019 due to construction problems The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital: completion date repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building The Â£745m Aberdeen bypass: delayed because of slow progress in completing initial earthworks Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration Committee, said Carillion's collapse ""really shakes public confidence in the ability of the private sector to deliver public services and infrastructure"". He said there needed to be a change of ""mindset"" at companies that do a lot of work for the taxpayer. ""You've got to treat yourself much more as a branch of the public service, not as a private company just there to enrich the shareholders and the directors,"" he said. ""Ironically, Whitehall tends to do contracts with companies that it always does contracts with, because that's the safe thing to do - that's the perception.  A great many small and medium-sized companies feel excluded."" Carillion is part of a consortium working on the HS2 rail line Mick Cash, the general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said: ""This is disastrous news for the workforce and disastrous news for transport and public services in Britain. Rehana Azam, national officer of the GMB union, said: ""What's happening with Carillion yet again shows the perils of allowing privatisation to run rampant in our schools, our hospitals and our prisons.""

Crisis meeting after Carillion collapse,"Cabinet ministers have concluded a crisis meeting about keeping vital public services going after the collapse of contractor Carillion. The construction giant, which provides services for schools, prisons and hospitals, has gone into liquidation. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said the two-hour Cobra committee talks enabled ministers to air any concerns. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attacked government policies and called Carillion a ""watershed moment"". In a video released on social media, he said: ""In the wake of the collapse of the contractor Carillion, it is time to put an end to the rip-off privatisation policies that have done serious damage to our public services and fleeced the public of billions of pounds."" Carillion ran into trouble after losing money on big public sector contracts and running up huge debts of around Â£1.5bn. The government is stepping in to pay employees and small businesses working on Carillion's public contracts and assess the distribution of contracts among other companies. After the Cobra meeting, Mr Lidington said that day one had gone ""pretty well"" as ""people were turning up to work [and] we have not had any reports of serious interruption to service delivery."" He said that accountancy firm PWC, which will help sell off Carillion's assets, took ministers through the advice it is giving to employees and contractors at the meeting. It was also an ""opportunity for ministers to test what sort of concerns are being expressed and decide how we should best address them and provide the reassurance that people want"", Mr Lidington added. This video can not be played David Lidington says wages will be paid to staff working on public sector contracts ""The action we have taken is designed to keep vital public services running rather than to provide a bailout on the failure of a commercial company,"" Mr Lidington told parliament. Carillion, the UK's second biggest construction firm, was also involved in major projects such as the HS2 high-speed rail line. The firm has 450 government contracts, including maintenance for prisons and hospitals, as well as dinners and cleaning for hundreds of schools. It is also the second biggest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence. 'They've literally locked the gate' Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Soldiers to schools - Carillion in UK public life Carillion collapse: What next? The government has disclosed that it awarded eight contracts to the company after it issued profit warnings - six of which were joint ventures with other firms. In his video message, Mr Corbyn linked the crisis to the outsourcing of public services to private companies. ""Across the public sector, the outsource-first dogma has wreaked havoc,"" the Labour leader said. ""Often it is the same companies that have gone from service to service, creaming off profits and failing to deliver the quality of service our people deserve."" Carillion has 43,000 staff worldwide, including 20,000 in the UK. There are also thousands of small firms that carry out work on Carillion's behalf -  many of those have contacted the BBC with concerns about whether they will be paid.

Soldiers to schools - Carillion in the UK,"Carillion is usually described as a construction company, its name often seen emblazoned across major projects. One of its contracts was with HS2, but it also supplied children in Oxfordshire with school dinners, maintained prison grounds in Cambridgeshire and set up a solar farm in West Sussex. Describing itself as an ""integrated support services business"", it held about 450 governmental contracts, spanning the Departments of Education, Justice, Defence and Transport. In the UK its projects included the Royal Opera House, the Library of Birmingham, the Tate Modern, and the hoop-shaped building of GCHQ.  It also manages the Smart Motorways traffic control system. So just how far did its interests spread? How big a part did it play in UK public life? The running of the libraries in Croydon, Ealing, Harrow and Hounslow was outsourced in 2012 - first to a company called John Laing Integrated Services, which swiftly sold it on to Carillion. Under the brand ""Cultural Community Solutions"", Carillion bosses said: ""We want to transform and re-energise the concept of the library. ""Our mission is to rethink and reinvent local public libraries to make them relevant and self-sustaining."" But Hounslow terminated its contract last summer, and Croydon announced on Monday that it would be taking its library services back in-house. Carillion is the parent company of CarillionAmey, which maintains about 50,000 homes across the United Kingdom for the Ministry of Defence, operating between Â£700m and Â£1bn worth of contracts. Following the announcement of the liquidation, CarillionAmey said: ""There is a considerable amount of press coverage regarding Carillion's current financial position, however, the impact on CarillionAmey's operations remains limited and we will continue to deliver services as normal."" A spokesman for the MoD said the announcement would have no direct impact on defence or the services provided to the Armed Forces and their families. ""Housing will continue to be serviced, catering facilities provided and buildings and offices cleaned,"" he added. In 2016, a report by the public accounts committee described CarillionAmey's performance for the MoD as ""totally unacceptable"", leaving families in ""dirty houses with broken appliances... without hot water or heating"". GCHQ's headquarters was one of the projects Carillion was involved in Dieter Helm, Professor of Economic Policy at Oxford University, said: ""You've got the Ministry of Defence, you've got the Department of Education, you've got the Department of Health, you've got the Department of Transport - all these different departments are striking contracts with this company. ""Who takes a look at the totality of this, at whether it really adds up and whether the company is competent as a whole to deliver all of these public services which have been put into this one single basket?"" While ministers have promised that all public services will be protected following the demise of Carillion, Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the government had ""serious questions to answer about its role in allowing taxpayers' exposure to escalate to this point"". The committee is responsible for overseeing government expenditure, and to make sure it is effective and honest. Ms Hillier said: ""Carillion's collapse raises grave concerns about jobs, the delivery of public services and the way government conducts its business. The Public Accounts Committee has previously warned of the risks when contractors, paid from the public purse, become too big to fail."" Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion collapse: What next? A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said those councils affected by the collapse of Carillion had been ""monitoring the situation closely and are implementing contingency plans to keep services running as normally as possible"". ""Councils are also working with other public sector partners in their local area to be ready for any wider knock-on effects of Carillion's failure."" Professor Simon Collinson, an expert in regional business at the University of Birmingham, says small firms will be the most affected. ""As suppliers, they rely on big construction firms like Carillion for much of their income. They'll be last in the queue for payment from any of the value salvaged from the mess, leading some to collapse and many to sack their own employees. ""Rather than just look to government we should be taking a hard look at the corporate governance structures in place at the firm; these should have changed the strategy and structure well before we got to this disappointing and damaging end point."" Carillion had the maintenance contract for Wormwood Scrubs Carillion maintained approximately half of the UK's prisons and Young Offender Institutions, including Wormwood Scrubs, Pentonville and Feltham. Its responsibilities included cleaning, landscaping and catering. The company was widely criticised byIndependent Monitoring Boards,externalacross the country, which described Pentonville as ""unsafe and inhumane"", Winchester as ""unable to function properly"" and Wandsworth as ""struggling to maintain basic standards"". Since the company's collapse, the Prison Officers Association (POA) said that the contracting out of services and maintenance in prisons was ""a recipe for disaster"", but their concerns were ignored. General Secretary of the POA Steve Gillan said: ""We need to know the contingency plans to keep our prisons operational. During the time Carillion had this contract the level of essential maintenance and work that is outstanding has spiralled out of control... due diligence was not undertaken. ""Today we face another real crisis due to poor management and privatisation"". The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital is at least a year behind schedule Carillion is behind two new hospitals - the Royal Liverpool and Midland Metropolitan. The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital is at least a year behind schedule. It was due to be completed in March 2017, but the completion date has been repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building. The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell was originally scheduled to open in October 2018, but difficulties with the heating, lighting and ventilation systems forced a delay of the launch date to spring 2019. The company also ran all the catering, cleaning, laundry and car parking at the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough. Oxfordshire County Council has promised school pupils will continue to receive school dinners The company was responsible for delivering school dinners to 30,000 pupils a day in 218 schools. Firefighters have been put on standby to deliver school meals in Oxfordshireafter the county council said it would take over services provided by Carillion. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure schools can continue to operate as usual. ""We have planned extensively for this and have been working with local authorities and academy trusts since before Christmas to make sure contingency plans are in place. We are continuing to offer support to schools help minimise disruption for pupils through our designated advice service."" Carillion: What is it and what's happening?

The firm isinvolved in major public projectssuch as the HS2 high-speed rail line and manages public service contracts including schools and prisons.

Carillion: The company entrenched in public life,"Carillion is usually described as a construction company, its name often seen emblazoned across major projects. One of its contracts was with HS2, but it also supplied children in Oxfordshire with school dinners, maintained prison grounds in Cambridgeshire and set up a solar farm in West Sussex. Describing itself as an ""integrated support services business"", it held about 450 governmental contracts, spanning the Departments of Education, Justice, Defence and Transport. In the UK its projects included the Royal Opera House, the Library of Birmingham, the Tate Modern, and the hoop-shaped building of GCHQ.  It also manages the Smart Motorways traffic control system. So just how far did its interests spread? How big a part did it play in UK public life? The running of the libraries in Croydon, Ealing, Harrow and Hounslow was outsourced in 2012 - first to a company called John Laing Integrated Services, which swiftly sold it on to Carillion. Under the brand ""Cultural Community Solutions"", Carillion bosses said: ""We want to transform and re-energise the concept of the library. ""Our mission is to rethink and reinvent local public libraries to make them relevant and self-sustaining."" But Hounslow terminated its contract last summer, and Croydon announced on Monday that it would be taking its library services back in-house. Carillion is the parent company of CarillionAmey, which maintains about 50,000 homes across the United Kingdom for the Ministry of Defence, operating between Â£700m and Â£1bn worth of contracts. Following the announcement of the liquidation, CarillionAmey said: ""There is a considerable amount of press coverage regarding Carillion's current financial position, however, the impact on CarillionAmey's operations remains limited and we will continue to deliver services as normal."" A spokesman for the MoD said the announcement would have no direct impact on defence or the services provided to the Armed Forces and their families. ""Housing will continue to be serviced, catering facilities provided and buildings and offices cleaned,"" he added. In 2016, a report by the public accounts committee described CarillionAmey's performance for the MoD as ""totally unacceptable"", leaving families in ""dirty houses with broken appliances... without hot water or heating"". GCHQ's headquarters was one of the projects Carillion was involved in Dieter Helm, Professor of Economic Policy at Oxford University, said: ""You've got the Ministry of Defence, you've got the Department of Education, you've got the Department of Health, you've got the Department of Transport - all these different departments are striking contracts with this company. ""Who takes a look at the totality of this, at whether it really adds up and whether the company is competent as a whole to deliver all of these public services which have been put into this one single basket?"" While ministers have promised that all public services will be protected following the demise of Carillion, Meg Hillier, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said the government had ""serious questions to answer about its role in allowing taxpayers' exposure to escalate to this point"". The committee is responsible for overseeing government expenditure, and to make sure it is effective and honest. Ms Hillier said: ""Carillion's collapse raises grave concerns about jobs, the delivery of public services and the way government conducts its business. The Public Accounts Committee has previously warned of the risks when contractors, paid from the public purse, become too big to fail."" Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion collapse: What next? A spokesperson for the Local Government Association said those councils affected by the collapse of Carillion had been ""monitoring the situation closely and are implementing contingency plans to keep services running as normally as possible"". ""Councils are also working with other public sector partners in their local area to be ready for any wider knock-on effects of Carillion's failure."" Professor Simon Collinson, an expert in regional business at the University of Birmingham, says small firms will be the most affected. ""As suppliers, they rely on big construction firms like Carillion for much of their income. They'll be last in the queue for payment from any of the value salvaged from the mess, leading some to collapse and many to sack their own employees. ""Rather than just look to government we should be taking a hard look at the corporate governance structures in place at the firm; these should have changed the strategy and structure well before we got to this disappointing and damaging end point."" Carillion had the maintenance contract for Wormwood Scrubs Carillion maintained approximately half of the UK's prisons and Young Offender Institutions, including Wormwood Scrubs, Pentonville and Feltham. Its responsibilities included cleaning, landscaping and catering. The company was widely criticised byIndependent Monitoring Boards,externalacross the country, which described Pentonville as ""unsafe and inhumane"", Winchester as ""unable to function properly"" and Wandsworth as ""struggling to maintain basic standards"". Since the company's collapse, the Prison Officers Association (POA) said that the contracting out of services and maintenance in prisons was ""a recipe for disaster"", but their concerns were ignored. General Secretary of the POA Steve Gillan said: ""We need to know the contingency plans to keep our prisons operational. During the time Carillion had this contract the level of essential maintenance and work that is outstanding has spiralled out of control... due diligence was not undertaken. ""Today we face another real crisis due to poor management and privatisation"". The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital is at least a year behind schedule Carillion is behind two new hospitals - the Royal Liverpool and Midland Metropolitan. The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital is at least a year behind schedule. It was due to be completed in March 2017, but the completion date has been repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building. The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell was originally scheduled to open in October 2018, but difficulties with the heating, lighting and ventilation systems forced a delay of the launch date to spring 2019. The company also ran all the catering, cleaning, laundry and car parking at the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough. Oxfordshire County Council has promised school pupils will continue to receive school dinners The company was responsible for delivering school dinners to 30,000 pupils a day in 218 schools. Firefighters have been put on standby to deliver school meals in Oxfordshireafter the county council said it would take over services provided by Carillion. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure schools can continue to operate as usual. ""We have planned extensively for this and have been working with local authorities and academy trusts since before Christmas to make sure contingency plans are in place. We are continuing to offer support to schools help minimise disruption for pupils through our designated advice service."" Carillion: What is it and what's happening?

Steven Seagal denies Bond girl assault,"This video can not be played Rachel Grant gives the BBC her account of a meeting she says took place in 2002 Actor and producer Steven Seagal has denied an allegation of sexual assault at a film rehearsal in Sofia 2002, made against him by Bond girl Rachel Grant. Mr Seagal's lawyers also deny another allegation by the actress that he attempted to indecently expose himself. The British actress later lost her job on the film, Out For A Kill. Ms Grant, speaking exclusively to the BBC, said: ""I want to share what happened to me, so people will hear it and others might come forward."" These claims followother allegations made against the Hollywood actor,some of which he has denied. Lawyers for Mr Seagal say that he unequivocally denies Ms Grant's allegations in their entirety: ""Our client denies having such contact with Ms Grant and further vehemently denies any alleged assault at all, in particular, the alleged assault occurring in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2002."" At the weekend, CBS Newsreported that the Los Angeles Police Department was investigating a separate sexual assault claim,externalagainst the actor. The 65-year-old, who was given Russian citizenship by President Vladimir Putin in 2016, is best known for his action roles in the 1980s and 1990s, including the Under Siege films. Actor Steven Seagal at the 2014 Chinese American Film Festival in California Ms Grant, who played the character Peaceful in James Bond film Die Another Day in 2002, says she was emboldened by women sharing their stories of sexual harassment as part of the #MeToo campaign. The British actress, who was 26 at the time, claims she was flown to Sofia to rehearse lines in September 2002 after auditioning for a role in Out For A Kill. She says she was excited to meet Mr Seagal, who had been a childhood hero. She claims she met the actor in a hotel suite with the film's director, but when left alone in the room with Mr Seagal, she alleges he asked her to take her top off several times, which she refused. ""I stood up to try to distract him. But he was able to tug down my top, which was strapless. My breasts were completely exposed and I was forced to cover myself,"" she claims. ""He pushed me on to the bed with force. Then he said, 'I suppose you want to see my private parts' - though he used a different word. ""I was looking up and he started to pull down his zip,"" she alleges. Ms Grant then ""burst into tears"", at which point Mr Seagal stopped and began to apologise, she says. She says Mr Seagal told her that he liked to date actresses he worked with to improve the ""on-screen chemistry"". ""It was horrible - I was upset, embarrassed and hurt. ""What actress should be brought to someone's bedroom on the first meeting and then be told to take their top off?"" Rachel Grant, 41, now works as an actress, producer and TV presenter Ms Grant says she has been the victim of sexual harassment on other occasions but that she has refused to let the incidents affect her career. ""I lost a job and I cried a lot but I'm a positive person - I tried to take it with a pinch of salt,"" she explains, acknowledging that not all victims of sexual assault are able to recover. She wants to end the culture of questioning why many victims of sexual harassment only share their experiences years after the event. ""When it happens to you, you're ashamed, you're embarrassed, nobody needs to know, nobody. You hope it gets covered in dust and no one will ever know. ""I want people to know that it actually makes more sense for people to talk about it a long time after it happens - you get over it and then you can talk about it."" She says she hopes campaigns like Time's Up and #MeToo will help bring an end to sexual harassment in the industry.

The parish priest from her home town Friarstown, in Limerick, said her funeral would take place in Ireland. ""Her family are still waiting for more details to come from London about her death,"" said Ballybricken and Bohermore parish priest Fr James Walton. ""The plan is for her to be buried here at home. When that will be will depend on when her body is released."" The Cranberries shot to international fame with their 1993 debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? and went on to sell over 40 million records worldwide. In 2017 The Cranberries announced a tour including dates in Europe, the UK, and the US. However, in May - shortly into the European tour - the group had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as a result of O'Riordan's health issues. The official Cranberries website cited ""medical reasons associated with a back problem"" preventing singer Dolores O'Riordan from performing. But just before Christmas O'Riordan had posted on Facebook saying she was ""feeling good"" and had done her ""first bit of gigging in months"", leading fans to believe she would soon be performing again.

O'Riordan split from her husband of 20 years, Don Burton in 2014. She and Burton, who is the former tour manager of Duran Duran, have three children together. The singer wasarrested over an alleged air rage incident in 2014but was released without charge, after a stewardess was reportedly attacked on a flight from New York to Shannon, County Clare. O'Riordan was taken to hospital in Limerick after being questioned by police and later discharged. Two years later, O'Riordan was ordered to pay 6,000 euros (Â£5,300) to charity for headbutting a police officer after an alleged air rage incident. She was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2015, which she said explained why she was in a ""manic"" state on the plane. In an interview in 2013 she said that she had been abused as a child, which led to her developing an eating disorder, and eventually she suffered a breakdown. She described her family, especially her children, as her ""salvation"". Irish president Michael D Higgins called her death ""a big loss"", and added O'Riordan's work with The Cranberries ""had an immense influence on rock and pop music in Ireland and internationally"".

The Kinks guitarist and singer Dave Davies paid tribute to O'Riordan, saying he was ""shocked"" and that he had seen her ""a couple weeks before Christmas"". He added ""she seemed happy and well"".

"1,000 young people charged over sex video","A police superintendent said the charges come as a warning to young people never to share sex videos. More than 1,000 young people have been charged by police in Denmark with distributing sexually explicit material. They are accused of using Facebook Messenger to share indecent video clips of two 15-year-olds having sex. Police said it could amount to distribution of indecent images of children, as the two people filmed are under 18. Facebook tipped off the US authorities, who notified police in Denmark. One thousand and four young people from across the country are facing charges after allegedly circulating the material via the messaging app in autumn last year. Some suspects are over 18 and were called to police stations to be interviewed. Suspects under 18 were contacted through their parents. A Danish police superintendent said the charges come as a warning to young people never to share sex videos. Anyone found guilty of these charges faces a possible conditional prison sentence of about 20 days. If found guilty of distributing indecent images of children, they would be listed for ten years on a register of child pornography offenders.

Smaller bottles of Coca-Cola to cost more,"Coca-Cola has confirmed the price of its larger bottles, including 500ml, will rise in March Coca-Cola has announced it will cut the size of a 1.75l bottle to 1.5l and put up the price by 20p in March, because of the introduction of a sugar tax on soft drinks from April this year. However, the company said it has no plans to change its classic recipe. ""People love the taste... and have told us not to change,"" a spokesman said. Coca-Cola Classic contains 10.6g of sugar per 100ml. Under the terms of the government's new tax, it will be subject to a tax of 24p per litre. ""We have no plans to change the recipe of Coca-Cola Classic so it will be impacted by the government's soft drinks tax,"" said a spokesman for Coca-Cola European Partners. ""Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke, our no-sugar colas, are not impacted."" The sugar tax was announced in March 2016, by the then Chancellor George Osborne, in an attempt to tackle rising obesity among children in the UK. From April, soft drinks manufacturers will be taxed at 18p per litre on drinks containing 5g of sugar or more per 100ml, or 24p per litre if the drink has more than 8g of sugar per 100ml. It is estimated, the tax will raise Â£520m a year - to be spent on funding sport in primary schools. The tax will apply to one in five soft drinks sold in the UK. How Coca-Cola became a million dollar idea Sugar tax: How will it work? What is the UK's most sugary drink? More children having teeth out in hospital Manufacturers and supermarkets have responded by tweaking recipes - typically upping the volume of artificial sweeteners - to avoid the levy. The amount of sugar used in Sprite, Fanta, and Dr Pepper - all owned by Coca-Cola - has been reduced - with the new version of Fanta, introduced last year, containing 33% less sugar. Similarly AG Barr, the makers of Irn Bru, took the decisionto dramatically alter the recipe of the famous Scottish drinkas a result of the sugar tax. But the new low sugar version, which sees much of the sugar content replaced by artificial sweeteners, has divided opinion among fans of the drink and even seen a petition launched to save the traditional recipe. However, the makers of Coca-Cola remain adamant they will stick with the original recipe - perhaps fearing the public backlash they faced in 1985 when they were forced to abandon the 'new Coke' recipe after 79 days and return to the original version. Coca-Cola said it was in discussion with retailers ahead of the sugar tax: ""These discussions include reviewing the pack sizes offered to consumers and our approach to price-marked packs,"" a spokesman said. The nature of the tax suggests a 330ml can of Classic Coke may now be more expensive than a can of Diet Coke - which is not subject to the tax. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, a Cola-Cola spokesman conceded the increase in price for cans may be passed on to wholesalers - though it is not clear what will happen on shop shelves. ""As is always the case, our customers will have to decide the retail prices in their outlets."" Tim Rycroft, of the Food and Drink Federation, told Newsnight that he thought the sugar tax was not ""the right mechanism"". ""If you put a tax on something, you will reduce consumption in terms of purchase. The question is, will you reduce consumption in terms of calories? Will those people who might choose not to buy a drink that goes up in price forego those calories, or will they find them somewhere else? ""Trying to tackle obesity through these very narrow interventions seems to me to be not the right way to do it.""

Park baby murder CCTV footage released,"This video can not be played Baby M death: Police search for two people seen on CCTV Police investigating the murder of a newborn girl whose body was discovered in a park have released CCTV footage of two people they want to speak to. Baby M was found dead in Manor Park, Aldershot, on 19 May. It is thought she was born about three days earlier. The two people in the footage walked up and down nearby Ash Road 10 times in an hour on 15 May, police said. A post-mortem examination revealed the child died from ""deliberately inflicted"" head injuries, police said. She suffered multiple blunt force injuries to the head, with other minor injuries to her body, and died within six hours of being born. It is thought the birth took place under this tree in Manor Park The body of the baby was discovered in Manor Park, Aldershot, in May Det Ch Insp Dave Storey, of Hampshire Constabulary, said analysis by the National History Museum found the birth would most likely have happened under a tree in the park between 18:00 BST on 15 May and 08:00 the following day. He added a DNA profile taken from the baby, whose body was discovered at the edge of the park by a council worker, showed that both she and her mother, and probably the child's father, were of east Asian ethnicity. ""This remains a particularly sad case in which, despite extensive investigation, we are still are nowhere nearer to identifying the newborn baby Baby M, nor her mother,"" he said. ""We have a baby who is unnamed and, at this stage, is still not buried and we would like some assistance in order to identify the mother and obtain some justice for Baby M."" He added the force was still trying to identify the mother and offer support ""because it takes an awful lot for a mother to give birth to a child to then either kill the baby or have the baby taken away from her and killed immediately afterwards"".

Ford to invest $11bn in electric vehicles,"Ford used the show to unveil its new Ranger 2019 pick-up truck Ford says it will boost its investment in electric vehicles to $11bn (Â£8bn) in the next five years, more than doubling a previous commitment. Chairman Bill Ford said the car maker would have 40 hybrid and fully electric vehicles in its range by 2022. It comes as countries around the world put more pressure on car makers to rein in carbon emissions. General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen have already outlined ambitious plans to offer more electric vehicles. Speaking at the Detroit Auto Show on Sunday, Mr Ford said the focus would be on electrifying existing Ford models without naming any specific cars. He said the firm would offer 16 fully electric vehicles by 2022 and 24 plug-in hybrids. New boss Jim Hackett wants Ford to make fewer petrol engine cars Mr Ford told reporters: ""We're all in on this and we're taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we're electrifying them. ""If we want to be successful with electrification, we have to do it with vehicles that are already popular."" Stephanie Brinley, a senior automotive analyst at IHS Markit, said it was part of a bigger trend of car makers investing in electrification. ""Part of it is about tougher regulation but also the expectation that electric vehicles will support autonomous driving. ""The big question is how quickly consumers will adapt, as electric is only 1% of the market right now. ""Changing that will take better infrastructure on our roads, but also having more electric vehicles available."" Last year, America's biggest carmaker GM said it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its range by 2023. Volkswagen said in November it would spend $40bn on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022 - doubling a previous commitment. Ford's $11bn investment pledge is much higher than a previously announced target of $4.5bn by 2020 and was spearheaded by new chief executive Jim Hackett. During the Detroit show, Fordteased the release of its first performance electric vehicle,external- the Mach 1 - without giving any details about how it would look or its spec. The firm announced an upgraded Mustang Bullitt sports car inspired by an earlier version, made in the 1960s and 70s, and will be released in 2020. The US firm also unveiled a more fuel-efficient version of its Ranger pick-up truck, the Ranger 2019. The SUV will have a 2.3-litre EcoBoost engine, 10-speed auto transmission and automatic emergency braking. Will Detroit's auto show be upstaged?

Carillion collapse: What next?,"The collapse of Carillion, the UK's second biggest construction firm, should not make much immediate difference to the services it provides. Following the news of its liquidation, the government has said it will provide funding to maintain Carillion's work in the public sector. But in the longer term, there are plenty of question marks over its uncompleted projects, as well as jobs and pensions. The company collapsed under the weight of Â£1.5bn of debt, including a Â£587m pension shortfall. Its problems arose from risky contracts which proved unprofitable and payment delays in the Middle East. Carillion employs 43,000 staff globally, 20,000 of them in the UK, where it does most of its business. They include construction workers, as well as hospital cleaners, prison maintenance workers, port staff and workers in the energy and utilities sector. Where Carillion is part of a consortium, the staff could be taken on by the other companies. Or if contracts were taken back into the public sector, the staff could then be employed directly by the government, health authorities, or local government. Of course, that leaves aside what happens to Carillion's private sector contracts, which is unclear at present. The company also subcontracts some of its work to smaller firms, while the Unite union said it understood there were also ""several thousand"" jobs at risk in the construction supply chain. BBC business editor Simon Jack said ""real pain"" could be felt by these subcontractors, many of whom were small and medium-sized businesses for whom payment delays or failures could threaten their future. There is a Â£587m shortfall in the Carillion pension scheme and 28,000 members of its 13 separate schemes. The government, the Pensions Regulator and representatives from the firm held talks to discuss the firm's options on Friday. A spokesperson for the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) acknowledged that news of Carillion's liquidation raised ""serious concerns for all people involved"". ""We want to reassure members of Carillion's defined benefit pension schemes that their benefits are protected by the PPF."" Nicola Parish, executive director at the Pensions Regulator, said: ""We continue to work closely with all relevant parties in what are very challenging circumstances... to help achieve the best possible outcome for members of the pension schemes and those impacted by the situation. Speaking before news of Carillion's collapse, pensions consultant John Ralfe said the scheme's members ""shouldn't be losing any sleep"". He said the ""good news"" was that whatever happened, the members would get compensation from the PPF, which generally meant their pension would be about 85% of what they might have expected to receive. The big question is who will pick up the firm's loss-making public contracts - another outsourced services provider or the government itself? The BBC's Simon Jack says the government may have to resort to temporary nationalisation of parts of the business. ""I'm told that there are plans in hand to do just that with the contract to run the prisons,""he wrotebefore the liquidation was announced. However, in instances where Carillion is part of a consortium with other companies, as it is with the design and build of its HS2 contracts, its role could be assumed by the other contractors. In situations where Carillion is the sole contractor, the work may be taken in-house by Network Rail, for example. The taxpayer has been called upon before to bail out firms, notably during the financial crisis with RBS and Lloyds. But despite feelings in some quarters that Carillion was ""too big to fail"", the government was not prepared to step in and prevent its collapse. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said that ""taxpayers cannot be expected to bail out a private sector company"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has called for the government to take responsibility for Carillion's big contracts or re-tender them, in order to keep the supply chain going. ""We also urgently need a Parliamentary inquiry into some of the very questionable decisions made in the past few months, not least the award of public contracts to a company that was clearly in danger of collapse,"" he said. A private finance initiative, or PFI, is a way of financing big public sector projects by getting private firms to implement and manage them. Under this system, the upfront costs are handled by the private company, which is then paid back by the government over a set period of time. Critics argue the government can end up overpaying, and that governments use them as an accounting gimmick to get public-sector borrowing figures down. PFIs have been around in the UK since 1992 and have been used by both Conservative and Labour governments. But there is widespread sentiment that Carillion's collapse shows up their limitations. Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration Committee, said Carillion's collapse ""really shakes public confidence in the ability of the private sector to deliver public services and infrastructure"". He said there needed to be a change of ""mindset"" at companies that do a lot of work for the taxpayer. ""You've got to treat yourself much more as a branch of the public service, not as a private company just there to enrich the shareholders and the directors,"" he said. Lord Adonis, who resigned last month as chairman of the government's Infrastructure Commission, said Mr Jenkin was ""absolutely right"". ""If the only way we can get private companies to deliver public services is constantly to bail them out and put them on life support, then that doesn't deliver for the taxpayer,"" he added. Lord Adonis said the state had to be prepared to step in as a ""last resort"" to provide public services itself. ""If these contracts simply cannot be run competitively and cost-effectively by the private sector, then there will be no choice but to bring them in [to the public sector],"" he warned. However, he added: ""There are other private companies that have done a perfectly good job on behalf of the taxpayer.""

Turkey denounces US 'terror army' plan,"About half of the border force will be made up of Syrian Democratic Forces fighters Key powers involved in Syria's civil war have criticised US plans to help an allied Kurdish-led militia set up a 30,000-strong ""border security force"". Turkey's president vowed to ""suffocate"" efforts to begin training members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and create what he called a ""terror army"". Ankara considers Kurds fighting for the SDF to be part of a terrorist group. Syria's government decried the ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty, and Russia warned it could lead to partition. With the help of air strikes from a US-led coalition, the SDF has captured tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory from Islamic State (IS) militants. In October, the alliance took full control of the northern city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of the ""caliphate"" declared by the jihadist group in 2014. Since then, SDF fighters have been advancing south-eastwards along the Euphrates river valley. News of the coalition's plan to work with the SDF to train a new Syrian Border Security Force (BSF) was first reported on Saturday by The Defense Post, which quoted a spokesman as saying that230 individuals were currently participating in the ""inaugural class"",external. The coalition said on Monday that its goal was to create a force with about 30,000 personnel ""over the next several years"". About half will be Kurdish and Arab SDF fighters and the other half new recruits. The US-led coalition against IS has been advising and arming YPG fighters in Syria The BSF will be tasked with securing the long sections of Syria's northern border with Turkey and eastern border with Iraq that are under SDF control, as well as parts of the Euphrates river valley, which effectively serves as the dividing line between the SDF and Syrian pro-government forces. ""A strong border security force will prohibit Daesh's freedom of movement and deny the transportation of illicit materials,"" the coalition said, using a different term for IS. ""This will enable the Syrian people to establish effective local, representative governance and reclaim their land."" Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Turkey has consistently opposed the coalition's support for the SDF because the force is dominated by the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) militia. Ankara considers the YPG an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. Washington disagrees and insists the YPG has been vital to the battle against IS. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the US had acknowledged it was ""in the process of creating a terror army on our border"". ""It is for us to suffocate this terror army before it is born,"" he said. Mr Erdogan added that preparations were complete for a Turkish military operation against the Kurdish enclave of Afrin in north-western Syria, and that it might start ""at any moment"". Troops deployed at the border were already hitting YPG positions inside Afrin with heavy artillery, he noted. The Syrian government called the creation of the SDF border force ""a blatant attack on the sovereignty and territorial integrity and unity of Syria, and a flagrant violation of international law"". ""What the American administration has done comes in the context of its destructive policy in the region to fragment countries... and impedes any solutions to the crises,"" an official at the foreign ministry was cited as saying by the Sana news agency. In October, SDF fighters took full control of the northern city of Raqqa The source warned that Damascus considered any Syrian fighting for militias sponsored by the US to be ""a traitor to their people and nation"". Russia, which backs the Syrian government, said the US move might lead to the ""break-up of a large territory along the border with Turkey and Iraq"". ""This is a very serious issue that raises concerns that a path towards the partition of Syria has been taken,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.

Sunk tanker leaves big oil spill off China,"This video can not be played Footage said to be filmed on Sunday 14 January showed huge plumes of smoke Chinese ships are racing to clean up a giant oil spill after an Iranian tanker sank in the East China Sea. The 120 sq km (46 sq mile) oil slick is thought to be made up of heavy fuel that was used to power the vessel. The Sanchi oil tanker sank on Sunday and officials say all its crew members are dead. It was carrying 136,000 tonnes of ultra-light crude oil from Iran which generates a toxic underwater slick that would be invisible from the surface. Both the fuel and the ultra-light oil could cause devastating damage to marine life. The Sanchi and a cargo ship collided 260km (160 miles) off Shanghai on 6 January, with the tanker then drifting south-east towards Japan. It caught fire after the collision and burnt for more than a week before sinking off China's east coast. Burning oil tanker sinks off China Iranian officials now say all 32 crew members - 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis - on the tanker were killed. On Monday, China Central Television said a search and rescue operation had been cancelled and a clean-up operation had begun after a fire on the surface was extinguished. They said two ships were spraying the water with chemical agents designed to dissolve the oil. This video can not be played Bodies were airlifted off the tanker on Saturday The BBC's China correspondent Robin Brant says the oil slick has more than doubled in size since Sunday. The big concern now is for the environmental impact, he said. There could also be a very tall plume of condensate, this ultra-refined form of oil, underneath the surface. Condensate, which creates products such as jet fuel, is very different from the black crude that is often seen in oil spills. It is toxic, low in density and considerably more explosive than regular crude. The cause of the collision is still not known. Some 13 vessels and an Iranian commando unit took part in the salvage operation, amid bad weather. On Saturday, salvage workers boarded the vessel and found the bodies of two crew members in a lifeboat. Only one other body had been found during the week of salvage operations. The rescue workers also retrieved the ship's black box but had to leave quickly because of the toxic smoke and high temperatures.

Where did it go wrong ?,"Construction giant Carillion is going into liquidation after its huge financial troubles finally overwhelmed it. The UK's second-largest construction company buckled under the weight of a whopping Â£1.5bn debt pile. Despite discussions between Carillion, its lenders and the government, no deal could be reached to save the company. The big concern is over the disruption this might cause, given Carillion holds so many government contracts - from building hospitals to managing schools. It also employs about 20,000 people in the UK and has more staff abroad. So how did the company get into such dire straits? Carillion specialises in construction, as well as facilities management and ongoing maintenance. It has worked on big private sector projects such as the Battersea Power station redevelopment and the Anfield Stadium expansion. But it is perhaps best known for being one of the largest suppliers of services to the public sector. Carillion worked on the Battersea Power Station revamp Notably, it is part of a consortium that holds a contract to build part of the forthcoming HS2 high speed railway line, and it is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail. It also maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence, manages nearly 900 schools and manages highways and prisons. Very. Carillion employs 43,000 staff globally, around half of them in the UK where it does most of its business. It also operates in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. In 2016, it had sales of Â£5.2bn and until July boasted a market capitalisation of almost Â£1bn. But since then its share price has plummeted, leaving it worth just Â£61m. Some argue that it overreached itself, taking on too many risky contracts that proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East that hit its accounts. Last year, it issued three profit warnings in five months and wrote down more than Â£1bn from the value of contracts. This made it much harder to manage its mountainous Â£900m debt pile and Â£600m pension deficit. In December, the firm convinced lenders to give it more time to repay them. However, the company's banks, which include Santander UK, HSBC and Barclays, were reluctant to lend it any more cash. Among its biggest problems were cost overruns on three public sector construction contracts: The Â£350m Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Sandwell. The opening was originally scheduled for October 2018, but difficulties with the heating, lighting and ventilation systems forced a delay of the launch date to spring 2019 The Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital. The new 646-bed hospital was due to be finished by March 2017, but the completion date has been repeatedly pushed back amid reports of cracks in the building The Â£745m Aberdeen bypass, which is being built by the Aberdeen Roads Ltd consortium, a joint venture that includes Balfour Beatty and Morrison Construction alongside Carillion. It is due to open in spring 2018. One key stretch was due to open a year earlier, but was delayed because of slow progress in completing initial earthworks. Last month, environment watchdogs slapped a Â£280,000 penalty on the consortium for polluting two of Scotland's most important salmon rivers As Carillion is such a big supplier to the public sector, some fear there will be a lot of disruption. Labour MP Jon Trickett told Parliament before the announcement that if it went under, it would risk ""massive damage"" to a range of public services. Thousands of jobs also hang in the balance. Unions have said workers do not deserve to be caught in the crossfire and have urged the government to safeguard their jobs and bring Carillion's contracts back in house. The government, which has praised Carillion's work on projects such as Crossrail, has said it will provide funding to maintain the public services run by the firm. Analysts say Carillion had a large order book of business lined up. The big question is, who will ultimately pick up its loss-making public contracts - another outsourced services provider or the government itself?

President Trump: 'I am not a racist',"This video can not be played The president made the comments to White House reporters at his Florida golf resort on Sunday President Donald Trump has denied that he is racist, after a row broke out over his alleged use of the word ""shithole"" to describe African nations. Mr Trump reportedly used the term last week during a bipartisan Oval Office meeting on immigration reform. He has now told reporters: ""I am not a racist. I'm the least racist person you have ever interviewed."" It is the first time the president has responded directly to the racism accusations. He made the denial to White House press pool reporters at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in Florida on Sunday night. The row broke out after lawmakers from both parties visited the president on Thursday to work on a proposal for a bipartisan immigration deal. In recent weeks the Trump administration has been withdrawing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) from a number of nationalities currently living in the country. Reports later emerged in US media that Mr Trump had asked during the meeting: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump was said to have told them that instead of granting temporary residency to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, the US should be taking in migrants from countries like Norway.

Democrats decry 'cruel' El Salvador migrants order This video can not be played President Trump honours MLK amid 'racist slur' controversy Accounts suggest that when Mr Trump was told that the largest groups of immigrants with the status were from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the president responded: ""Haitians? Do we need more Haitians?"" The president tweeted on Friday morning that the language he used in the meeting was ""tough"" but disputed the wording of the reports. Allow Twitter content?

But Senator Dick Durbin stood by claims, and said that Mr Trump had used ""hate-filled, vile and racist"" language during the meeting. This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Several senior Republican lawmakers at the meeting appeared on the Sunday shows to back up Mr Trump. Senator David Perdue said the reported slur was a ""gross misrepresentation"". On Friday, in the immediate aftermath, he had said he could not recall the conversation. But another Republican senator who was there, Lindsey Graham, did not deny the comments were made. ""Following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,"" he said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a senior Republican, said that Donald Trump's immigration comments were ""very unfortunate"" and ""unhelpful"". Asked on Sunday on whether he thought the comments had made it harder to achieve any immigration deal, Mr Trump responded: ""Have you seen what various senators said about my comments? They weren't made."" This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The African Union on Friday demanded that the US president apologiseexpressing their ""shock, dismay and outrage"" at the ""clearly racist"" remarks. The UN human rights spokesman, Rupert Colville, told a Geneva news briefing: ""There is no other word one can use but racist. You cannot dismiss entire countries and continents as 'shitholes'."" South Africa's foreign office has summoned the deputy chief of mission at the US embassy to protest over the reported comments, although Ghana has denied media reports that it has done likewise. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) accused the president of falling ""deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of racism and xenophobia"".

In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded both Mrs Sadler and Mr Forrester had cases to answer for gross misconduct. The inquest was the second hearing into Poppi's death. The first, in 2014 with a different coroner, lasted less than eight minutes and concluded the cause of her death was ""unascertained"".

Virgin Trains to resume Daily Mail sales,"Virgin Trains is to reverse its decision to stop selling the Daily Mail on its West Coast services. Virgin Group boss Sir Richard Branson said he instructed the firm to restock the paper while a review takes place. Virgin Trains had said the decision came after ""feedback from our people"". But Sir Richard said he was unaware of the move and the operator must never be seen to be ""censoring"" customers. The Daily Mail said it welcomed the ""support for freedom of speech"". In November, Virgin Trains staff were told in an internal memo ""considerable concern"" had been raised about the Mail's position on issues such as immigration, LGBT rights and unemployment. The memo added the paper was ""not compatible"" with the company's beliefs. Last week, Virgin said it regularly reviewed its on-board products and it had never sold the newspaper on its East Coast trains, which is under the management of Virgin and Stagecoach. Virgin West Coast services run between London, the Midlands, the north-west of England and Scotland. Mail sales halt absurd, says Johnson Virgin Trains apologises for 'sexist' tweet Paperchase 'sorry' for Daily Mail offer In Sir Richard's statement,,externalhe said the chairman of Stagecoach, Sir Brian Souter, was also not aware of the decision. ""Brian and I agree that we must not ever be seen to be censoring what our customers read and influencing their freedom of choice. ""Nor must we be seen to be moralising on behalf of others. Instead we should stand up for the values we hold dear and defend them publicly, as I have done with the Mail on many issues over the years.""

The paper described the original decision as ""disgraceful"" and suggested it had been taken for ""political reasons"". Its had said it ""may be no coincidence"" the other titles remaining in stock were ""like Virgin owner Sir Richard Branson... pro-Remain"". The Mail had taken the opposite stance during the EU referendum. The decision by Virgin Trains had also attracted criticism from Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who described it as ""censorious and wrong"".

Sinn Fein MP McElduff resigns,"This video can not be played Barry McElduff regrets 'deep and unnecessary' hurt The MP for West Tyrone, Barry McElduff, has resigned as a result of a controversy over a Twitter video. The Sinn FÃ©in MP posted a video of himself in a shop with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head. It was published on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills murders, in which 10 Protestant workmen were shot dead by the IRA. The sole survivor of the attack said he would not accept his apology adding: ""I'll never forgive him"". Mr McElduff has said that he did not make a connection in his mind between the video and the massacre, but he accepted many people do not believe that. Analysis: Barrage of criticism never abated Survivor says McElduff video 'depraved' Sinn FÃ©in MP apologises over Kingsmill tweet Sinn FÃ©in suspended Mr McElduff from party activities for a period of three months last Monday. Alan Black, who was the only person to survive the 1976 attack, welcomed the resignation. ""I'm not on a crusade. I've done what I've done up to now to protect the memory of the boys and to try to protect their families,"" he told the BBC. ""But he did the right thing stepping down  - eventually.  I won't be speaking publicly about Kingsmills again unless there is some development at the inquest. ""As far as I'm concern the Barry McElduff incident is over now. But I don't accept his apology. I'll never forgive him."" Mr McElduff said the ""deep and unnecessary hurt this video caused the families of the victims of Kingsmills is my greatest regret"" and reiterated his apology to them. Ten workmen were killed in the 1976 atrocity ""Kingsmills was wrong, unjustifiable and sectarian. It should never have happened,"" he said. He said that the view that the video was intended to refer to the massacre would ""impede any reconciliation process"". Barry McElduff has consistently protested that he never intended to cause offence with his Kingsmills loaf video, and that its publication on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills atrocity was just a terrible coincidence. With that in mind, his family and friends rallied to his defence and he must have initially hoped that his three month suspension would buy enough time for emotions to cool. However, the criticism never abated, with Sinn FÃ©in's opponents accusing the party of not matching their initial tough words with appropriate action. Read morehere. ""I am an Irish republican and believe wholeheartedly in the reunification of our country and an agreed Ireland in which we heal the wounds of the past together. ""Reconciliation is essential, but that message is not being heard at this time,"" Mr McElduff added. The former UUP MLA Danny Kennedy, who is a cousin of Mr Black, said Mr McElduff had ""bowed to the inevitable"". He toldBBC Talkbackit was necessary for Mr McElduff to step down, and said today was ""not a day of celebration"". ""There is nothing here to celebrate except that at long last a public representative has owned up and taken responsibility for his own actions,"" he said. Barry McElduff says Kingsmills was 'wrong, unjustifiable and sectarian' The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said it was right that Mr McElduff resigned saying he was not fit for public office and should have resigned in the immediate aftermath of posting the video. She accused Sinn FÃ©in of failing to deal with the situation. ""By merely suspending him and continuing to pay him, they compounded his disgraceful actions and demonstrated a lack of respect and compassion for the victims of Kingmills and indeed victims more widely. ""Now is the time for Sinn FÃ©in to learn the lessons from these dark events and to deal with the fact that it, and many of its individual members, continue to publicly glorify the murderous deeds of the past. Ten Protestant workmen were murdered in the 1976 Kingsmills massacre Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann welcomed Mr McElduff's resignation but said that ""it should have happened last week"". He called for ""a non-partisan candidate who will be a voice for victims to contest this seat against Sinn FÃ©in"". ""If a candidate emerges that allows cross-community support to coalesce around, it would send a strong message that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated,"" he said. The DUP's Gregory Campbell was cautious about the suggestion, commenting that Sinn FÃ©in had achieved almost 51% of the vote in the recent general election. ""Whatever decisions we may make separately, let's not do anything to turn Sinn FÃ©in into a victim,"" the East Londonderry MP said. ""They were the perpetrators of this incident, not the victims of it,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in's northern leader Michelle O'Neill said Mr McElduff told her of his intention to resign on Sunday evening. ""Barry recognises that this controversy and his continuing role in public office is compounding the distress that's been caused to families and the victims of Kingsmills and he again offers his profound apology for the unintended hurt that has been caused to both the Kingsmills families, but also to the wide victims community,"" she said. MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir said he retweeted the video as he believed it was ""wholly apolitical"" ""He has said that he does not want to be a barrier to further reconciliation and I respect that decision,"" Mrs O'Neill added. She also called for Sinn FÃ©in's MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir to ""reflect on what he does on social media"" after he retweeted Mr McElduff's video. Mr Ã Muilleoir has apologised for retweeting the video, saying he saw it as being ""wholly apolitical and retweeted it on that basis"". Mr McElduff's resignation will trigger a by-election in West Tyrone, where last year Mr McElduff had a majority with more than 50% of the overall vote.

Deneuve apologises to sex assault victims,"Catherine Deneuve has been in more than 100 films in a career spanning decades The French actress Catherine Deneuve has apologised to victims of sexual assault after signing an open letter that argued the campaign against sexual harassment had gone too far. She said she was sorry if she had offended victims of ""hideous acts"". Last week, she sparked a feminist backlash as one of 100 prominent women who signed a letter saying men should be ""free to hit on"" women. Some activists said the intervention trivialised sexual violence. The letter signed by French women writers, performers and academics, was published by Le Monde newspaper last Tuesday. It said that while it was legitimate and necessary to speak out against the abuse of power by some men, the constant denunciations had spiralled out of control. ""I fraternally salute all the victims of these hideous acts who might have felt assaulted by the letter published in Le Monde. It is to them and them alone that I offer my apologies,"" the actress said in a letter published on Sunday on the website of French daily Liberation. Ms Deneuve also said that there was ""nothing in the letter"" to Le Monde that said ""anything good about harassment, otherwise I wouldn't have signed it"". France's celebrity pushback against 'MeToo' The signatories of the letter decried a new ""puritanism"" sparked by recent sexual harassment scandals, and deplored a wave of ""denunciations"", following rape allegations made against US movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Mr Weinstein denies all allegations of non-consensual sex, but has admitted that his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"". Harvey Weinstein scandal: Who has accused him of what? In the letter, the signatories say: ""Men have been punished summarily, forced out of their jobs when all they did was touch someone's knee or try to steal a kiss. ""Rape is a crime, but trying to seduce someone, even persistently or clumsily, is not - and nor is men being gentlemanly a chauvinist attack."" According to the writers, this is creating a public mood in which women are seen as powerless, as perpetual victims. ""As women we do not recognise ourselves in this feminism, which beyond denouncing the abuse of power, takes on a hatred of men and of sexuality."" Deneuve is by far the most prominent of them. The other 99 women who signed the document include some well-known figures, such as actress Christine Boisson; conservative journalist Ãlisabeth LÃ©vy; Brigitte Lahaie, a 1970s porn star who is now a talk-show host; Catherine Millet, a writer and magazine editor. There are also lesser-known names from the worlds of entertainment, the arts, the media, and academia. Most of the signatories, however, are professionals who are not known to the French public. The letter has stirred debate in France. On Wednesday a group of about 30 feminists issued a statement accusing Deneuve and her co-signatories of seeking to ""close the lid"" on the scandals uncovered by the Weinstein case, and of ""pouring scorn"" on victims of sexual violence. On social media, many expressed either anger or sadness at the open letter.One Twitter user (in French) regretted the inability of women to speak with one voice,external, saying they had ""failed to agree"". The backlash against the letter, however, has not been front-page news and is not trending on Twitter in France. The reason may be that controversy over exposing sex pests has been rumbling on for several months now in France. The debate has mostly pitted those belonging to the older generation, who view #MeToo and similar campaigns as a threat to the sexual liberation achieved in the 1960s, against younger, activist types who feel that the battle against harassment is the latest stage in the fight for women's rights. She is not known as an activist star.  However, last year the 74-year-old spoke out against social media campaigns shaming men accused of harassing women. Women and men from all over the globe who have been sexually harassed have been sharing their stories across social media using the hashtag #MeToo. In France, Twitter users are using #Balancetonporc  (""rat on your dirty old man"") to encourage women to name and shame their attackers. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Deneuve, an Oscar-nominated actress, has been in more than 100 films, making her debut in 1957.

Giggs is named new Wales manager,"This video can not be played 'Proud' Wales boss Giggs was 'itching' to return to football Ryan Giggs has been appointed Wales manager on a four-year contract. The 44-year-old former Manchester United winger succeeds Chris Coleman, wholeft for Sunderland in November. Coleman's assistant Osian Roberts, former Wales striker Craig Bellamy and Mark Bowen were also interviewed. Giggs had long been a target for the Football Association of Wales (FAW) and was the favourite for the role once Coleman departed after Wales failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. If you are viewing this page on the BBC News app pleaseclick here to vote.,external The FAW confirmed the appointment on social media and in a statement Giggs said: ""I am so proud to have been given the honour of managing the national team. ""The challenges that we have ahead of us with the Nations League and qualification for Uefa Euro 2020 excite me a great deal. ""I can't wait to start working with the players as we prepare for those crucial games later in the year."" FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford said: ""With his vast amount of experience having played, coached and managed the biggest club in the world, we are confident of a successful future for our national team."" Giggs won 64 caps between 1991 and 2007 and captained his country - but he was criticised for regularly pulling out of squads and especially for missing friendly matches. Before Giggs' appointment former team-mate Clayton Blackmore told BBC Sport Wales their former bossSir Alex Ferguson had been responsible for the no-shows. The Manchester United great was in caretaker charge of the Red Devils for four games at the end of the 2013-14 season following the sacking of David Moyes. He spent the next two seasons as Louis van Gaal's assistant, but left after Jose Mourinho was appointed manager at Old Trafford. Giggslost out on the Swansea job to Bob Bradleyafter being interviewed for the manager's role at the Liberty Stadium in October 2016. It is understood Bellamy and Roberts, who is the FAW's technical director, also had their supporters at Welsh football's governing body. Bellamy, 38, won 78 caps and is the country's fourth most-capped player. The former Newcastle, Liverpool and Blackburn forward is currently an academy coach at Cardiff City, where he ended his playing career in 2014. This video can not be played Alan Shearer to Ryan Giggs: Good luck getting Wales players to friendlies Roberts has worked throughout all age grades in the Welsh system and been widely credited for helping to produce the talented crop of youngsters who will be at the disposal of the new senior manager and was Coleman's assistant boss during a spell in which Wales reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016. Tony Pulis was also among the initial contenders to succeed Coleman, but he ruled himself out when he became Middlesbrough manager last month. Bowen was available after leaving Stoke, where he was assistant to boss Mark Hughes until the latter was sacked by the Potters on 6 January. So Wales finally have their man. Its long been an ambition for many of the Football Association of Wales hierarchy to appoint Giggs to the top job. They craved him ahead of going for Gary Speed and Chris Coleman when the position was vacant in the past. Now he is at the helm, the FAW will have to lead a charm offensive to ensure the famous motto #TogetherStronger remains relevant. Make no mistake, this is a divisive appointment. There is a vociferous body of Wales fans - including a hard-core section who spend thousands of pounds travelling to support their country - who will have to be won over. They cite a perceived lack of commitment given Giggs' record as a player for being absent for friendlies. Ryan Giggs inherits a talented Wales squad with players such as Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey at his disposal Welsh internationals who shared a dressing room with him at the time have never doubted the passion he held for playing for his country. But perceptions are hard to eradicate. Neither Speed nor Coleman were universally welcomed when they became Wales manager. Coleman's results and ultimate qualification for Euro 2016 finals ensured his elevation to Welsh national treasure. They did not, however, face as much hostility on their appointment. Giggs is a Manchester United legend. That seems to explain some of the ferocity against him as United are loved by their fans - loathed by others. He inherits a squad of great talents with stellar players such as Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey still at the age where they can be decisive forces at international level. The future also looks bright in the hands of Ethan Ampadu and Ben Woodburn. Giggs may lack coaching experience but will command respect as soon as he walks in the dressing room. His medal haul goes before him and he is one of the finest talents in Wales' sporting history. To some fans of the national team he is admired, rather than loved - now he must win hearts too.

Hard Brexit 'would cost Scots Â£12.7bn',"Scotland's economy would be Â£12.7bn a year worse off under a so-called hard Brexit, according to analysis by the Scottish government. The figure is contained ina paper on the impact of UK withdrawal from the European Union,external. It calculates the cost to Scotland of the UK leaving the single market with or without a trade deal. The UK government insists it is seeking a Brexit deal that will work for the whole of the UK. And the Scottish Conservatives dismissed the analysis as ""completely over-the-top scaremongering"". Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon launched the paper with a speech in Edinburgh, alongside her Brexit minister Mike Russell. She said none of the options included was ""as good as staying in the European Union"", but said retaining single market membership would be the ""least damaging"" approach. She said: ""For the sake of jobs, the economy and the next generation, today we are calling on the UK government to drop its hard Brexit red lines so that Scotland and the UK can stay inside the single market and customs union."" Brexit: All You Need To Know Sturgeon call on indyref2 by end of year No 'Scotland-specific Brexit analysis' Brexit impact study 'will not be published' The Scottish government document, titled Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment, considers three potential outcomes for Scotland's economy when Britain exits the EU in March 2019. They include the impact of Scotland remaining within the single market and customs union or the UK securing a free trade agreement. The final scenario considered is the impact on Scotland's GDP figures if trade with the EU reverts to so-called WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms. That would involve the UK accepting tariffs on goods imported from, or exported to, the single market. The Scottish government concludes that if the UK was to pursue a WTO relationship, the cost to Scotland would be about 8.5% of GDP. That would be equivalent to Â£12.7bn a year by the year 2030, compared with current full EU membership, their analysis found. The paper says that would equate to a loss of about Â£2,300 per year for each person in Scotland. If the UK achieves a free trade deal similar to that the EU struck with Canada - the only model Ms Sturgeon said was likely if Theresa May's government sticks to its current red lines - Scottish GDP would be 6.1% worse off by 2030, compared with the baseline of EU membership. This would equate to Â£9bn in 2016 cash terms, or Â£1,610 per person. The paper estimates that retaining single market membership, which Mr Russell described as the ""least worst"" option, would see Scottish GDP 2.7% worse off come 2030, working out at Â£4bn in cash terms, or Â£688 per person. Ms Sturgeon said single market membership would be ""the number one priority"" for the Scottish government when phase two of the Brexit talks begin, urging Mrs May not to repeat the ""mistakes"" of previous talks. She said: ""It is time for the UK government to stop deluding itself, and misleading others, about what will happen if it maintains its red lines."" The first minister also called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to change his ""ridiculous"" position on Brexit and join other opposition groups in pushing for single market membership. The Scottish government has also argued strongly in favour of free movement of people, something Mr Russell said Scotland ""cannot do without"". The paper notes that due to ""demographic challenges"" facing Scotland, all of the increase in population projected over the next decade results from immigration. It states: ""Without immigration, the number of people of working age, working and paying towards public services in Scotland, is likely to fall."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the UK government was ""committed to working closely with the Scottish government as we negotiate our future relationship with the EU"" - but was critical of the analysis paper. He said: ""These figures fail to acknowledge that above all we need to avoid anything that might fracture the vital UK internal market, which is worth around Â£48bn to the Scottish economy - or four times more than trade with the EU. ""They also do not recognise that we're seeking a new deep and special economic partnership with the EU that works for Scotland, and indeed the whole of the UK, and is of greater scope than any existing agreement. ""At the weekend, Nicola Sturgeon made it clear her real priority isholding a second independence referendum in Scotland, not getting a good deal as we leave the EU."" Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins, meanwhile, accused the Scottish government of ""scaremongering"", saying the SNP had proved with their 2014 white paper on independence that ""their financial forecasts simply cannot be trusted"". Scottish Labour said the Tories' ""reckless and incompetent Brexit"" risked ""devastating our economy, jobs and public services"", and that the UK government had so far ""delivered nothing but uncertainty and attacks on hard-won workers' rights and devolution"". However, the Scottish Greens said it was actually Labour who were under pressure, saying it was ""disappointing"" to see them ""refusing to join us"" in arguing for single market membership ""and instead essentially choosing to back the Tories' job-destroying hard Brexit"". The Lib Dems also urged Labour to ""come on board and protect our UK and Scottish economies"". While backing the paper as ""worthwhile"", leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to ""drop the threat of an independence referendum"".

Twelve hurt in Russia school knife fight,"Emergency services rushed to the school to deal with the fight Eleven children and a teacher were wounded in Russia when a knife fight broke out at a school in Perm, a city 1,000km (620 miles) east of Moscow. The victims were slashed when they tried to tackle two teenage boys who burst into a classroom wielding knives. Two suspects, both 16, were detained by police and the incident is being treated as attempted murder. Surgeons operated on 47-year-old teacher Natalya Shagunina and on four of the children, RIA Novosti news said. The teacher remains critically ill, the others' injuries are less severe. Most of the injured children are aged 10-12 and have knife cuts to the head and neck. The school was evacuated and will remain shut on Tuesday as police pursue a criminal investigation there. Classes were abandoned because of the emergency at the school Some witnesses quoted on social media contradicted reports from local security officials about what happened. The witnesses said the two boys with knives had attacked the teacher and slashed pupils who rushed to defend her. One, quoted by Komsomolskaya Pravda daily, said the two boys were clad in black, armed with hunting knives and acted together. Earlier, a security source quoted by Interfax news agency said two boys had started a knife fight in a corridor, then burst into a classroom where younger children were studying. Interfax quoted another local source as saying one of the boys had been expelled from the school, because of drugs and mental health issues, but got in after telling a guard outside that he was a pupil. There are reports that one assailant, or both, had been angered by personal comments on social media. Children said they saw blood on the floor as they were led out.

Baghdad suicide attack 'kills 35',"Some victims were buried hours later in the Shia Muslim holy city of Najaf Two suicide bombers have killed at least 35 people and injured 90 in an attack on a Baghdad square where day labourers gather to look for work. They set off their devices at intervals, sending people scattering across Tayaran Square in the centre of the Iraqi capital. Scores of labourers are said to be among the dead and injured. Attacks on the city had become less frequent since the Islamic State group lost its Iraqi strongholds last year. The government declared it had retaken all territory overrun by the Sunni Muslim militants since 2014. The war against IS in maps and charts Officials say the death toll could rise Two men set off suicide bomb belts, the first one detonating his device at around 10:00 (07:00 GMT). CCTV videos circulated on social media show the moment of the first blast and people fleeing through stalls or carrying at least one person who seems to be injured. Allow Twitter content?

An eyewitness, Husain Abdallah, told AFP news agency the bomber had just got off a bus. After the blast Mr Abdallah and others began running and were still trying to escape when the second bomb went off. Another video, recorded on a mobile phone, captured the moment of that attack and the crowd panic that followed, with what appeared to be shots being fired. Allow Twitter content?

The attacks were designed to maximise casualties, as is often the case, with one bomb swiftly followed by another, BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. Large crowds of construction workers gather to find work every morning on Tayaran and it has been targeted by militants in the past. Another bomb attack in Baghdad on Monday, in the north-eastern district of Jamila, killed two civilians and injured six others, medical and security sources say. A bloodstained puddle could be seen on the square after the attacks No group said it had carried out the bombing but such attacks are usually attributed to IS, which regards members of Iraq's majority Shia Muslim community as heretics. Success by Iraqi forces in defeating IS as a territorial threat is likely to have caused the decrease in attacks recently, as jihadist bomb factories west of Baghdad can no longer operate, our Arab affairs editor adds. However, there are fears the militants will revert to the guerrilla tactics they have used for so long. A suicide bomb attack on a checkpoint in the north of the city on Saturday killed at least five people, police said. Attacks on the square since 2011 have killed 180 people, ""often in the run-up to elections or just after the polls"",  Iraqi analyst Hisham al-Hashemi was quoted as saying by AFP. Their aim is to ""create chaos and exacerbate sectarian divisions"", he said. Other militant attacks in recent years have been even deadlier: InJuly 2016more than 300 civilians were killed and hundreds injured in an IS suicide truck bomb attack on Baghdad's Shia district of Karrada - the deadliest attack by a single bomber in Iraq's history InNovember 2016up to 125 people, many of them Shia pilgrims from Iran and Afghanistan, were killed in a suicide car bombing by IS at a petrol station in Hilla, south of Baghdad InJuly 2015a truck bombing in a marketplace at Khan Bani Saad, Diyala, killed up to 120; it was claimed by IS On11 May 2016multiple bombings in Baghdad targeted mainly Shia districts including Sadr City, killing 93 people; IS said it had carried out two of the attacks On17 May 2016three bombings across Baghdad killed 77, including 41 in Shaab district and 30 in Sadr City The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Iraq country profile Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Jakarta stock exchange walkway collapses,"This video can not be played Floor collapses at Jakarta stock exchange building A mezzanine floor has collapsed at the Jakarta stock exchange building (IDX), injuring dozens of people. Dramatic CCTV footage captured the moment of collapse, which sent a group of more than 30 students gathered on the mezzanine crashing into the lobby. The area was evacuated and cordoned off by police, but trading has now resumed. Police say 72 people were hurt and are being treated in three different hospitals in Jakarta, but there have been no fatalities. Police ruled out an explosion as a cause of the collapse Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told local media that some of the victims, who had injuries to their hands and feet, had been taken to nearby hospitals. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Police using dogs and riot gear have pushed journalists back from the lobby area where the roof collapsed. They say it was not a terrorist attack, but they are still investigating what caused the floor to collapse. Fifteen ambulances have left the scene carrying the injured, officers say. It happened during most people's lunch break so the building was quieter than usual, but there were still hundreds of people there. The Jakarta stock exchange is a grand two-tower building with a vast marble floor lobby. The Indonesian government has being pushing for more foreign investment, but today's chaotic scenes here are not the image they want to portray. Mr Argo told Metro TV: ""We are still investigating the cause, but for now our priorities are the casualties."" The incident happened shortly after 12:00 local time (05:00 GMT), according to a journalist from Metro TV who was in the building. Marlia Zein added that there was a ""loud banging"", leading people inside to ""immediately"" run out of the building. A student named as Alfita, who was on the walkway when it collapsed, told Reuters news agency: ""There was a rumbling noise but it wasn't an explosion. ""It was like something had fallen, and suddenly the floor we were standing on fell away."" The stock exchange has re-opened for the afternoon session, with exchange chief Tito Sulistio saying the system was ""not affected"". Floor collapses at stock exchange.

Countries warned UK could cut foreign aid,"This video can not be played Penny Mordaunt says countries need to be encouraged to invest in themselves The UK could cut its aid to developing countries that fail to invest in their own people, the international development secretary has said. Penny Mordaunt told the Daily Telegraph she ""won't invest"",externalwhen others should put ""their hands in their pockets"". The government is committed to spending 0.7% of national income on overseas aid and currently spends Â£13bn each year. Ms Mordaunt said she wanted governments of developing countries to ""step up and take responsibility"". ""If it chooses not to, that will inform our decisions around our funding,"" she added. Reality Check: How much does the UK spend on overseas aid? Foreign aid 'to be used for UK interests' ""We will continue to prioritise investments in saving lives, tackling under-nutrition, improving health and getting kids a quality education. ""But our focus will increasingly be on helping developing countries stand on their own feet and build sustainable health and education systems that they invest in themselves."" Under legislation approved in 2015, the UK government is legally required to spend 0.7% of gross national income on foreign aid. The UK first met the target on a voluntary basis in 2013, before it was made a legal requirement - although the level of spending has long had its critics in Parliament and the press. Ms Mordaunt, who replaced Priti Patel as international development secretary in November, backs the 0.7% target but says the public have ""legitimate"" concerns about the budget. She said: ""What they question is the weight and resource given to this task by their parliament and their government, especially when there are domestic needs and a national debt to address."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Mordaunt said the UK needs to invest money into ""trying to head off problems that will be a difficulty for us in the future"", such as pandemics. She added: ""The bar we need to set on aid spending is not just 'are we spending this money well' but could we spend it better in the national interest."" Her comments come two weeks after Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK's aid budget will be shifted to projects that promote its interests. He said the money will be ""more sensibly distributed"" to support foreign policy aims such as denying safe havens to Islamist militants.

"Scrap 'tens of thousands' target, MPs urge","The government should drop its target of reducing net migration to the tens of thousands, a group of MPs has said. Failure to meet it ""undermines"" public trust,the Home Affairs Committee argued,,externaland instead, immigration policies should consider the UK's needs ""and humanitarian obligations"". The MPs also said fears about the scale of illegal immigration have grown because of a lack of official data. The Home Office said the public was clearly in favour of lower immigration. Annual net migration to the UK is currently 230,000. The target of reducing it to tens of thousands was set by David Cameron at the beginning of the coalition government in 2010, but that figure has never been met. What do the latest migration figures reveal? Non-EU students 'not staying illegally' Food firms warn of EU worker shortage In its report, the Home Affairs Committee states that the target ""is not working to build confidence"" and does not reflect the public's view on how different forms of migration should be treated. The continued ""discrepancy"" between the target and reality has ""damaged"" the public's view of the immigration system, they argue. This video can not be played Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper calls for the migration target to be replaced The report recommends the government switches to a Canada-style model - which is run on a points system - that uses evidence to come up with a ""framework"" of targets and controls for different types of immigration. It also suggests: Setting up an annual migration report, which details the economic contribution from migration, impacts, and actions on skills and integration A greater focus on border enforcement, as well as criminal and security checks More weight be given to high-skilled workers in the immigration system The creation of a permanent resettlement programme for asylum seekers It adds that foreign students, who are currently part of the UK's net migration statistics, should be removed from the target altogether. To date, the government has resisted calls to take that step, despite arguments that the majority of students come to study and then return home - and make a significant positive economic contribution to the country. Meanwhile, a separate report by think tank British Future and campaign group Hope not Hate, submitted to the committee, said high-profile failures in immigration policy had eroded public trust. The report, titled National Conversation, interviewed public panels in more than 40 different towns and cities across the UK. It cited the failure to deport foreign nationals at the end of their prison sentences as one of the problems raised by the panel members. ""A reason that many participants feel migration flows are uncontrolled is that they do not trust the government to enforce immigration policy,"" it added. This video can not be played Theresa May: We still want to cut net migration to 'tens of thousands' The Home Affairs Committee said the lack of data on illegal immigration was perceived as the government showing ""indifference"" towards an issue of ""high public interest"". It urged ministers to produce an annual estimate of illegal immigration to reassure the public the issue was being taken seriously. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are making it harder than ever before for those with no right to be here to remain in the UK. ""However, we also believe that more analysis of the scale and nature of the problem of illegal immigration is needed in order to develop appropriate policy responses and reassure the public that the issue is being addressed seriously."" The spokesman said net migration had fallen steadily ""over the past four quarters"" and added ""the British people sent a very clear message in the EU referendum, they want more control of immigration and our borders.""

"Hard Brexit 'would cost Scots Â£12.7bn'Analysis by the Scottish government concludes a so-called hard Brexit would cost each Scot Â£2,300 a year.1m2 minutes agoScotland politics","Scotland's economy would be Â£12.7bn a year worse off under a so-called hard Brexit, according to analysis by the Scottish government. The figure is contained ina paper on the impact of UK withdrawal from the European Union,external. It calculates the cost to Scotland of the UK leaving the single market with or without a trade deal. The UK government insists it is seeking a Brexit deal that will work for the whole of the UK. And the Scottish Conservatives dismissed the analysis as ""completely over-the-top scaremongering"". Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon launched the paper with a speech in Edinburgh, alongside her Brexit minister Mike Russell. She said none of the options included was ""as good as staying in the European Union"", but said retaining single market membership would be the ""least damaging"" approach. She said: ""For the sake of jobs, the economy and the next generation, today we are calling on the UK government to drop its hard Brexit red lines so that Scotland and the UK can stay inside the single market and customs union."" Brexit: All You Need To Know Sturgeon call on indyref2 by end of year No 'Scotland-specific Brexit analysis' Brexit impact study 'will not be published' The Scottish government document, titled Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment, considers three potential outcomes for Scotland's economy when Britain exits the EU in March 2019. They include the impact of Scotland remaining within the single market and customs union or the UK securing a free trade agreement. The final scenario considered is the impact on Scotland's GDP figures if trade with the EU reverts to so-called WTO (World Trade Organisation) terms. That would involve the UK accepting tariffs on goods imported from, or exported to, the single market. The Scottish government concludes that if the UK was to pursue a WTO relationship, the cost to Scotland would be about 8.5% of GDP. That would be equivalent to Â£12.7bn a year by the year 2030, compared with current full EU membership, their analysis found. The paper says that would equate to a loss of about Â£2,300 per year for each person in Scotland. If the UK achieves a free trade deal similar to that the EU struck with Canada - the only model Ms Sturgeon said was likely if Theresa May's government sticks to its current red lines - Scottish GDP would be 6.1% worse off by 2030, compared with the baseline of EU membership. This would equate to Â£9bn in 2016 cash terms, or Â£1,610 per person. The paper estimates that retaining single market membership, which Mr Russell described as the ""least worst"" option, would see Scottish GDP 2.7% worse off come 2030, working out at Â£4bn in cash terms, or Â£688 per person. Ms Sturgeon said single market membership would be ""the number one priority"" for the Scottish government when phase two of the Brexit talks begin, urging Mrs May not to repeat the ""mistakes"" of previous talks. She said: ""It is time for the UK government to stop deluding itself, and misleading others, about what will happen if it maintains its red lines."" The first minister also called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to change his ""ridiculous"" position on Brexit and join other opposition groups in pushing for single market membership. The Scottish government has also argued strongly in favour of free movement of people, something Mr Russell said Scotland ""cannot do without"". The paper notes that due to ""demographic challenges"" facing Scotland, all of the increase in population projected over the next decade results from immigration. It states: ""Without immigration, the number of people of working age, working and paying towards public services in Scotland, is likely to fall."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the UK government was ""committed to working closely with the Scottish government as we negotiate our future relationship with the EU"" - but was critical of the analysis paper. He said: ""These figures fail to acknowledge that above all we need to avoid anything that might fracture the vital UK internal market, which is worth around Â£48bn to the Scottish economy - or four times more than trade with the EU. ""They also do not recognise that we're seeking a new deep and special economic partnership with the EU that works for Scotland, and indeed the whole of the UK, and is of greater scope than any existing agreement. ""At the weekend, Nicola Sturgeon made it clear her real priority isholding a second independence referendum in Scotland, not getting a good deal as we leave the EU."" Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins, meanwhile, accused the Scottish government of ""scaremongering"", saying the SNP had proved with their 2014 white paper on independence that ""their financial forecasts simply cannot be trusted"". Scottish Labour said the Tories' ""reckless and incompetent Brexit"" risked ""devastating our economy, jobs and public services"", and that the UK government had so far ""delivered nothing but uncertainty and attacks on hard-won workers' rights and devolution"". However, the Scottish Greens said it was actually Labour who were under pressure, saying it was ""disappointing"" to see them ""refusing to join us"" in arguing for single market membership ""and instead essentially choosing to back the Tories' job-destroying hard Brexit"". The Lib Dems also urged Labour to ""come on board and protect our UK and Scottish economies"". While backing the paper as ""worthwhile"", leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to ""drop the threat of an independence referendum"".

The first minister also called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to change his ""ridiculous"" position on Brexit and join other opposition groups in pushing for single market membership. The Scottish government has also argued strongly in favour of free movement of people, something Mr Russell said Scotland ""cannot do without"". The paper notes that due to ""demographic challenges"" facing Scotland, all of the increase in population projected over the next decade results from immigration. It states: ""Without immigration, the number of people of working age, working and paying towards public services in Scotland, is likely to fall."" Scottish Secretary David Mundell said the UK government was ""committed to working closely with the Scottish government as we negotiate our future relationship with the EU"" - but was critical of the analysis paper. He said: ""These figures fail to acknowledge that above all we need to avoid anything that might fracture the vital UK internal market, which is worth around Â£48bn to the Scottish economy - or four times more than trade with the EU. ""They also do not recognise that we're seeking a new deep and special economic partnership with the EU that works for Scotland, and indeed the whole of the UK, and is of greater scope than any existing agreement. ""At the weekend, Nicola Sturgeon made it clear her real priority isholding a second independence referendum in Scotland, not getting a good deal as we leave the EU."" Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins, meanwhile, accused the Scottish government of ""scaremongering"", saying the SNP had proved with their 2014 white paper on independence that ""their financial forecasts simply cannot be trusted"". Scottish Labour said the Tories' ""reckless and incompetent Brexit"" risked ""devastating our economy, jobs and public services"", and that the UK government had so far ""delivered nothing but uncertainty and attacks on hard-won workers' rights and devolution"". However, the Scottish Greens said it was actually Labour who were under pressure, saying it was ""disappointing"" to see them ""refusing to join us"" in arguing for single market membership ""and instead essentially choosing to back the Tories' job-destroying hard Brexit"". The Lib Dems also urged Labour to ""come on board and protect our UK and Scottish economies"". While backing the paper as ""worthwhile"", leader Willie Rennie urged the SNP to ""drop the threat of an independence referendum"".

The Sinn FÃ©in MP posted a video of himself in a shop with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head. It was published on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills murders, in which 10 Protestant workmen were shot dead by the IRA. The sole survivor of the attack said he would not accept his apology adding: ""I'll never forgive him"". Mr McElduff has said that he did not make a connection in his mind between the video and the massacre, but he accepted many people do not believe that. Analysis: Barrage of criticism never abated Survivor says McElduff video 'depraved' Sinn FÃ©in MP apologises over Kingsmill tweet Sinn FÃ©in suspended Mr McElduff from party activities for a period of three months last Monday. Alan Black, who was the only person to survive the 1976 attack, welcomed the resignation. ""I'm not on a crusade. I've done what I've done up to now to protect the memory of the boys and to try to protect their families,"" he told the BBC. ""But he did the right thing stepping down  - eventually.  I won't be speaking publicly about Kingsmills again unless there is some development at the inquest. ""As far as I'm concern the Barry McElduff incident is over now. But I don't accept his apology.

Ten workmen were killed in the 1976 atrocity ""Kingsmills was wrong, unjustifiable and sectarian. It should never have happened,"" he said. He said that the view that the video was intended to refer to the massacre would ""impede any reconciliation process"". Barry McElduff has consistently protested that he never intended to cause offence with his Kingsmills loaf video, and that its publication on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmills atrocity was just a terrible coincidence. With that in mind, his family and friends rallied to his defence and he must have initially hoped that his three month suspension would buy enough time for emotions to cool.

He called for ""a non-partisan candidate who will be a voice for victims to contest this seat against Sinn FÃ©in"". ""If a candidate emerges that allows cross-community support to coalesce around, it would send a strong message that this type of behaviour will not be tolerated,"" he said.

Thousands struggle with childcare websiteParents are struggling to get subsidised childcare they are entitled to due to continued web issues.8h8 hours agoFamily & Education,"Thousands of parents in England are struggling to get subsidised childcare as they grapple with a glitchy website eight months after it was set up. In some cases, money meant for fees has become stuck in tax-free childcare accounts, leaving some parents unable to pay their nursery bills. Others struggled to apply for or reconfirm their free childcare. The government says that fewer than 2% of the 320,000 parents who have opened accounts had encountered problems. It added that earlier teething problems had been put right with extra resources and insists the website is running smoothly for the majority of parents. But nursery and pre-school organisations say thousands of parents have experienced major problems using the HMRC-run website. They have had to devote hours to helping parents resolve issues through repeated calls to the telephone helpline, they say. And many parents have ended up relying on the goodwill of nursery bosses to keep looking after their children while they work, until compensation payments are forthcoming. It comes after problems in the spring and summer when parents struggled to claim eligibilityfor either the 30 hours scheme for three and four-year-olds or the tax-free childcare - the government's two key schemes aimed at making childcare more affordable. Am I eligible for 30 hours' free childcare? Diversity key to meeting childcare pledge Debbie Raylan, a volunteer administrator at a nursery in Nantwich, said she had been supporting parents who had money locked in tax-free accounts and who were unable to reconfirm their right to claim free childcare. ""One lady I helped, had to make over 100 phone calls, literally, to get the problem sorted. ""This lady was looking at either giving up her job or finding someone else to look after her children. This is real life, it impacts on people."" One mother of two, Kathleen Shields, told the BBC her children's tax-free accounts had been wiped, and that helpline staff could not say when they would be up and running again. Although, she was able to withdraw the funds she had paid in, she has been left more then Â£400 out of pocket for only two months' childcare costs as the government top-up cannot be received in the account. ""I would like to voice my disappointment,"" she said, ""and highlight how difficult this makes things for hardworking families - mine and the countless others impacted by this."" She is claimingcompensation. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said she had heard from too many members for these issues to be confined to ""teething troubles"". ""It is causing ongoing problems,"" she said. ""Too many nurseries are saying they have parents who are struggling both to register and reconfirm their eligibility, something they must do every three months."" She said it had taken months for many nurseries themselves to register, with one taking more than a year to have its details approved. ""Here, the parents who had signed up for tax-free childcare were unable to use this towards their child's place at that nursery."" One of the key issues causing problems currently seems to be linked to the three-monthly reconfirmation. In order to secure the government subsidy for the term that has just started, parents were required to reconfirm by 31 December. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: ""It's incredibly disappointing that the long-running problems with the government's Childcare Service still haven't been resolved. ""This is an IT system meant to support a flagship government policy and yet, more than eight months after its launch, we are still hearing reports of parents who cannot do the simplest things. ""This is understandably causing much anger and frustration, something not helped by the government's insistence that all is fine with the website despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary. ""The government must get a grip on this problem once and for all, and ensure that the system it is asking parents to use is actually fit for purpose."" Ms Tanuku added that her organisation had been flagging up these issues on a regular basis with HMRC and attending advisory meetings regularly. ""Despite reassurances from the HMRC, these complaints are too commonplace and we are sure this is the tip of the iceberg."" Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said problems seem to persist with the website despite HMRC saying it had resolved things. ""We've launched an inquiry into childcare, part of which will focus on the impact of these failures on the take-up of government initiatives that aim to make childcare affordable."" An HMRC spokesperson said: ""More than 250,000 parents have successfully reconfirmed their eligibility. Almost all parents receive a response within five working days, and most get their decision instantly. ""If any parent is having a problem reconfirming or needs to speak to us, they should call us on 0300 123 4097."" or Tax-free childcare scheme delayed Families hit by childcare website glitch HMRC acts over childcare site issues HM Revenue & Customs Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

""One lady I helped, had to make over 100 phone calls, literally, to get the problem sorted. ""This lady was looking at either giving up her job or finding someone else to look after her children. This is real life, it impacts on people."" One mother of two, Kathleen Shields, told the BBC her children's tax-free accounts had been wiped, and that helpline staff could not say when they would be up and running again. Although, she was able to withdraw the funds she had paid in, she has been left more then Â£400 out of pocket for only two months' childcare costs as the government top-up cannot be received in the account. ""I would like to voice my disappointment,"" she said, ""and highlight how difficult this makes things for hardworking families - mine and the countless others impacted by this."" She is claimingcompensation. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said she had heard from too many members for these issues to be confined to ""teething troubles"". ""It is causing ongoing problems,"" she said. ""Too many nurseries are saying they have parents who are struggling both to register and reconfirm their eligibility, something they must do every three months."" She said it had taken months for many nurseries themselves to register, with one taking more than a year to have its details approved. ""Here, the parents who had signed up for tax-free childcare were unable to use this towards their child's place at that nursery."" One of the key issues causing problems currently seems to be linked to the three-monthly reconfirmation. In order to secure the government subsidy for the term that has just started, parents were required to reconfirm by 31 December. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: ""It's incredibly disappointing that the long-running problems with the government's Childcare Service still haven't been resolved. ""This is an IT system meant to support a flagship government policy and yet, more than eight months after its launch, we are still hearing reports of parents who cannot do the simplest things. ""This is understandably causing much anger and frustration, something not helped by the government's insistence that all is fine with the website despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary. ""The government must get a grip on this problem once and for all, and ensure that the system it is asking parents to use is actually fit for purpose."" Ms Tanuku added that her organisation had been flagging up these issues on a regular basis with HMRC and attending advisory meetings regularly. ""Despite reassurances from the HMRC, these complaints are too commonplace and we are sure this is the tip of the iceberg."" Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said problems seem to persist with the website despite HMRC saying it had resolved things. ""We've launched an inquiry into childcare, part of which will focus on the impact of these failures on the take-up of government initiatives that aim to make childcare affordable."" An HMRC spokesperson said: ""More than 250,000 parents have successfully reconfirmed their eligibility. Almost all parents receive a response within five working days, and most get their decision instantly. ""If any parent is having a problem reconfirming or needs to speak to us, they should call us on 0300 123 4097."" or Tax-free childcare scheme delayed Families hit by childcare website glitch HMRC acts over childcare site issues HM Revenue & Customs Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

US plan 'slap of the century' - Abbas,"Mr Abbas (centre) spoke for two hours Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has described US President Donald Trump's Middle East peace efforts as the ""slap of the century"". At a meeting of Palestinian leaders, he stressed he would not accept any peace plan from the US after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. He also accused Israel itself of putting an end to the 1994 Oslo Accords, which began the peace process. Mr Trump has threatened to cut aid if the Palestinians reject peace talks. Speaking earlier this month,Mr Trump insisted recognition of Jerusalem took the hugely divisive issue ""off the table"" for new peace talks. Palestinians argue the move shows the US cannot be a neutral broker. Palestinian leaders are meeting for two days in Ramallah to come up with a concrete Palestinian response to Mr Trump's move. Mr Abbas had already rejected Mr Trump's proposals last month, after the UN General Assembly voted to express regret at US recognition of Jerusalem. Speaking to Palestinian faction leaders in Ramallah on Sunday, he said: ""The deal of the century is the slap of the century and we will not accept it."" ""I am saying that Oslo, there is no Oslo,"" he added. ""Israel ended Oslo."" Washington has for the past few months been drafting a new peace plan, though it has not divulged any details. On Sunday, Mr Abbas suggested Palestinians were being offered the village of Abu Dis, outside Jerusalem, as the capital of a future Palestinian state. ""What would you want, if Jerusalem were to be lost?"" he asked rhetorically,external, according to the Jerusalem Post. ""Would you want to make a state with Abu Dis as its capital?"" Ismail Haniya, leader of the Palestinian group Hamas, said last month that he had received information that the village was being mooted by the US as a future Palestinian capital.

LiveBusiness Live: Carillion reaction,"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Carillion files for voluntary liquidation Cobra committee meets Pension schemes go into rescue fund Government defends Carillion contracts MPs call for inquiry into collapse Chris Johnston That's all for the first livepage of the week. We usually finish with a look at Wall Street's closing prices. But markets are closed for a US public holiday - Martin Luther King day. Join us again tomorrow from 6am. Peter Kitson, Partner at law firm Russell-Cooke, says the procurement rules that govern public sector
procurement are the key to understanding what has gone wrong at Carillion. Almost all Carillion contracts have been competitively tendered under those procurement rules. The rules require public sector clients to investigate and possibly to exclude any tenderer whose bid is 'abnormally low'. One contributory factor here may be that Carillion has tendered at very low margins, possibly unsustainably low, in order to win these huge volumes of work. If such bids have succeeded, that can only mean either than the regulations themselves are ineffective or that public sector clients lack the confidence or the expertise properly to enforce those rules.

Britain's second biggest construction company has collapsed. What does it mean for the projects it worked on, and the schools and hospitals it worked for? Ministers have now ended the Cobra meeting on the demise of Carillion. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (pictured) says day one had gone ""pretty well"" as ""people were turning up to work, we have not had any reports of serious interruption to service delivery."" He says PWC, which is working with the official receivers, took ministers through the advice it is giving to employees and contractors at the meeting. It was also an ""opportunity for ministers to test what sort of concerns are being expressed and decide how we should best address them and provide the reassurance that people want"", Mr Lidington adds. Spot of other corporate news for a moment. The engineering giant GKN, already under pressure to begin takeover talks with Melrose, is facing another threat. It has emerged that US activist investor Elliott has a 1.7% stake in the company, which last weekrejected a Â£7bn bid from Melrose. Elliott, a hedge fund with a track record of intervening in takeovers, said it held the stake in GKN through contracts-for-difference (CfDs). A person familiar with the situation said that while Elliott believed the current offer from Melrose was too low, GKN should open discussions to ""find the right price and the right structure"".

 workers on private sector contracts for 48 hours after the company's collapse, but will not offer them the same protection as those in the public sector, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said. While the government is paying the salaries of Carillion's workers, he said those private companies employing Carillion would have just two days of government support. ""The position of private sector employees is that they will not be getting the same protection that we're offering to public sector employees, beyond a 48-hour period of grace,"" Mr Lidington told MPs. ""I think that is a reasonable gesture towards private sector employees,"" he added. Chancellor Philip Hammond and ministers including Nick Gibb, Stephen Barclay, Michael Ellis, Tobias Elwood and Jake Berry have arrived in Whitehall for a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee on the collapse of Carillion. The collapse of Carillion is a âwatershed
momentâ, says Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. ""Across the public
sector, the outsource-first dogma has wreaked havoc. Often it is the same
companies that have gone from service to service, creaming off profits and
failing to deliver the quality of service our people deserve. ""Labour will end the PFI rip-off, put an end the
private-profit-is-best dogma and run our public services for the benefit of the
many, not the profits of the few.â Mick Lynch, assistant general secretary of the RMT union, calls the Carillion collapse a disaster. ""There are thousands of sub-contractors, agency labour, there are suppliers who won't get paid. We're already being told that people aren't being paid,"" he says. ""The thing is collapsing around us and the government seems to have this laissez-faire attitude and they've got to take steps that assure people of their futures."" Times deputy political editor Sam Coates has been reading the leaders in today's edition of the Evening Standard, which is edited, of course, by one George Osborne. Allow Twitter content?

Former chancellor Lord Lawson has called for an independent inquiry into the private finance initiative (PFI) process following the Carillion collapse. He told the House of Lords he ""refused to have anything to do with it"" when in office in the 1980s even though Treasury officials were keen on it. Subsequent chancellors, especially Gordon Brown, were ""enthusiastically in favour"" because it enabled ministers to ""dress up"" considerable amounts of public spending off the public sector balance sheet. He said this was not a good reason for something which did not give good value for money for the taxpayer and introduced ""a degree of moral hazard which we see very much in the Carillion affair"". Lord Lawson said it was important to ""take stock and decide whether the whole PFI initiative should be proceeded with any further"" because there was enough evidence to show it was not good value for money or sensible for taxpayers.

The construction company, which employs up to 300 people in Northern Ireland, goes into liquidation. House of CommonsParliament Rachel Reeves, Labour chair of the Business Committee, Rachel says that despite  its financial outlook Carillion was ""year after year paying dividends to shareholders"", while its former chief executive was being paid Â£600,000 until October last year. She asks for a change to the rules so that ""companies cannot siphon off money to the detriment of suppliers, workers and ultimately the taxpayer"". Cabinet Office minister David Lidington says the official receiver will consider the potential detriment to those receiving pensions as well as employers and may impose penalties on individuals ""if there is evidence they have abused their responsibilities"". House of CommonsParliament Conservative chair of the Treasury Committee, Nicky Morgan, highlights the role of small and medium-sized businesses in the supply chain. She says they are ""concerned about meeting liabilities"" and asks what can be done so they do not feel ""pressure to keep paying the taxman"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington assures her the official receiver is making provision to assist suppliers and subcontractors, and points out a helpline is available through which MPs can raise queries on behalf of constituents. Very quick update on the London market: theFTSE 100ended the day down about 10 points at 7,769. But more interestingly, sterling has hit$1.38 against the US dollar. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital says the pound has now made up more than 60% of its losses since the Brexit referendum vote, when the currency fell below $1.20. ""Ultimately
this is a dollar story as much as anything else, and the greenback â while
rocking - looks oversold and may be poised to bounce back, which could prevent
sterling from breaking out just yet,"" he adds. Frank Field, chair of the
Work and Pensions select committee, comments: âCarillion took on mega
borrowings while its pension deficit ballooned. We called over a year ago for the Pensions Regulator to have mandatory clearance powers for corporate activities like these that
put pension schemes at risk, and powers to impose truly deterrent fines that
would focus boardroom minds. âIf government had acted
then, the brakes might have been put on Carillionâs massive ramping-up of debt
and it never would have fallen into this sorry crisis."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Ceiling collapses at Jakarta stock exchange,"This video can not be played Floor collapses at Jakarta stock exchange building A mezzanine floor has collapsed at the Jakarta stock exchange building (IDX), injuring dozens of people. Dramatic CCTV footage captured the moment of collapse, which sent a group of more than 30 students gathered on the mezzanine crashing into the lobby. The area was evacuated and cordoned off by police, but trading has now resumed. Police say 72 people were hurt and are being treated in three different hospitals in Jakarta, but there have been no fatalities. Police ruled out an explosion as a cause of the collapse Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told local media that some of the victims, who had injuries to their hands and feet, had been taken to nearby hospitals. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Police using dogs and riot gear have pushed journalists back from the lobby area where the roof collapsed. They say it was not a terrorist attack, but they are still investigating what caused the floor to collapse. Fifteen ambulances have left the scene carrying the injured, officers say. It happened during most people's lunch break so the building was quieter than usual, but there were still hundreds of people there. The Jakarta stock exchange is a grand two-tower building with a vast marble floor lobby. The Indonesian government has being pushing for more foreign investment, but today's chaotic scenes here are not the image they want to portray. Mr Argo told Metro TV: ""We are still investigating the cause, but for now our priorities are the casualties."" The incident happened shortly after 12:00 local time (05:00 GMT), according to a journalist from Metro TV who was in the building. Marlia Zein added that there was a ""loud banging"", leading people inside to ""immediately"" run out of the building. A student named as Alfita, who was on the walkway when it collapsed, told Reuters news agency: ""There was a rumbling noise but it wasn't an explosion. ""It was like something had fallen, and suddenly the floor we were standing on fell away."" The stock exchange has re-opened for the afternoon session, with exchange chief Tito Sulistio saying the system was ""not affected"". Floor collapses at stock exchange.

"President Trump: 'I am not a racist'He told reporters that he is the ""least racist person"" after row broke out over ""shithole"" remark.","This video can not be played The president made the comments to White House reporters at his Florida golf resort on Sunday President Donald Trump has denied that he is racist, after a row broke out over his alleged use of the word ""shithole"" to describe African nations. Mr Trump reportedly used the term last week during a bipartisan Oval Office meeting on immigration reform. He has now told reporters: ""I am not a racist. I'm the least racist person you have ever interviewed."" It is the first time the president has responded directly to the racism accusations. He made the denial to White House press pool reporters at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in Florida on Sunday night. The row broke out after lawmakers from both parties visited the president on Thursday to work on a proposal for a bipartisan immigration deal. In recent weeks the Trump administration has been withdrawing Temporary Protected Status (TPS) from a number of nationalities currently living in the country. Reports later emerged in US media that Mr Trump had asked during the meeting: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trump was said to have told them that instead of granting temporary residency to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, the US should be taking in migrants from countries like Norway.

This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Several senior Republican lawmakers at the meeting appeared on the Sunday shows to back up Mr Trump. Senator David Perdue said the reported slur was a ""gross misrepresentation"". On Friday, in the immediate aftermath, he had said he could not recall the conversation. But another Republican senator who was there, Lindsey Graham, did not deny the comments were made. ""Following comments by the president, I said my piece directly to him yesterday. The president and all those attending the meeting know what I said and how I feel,"" he said. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a senior Republican, said that Donald Trump's immigration comments were ""very unfortunate"" and ""unhelpful"".

South Africa's foreign office has summoned the deputy chief of mission at the US embassy to protest over the reported comments, although Ghana has denied media reports that it has done likewise. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) accused the president of falling ""deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of racism and xenophobia"".

Was Trump's alleged slur racist?,"This video can not be played 'Mr President, are you a racist?' US President Donald Trump's reported reference to Haiti and African nations as ""shitholes"" has sparked global outrage. But was it racist? Charlton McIlwain, professor and dean at NYU, and Drew Liquerman of Republicans Overseas, offer contradicting opinions on the matter. Mr McIlwain:Yesterday, Donald Trump said African and Haitian immigrants hail from ""shithole countries"".A little black girl and child of Haitian immigrants I know overheard. Unprompted, and defiant she responded to her mother: ""Donald Trump is a shithole!"" The word itself was foreign to her, but she intuitively understood the words were derogatory, demeaning - racist. In Trump's words she recognised a constellation of associations and inferences that Trump drew on to make this so. A statement is racist when it explicitly denigrates and/or asserts as true a negative, longstanding stereotype about an entire group of people, signalled by the colour of their skin. ""Shithole"" fits the bill in the vilest way. Those who manage with a straight face to say Trump's words were not racist no doubt will point out that he did not specify that black people from these countries are shitholes. But, he did not have to. We have longstanding and differential associations between the colours white and black. For much of our recent history, white has always represented all that is pure, clean, desirable. These associations are found in the language of our dictionaries, the one-time definition of Africa as the ""dark continent"",and the way we demarcated slaves from non-slaves throughout the slave trade. These associations define our beauty standards, animated through film and television's past and present. And, these colour associations still dominate our perceptions of leadership, images of success and attributions of worth and value. Because of these longstanding and pervasive associations between black and white, Trump need only connecta few dots to express his racism. Denigrate immigrants from countries like Africa and Haiti as shitholes with no value, then specify their opposite - people from ""Norway"".Even a little girl can see what the primary difference is between the two. This video can not be played Dick Durbin: ""Trump said these hate-filled things, and he said them repeatedly"" Mr Liquerman:While elite Washington media and political class is outraged over President Trump's reported remarks on immigration, it's unclear what he actually said (the White House has disputed Senator Durbin's account). President Trump's alleged harsh characterisation of Haiti is certainly uncouth, but nothing suggests it's racist. Haiti is indisputably the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and has serious disease and development problems, according to the WHO and UN. Those same organisations (and American leftists) consistently cite Norway as a prosperous, successful country. With that established, it's perfectly rational for any country - including the US - to prefer educated and high-skilled immigrants, and, unsurprisingly, those immigrants disproportionately come from wealthy, developed countries. If President Trump had suggested we turn away all Haitians - even the educated, high-skilled ones who would help our country and economy, as many immigrants from Haiti do - it would be a different story. But he has made clear that he wants help the economy by bringing in the best immigrants, wherever they may come from. Country of origin should neither make nor break anyone's immigration application, as there are high-skilled and talented citizens in every country who could contribute a lot to the US. But it's foolish to believe they are as prevalent in Haiti, where the literacy rate is around 60%, as they are in Norway, where the literacy rate is nearly 100%. Ultimately, this episode is a case study in Democrats' bad faith. Thankfully, informed Americans are too smart to fall into this trap, the coming reforms to US immigration policy will reflect the views of the Trump administration, the GOP, and the American people, not Washington insiders.

Shock over migrant remarks,"Mr Trump said he would prefer to take in migrants from nations like Norway, whose prime minister he met on Wednesday US President Donald Trump has drawn widespread criticism after reportedly describing African nations as ""shithole countries"" and suggesting immigrants from Haiti should be removed from the country. According to Democratic Senator Richard Durbin, who was present at the meeting, the president asked why the US should take immigrants from such countries, instead of from countries like Norway. Mr Trump's team did not initially deny the remarks. Mr Trump issued an apparent denial on Twitter on Friday, saying the language he used ""was tough, but this was not the language"". Full story: Trump 'in crude Oval Office outburst about migrants' TheUnited Nationshuman rights office called the reported comments ""shocking and shameful"". ""I'm sorry but there is no other word for this but racist"", said a spokesman in Geneva. TheAfrican Union(AU) said it was ""frankly alarmed"" by Mr Trump's statement. ""Given the historical reality of how many Africans arrived in the United States as slaves, this statement flies in the face of all accepted behaviour and practice,"" AU spokeswoman Ebba Kalondo told the Associated Press news agency. InBotswana, the US ambassador was summoned in a letter and asked ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country"". The US ambassador toPanamaresigned, according to Reuters news agency, telling the State Department in a letter that he could no longer serve in the Trump administration. InHaiti, Rene Civil, a left-wing activist, demanded the US president apologise ""before the entire African continent, as well as before Haiti, the country whose blood has been used by ancestors who have served with their minds and bodies to liberate the United States itself from slavery"". InNigeria,one resident in Lagos told Reuters news agency: ""Calling [every] African country shithole is really, really, very bad and I think every African country should just learn from this and probably just stay in their country and work with their resources."" InSouth Africa, ANC deputy secretary general Jessie Duarte said: ""Ours is not a shithole country and neither is Haiti or any other country in distress. And it is extremely offensive for President Trump to make statements about other countries that are really not complimentary of the US's position or policy positions on those countries."" 11 things we never said before Trump What promises has Trump kept as president? In theUK, Prime Minister Theresa May's office said Ms May did not share Mr Trump's reported characterisation of the nations. A spokesman declined to comment on ""alleged private remarks"", but asked if Ms May viewed the countries Mr Trump was referring to as ""shitholes"", the spokesman replied: ""No."" An immigration policy analyst in Washington DC made the point that immigrants fromNorwayactually did badly out of immigration to the US at the turn of the last century. Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute, said ""this shows that the 'loser immigrants' from yesterday's 'shitholes' tend to turn into excellent, rich Americans after a few generations while their countries improve substantially"".

Democratmembers of Congress said the remark clearly showed Mr Trump was racist. ""We always knew that President Trump doesn't like people from certain countries or people [of] certain colours,"" said Congressman Luis Gutierrez. ""We can now we say with 100% confidence that the president is a racist who does not share the values enshrined in our constitution."" Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky said: ""Just when you thought Donald Trump could not get any more racist, he digs down to an even deeper low."" SomeRepublicansspoke out about over the remarks. Republican Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who was born in Cuba and whose south Florida district includes many Haitian immigrants, said: ""Shame on him. It is reprehensible, it is disgusting, it is racist."" Mia Love, a congresswoman from Utah who is of Haitian descent, called Mr Trump's reported comments ""unkind"" and ""divisive"", and demanded an apology. African-American Senator Tim Scott, who says America is ""born from immigrants"", is quoted as saying: ""If these comments are the president's words, they are disappointing to say the least.,external"" Iowa Congressman Steve King, an immigration hardliner and staunch supporter of Mr Trump, spoke up for the president, telling him to ""hang in there"" and calling on him to end the Daca immigration programme, calling it by a derogatory name. ""Hang in there Mr. President @realDonaldTrump. If those countries aren't as you described, Democrats should be happy to deport criminal aliens back to them. &End #AnchorBabies, too.""

Carillion on the brink as talks continueCarillion's creditors are due to meet government officials in a last ditch bid to prevent collapse.7h7 hours agoBusiness,"Carillion's key creditors are due to meet government officials on Monday in a last ditch bid to prevent the construction giant's collapse. It comes as the chairman of a key group of MPs says there may need to be an inquiry into how public contracts are awarded to companies like Carillion. Labour and unions say warnings about the firm's financial woes were ignored. Carillion is involved in major projects like the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. It has debts of Â£1.5bn and a Â£587m pensions shortfall. Without a financial restructuring, the UK's second largest construction company, which has 43,000 staff worldwide - 20,000 in the UK - looks set to go into administration. Accountancy firm EY has been put on notice to step in to run the company if the talks fail. Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion's main bank creditors - including RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander UK - are owed about Â£900m. They have indicated an unwillingness to put more money into the company without direct intervention from the government. Talks involving government officials and company bosses were held throughout the weekend. The officials are expected to meet key creditors early on Monday, the BBC has been told. It is understood that the creditors want the government to guarantee some of Carillion's debt payments. But that would be, in effect, helping to bail out a private company. Carillion's crisis has put a spotlight on how major public contracts are outsourced to private companies. The Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration select committee said he may launch in inquiry into government procurement and contracting. Bernard Jenkin said: ""We would want to look at Carillion's relationship with Whitehall, as a test case. ""We have long been interested in projects and contracts which are 'too big to fail' and how Whitehall and the private sector must improve  how they work together."" Labour said it would seek answers as to why the government continued to place contracts with Carillion despite the company issuing three profits warnings that should have flagged up problems. ""Alarm bells have been ringing for over six months about the state of Carillion's finances, so the government must come forward and answer questions on exactly what due diligence measures were undertaken,"" said Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister. Carillion's banks are owed about Â£900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans. The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Labour peer Lord Adonis,who last month quit as head of the National Infrastructure Commission,tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed. New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""It [Carillion] is a going concern, it's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say it is a going concern. ""I would hope to see that the working capital they need will be there, working with their partners."" This video can not be played Bailing out Carillion 'would send the wrong message', Vince Cable says. Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. As recently as 2016, Carillion had sales of Â£5.2bn, and until July 2017, its market capitalisation was close to Â£1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just Â£61m. Carillion's problems stem, in part, from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East. Carillion is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence.

Ceiling collapses at Jakarta stock exchangeThe cause of the collapse remains unclear but there are reports of casualties.7m7 minutes agoAsia,"This video can not be played Floor collapses at Jakarta stock exchange building A mezzanine floor has collapsed at the Jakarta stock exchange building (IDX), injuring dozens of people. Dramatic CCTV footage captured the moment of collapse, which sent a group of more than 30 students gathered on the mezzanine crashing into the lobby. The area was evacuated and cordoned off by police, but trading has now resumed. Police say 72 people were hurt and are being treated in three different hospitals in Jakarta, but there have been no fatalities. Police ruled out an explosion as a cause of the collapse Police spokesman Argo Yuwono told local media that some of the victims, who had injuries to their hands and feet, had been taken to nearby hospitals. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Jakarta Police using dogs and riot gear have pushed journalists back from the lobby area where the roof collapsed. They say it was not a terrorist attack, but they are still investigating what caused the floor to collapse. Fifteen ambulances have left the scene carrying the injured, officers say. It happened during most people's lunch break so the building was quieter than usual, but there were still hundreds of people there. The Jakarta stock exchange is a grand two-tower building with a vast marble floor lobby. The Indonesian government has being pushing for more foreign investment, but today's chaotic scenes here are not the image they want to portray. Mr Argo told Metro TV: ""We are still investigating the cause, but for now our priorities are the casualties."" The incident happened shortly after 12:00 local time (05:00 GMT), according to a journalist from Metro TV who was in the building. Marlia Zein added that there was a ""loud banging"", leading people inside to ""immediately"" run out of the building. A student named as Alfita, who was on the walkway when it collapsed, told Reuters news agency: ""There was a rumbling noise but it wasn't an explosion. ""It was like something had fallen, and suddenly the floor we were standing on fell away."" The stock exchange has re-opened for the afternoon session, with exchange chief Tito Sulistio saying the system was ""not affected"". Floor collapses at stock exchange.

Koreas begin talks on Olympic art troupe,"Athletes, cheerleaders and an art troupe are expected to be part of the North's delegation at the Olympics North Korea has agreed to send a 140-member orchestra to the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea next month. The two sides are discussing plans for the North's delegation at Panmunjom village in the demilitarised zone (DMZ), also known as the truce village. North Korea announced last week that it would send a delegation to the Games in the South - easing months of tensions. Relations have been strained between the two Koreas over the North's missile tests and nuclear programme. North Korea has participated in several Olympic Games before, but never in South Korea. It boycotted the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive A history of North Korea at the Olympics The coach who helped North Korea's skaters qualify for the Olympics Details of the diplomatically complicated plan are still being ironed out. By Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring The Samjiyon Band is a long-respected nationalist orchestra that forms part of the Mansudae Art Troupe, a longstanding opera and music group that was founded in 1969. The group is largely made up of women musicians and most of its members play string instruments. They are known for giving classical song and dance performances and the Korean government says they play an important role in promoting friendship overseas. The Samjiyon Band of the Mansudae Art Troupe participate in a Lunar New Year performance They often perform for officials to mark the start of Lunar New Year, and have given numerous high-level performances at other key events in the last decade, including the three-year anniversary of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's army in December 2014. Many of their song lyrics speak of praise for the country's leadership - past and present. In December 2014, state news agency KCNA said ""performers expressed boundless reverence for Kim Jong-un"" and ""represented the high pride and self-esteem of the army and the people of the [Democratic People's Republic of Korea], who are blessed with the illustrious leaders generation after generation"". Monday's talks were thought to be focused on details including the number of performers, their travel route and their schedules, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Four delegates from each side were expected to attend, with the North's delegation including Hyon Song-wol, the leader of the popular all-female pop group, the Moranbong Band. Moranbong during one of their appearances on state TV Formed in 2012, all band members are reportedly hand-picked by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un himself. Their music is a synthesiser-heavy mix of Western classics and Pyongyang propaganda songs including ""We Call Him Father"" - an ode to Mr Kim. The changing line-up consists of singers and multi-instrumentalists, playing anything from electric guitars to synthesiser, violin and saxophone. In 2015, the band was wrongly rumoured to have been purged, even executed, when the members vanished from public view for several weeks. Monday's meeting was for working-level talks - with lower-ranking officials - rather than the breakthrough high-level talks of last week. At last week's high-level inter-Korean talks,the first in more than two years,Pyongyang said it wanted to send athletes, cheerleaders, an art troupe and a taekwondo team to the Winter Olympics taking place from 9-25 February in Pyeongchang. On Saturday, both sides will also meet at the International Olympics Committee in Switzerland, to discuss the details of North Korea's involvement. Only two North Korean athletes currently qualify for the Games - figure skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik. This video can not be played Here's five things you should know about the so-called 'truce zone', Panmunjom The North's involvement in the Games is seen as a good public relations opportunity for both sides, and a chance to lower geopolitical tensions between the two neighbours. South Korea has proposed that athletes from both the North and South march jointly together in the opening ceremony. North Korea is said to be ""positively"" considering this. The South has also suggested a unified Korean team for the women's hockey tournament. Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said the North was ""expected to respond to the proposal soon"". The two Koreas are still technically at war, as the 1950-53 Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Tensions have also been high due to North Korea's frequent ballistic missile tests. The latest test, on 28 November, sparked a new series of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans. US President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un have also conducted an increasingly bitter feud, with the US leader dubbing Mr Kim ""Rocket Man"" and both boasting about their nuclear capabilities. Last week, Pyongyang criticisedSouth Korean leader Moon Jae-in after he said Mr Trump deserved ""big credit""for the North-South talks. It indirectly threatened to pull out of the Olympics, with KCNA saying: ""[South Korea] should know that train and bus carrying our delegation to the Olympics are still in Pyongyang.""

Carillion on the brink as talks continue,"Carillion's key creditors are due to meet government officials on Monday in a last ditch bid to prevent the construction giant's collapse. It comes as the chairman of a key group of MPs says there may need to be an inquiry into how public contracts are awarded to companies like Carillion. Labour and unions say warnings about the firm's financial woes were ignored. Carillion is involved in major projects like the HS2 high-speed rail line, as well as managing schools and prisons. It has debts of Â£1.5bn and a Â£587m pensions shortfall. Without a financial restructuring, the UK's second largest construction company, which has 43,000 staff worldwide - 20,000 in the UK - looks set to go into administration. Accountancy firm EY has been put on notice to step in to run the company if the talks fail. Simon Jack: Carillion's uncertain future Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion's main bank creditors - including RBS, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Santander UK - are owed about Â£900m. They have indicated an unwillingness to put more money into the company without direct intervention from the government. Talks involving government officials and company bosses were held throughout the weekend. The officials are expected to meet key creditors early on Monday, the BBC has been told. It is understood that the creditors want the government to guarantee some of Carillion's debt payments. But that would be, in effect, helping to bail out a private company. Carillion's crisis has put a spotlight on how major public contracts are outsourced to private companies. The Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Public Administration select committee said he may launch in inquiry into government procurement and contracting. Bernard Jenkin said: ""We would want to look at Carillion's relationship with Whitehall, as a test case. ""We have long been interested in projects and contracts which are 'too big to fail' and how Whitehall and the private sector must improve  how they work together."" Labour said it would seek answers as to why the government continued to place contracts with Carillion despite the company issuing three profits warnings that should have flagged up problems. ""Alarm bells have been ringing for over six months about the state of Carillion's finances, so the government must come forward and answer questions on exactly what due diligence measures were undertaken,"" said Jon Trickett, the shadow Cabinet Office minister. Carillion's banks are owed about Â£900m, in the form of overdrafts as well as credit card facilities and other loans. The banks will likely show forbearance for a few weeks if a sustainable solution to this debt can be found. But they would also like the government to get involved when it comes to managing its key public contracts. This could mean that they would need taxpayers to act as guarantor on future payments from Carillion or that the important contracts to maintain schools and hospitals be taken back in house by Whitehall officials. The government is in a bind. Let Carillion fail and risk thousands of job losses, or bail it out and risk propping up a private company with public money - only a few months after it paid out dividends to its shareholders. Labour peer Lord Adonis,who last month quit as head of the National Infrastructure Commission,tweeted that the government has ""got questions to answer about propping up Carillion with contracts long after its problems clear. Looks like another Grayling bailout!"" Last summer, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling awarded Carillion part of the contract to build HS2, a week after the company issued a profits warning and its chief executive had departed. New Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday: ""It [Carillion] is a going concern, it's a very commercially sensitive situation so I wouldn't comment further than to say it is a going concern. ""I would hope to see that the working capital they need will be there, working with their partners."" This video can not be played Bailing out Carillion 'would send the wrong message', Vince Cable says. Alastair Stewart, a construction and property analyst at Stockdale Securities, said none of the solutions involving the government were ""particularly palatable"". ""The biggest intervention they could make is actually take a stake in the company as part of raising a large amount of capital, but they'll look back and look at the background of Lloyds and RBS,"" he said. As recently as 2016, Carillion had sales of Â£5.2bn, and until July 2017, its market capitalisation was close to Â£1bn. Since then, its share price has plummeted and it is now worth just Â£61m. Carillion's problems stem, in part, from a string of risky contracts which have proved unprofitable. It also faced payment delays in the Middle East. Carillion is the second largest supplier of maintenance services to Network Rail, and it maintains 50,000 homes for the Ministry of Defence.

UKIP leader 'won't go' over partner's texts,"Mr Bolton took over as UKIP leader in September UKIP leader Henry Bolton has said he will not stand down, despite calls for his resignation over racist comments reportedly made by his girlfriend. Jo Marneyapologised in the Mail on Sunday,externalfor saying black people were ugly and Prince Harry's fiancee, Meghan Markle, would ""taint"" the Royal Family. Senior party members have questioned Mr Bolton's judgement, calling his private life an ""unhelpful distraction"". Butin a video,externalobtained by the Daily Mail, he said he would not resign. Ms Marney, a 25-year-old model, claimed her texts, published by the Mail on Sunday, were taken out of context. More offensive comments alleged to have been written by her have appeared in Monday's papers. Mr Bolton is due to speak to the media on Monday morning. The former army officer took over as UKIP leader in September. If he were to quit, it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Who is new UKIP leader Henry Bolton? UKIP leader in relationship with model Meanwhile five UKIP members - including MEP Bill Etheridge and former leadership candidate Ben Walker - have drafted a proposal for transforming the party, which includes the removal of Mr Bolton in order to ""save the party from imminent insolvency"". ""One of our task-force is confident he has already persuaded Henry to do the right thing,"" the proposal reads. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Etheridge had previously said Mr Bolton, 54, should step aside ""quickly"", calling him a ""naive political lightweight"" whose personal life was distracting from policy. He cited several other complaints including a rise in membership fees, adding that Mr Bolton did not have the ""experience or the political nous or the correct advice to deal with the issue that he faces"". ""He must go, he must go quickly, he must go as quietly as possible,"" he said. Former UKIP leadership candidate Suzanne Evans told BBC News it was ""scandal after scandal with Mr Bolton"". Analysis:By BBC political correspondent, Alex Forsyth UKIP was riding high after the EU referendum result, but since then the party has struggled with internal divisions. When elected last September, Henry Bolton became its fourth leader in little over a year. Many had hoped he'd unite the party and restore its focus on Brexit. Now, as his future hangs in the balance, five UKIP members have come up with what they call a proposal for the party's transformation. MEPs Stuart Agnew and Bill Etheridge join Freddy Vachha, Ben Walker and Catherine Blaiklock to lead what they call an interim task force. It's stark in its assessment of UKIP's current standing - saying it doesn't deserve to run anything and is rightly perceived to be incompetent. The group suggests radical financial and structural changes - including an all-new managerial team, a new leader and a crackdown on rental costs and expenses. Whether their idea is adopted or not, most in UKIP recognise it needs a drastic solution to its current problems. The party chairman, Paul Oakden, said on Sunday that the leader had ""some difficult decisions"" to make. ""He intends on making those decisions today, and I'm sure whatever he does will be in the best interests of the party,"" he told BBC's Sunday Politics. Mr Oakden declined to give his own views on Mr Bolton's situation, but said the party needs to be ""behind our leader 100% in taking that battle (for Brexit) forward"". ""Whether or not the party decides it is willing to give that support to Henry is for the party to decide,"" he said. This video can not be played Henry Bolton tells the BBC's Daily Politics he did not want the publicity his relationship with a 25-year-old model attracted The Mail on Sunday said Ms Marney sent the messages three weeks before her relationship with Mr Bolton started. When a reply to one of her texts suggested her comments were racist, she added ""so what?"" and said she did not want other races invading her culture. In a statement to the newspaper, Ms Marney said: ""I apologise unreservedly for the shocking language I used. ""The opinions I expressed were deliberately exaggerated in order to make a point and have, to an extent, been taken out of context. Yet I fully recognise the offence they have caused."" Mr Bolton earlier replied to a party member online who urged him to call for Ms Marney to have her membership removed. ""She has to go or he and @UKIP are doomed if we let this behaviour happen in the party,"" the teenage activist said. In replying, Mr Bolton tweeted: ""Jo was suspended immediately upon us receiving this information."" Mr Bolton confirmed his relationship with Ms Marney in a letter to UKIP supporters earlier this month, after splitting up with his wife. He denied he had been involved in a ""clandestine affair"".

Women asked for sexual harassment stories,"Sexual harassment of women and girls in public spaces, such as schools and workplaces, is to face further scrutiny, under an inquiry by MPs. TheWomen and Equalities committee's investigation,externalfollows widespread allegations in the UK and the US. It will shine a spotlight ""on a problem that seems to be so routine in women's lives"", yet often absent in public policy, chair Maria Miller said. She said she hoped to identify steps government could take to tackle it. A YouGov survey published last year, revealed 85% of women aged 18-24 had experienced unwanted sexual attention in public places and 45% have experienced unwanted sexual touching. Reported sexual offences on trains have more than doubled in the past five years. Women and girls are also harassed, groped or assaulted on buses, in the street and in bars and clubs, Mrs Miller said, adding that she hoped to find out why it happens, whether the problem is getting worse and what more can be done. Schools told not to dismiss sexual harassment 'as banter' 'Half of women' sexually harassed at work, says BBC survey Third of teen girls sexually harassed online ""We know that sexual harassment can be experienced by anyone, but the evidence shows that it is overwhelmingly a problem that is perpetrated by men and boys against women and girls and forms part of the wider inequalities that women and girls experience - which is why we are focusing on this,"" she continued. The inquiry follows a report from the committee aboutsexual harassment in English schools, which led to the government making relationships and sex education compulsory and publishing guidance for schools on how to tackle sexual violence. How 'MeToo' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Photographers suspended amid sex claims The committee is interested in how age, ethnicity, sexuality and other characteristics affect women's experiences. It is acceptingwritten submissions online,externalfrom a range of sources such as representatives of victims, academics and employment lawyers until 5 March.

California mudslide toll rises to 20,"Rescue teams are continuing to search through the debris to find four people who are still missing Officials have identified 20 victims following flash floods and mudslides that hit Santa Barbara County in California on Tuesday. The body of 30-year-old Pinit Sutthithepa was found on Saturday afternoon, local officials said. Mr Sutthithepa's six-year-old son and 79-year-old father-in-law, Richard Loring Taylor, were found deceased on Tuesday. His two-year-old daughter, Lydia, is still missing. The body of 25-year-old Morgan Corey was found on Saturday morning. An 89-year-old man who had celebrated his birthday the day before is also amongst the dead. Rescue teams continue to search muddy debris for survivors. All of those killed died of ""multiple traumatic injuries due to flash flood with mudslides"", according to the Santa Barbara County Coroner's Office. It has released a list of the victims who have been identified and recovered so far. The victims include: Jonathan Benitez - 10 years old Kailly Benitez - 3 years old Joseph Francis Bleckel - 87 years old Martin Cabrera-Munoz - 48 years old David Cantin - 49 years old Morgan Corey - 25 years old Sawyer Corey - 12 years old Peter Fleurat - 73 years old Josephine Gower - 69 years old John McManigal - 61 years old Alice Mitchell - 78 years old James Mitchell - 89 years old Caroline Montgomery - 22 years old Mark Montgomery - 54 years old Marilyn Ramos - 27 years old Rebecca Riskin - 61 years old Roy Rohter - 84 years old Pinit Sutthithepa - 30 years old Peerawat Sutthithepa - 6 years old Richard Loring Taylor - 79 years old The youngest of the victims who have been located was three-year-old Kailly Benitez, who was one of four children killed as a result of the mudslides. Four people are still missing, local officials said. Those still missing are: John ""Jack"" Cantin, 17 Faviola Benitez Calderon, 28 Lydia Sutthithepa, 2 John ""Jack"" Keating, 53 The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been scorched by widespread wildfires in December. After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption. Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods. Five hundred extra emergency rescuers arrived over the weekend, joining more than 2,100 personnel from local and national agencies, including the US Coast Guard, the US Navy and the American Red Cross.

Police 'tear gas protesters' in Tunisia,"This video can not be played The government is seeking to calm days of unrest Police in Tunisia are reported to have fired tear gas to disperse a crowd of youths protesting against new austerity measures. A Reuters witness said young people aged around 20 were throwing stones at police vehicles and setting fire to tyres. The clash happened in Ettadamen, a poor district of the capital, Tunis. President Beji Caid Essebsi had given a speech there earlier on Sunday promising to increase youth employment. Joblessness among the young is considered a key indicator of a country's economic prospects, and Tunisia's stands at around 35%. The president's comments came as Tunisians marked the seventh anniversary of the country's revolution. The 2011 uprising that launched the Arab Spring led to the toppling of President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali after 23 years. What is Tunisia like? Who won and lost from the Arab Spring? Ben Ali, now in exile in Saudi Arabia, was convicted in absentia of embezzlement and misuse of public funds, and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment. Several hundred people joined rallies in Tunis on Sunday at the urging of political parties and the UGTT, a prominent trade union. Protests are a common feature each January in Tunisia, as people commemorate the 2011 rallies. A increase in value-added tax and social security contributions brought in at the start of January has led to heightened emotions this year. Protesters in Tunis mark the seventh anniversary of the toppling of President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali Protesters are calling for a review of the 2018 budget, and a push to combat corruption. Tunisia is the only country to dislodge its long-standing leader in the Arab Spring without descending into serious violence. But nine successive governments have failed to revive its flagging economy. Both peaceful protests and nocturnal unrest have been seen across the country over the past week. This video can not be played Violence at anti-austerity protests in Tunisia More than 800 people have been arrested, according to the interior ministry, which accuses them of theft, vandalism and violence. In 2011 the slogan ""Work, Freedom, Dignity"" rang out in the streets, and protesters have revived it in recent days. On Sunday, many gathered on Habib Bourguiba Avenue, a major site in the 2011 demonstrations. Hundreds of riot police were deployed there. An interior ministry spokesman said on Saturday that around 97 members of the security forces and civil protection units had been injured during the protests. The number of protesters injured was not given. There have been protests in all of these towns The government has tried to quell protests by unveiling a welfare package that includes better healthcare and an increase in aid for the needy. Officials say the 70m dinar ($28.5m) plan will help more than 120,000 Tunisians. But it's unclear how it will be funded. The government's tax and price increases were imposed as it seeks to placate international donors by reducing its budget deficit. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave Tunisia a $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn) loan on the promise it would enact financial reforms. The tourism sector, once a vital source of revenue, was damaged in 2015 by a wave of jihadist attacks and is yet to bounce back. As 2018 begins, inflation is at a three-and-a-half-year high and food prices are rising by 10% annually. Taxes on items like mobile phones, cars and the internet have also increased. Ordinary people are suffering financially. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Tunis, says the president's visit to the flashpoint district of Ettadamen was a bid to quell further unrest. He says the protesters are not only frustrated about the immediate tax increases, but more deeply by a loss of hope.

Trump plan 'slap of the century' - Abbas,"Mr Abbas (centre) spoke for two hours Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has described US President Donald Trump's Middle East peace efforts as the ""slap of the century"". At a meeting of Palestinian leaders, he stressed he would not accept any peace plan from the US after it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. He also accused Israel itself of putting an end to the 1994 Oslo Accords, which began the peace process. Mr Trump has threatened to cut aid if the Palestinians reject peace talks. Speaking earlier this month,Mr Trump insisted recognition of Jerusalem took the hugely divisive issue ""off the table"" for new peace talks. Palestinians argue the move shows the US cannot be a neutral broker. Palestinian leaders are meeting for two days in Ramallah to come up with a concrete Palestinian response to Mr Trump's move. Mr Abbas had already rejected Mr Trump's proposals last month, after the UN General Assembly voted to express regret at US recognition of Jerusalem. Speaking to Palestinian faction leaders in Ramallah on Sunday, he said: ""The deal of the century is the slap of the century and we will not accept it."" ""I am saying that Oslo, there is no Oslo,"" he added. ""Israel ended Oslo."" Washington has for the past few months been drafting a new peace plan, though it has not divulged any details. On Sunday, Mr Abbas suggested Palestinians were being offered the village of Abu Dis, outside Jerusalem, as the capital of a future Palestinian state. ""What would you want, if Jerusalem were to be lost?"" he asked rhetorically,external, according to the Jerusalem Post. ""Would you want to make a state with Abu Dis as its capital?"" Ismail Haniya, leader of the Palestinian group Hamas, said last month that he had received information that the village was being mooted by the US as a future Palestinian capital. Hamas was invited to the meeting in Ramallah but declined to take part. The city is one of the world's most contested sites. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important Israel claims the whole of the city as its capital. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, to be the capital of a future Palestinian state. Mr Trump, however, decided to formally recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital, despite being warned it could cause unrest in the region. He also said he would move the US embassy there from Tel Aviv, where all other nations have their diplomatic missions.

Trump Jerusalem shift puts counter-terror efforts at risk,"The US Fifth Fleet patrols the Gulf, providing a counterweight to Iran, but will US allies now be more wary of Washington? The recognition by US President Donald Trump of Jerusalem as Israel's capital has triggered more than just criticism from America's allies. Here in Bahrain, atthe annual Manama Dialogue security conference,external, there is an almost universal concern that the announcement will be a gift to the region's twin adversaries - Iran and the jihadists of al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State (IS). ""The president has lit a fire and left his Arab allies to deal with the blaze,"" said Elisabeth Marteu, Consultant Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). A former UK Special Forces officer, who asked not to be quoted, compared the announcement to ""throwing a hand grenade into a room with the pin removed"". Officially, the Arab Gulf rulers have always supported the Palestinian right to a homeland, recognising it as a long-running source of grievance for the whole region and a popular pan-Arab, pan-Islamic cause. Privately though, older members of the ruling families have never fully forgiven the Palestinian Authority for siding with Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Soon after that country's liberation I saw a piece of graffiti daubed on a wall in Kuwait City that read: ""Jerusalem is the eternal home of the Jews and I am a Kuwaiti writing this."" That was in 1991 and things are different now. Most of the Arab world's populations are too young to remember, or even care about, the invasion of 1990, but they do care about Jerusalem. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important It is the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina, and it holds a special place in many people's hearts. What does this mean for counter-terrorism? It means a risk on two counts. The first is the risk that people who might not be well disposed towards the West but were not planning to translate this into violent action may now think again. Hediya Fathalla, an expert on Gulf security and a former Bahrain government official, told the BBC: ""There are dormant jihadist mentalities who are sitting there thinking 'I'm not operational but I have jihadist feelings' so will this push them over the fence?"" The second risk is on the other side of the equation, namely that someone previously co-operating with US government agencies may now be less inclined to do so. What are the alternatives to a two-state solution? Why settlement issue is so difficult They may well have an excellent working relationship with, say, their counterpart at the CIA or NSA. But at the back of their minds there could now be a pervasive doubt over whether a US administration that has acted in this way actually has their interests at heart. Even at the very top of a country's hierarchy, in the Royal Court of Saudi Arabia, there must now be concerns that Saudi Arabia has chosen to work so closely with a White House that has just infuriated so much of the Arab world. Then there is Iran. The Islamic Republic continues to rival Saudi Arabia for power and prestige across the Middle East. It has long supported the twin anti-Israel militias of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian Territories. The overseas arm of its Revolutionary Guards Corps is called ""the Quds force"", meaning ""the Jerusalem force"". ""Iran has always used Jerusalem as a sort of narrative when stirring up Arab masses, it's what helped it align with Hamas... so I think it will definitely play into the hands of Iran,"" said Hediya Fathalla. Hezbollah and its leader Hassan Nasrallah are fiercely opposed to Israel Commenting this weekend in the online edition of IISS Voices for the International Institute for Strategic Studies, which organises the Manama Dialogue, Elisabeth Marteu also believes the announcement will help Iran's interests. ""This would be a great boost to Tehran, which is trying to repair its image after the Syria and Iraq conflicts,"" she writes. Over time, the damage to US relations with its Gulf Arab partners will be repaired. Washington is simply too big, too powerful and too important an ally to ignore. The US Fifth Fleet patrols the Gulf, providing a counterweight to Iran, while sophisticated US weaponry makes up much of the region's arsenals. But the recent US announcement is a reminder to rulers here that this White House administration is still capable of causing them intense embarrassment. Muslims protest worldwide against Trump.

Qatari royal 'held against will' in UAESheikh Abdullah makes a video statement saying the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi is holding him captive.6h6 hours agoMiddle East,"Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan A Qatari royal says he is being held against his will in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Sheikh Abdullah bin Ali al-Thani - who played a role in negotiating with Saudi Arabia during the Qatar diplomatic crisis last year - made the claims in a YouTube video released on Sunday. He claims he is being held by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince, who will be ""fully responsible"" if anything happens to him. A UAE official denied the accusations. In the video statement, the Qatari sheikh, a relative of the current Qatari emir, is seated in an armchair, talking directly to camera. ""I'm currently in Abu Dhabi, being hosted by Sheikh Mohamed. But this is not a hosting status. Rather, it is a 'holding' one. They told me not to move,"" he says. The Qatar crisis explained He continues: ""I'd like to inform you that if something happens to me, Qatar will be innocent of it."" Ali Rashid al-Nuaimi, who heads Abu Dhabi's education department and a counter-extremism centre, sent a series of tweets saying Sheikh Abdullah is free to go ""whenever he wants"". Sheikh Abdullah brokered a deal with Saudi Arabiato allow Qatari pilgrims into the country after Saudi Arabia and other countries in the region cut diplomatic ties with Qatar in June 2017. The video was published on a YouTube channel run by UAE 71 website. By Sebastian Usher, BBC Arab Affairs Editor This is a complete turnaround from last year when Sheikh Abdullah appeared out of nowhere as a significant player in the political feud pitting the Saudis and Emiratis against Qatar. He won a diplomatic coup in apparently brokering a deal with Saudi Arabia to reopen its land border with Qatar so that its citizens could attend the Hajj. A descendant of the founding father of Qatar, Sheikh Abdullah's branch of the royal family had been sidelined for decades. But suddenly he was everywhere, with legions of followers on Twitter. The consensus was that he was very much acting with the approval of the UAE and Saudi Arabia - with even some speculation that they might be considering him as a replacement leader in Qatar.

Alcohol ban on Sri Lankan women reinstated,"Many women in Sri Lanka see alcohol consumption as contrary to the nation's culture A move to grant women in Sri Lanka the same rights as men to buy alcohol legally has been overruled by President Maithripala Sirisena. He told a rally he had ordered the government to withdraw the reform, which would also have allowed women to work in bars without a permit. He said he had only found out about the move from the newspapers. The government announced on Wednesday it was amending a 1955 law, agreeing that it discriminated against women. Critics have accused the president of not taking gender equality seriously. ""This is not just about this archaic sexist law but the archaic sexist system in which this law is just one more tool of control,"" wrote one Sri Lankan blogger. Sri Lanka profile While the previous law was not always strictly enforced, many Sri Lankan women had welcomed the change. It would have allowed women over the age of 18 to buy alcohol legally for the first time in more than 60 years. A ban on alcohol being sold outside the hours of 09:00 to 21:00 would have been changed to allow sales between 08:00 and 22:00. Maithripala Sirisena has been president for three years Leading monks in the Buddhist-majority country had criticised the decision to lift the ban, arguing it  would destroy Sri Lankan family culture by getting more women addicted to alcohol. Saying he had listened to criticism of the government's step, President Sirisena told the rally he had ordered the government to withdraw its notification announcing the lifting of the ban. It came as no surprise to some as he runs an anti-alcohol campaign and has warned in the past that alcohol consumption among Sri Lankan women is increasing ""drastically"". However, commentators say the abrupt cancellation of the government's reform suggests there are differences within the coalition government. Mr Sirisena has encouraged women in the country to play a more active part in politics, boasting last year that his government had acted to ensure more women were returned at future elections. His apparent double standards over the alcohol issue drew anger from both women and men on Twitter on Sunday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
