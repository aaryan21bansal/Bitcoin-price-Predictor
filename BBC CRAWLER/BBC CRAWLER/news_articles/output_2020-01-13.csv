Roads have been closed including a stretch of the Belfast Road in Carrickfergus after part of the sea wall has collapsed. At Belfast International Airport - where there was some disruption to flights - passengers were stuck on one plane for two hours after wind speeds were too high to disembark. BBC presenter Holly Hamilton, who was on board, said: ""The captain announced we would be unable to disembark as the wind speed was at 46 knots and it needed to be a maximum of 40 to allow the steps to be brought out to allow passengers off. The captain invited the children to the cockpit to keep them entertained, said Holly Hamilton ""Everyone understood why it was necessary as the plane itself was swaying from side to side when we weren't even in motion. ""Most people were just relieved we'd landed safely as it was a pretty choppy landing."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five Labour leadership hopefuls reach next round,"This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Emily Thornberry will join four others in the next round of the contest to become Labour leader, after winning the support of enough MPs and MEPs. The shadow foreign secretary passed the threshold of 22 backers less than 10 minutes before nominations closed. She was helped by Clive Lewis quitting the race - with several of his backers switching to back her candidacy. Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips had already qualified for the next stage. Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, led the way with 88 nominations, ahead of Mrs Long Bailey on 33, Ms Nandy on 31 and the other two contenders on 23 each. Mr Lewis, the lowest-ranking candidate, pulled out after getting only five nominations. The deputy Labour leader post is also vacant after Tom Watson stood down from Parliament. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Which Labour contender is the most working-class? All five candidates - Angela Rayner, Ian Murray, Dawn Butler, Rosena Allin-Khan and Richard Burgon - have secured enough nominations to get through to the next stage of the race. Jeremy Corbyn's successor will be announced on 4 April. He is standing down after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row last month. Announcing his exit on Twitter, Norwich South MP Mr Lewis said the contest ""was never just about the Labour leadership but about our survival as a political movement and mapping our path to power"".

Both Nadia Whittome and Rachael Maskell, who were originally backing Mr Lewis, switched to support Ms Thornberry. Mr Lewis urged his opponents to take on board some of the ideas he had argued for during his short-lived campaign, including more working with other political parties and progressive forces. ""I now throw down the gauntlet to other Labour leadership candidates and ask them if they are brave enough, strong enough, to take forward some of the issues in my manifesto,"" he said. ""In the coming weeks I'll be watching their responses closely before deciding who to support."" Among the prominent figures backing Sir Keir are Tottenham MP David Lammy, who has been named vice-chair of his campaign, and former leader Ed Miliband, who said he had ""the best experience and vision to deliver 21st Century socialism for the country"". In a speech in east London, Ms Nandy urged Labour to ""think big and paint a broad canvass"" as it seeks to bounce back from its defeat. Although she accepted that Labour ""did not have all the answers"", particularly in Scotland, she said the party had a vital role to play in ensuring the ""cause of social justice is beating back divisive nationalism and winning"". ""I want to enable this country to become the country I've known we could be all my life but I've never seen,"" she said. ""I feel I can almost touch it."" Profile: Sir Keir Starmer Profile: Rebecca Long Bailey Profile: Lisa Nandy Profile: Jess Phillips Profile: Emily Thornberry As part of her pitch, Ms Phillips is calling for the creation of a universal childcare service, based on provision in some Scandinavian countries. She told LBC the last Labour government's offer of 15 hours free childcare a week had been a ""lifeline"" for her as a young mother at the time, but current level of provision was now ""very limited and needed massive improvement"". 13 January: Nomination period closes 14-16 January: Application period for registered supporters 15 January - 14 February: Second stage of nominations from Constituency Labour Parties (CLP) and affiliates, including unions 18 January: The first of seven scheduled hustings takes place in Liverpool 20 January: Freeze date for voting eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters 16 February: The last scheduled hustings is held in London 21 February: Ballot opens 2 April: Ballot closes 4 April: Special conference to announce results She said the state needed to think of affordable childcare as an economic catalyst for families, in the same way as transport and broadband connections, and not just  focus on whether a woman's earnings made her eligible for support. ""Universal free childcare will not only provide thousands and thousands of jobs to groups of people who are desperately in need of good, secure income, it will also enable masses more people to properly go out to work and make their families' lives better,"" she said. Asked who she would most like to serve under if she did not win, she chose Ms Nandy, arguing it was time for Labour to have its first female leader. Monday marks the close of the first stage of the nominations process. Candidates also have to win the support of 5% of constituency Labour parties or three affiliate organisations, two of which must be trade unions, by 14 February. Unison, the UK's largest union, has said it is supporting Sir Keir. Meanwhile, Sir Keir has written to party officials,externalcalling for leadership hustings to take place in ""each region and nation"" of the UK. At the moment, there are only seven hustings scheduled between 18 January and 16 February - in Liverpool, Durham, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow and London. He said the process of rebuilding trust in Labour must ""happen in communities across the country, not just in those we currently represent"".

Work gets under way on new Â£8m railway stationTrains will soon be able to stop at a Ceredigion village for the first time since 1965.,"The new Bow Street station is due to open later in 2020 Work is getting under way to build a new railway station that will see trains call at a Welsh village for the first time in 55 years. The new Bow Street station in Ceredigion is costing about Â£8m - funded by the Welsh Government and the UK's Department for Transport. It is due to open later in 2020, served by Cambrian Line trains between Aberystwyth and Shrewsbury. It follows a vocal campaignover the last decade to reopen the station. Wales' Transport Minister Ken Skates said: ""Our vision for railways includes the opening of new stations and the improvement of connectivity across all regions in Wales. ""This is the beginning of delivering that ambition."" The original Bow Street station closed in 1965 - and is now the site of a builders' merchant The original station was closed as part of the Beeching cuts in the 1960s that saw the rail network in Wales decimated. The new station will be built south of the old site, which is now home to a builders' merchant. The scheme is being delivered by Transport for Wales (TfW), Network Rail and Ceredigion council. Fifty years of Beeching's rail cuts Ticket to ride: Why prices vary so much Reality check: When is a train on time? TfW chief executive James Price said it was the first station the organisation was building since taking over the Wales and Borders rail service.

"YouTubers face Â£4,600 bill over 'meme' video reviewsTwo YouTubers have been charged $6,000 (Â£4,600) over the use of four clips in their videos.","Above is a still taken from one of the four videos at the centre of the controversy Two YouTubers have been told to pay $6,000 (Â£4,600) or risk losing their YouTube channel completely. MxR and Potastic Panda are known for making videos where they react to memes and other online content. But it turns out four videos they watched have been bought up by a media company, which has slapped them with a bill for infringing its copyright. And unless they pay, their channel could now be removed due to the nuances of YouTube's copyright system. A channel receives a strike against it if a copyright owner formally notifies YouTube that a copyright infringement has taken place. Receiving three strikes,according to Google,external, results in a YouTube channel being ""subject to termination"". MxR Plays is a YouTube channel which often involves 'reaction videos' - where people film themselves reacting to anything from memes tomovie trailers. MxR and Potastic Panda, the YouTubers who host the channel, say they have received four copyright claims in the same bill from Jukin Media, with Google yet to be notified. Their joint channel has 840,000 subscribers - and MxR has a personal following of more than two million. MxR tweeted his concerns that because of the 'three strikes' rule, if he doesn't pay up Jukin Media could contact Google with all four claims at once and potentially ""take down"" the channel. MxR lamented that just one of the couple's videos will cost them $3,000 (Â£2,300) because it contained footage from two Jukin Media clips. ""Today we got hit with a huge bill of $6,000,"" said MxR in a YouTube video viewed 1.3 million times. ""I think it's because in the past we've paid them about $2,000 (Â£1,500). ""If you don't pay they'll start striking your channel - they'll basically remove our channel if we don't pay them."" YouTube's copyright claim system abused by extorters Mark Hamill supports Star Wars superfan's emotional reaction video SpongeBob SquarePants fan claims Nickelodeon copied art He said that the couple do a ""very thorough search"" to see if the content in their videos is already owned by a media company, but it is not always easy. ""Sometimes they are videos where it's just a cat,"" he said, ""and there's really nothing you can search for. ""You end up having to search through 40 pages of videos and sometimes you miss one of them. If they treat every YouTuber like this, thousands of channels will be deleted."" Jukin Media, the company which owns the four videos, has responded in a lengthy social media post, claiming the YouTubers are ""making money off of videos that don't belong to you"". ""As we've mentioned repeatedly,""the Jukin Media statement reads,external, ""you can completely avoid any issues related to copyright by simply licensing videos on our website. ""In effect, you're taking other peoples' videos without asking them, then posting them to your channel and making money off of them. ""We never want to issue copyright strikes - we have a duty to do so to protect the copyright of the creators who have signed with us."" Leonard J. French is a copyright lawyer based in the United States who is also a YouTuber with more than 100,000 subscribers. He told the BBC that the question being brought up by commenters online is whether the YouTubers should pay at all - or if their video falls under the legal principle known as fair use. ""It's very possible that MxR Plays are not making a fair use,"" he said. ""But I and my fellow attorneys don't actually know how a judge or jury would find if this went to a trial because fair use is such an in-depth analysis. ""It's right on the line. Did this channel make enough additional commentary or criticism to overcome the hurdles to fair use, or did they just republish the original material without adding enough transformative content to make it a new material?

He said that according to US copyright law (specifically 17 U.S.C. section 106-7), there are four points which need to be addressed to ascertain whether something qualifies as fair use or not. How to tell if your video might qualify as fair use according to Leonard J. French The copyrighted part of the video has been transformed into something new, such as commentary or criticism The original copyrighted work is not being used for profit, as opposed to being used for commercial purposes A very small proportion of the original copyrighted work has been used (such as a single frame from a video), with more original content added The video has not usurped the market - meaning people do not need to watch the original anymore Leonard said that while $6,000 may seem like a lot, it could potentially be a lot more if the issue ever went to court. ""As a copyright attorney working in this field,"" he said, ""I can say this is a normal demand and may even be a reasonable demand. ""But there are different ways to calculate damages in the US. If Jukin Media has registered the copyrights before making this claim, they could get damages up to $150,000 (Â£115,000) in court. ""If they have not registered the copyrights, they would only be able to claim actual damages, which are the original fee for the video's use ($49/Â£37) plus attorney's fees.

Flybe in talks to delay air passenger duty bill,"Flybe says air passenger duty unfairly burdens its domestic customers The government is considering measures including short-term funding to save Flybe from collapse. This is in addition to a potential cut in air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal flights outside London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" about the importance of the airline. However, environmental groups said a cut in APD would be ""reckless"". The prime minister told the BBC that it was ""not for government"" to step in and save companies that run into trouble. But he added: ""We see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole of the United Kingdom."" The airline carries about eight million passengers a year from airports including Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Belfast City, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said Flybe was ""very important not just to our airport but to regions, to nations and to island communities across the UK"". ""They provide lifeline services to destinations across the rest of the UK that simply are not replicated by either other airlines or convenient and affordable train services."" Regular Flybe passengers have also expressed their concern,with many describing its routes as ""vital"". Are you affected? Please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Nick Lake, 39, who works for a property development company, said he uses Flybe at least once a week to fly between Manchester and Edinburgh and ""would be devastated if they went under"". The UK government is considering a range of measures to help the Exeter-based company. These include providing short-term funding to Flybe, using government money that is available to companies for investment purposes and which does not breach EU rules on state aid. It is understood that Flybe's owners would also be required to invest tens of millions of pounds into the company as part of any deal. A cut to air passenger duty (APD) on domestic routes is also being considered. This is expected to be applied industry-wide and to be announced at the Budget in March. The change would allow Flybe to defer its tax bill, design a rescue plan, and secure more than 2,000 jobs. Improving connectivity outside of London was a key Conservative manifesto pledge and at least one of Flybe's routes, between Newquay and London, is subsidised by the government. Sky News reported that,externalthe possible deal over air passenger duty could see Flybe defer a payment of more than Â£100m for three years. It's also thought any turnaround plan would be financed by a consortium led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which rescued the airline a year ago. Virgin Atlantic, Southend Airport-owner Stobart Group and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners paid Â£2.8m for the airline and agreed to invest Â£100m in the loss-making business. Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer."" BBC business editor Simon Jack said a cut to air passenger duty could create what Boris Johnson has previously described as a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would lead struggling companies to believe they could rely on the government to help them if they got into financial difficulties. As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar.

"Five Labour leadership hopefuls reach next roundEmily Thornberry gains enough support just before nominations close, but Clive Lewis withdraws.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Emily Thornberry will join four others in the next round of the contest to become Labour leader, after winning the support of enough MPs and MEPs. The shadow foreign secretary passed the threshold of 22 backers less than 10 minutes before nominations closed. She was helped by Clive Lewis quitting the race - with several of his backers switching to back her candidacy. Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips had already qualified for the next stage. Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, led the way with 88 nominations, ahead of Mrs Long Bailey on 33, Ms Nandy on 31 and the other two contenders on 23 each. Mr Lewis, the lowest-ranking candidate, pulled out after getting only five nominations. The deputy Labour leader post is also vacant after Tom Watson stood down from Parliament. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Which Labour contender is the most working-class? All five candidates - Angela Rayner, Ian Murray, Dawn Butler, Rosena Allin-Khan and Richard Burgon - have secured enough nominations to get through to the next stage of the race. Jeremy Corbyn's successor will be announced on 4 April. He is standing down after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row last month. Announcing his exit on Twitter, Norwich South MP Mr Lewis said the contest ""was never just about the Labour leadership but about our survival as a political movement and mapping our path to power"".

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Both Nadia Whittome and Rachael Maskell, who were originally backing Mr Lewis, switched to support Ms Thornberry. Mr Lewis urged his opponents to take on board some of the ideas he had argued for during his short-lived campaign, including more working with other political parties and progressive forces. ""I now throw down the gauntlet to other Labour leadership candidates and ask them if they are brave enough, strong enough, to take forward some of the issues in my manifesto,"" he said. ""In the coming weeks I'll be watching their responses closely before deciding who to support."" Among the prominent figures backing Sir Keir are Tottenham MP David Lammy, who has been named vice-chair of his campaign, and former leader Ed Miliband, who said he had ""the best experience and vision to deliver 21st Century socialism for the country"". In a speech in east London, Ms Nandy urged Labour to ""think big and paint a broad canvass"" as it seeks to bounce back from its defeat. Although she accepted that Labour ""did not have all the answers"", particularly in Scotland, she said the party had a vital role to play in ensuring the ""cause of social justice is beating back divisive nationalism and winning"". ""I want to enable this country to become the country I've known we could be all my life but I've never seen,"" she said. ""I feel I can almost touch it."" Profile: Sir Keir Starmer Profile: Rebecca Long Bailey Profile: Lisa Nandy Profile: Jess Phillips Profile: Emily Thornberry As part of her pitch, Ms Phillips is calling for the creation of a universal childcare service, based on provision in some Scandinavian countries. She told LBC the last Labour government's offer of 15 hours free childcare a week had been a ""lifeline"" for her as a young mother at the time, but current level of provision was now ""very limited and needed massive improvement"". 13 January: Nomination period closes 14-16 January: Application period for registered supporters 15 January - 14 February: Second stage of nominations from Constituency Labour Parties (CLP) and affiliates, including unions 18 January: The first of seven scheduled hustings takes place in Liverpool 20 January: Freeze date for voting eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters 16 February: The last scheduled hustings is held in London 21 February: Ballot opens 2 April: Ballot closes 4 April: Special conference to announce results She said the state needed to think of affordable childcare as an economic catalyst for families, in the same way as transport and broadband connections, and not just  focus on whether a woman's earnings made her eligible for support. ""Universal free childcare will not only provide thousands and thousands of jobs to groups of people who are desperately in need of good, secure income, it will also enable masses more people to properly go out to work and make their families' lives better,"" she said. Asked who she would most like to serve under if she did not win, she chose Ms Nandy, arguing it was time for Labour to have its first female leader. Monday marks the close of the first stage of the nominations process. Candidates also have to win the support of 5% of constituency Labour parties or three affiliate organisations, two of which must be trade unions, by 14 February. Unison, the UK's largest union, has said it is supporting Sir Keir. Meanwhile, Sir Keir has written to party officials,externalcalling for leadership hustings to take place in ""each region and nation"" of the UK. At the moment, there are only seven hustings scheduled between 18 January and 16 February - in Liverpool, Durham, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow and London. He said the process of rebuilding trust in Labour must ""happen in communities across the country, not just in those we currently represent"".

Flybe in talks to delay air passenger duty billA deferment is one option the airline is discussing with the government to secure a rescue deal.Business,"Flybe says air passenger duty unfairly burdens its domestic customers The government is considering measures including short-term funding to save Flybe from collapse. This is in addition to a potential cut in air passenger duty (APD) on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operates more than half of UK internal flights outside London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the BBC there was ""no doubt"" about the importance of the airline. However, environmental groups said a cut in APD would be ""reckless"". The prime minister told the BBC that it was ""not for government"" to step in and save companies that run into trouble. But he added: ""We see the importance of Flybe in delivering connectivity across the whole of the United Kingdom."" The airline carries about eight million passengers a year from airports including Birmingham, Manchester, Southampton, Belfast City, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Tim Jeans, chairman of Cornwall Airport, said Flybe was ""very important not just to our airport but to regions, to nations and to island communities across the UK"". ""They provide lifeline services to destinations across the rest of the UK that simply are not replicated by either other airlines or convenient and affordable train services."" Regular Flybe passengers have also expressed their concern,with many describing its routes as ""vital"". Are you affected? Please share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Nick Lake, 39, who works for a property development company, said he uses Flybe at least once a week to fly between Manchester and Edinburgh and ""would be devastated if they went under"". The UK government is considering a range of measures to help the Exeter-based company. These include providing short-term funding to Flybe, using government money that is available to companies for investment purposes and which does not breach EU rules on state aid. It is understood that Flybe's owners would also be required to invest tens of millions of pounds into the company as part of any deal. A cut to air passenger duty (APD) on domestic routes is also being considered. This is expected to be applied industry-wide and to be announced at the Budget in March. The change would allow Flybe to defer its tax bill, design a rescue plan, and secure more than 2,000 jobs. Improving connectivity outside of London was a key Conservative manifesto pledge and at least one of Flybe's routes, between Newquay and London, is subsidised by the government. Sky News reported that,externalthe possible deal over air passenger duty could see Flybe defer a payment of more than Â£100m for three years. It's also thought any turnaround plan would be financed by a consortium led by Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic, which rescued the airline a year ago. Virgin Atlantic, Southend Airport-owner Stobart Group and hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners paid Â£2.8m for the airline and agreed to invest Â£100m in the loss-making business. Flybe has refused to comment on talks over a rescue. Air passenger duty (APD) is charged,externalon all passenger flights from UK airports, excluding the Scottish Highlands and Islands region. The amount depends on the destination and class of travel. Under current rules, passengers on domestic flights pay Â£13 in APD for a single journey, with higher rates for longer flights and premium cabins. Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around 'Flybe's collapse would be a disaster' Flybe is a long-time critic of APD, which it says disproportionately burdens its domestic customers because they have to pay it each time they take off from a UK airport. Changes to air passenger duty could reduce the billions of pounds the charge generates for the government, which is expected to reach Â£3.7bn this financial year,according to Office for Budget Responsibility,external. Doug Parr, chief scientist at environmental campaign group Greenpeace, said cutting air passenger duty would be ""a shocking decision"". ""They cannot claim to be a global leader on climate one day, then making the most carbon-intensive kind of travel - flying - cheaper the next. More than 2,000 jobs are at risk if Flybe fails to secure funding Jenny Bates, a campaigner for the Friends of the Earth charity, told the BBC any cut to air passenger duty would be ""reckless"". Ms Bates said: ""These short UK trips are exactly the ones we need to avoid in the drive to cut aviation climate emissions needed to prevent climate breakdown. ""Instead the government could invest more in our rail system, helping make such trips more affordable."" The proposed cut in air passenger duty has shocked many commentators. AA president Edmund King said car drivers were taxed much higher than air passengers. He calculates that for every 100 miles driven, an average car incurs around Â£10 in tax. So driving from Newcastle to Newquay would cost about Â£35 in tax. In comparison an air traveller would pay just Â£13 in air passenger duty. Meanwhile, the Heathrow campaign group HACAN said it believed many of Flybe's routes were simply commercially unviable, with insufficient business traffic. They doubted cutting the tax would make much difference. But the biggest outcry has come from environmentalists. Aviation is the fastest-growing source of the emissions that are heating the planet, and there are calls for the government to make it more expensive, not cheaper. Former transport secretary and Labour peer Lord Adonis said that if the tax was cut, it was likely that general taxes would have to be raised to make up for the lost revenue. He added: ""There may be a case for subsidising more routes. If they are vitally necessary there is a case for subsidising them... but not to give Virgin and BA a free lunch at the expense of the general tax payer.""

"YouTubers face Â£4,600 bill over 'meme' video reviews","Above is a still taken from one of the four videos at the centre of the controversy Two YouTubers have been told to pay $6,000 (Â£4,600) or risk losing their YouTube channel completely. MxR and Potastic Panda are known for making videos where they react to memes and other online content. But it turns out four videos they watched have been bought up by a media company, which has slapped them with a bill for infringing its copyright. And unless they pay, their channel could now be removed due to the nuances of YouTube's copyright system. A channel receives a strike against it if a copyright owner formally notifies YouTube that a copyright infringement has taken place. Receiving three strikes,according to Google,external, results in a YouTube channel being ""subject to termination"". MxR Plays is a YouTube channel which often involves 'reaction videos' - where people film themselves reacting to anything from memes tomovie trailers. MxR and Potastic Panda, the YouTubers who host the channel, say they have received four copyright claims in the same bill from Jukin Media, with Google yet to be notified. Their joint channel has 840,000 subscribers - and MxR has a personal following of more than two million. MxR tweeted his concerns that because of the 'three strikes' rule, if he doesn't pay up Jukin Media could contact Google with all four claims at once and potentially ""take down"" the channel. MxR lamented that just one of the couple's videos will cost them $3,000 (Â£2,300) because it contained footage from two Jukin Media clips. ""Today we got hit with a huge bill of $6,000,"" said MxR in a YouTube video viewed 1.3 million times. ""I think it's because in the past we've paid them about $2,000 (Â£1,500). ""If you don't pay they'll start striking your channel - they'll basically remove our channel if we don't pay them."" YouTube's copyright claim system abused by extorters Mark Hamill supports Star Wars superfan's emotional reaction video SpongeBob SquarePants fan claims Nickelodeon copied art He said that the couple do a ""very thorough search"" to see if the content in their videos is already owned by a media company, but it is not always easy. ""Sometimes they are videos where it's just a cat,"" he said, ""and there's really nothing you can search for. ""You end up having to search through 40 pages of videos and sometimes you miss one of them. If they treat every YouTuber like this, thousands of channels will be deleted."" Jukin Media, the company which owns the four videos, has responded in a lengthy social media post, claiming the YouTubers are ""making money off of videos that don't belong to you"". ""As we've mentioned repeatedly,""the Jukin Media statement reads,external, ""you can completely avoid any issues related to copyright by simply licensing videos on our website. ""In effect, you're taking other peoples' videos without asking them, then posting them to your channel and making money off of them. ""We never want to issue copyright strikes - we have a duty to do so to protect the copyright of the creators who have signed with us."" Leonard J. French is a copyright lawyer based in the United States who is also a YouTuber with more than 100,000 subscribers. He told the BBC that the question being brought up by commenters online is whether the YouTubers should pay at all - or if their video falls under the legal principle known as fair use. ""It's very possible that MxR Plays are not making a fair use,"" he said. ""But I and my fellow attorneys don't actually know how a judge or jury would find if this went to a trial because fair use is such an in-depth analysis. ""It's right on the line. Did this channel make enough additional commentary or criticism to overcome the hurdles to fair use, or did they just republish the original material without adding enough transformative content to make it a new material? ""That's the difference between no damages and massive damages with nothing in between."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

He said that according to US copyright law (specifically 17 U.S.C. section 106-7), there are four points which need to be addressed to ascertain whether something qualifies as fair use or not. How to tell if your video might qualify as fair use according to Leonard J. French The copyrighted part of the video has been transformed into something new, such as commentary or criticism The original copyrighted work is not being used for profit, as opposed to being used for commercial purposes A very small proportion of the original copyrighted work has been used (such as a single frame from a video), with more original content added The video has not usurped the market - meaning people do not need to watch the original anymore Leonard said that while $6,000 may seem like a lot, it could potentially be a lot more if the issue ever went to court. ""As a copyright attorney working in this field,"" he said, ""I can say this is a normal demand and may even be a reasonable demand. ""But there are different ways to calculate damages in the US. If Jukin Media has registered the copyrights before making this claim, they could get damages up to $150,000 (Â£115,000) in court. ""If they have not registered the copyrights, they would only be able to claim actual damages, which are the original fee for the video's use ($49/Â£37) plus attorney's fees. ""Legally it's not an issue to make a demand for $1,500, but it seems morally outrageous to go after a channel like this for that much money per video.""

Mystery cash bundle donors come forward,"The benefactors would deliberately leave the money where it would be found by people in need Bundles of cash found on the streets of a former pit village were left by two Good Samaritans, police have said. Since 2014 there have been at least 12 instances ofmoney being found in Blackhall Colliery,County Durham, usually amounting to Â£2,000 in Â£20 notes. The money was always left in plain sight and often on pavements. The benefactors told police they had received unexpected windfalls and wanted to give something back. One of the Good Samaritans - who both wish to remain anonymous - said she felt an ""emotional connection"" to the former pit village after being helped by a resident and wanted to ""repay the kindness she received"". Over the past six yearsÂ£26,000 has been handed in by village residents. Durham Police said all the previous bundles had been returned to the finder. Residents handing in the cash have been praised for their honesty The benefactors would deliberately leave the money where it would be found by people in need, including pensioners, and they would then often wait to make sure it was picked up. Det Con John Forster, of Durham Police, said he was ""really pleased"" the mystery had been solved. He added: ""I am glad we can now definitively rule out the money being linked to any crime or a vulnerable person. ""I would like to thank the Good Samaritans for getting in touch and also to the honest residents of Blackhall who have continued to hand the money in."" It is unknown whether the pair will continue to leave bundles of money but any that are found and handed in to police will continue to be returned to the finder.

Flybe boss 'focused' on turning airline around,"Flybe boss Mark Anderson has told staff that he and the management team remain ""focused"" on turning the airline round. Mr Anderson's comments came in an email to staff following reports that the airline is in crisis talks in an attempt to put together a rescue deal. According to Sky News,,externalFlybe, which has already been bailed out once, has been struggling to secure fresh finance. In his email, Mr Anderson stressed that Flybe was continuing to operate as normal. ""All my energy, and that of our Leadership Team, is very focused on continuing to turn Flybe, soon to be Virgin Connect, around and deliver the heartfelt service that our customers expect,"" he said. ""I do appreciate that the headlines some of you have already read are disturbing but I want you to know that we are determined to do everything we can to make this work."" He told staff he was ""extremely grateful"" for their hard work and commitment. In an earlier statement, Flybe said it was focusing on ""providing great service and connectivity for our customers, to ensure that they can continue to travel as planned"". Flybe boss Mark Anderson has asked staff not to speculate on rumours and to focus on their work while it works to turn the airline around Flybe, the UK's biggest regional carrier, added: ""We don't comment on rumour or speculation."" The reports come a year after Flybe was bought for Â£2.8m by a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. Since then, the consortium has invested tens of millions of pounds in the troubled carrier, but losses have continued to mount. Tourism adviser and researcher Prof Annette Pritchard, of the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research in Cardiff, commented on Twitter that Flybe provided ""a vital social and cultural link for many marginal economies"". 'Valuable connectivity': Why Flybe matters Based in Exeter, Flybe carries about eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Its network of routes includes more than half of UK domestic flights outside London. If the business collapses, more than 2,000 jobs will be at risk. Matthew Mills, a graphic designer based in Shropshire, recently booked flights for his family to Germany with Flybe. He is also one of the 10,000 consumers still waiting to receive a refund from collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook on a holiday that was meant to take place in November. ""You don't know whether to laugh or cry,"" he told the BBC. ""We've used Flybe quite a bit in the past because we have family in Germany and we don't have many alternatives in the UK - if Flybe goes under, we'd be looking at 50% more in prices on flights to Germany, easily."" Worried Flybe customers have taken to Twitter to express their concerns, saying they are still waiting for information on whether their flights will go ahead. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC understands that EY has been lined up as administrators if Flybe were to go under. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""I am appalled that once again the future of a major UK airline and hundreds of jobs is being discussed in secret with no input from employees or their representatives. ""According to reports, the airline could have collapsed over the weekend, which would have been devastating news."" Mr Strutton called on Flybe's owners and the government to talk to the union, saying staff had a right to know what was going on. Exeter is home to Flybe's headquarters and a quick look at the departures and arrivals board here illustrate just how important the airline's connections are to the area. Of the eight departures to destinations such as Manchester, Newcastle and Jersey, seven of them are operated by Flybe. The taxi driver who brought me from the train station told me his firm had paid Â£40,000 to secure a concession inside the terminal. ""Flybe is a massive part of our business"" before helpfully reeling off a list of arrivals and departure times he knew off the top of his head. Its not just the flights - over 400 people work at HQ, plus they run a training academy for apprentice plane engineers. The airline is in talks with both the Department for Transport and the Business Department to see if the government can provide or facilitate a rescue. The government refused a request from Thomas Cook for Â£150m in emergency funding, with Boris Johnson claiming it would have provided a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would see the government called on to rescue other failing private companies. However, the government may face a political hazard. It has vowed to focus on regional connectivity which the collapse of Flybe would do nothing to improve. Prof Loizos Heracleous, an aviation industry expert from Warwick Business School, said it would be ""no easy task"" for Flybe to attract new finance. He added: ""The aviation industry is an unattractive industry in terms of performance and returns on investment at the best of times. ""It is saddled with high-cost assets, namely planes, and key costs that fluctuate uncontrollably, mainly fuel, which accounts for around a third of total airline costs. ""On top of that, they face high regulation, often aggressive unions, low barriers to entry that increase competition, and high bargaining power of buyers."" Ben Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, said Flybe provided ""valuable connectivity throughout the UK"" and called on the government to intervene. He called Flybe ""a strategically important business"". The industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""We do not comment on the financial situation of any of the organisations we regulate."" As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

Pensions row 'making bad situation worse in NHS',"The continuing dispute over pensions that has seen doctors stop working overtime is ""making a bad situation worse"", hospital bosses are warning. Some have been refusing to work extra hours because they were being landed with bills after changes to how much could be accrued in pensions tax free. A short-term fix, proposed in November by NHS bosses in England, will see the NHS pick up the tax bills. But NHS Providers said that move had not begun to solve the problems. Saffron Cordery, of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said the issue was still ""making a bad situation worse"" and adding to the ""stress"" on waiting times. Last week, official figures showed performance against accident-and-emergency, cancer and routine operation waiting times had sunk to its worst level since records began. Ms Cordery said: ""It is still early days but it doesn't look like the fix is having anything like the desired impact. ""The problem is that a decades-long way of working has unravelled very quickly. ""It has always been the case that doctors have offered to do extra work but now they are discovering a new work-life balance. ""They are also suspicious - even with the promises - that they will still lose out in the future. ""Trusts across the country are really worried about this and how, not just now but in the future, you persuade doctors to do the extra work. ""There are many factors that are causing the longer waiting times - rising demand, workforce shortages, flu - but this is certainly playing a role."" The amount people can put into pensions tax free has been reduced for all workers. In 2010-11 it was Â£255,000 but has now been cut to Â£40,000 a year - and drops still further for the highest earners. The changes tend to affect those earning more than Â£110,000, about a third of senior doctors and GPs. A number of short-term fixes have already been tried, including allowing staff to temporarily opt out of the scheme and add to their pay packet any pension payments they would have received. But these have had a limited impact on the stand-off, prompting NHS England and ministers to agree to using NHS funds to cover the cost of tax bills by topping up their pension pots before retirement. This means doctors can take money out of their pension pots to pay the tax bills, while providing the NHS with time to find the money. The emergency measure is available for the 2019-20 tax year only. The Treasury is still looking at how the pension changes have been implemented, in an attempt to find a long-term solution ahead of the start of the next financial year in April. There are differences to how pensions work elsewhere in the UK, although tax-free allowances have been reduced in each nation. Dr Vishal Sharma, of the British Medical Association, said ""fundamental"" reform was the only solution. ""The BMA has been warning of the impact of ludicrous pensions taxation rules on the NHS for almost two years. ""Doctors are scaling back their hours and will continue to do so if the pension crisis remains unaddressed.""

Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit,"There is no application form for the Royal Family. No interview, no appeal, few in the way of entrances or exits. It is that strange lottery, an accident of birth. But to stay royal you have to do two things. Serve, and survive. You have to do some service. Some of it ceremonial, and often dull.  Some of it - if it involves celebrities or travel - less dull. A lot of it is woven into the civic life of the UK - openings, namings, lunches and dinners. You have to survive. You have to aid - and certainly not threaten - the survival of the House of Windsor and the British monarchy. It's not a bad life. It is a constrained life, often unchosen. In exchange for a pretty comfortable standard of living in perpetuity, you lose a lot of choice. But you must do these two things if you want to remain a royal. And it's not clear that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex really want to do either. Queen and Prince Harry to hold talks over Sussexes' future 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement How could the Sussexes make money? In Sandringham later the players will receive a series of options, a range of possibilities. These will be based on the stated aim of Prince Harry and Meghan that they want financial independence, to take paid employment, to spend a lot more time outside the UK, to exclude the media from their lives at their discretion and to continue at least in part, a royal life, service to the Queen. Leaving aside the heady brew of contradictions detailed elsewhere, the balancing of these different aims and demands is hard enough.  Money is a big issue. But so will be the status of the court of Prince Harry and Meghan that emerges. Will it be entirely independent of the palace, of the monarchy? Will the palace retain any veto on direction or projects for the couple? Much, says one official, depends on how much royal work the prince and Meghan intend to do, and where. Meghan will be in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie during Monday's meeting To watch Prince Harry for not very long, as I have, is to observe a man who comes alive with crowds, with love, with those who need him. But also to see a man entirely unhappy with his lot. A man who desperately wants to get away from cameras, observers, outsiders, looking and filming and exploiting him. Now the prince, who has worn the nation's uniform in combat and amongst death and injury, is openly sneered at across pages and feeds and memes. It is hardly a great national moment. Prince Harry has had a hard time, from when his mother was taken from him, a boy aged 12. It is important to remember also because it demolishes the Meghan Myth - that somehow she is the root of all today's turmoil. The Meghan Myth is nonsense, with a generous sprinkling of spite, misogyny and some racism. The prince always wanted out. And together, with her brains and understanding and love, they think they have a way. Maybe a deal comes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But what are not up for negotiation are service and survival. Both must be observed by Prince Harry and Meghan if they are to remain royals. Perhaps Prince Harry's allergy to media coverage can be managed at those royal events and duties he attends.  Perhaps the couple will make themselves available to a significant and visible degree of service. But the style of their departure from familial obligation, their declaration of independence last week, was so abrupt and so disrespectful. The duke has gone beyond rebellious prince. Meghan, the enabler, is in Canada, with child and dogs. That degree of going rogue looks quite a lot like a direct threat to the survival of the monarchy. That is why today's meeting is hard. Maybe the two sides can strike a deal over the next day, two days, invent a new structure that officials say might be emulated for a new royal generation. But will the couple really agree to the restrictions that service and survival demand? A deal will probably be crafted - however the direction of travel is one way.

What's on the agenda for the 'Sandringham summit'?,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex say they want to be ""financially independent"", but how? The Queen has called an urgent meeting of senior royals at Sandringham to discuss a new role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Monday's gathering - being described as the ""Sandringham summit"" - will see her meet the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, while Meghan is expected to join over the phone from Canada, as they weigh up what Buckingham Palace calls ""complicated issues"". But what questions will they have to consider? The couple say they want to become ""financially independent"". They have proposed giving up the Sovereign Grant, paid annually by the government to support the Royal Family in its official duties. The duke and duchess say it currently accounts for about 5% of their current staff costs, which they will need to find elsewhere. Their remaining costs come from income produced by the Duchy of Cornwall, Prince Charles' Â£1bn estate.Statements on the Sussexes' website,externalsuggest the couple expect this will continue. The crisis meeting is taking place at the Queen's Sandringham estate They say they already pay the costs of their private travel. After criticism of their use of private jets last year, they say that wherever possible this will be by ""commercial air carriers, local trains and fuel-efficient vehicles"". Official visits are carried out at the request of the Foreign Office and are paid out of the Sovereign Grant - and it seems that the duke and duchess anticipate that this will not change. By most people's standards Prince Harry and Meghan are already very wealthy. David McClure, author of Royal Legacy, a book about the Royal Family's finances, says the duke inherited Â£7m when his mother died, while Meghan was a successful actress - who alsoran a lifestyle blog- when they met. ""Together, they might well be worth Â£10m to 15m,"" he says. Queen and Prince Harry to hold face-to-face talks Questions answered as Harry and Meghan 'step back' Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights How could the couple make money? Meghan Markle: The wellness guru she could have been But the couple could turn to the private sector to earn more money. Mr McClure says senior royals are aware that working in the commercial sector can be a ""potential minefield"". And BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says the general rule has always been that if you are a working royal, you don't really do paid work, especially if it could cause a conflict of interest. The Earl and Countess of Wessex faced such allegations when they tried to run a TV company and PR firm, respectively. Nearly any employment they might embark on would open the duke and duchess up to criticism that they were exploiting or monetising the royal brand, our correspondent adds. The duke and duchess carried out a tour of Africa last year, but what royal duties will they keep moving forwards? There has been no indication that the duke and duchess intend to renounce their titles. Harry's mother, Princess Diana, gave up the title ""Her Royal Highness"" when she divorced Prince Charles. However, commentators have suggested the Palace is unlikely to go down this road again given the criticism it faced following this move. In December it was also revealed that the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing and charitable fundraising - and renouncing their royal titles could mean they lose some of the status this brand is built on. The meeting is unlikely to consider the issue of succession: it would take an act of Parliament to alter the line of succession, wherePrince Harry currently stands in sixth place. The proposal from the duke and duchess is that they divide their time between the UK and North America. Canada, where the couple spent a six-week break over Christmas,has been touted as a possible base for the couple. Meghan lived and worked in Toronto for seven years during her time starring in the US legal drama Suits and has several Canadian friends. The Daily Mail's royal correspondent, Rebecca English,has suggested the couple may eventually settle in Los Angeles,external, the city where she grew up and her mother still lives - but not until President Trump's time in the White House is over. How much time they spend in the UK may be a crucial question, asMeghan is believed to be applying to be a British citizen, which requires that she only spends 90 days abroad each year. And as Archie - currently only eight months old - grows up, where he attends school could determine where the duke and duchess have their main home. Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage has been refurbished with taxpayer funds The couple plan to continue to use the Grade II-listed house in Windsor, which was refurbished with Â£2.4m in taxpayer funds. Keeping it will ensure they ""will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom"", they said. But they acknowledge that this depends on the permission of the Queen, who owns the property. If the couple choose to base themselves outside the UK for any length of time, there are likely to be tax implications, according to BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell. Under the Canadian tax system, anyone who lives in the country for 183 days or more a year must pay tax on their global income, regardless of where it is earned or received. Similar rules apply in the UK, but the limit is 90 days. Harry has been warned he risks facing a ""double tax"" on his income if he divides his time between the two countries,according to the Mail on Sunday,external. The duke and duchess said in their statement on Wednesday that they intend to continue ""to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". One of the tasks facing the meeting of senior royals will be to decide what exactly this means. ""It's not at all clear how much in the way of royal duties the prince and Meghan see themselves doing,"" says the BBC's Jonny Dymond. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter said any attempt to step back from their royal duties would pose problems. ""You're either a royal or you're not a royal - you can't have one leg in one camp and another leg in another camp,"" he said. According totables compiled each year by retired insurance broker Tim O'Donovan,external, the duke attended 201 engagements last year - his second-highest number since he committed to full-time public duties - while the duchess had 83 engagements. That is some way below the number of the busiest royal, Prince Charles, who attended 521 functions - although Mr Donovan stresses that the effort and preparation for each varies. The duke and duchess intend to continue ""to honour our duty to the Queen"" In April, the Sussexes intend to launch a new foundation, which they say will ""advance the solutions the world needs most"" through ""local and global community action"". They say they have researched the work of many well-known and lesser-known foundations in developing their plan. The Sunday Telegraph,externalsays they may try to model their foundation on organisations like those run by Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Melinda Gates and George and Amal Clooney. The paper says the couple have obtained a UK trademark for The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But it says that if they want to attract wealthy US-based donors, they may also need to set up a stateside ""friends of"" organisation so donors can benefit from local tax-breaks. The Sussexes' handling of media relations has already caused controversy within the Royal Family. A source told the BBC thatPrince William was ""furious""after the couple's ITV interview in October. With the duke and duchess proposing major changes in their PR operation, other royals will have an opportunity to raise concerns at the meeting. This video can not be played Prince Harry has said he and Prince William ""are certainly on different paths at the moment"" Part of their plan is to withdraw from the royal rota, which gives some UK publications privileged access to royal engagements on condition that they share pictures and quotes with other publications. The couple say they are concerned about ""frequent misreporting"". They also say they want to connect with the public more directly through social media, adding that the rota system can restrict them from publishing new images themselves. The couple say their security as ""internationally protected people"", provided by armed Metropolitan Police officers, is mandated by the Home Office. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said this arrangement should continue. ""I think the British taxpayer should pay for the security of Harry and Meghan and their family as they do for former ministers,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, highlighting Prince Harry's Afghanistan service. Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""safety was always a priority"" for the Royal Family, although she said she would not discuss the arrangements for protected individuals. Butthe Sunday Times,externalsaid the Metropolitan Police is considering replacing expensive firearms officers with guards armed with Tasers for several VIPs, in order to cut costs. It quotes former head of royal protection Dai Davies saying the move would be ""nonsensical"", however, because of the Taser's short range and one-shot limit.

Questions answered as Harry and Meghan 'step back',"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's decision to ""step back"" as senior members of the Royal Family has generated interest across the world. Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are said to have ""blindsided"" Buckingham Palace with the announcement, which the couple said came after ""many months of reflection"". They saidthey intended to become financially independent while continuing to supportthe Queen. But what does it mean for their future? Will the duke still be in the line of succession? And what if the couple split up?BBC royal correspondent Sarah Campbellanswers readers' questions. Succession to the throne in the UK is not only due to birth, but also legislation. It would take an Act of Parliament to remove a person from the line of succession. Downing Street has so far said that questions on the duke and duchess's announcement are ""for the royal household"". The Royal Family tree and line of succession It is worth noting that, as the Cambridge family expands, Prince Harry will keep moving down the line of succession. Archie has no title - that was his parents' decision when he was born. He is simply Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor. There is no suggestion the duke and duchess wish to renounce their titles. In full: Sussexes' statement and palace response Harry and Meghan step back: What will happen next? In pictures: Harry and Meghan's life together He remains a member of the Royal Family - stepping back from duties does not change that. Moreover, what the couple plan to do has not been tried before, so there is no precedent to guide us. This rule applies to some applicants for British citizenship. We were told that Meghan was not going to be fast-tracked to get citizenship and it will take the same length of time for her as for anyone else. We are not aware she is a dual citizen as yet (as in, that she has a British passport). Buckingham Palace did not respond when asked whether the duchess's citizenship application would be affected by the announcement. Meghan has talked about the fact that, even though she was already in the public eye, she wasnot prepared for the huge press interestwhich came with marrying into the Royal Family. We simply do not know how much support the duke and duchess have been given, so it is difficult to say whether they should have been given more. The next Invictus Games is to be held this year in The Hague. The Invictus Games Foundation - with Prince Harry as patron - was established to preside over the games and, as it is a separate entity, it will continue regardless of what happens with Prince Harry's status within the Royal Family. It will remain one of his key commitments. 'Freedom' or 'petulance'? World's media split on royal move How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight Prince Edward and his wife the Countess of Wessex are now both working members of the Royal Family with a busy schedule of engagements. But they both experienced difficulties when pursuing careers in the private sector: Sophie worked for a PR firm that was caught in a sting by a national newspaper and she was recorded making comments about members of the Royal Family; Edward had little success as a television producer. They both gave up their careers and are now full-time ""working royals"" paid for using income from the Duchy of Lancaster, the Queen's private income. Wallis Simpson was an American divorcee like Meghan Markle. In 1936, it was considered the public would never accept a divorcee as Queen. Edward VIII - the Queen's uncle - had to choose between the throne and Wallis Simpson. He chose her, thereby relieving himself of his position and all royal duties. Prince Harry and Meghan have said they wish to ""step back"" as senior royals suggesting they do intend to carry out some duties on behalf of the Queen. This is their choice as opposed to a course of action they have no option but to follow. But - it is early days and it is really not clear yet how their part-royal, part-private roles will pan out. On their website, the couple say they will continue to use Frogmore Cottage - their home on the Windsor estate - with the permission of its owner, the Queen. They say the cottage will be their ""official residence as they continue to support the monarchy, and so that their family will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom"". They add that the refurbishment of the cottage was planned well before they decided to move in and their decision to live there saved money when compared with the refurbishment of another property at Kensington Palace. On their website, Harry and Meghan say they will no longer receive funding through the Sovereign Grant, ""thereby making them members of the Royal Family with financial independence"". However, the couple say the grant only provides 5% of their income and it is unclear whether they will give up their other sources of funding. Explained: Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? The couple will continue to be given a security detail paid for by the taxpayer-funded Metropolitan Police, which does not disclose the costs involved. The couple's intention to travel back and forth from North America would likely add to this cost, but it is possible they will pay towards this - although it will be a large bill. This comes after Harry and Meghanclaimed on their new website,externalthat 95% of funding for their office comes through income from Prince Charles' estate - the Duchy of Cornwall. The Duchy estate belongs to all heirs to the throne and has existed since Edward III created it for his son and heir, Prince Edward (famously known as the Black Prince), in 1337. According to a charter, the Prince of Wales, as the Duke of Cornwall, receives income each year generated from assets on the estate - which includes large parts of Cornwall, Dorset and Herefordshire - but he does not benefit from the proceeds or profit on the sale of any assets,according to the Duchy's website.,external This means that the territory - and income - of the Duchy will pass to Prince William, as heir, and on to his son Prince George when he becomes the heir. Therefore the estate itself is not owned by any one member of the Royal Family, nor is it owned by the government. Harry and Meghan's wedding in May 2018 attracted some 100,000 well-wishers to Windsor as well as a global TV audience of hundreds of millions. At the time, the Berkshire police commissioner Anthony Stansfeldsuggested the costof securing the duke and duchess' wedding was ""between Â£2m and Â£4m"". Another recent comparison would be the 2011 wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, which cost the Metropolitan Police Â£6.35m - though it took place in London and was a larger event. The Metropolitan Police - which is responsible for securing the Royal Family - does not reveal the cost of day-to-day security or policing, so these costs are not known. Reports of previous estimates have suggested the cost of securing all senior royals costs the Met Police around Â£50m a year. Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family?

Financiers and gurus: Europe's working royals,"Princess Laurentien and Prince Constantijn of the Netherlands are among Europe's working royals The UK monarchy is not the first in Europe to face questions over the private careers of senior royals. The Queen led ""crisis talks"" on Monday over the ""new progressive role"" that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan want to take, which includes earning their own money while continuing to support the monarch. European royal family ties go back centuries. Among the UK monarchy's closest neighbours, some senior royals have successfully transitioned into modern working lives, while others have been forced to give up their titles, or faced accusations of exploiting the royal brand. Queen agrees 'transition' for Harry and Meghan How might Harry and Meghan make money? The rules on royal titles and duties vary across Europe. It is also significant that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have a global celebrity status not shared by their European counterparts. Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien both work The Netherlands has been described as a successful example of senior members of the royal family holding down jobs. The king's brother, Prince Constantijn, and his wife, Princess Laurentien, both work. ""They previously agreed... with first taking a life away from the throne but with the condition that you be available when the crown needs you, you might need to put everything aside. And when you do a job, please get in touch with government, with the king, with the monarch to say what your plan is,"" Dutch royal reporter Rick Evers said. The couple work for a global policy think tank and part time for the Dutch ministry of foreign affairs. Prince Constantijn, known as Tijn, rarely attends public events as a member of the Dutch Royal House. Prince Constantijn's older brother, Prince Friso, also worked. After earning a degree in aeronautical engineering, he was employed by a uranium enrichment company. He died in 2012 after being buried under an avalanche during a skiing holiday in the Austrian Alps. Royals with paid private jobs in the Netherlands do not receive constitutional allowances. King Willem-Alexander, meanwhile, still serves as a commercial pilot, flying planes with KLM - something he describes as a serious hobby rather than a job. This video can not be played Matthew Price reports from Amsterdam where parties are underway to pay tribute to the new king BBC correspondent Anna Holligan says a media code was adopted in 2005 under which photographs of members of the royal house performing royal duties are always permitted, and on occasions like holidays the government arranges official photo opportunities, on the condition that royals are allowed privacy for the rest of the year. It's a working model which seems to satisfy both the royals - and public interest in their (relatively normal) lives, she adds. Princess Martha Louise has stopped using her title in business ventures In Norway, Princess Martha Louise - the eldest child of Norwegian King Harald V - gave up her royal highness status after getting married in 2002, as she sought to focus on her private career. However, she has faced accusations of exploiting her title for profit. Alongside her boyfriend, a shaman called Durek Verrett, she organised seminars last year called ""The Princess and the Shaman"". They promised to take participants on a journey of ""self discovery into wisdoms to reveal to you your divine self activated"". Amid criticism over the move, she later apologised and said she would drop her royal title in future work endeavours. ""The fact that I used princess in the title of my tour, I have said before that I am very sorry, and I still stand by that. It was a mistake and I understand that it provokes when the princess title is used this way,"" she wrote on Instagram. ""The discussions are something I have taken seriously, and in collaboration with my family we have found that it is best that we make some changes."" As part of the move, she created a new Instagram account for work-related projects, which does not include her title. ""I am simply Martha Louise. Let's explore life and go on adventures together,"" she wrote in her first post. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Despite the controversy and losing her royal highness status, royal watcher James Taylor said she continues to appear with her family at certain public events. ""She's had quite a degree of criticism but at the same time she's... still in the family circle,"" he said. Cristopher O'Neill did not want a royal title after his marriage to Princess Madeleine of Sweden The husband of Princess Madeleine, the youngest child of Sweden's king, opted not to accept a royal title when they married so he could continue with his professional life. ""When they got married in 2013, the king allowed him a royal title but he declined that because he wanted to be independent and make sure he could make his own money,"" Swedish royal expert Roger Lundgren said. Christopher O'Neill, a British-American national, continues to work as a financier, while his wife performs royal duties and works with non-profit foundations. He appears alongside the royal family at major occasions. Mr Lundgren said Mr O'Neill did not face criticism in Sweden for his work because he had not accepted a title. He said if Mr O'Neill had taken a royal title while continuing to work as a financier ""there would have been a lot of problems"". The children of Princess Madeleine and Mr O'Neill will also be expected to work for a living in future afterthe Swedish king last year removed five of his grandchildrenfrom the royal house. The move to slim down the monarchy saw the children stripped of the title of royal highness, meaning they are no longer required to perform royal duties. Analysts, however, noted that the children - who remained princes and princesses - still retained a ""theoretical claim to the throne"" and would likely continue to appear at social gatherings through their titles. The decision did not affect the king's two grandchildren who are in direct line to the throne. Princess Cristina does not perform royal duties Spain's Princess Cristina is thought to be the first member of the Spanish royal family to hold a salaried job. Her father gave her the title of Duchess of Palma de Mallorca upon her marriage in 1997 to former Olympic handball player Inaki Urdangarin. But her brother, Spain's King Felipe VI, stripped her of the title of duchess in 2015 as she prepared to stand trial over an embezzlement scam involving her husband. Princess Cristina was cleared of involvement butUrdangarin was convicted in 2017of using his not-for-profit NÃ³os Institute sports foundation to siphon off millions of euros for private use, becoming the first member of a Spanish monarch's family to go to jail. The princess, who relocated to Geneva in 2013, has been reported in recent years to be working for the charitable foundation run by La Caixa bank and the Aga Khan Foundation. She does not perform royal duties and never appears at public events with the royal family, Mr Lundgren said. What's on the agenda for the royal talks? How might Harry and Meghan make money?

Royal couple looking for the exit,"There is no application form for the Royal Family. No interview, no appeal, few in the way of entrances or exits. It is that strange lottery, an accident of birth. But to stay royal you have to do two things. Serve, and survive. You have to do some service. Some of it ceremonial, and often dull.  Some of it - if it involves celebrities or travel - less dull. A lot of it is woven into the civic life of the UK - openings, namings, lunches and dinners. You have to survive. You have to aid - and certainly not threaten - the survival of the House of Windsor and the British monarchy. It's not a bad life. It is a constrained life, often unchosen. In exchange for a pretty comfortable standard of living in perpetuity, you lose a lot of choice. But you must do these two things if you want to remain a royal. And it's not clear that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex really want to do either. Queen and Prince Harry to hold talks over Sussexes' future 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement How could the Sussexes make money? In Sandringham later the players will receive a series of options, a range of possibilities. These will be based on the stated aim of Prince Harry and Meghan that they want financial independence, to take paid employment, to spend a lot more time outside the UK, to exclude the media from their lives at their discretion and to continue at least in part, a royal life, service to the Queen. Leaving aside the heady brew of contradictions detailed elsewhere, the balancing of these different aims and demands is hard enough.  Money is a big issue. But so will be the status of the court of Prince Harry and Meghan that emerges. Will it be entirely independent of the palace, of the monarchy? Will the palace retain any veto on direction or projects for the couple? Much, says one official, depends on how much royal work the prince and Meghan intend to do, and where. Meghan will be in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie during Monday's meeting To watch Prince Harry for not very long, as I have, is to observe a man who comes alive with crowds, with love, with those who need him. But also to see a man entirely unhappy with his lot. A man who desperately wants to get away from cameras, observers, outsiders, looking and filming and exploiting him. Now the prince, who has worn the nation's uniform in combat and amongst death and injury, is openly sneered at across pages and feeds and memes. It is hardly a great national moment. Prince Harry has had a hard time, from when his mother was taken from him, a boy aged 12. It is important to remember also because it demolishes the Meghan Myth - that somehow she is the root of all today's turmoil. The Meghan Myth is nonsense, with a generous sprinkling of spite, misogyny and some racism. The prince always wanted out. And together, with her brains and understanding and love, they think they have a way. Maybe a deal comes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But what are not up for negotiation are service and survival. Both must be observed by Prince Harry and Meghan if they are to remain royals. Perhaps Prince Harry's allergy to media coverage can be managed at those royal events and duties he attends.  Perhaps the couple will make themselves available to a significant and visible degree of service. But the style of their departure from familial obligation, their declaration of independence last week, was so abrupt and so disrespectful. The duke has gone beyond rebellious prince. Meghan, the enabler, is in Canada, with child and dogs. That degree of going rogue looks quite a lot like a direct threat to the survival of the monarchy. That is why today's meeting is hard. Maybe the two sides can strike a deal over the next day, two days, invent a new structure that officials say might be emulated for a new royal generation. But will the couple really agree to the restrictions that service and survival demand? A deal will probably be crafted - however the direction of travel is one way.

What's on the royal talks agenda?,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex say they want to be ""financially independent"", but how? The Queen has called an urgent meeting of senior royals at Sandringham to discuss a new role for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Monday's gathering - being described as the ""Sandringham summit"" - will see her meet the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, while Meghan is expected to join over the phone from Canada, as they weigh up what Buckingham Palace calls ""complicated issues"". But what questions will they have to consider? The couple say they want to become ""financially independent"". They have proposed giving up the Sovereign Grant, paid annually by the government to support the Royal Family in its official duties. The duke and duchess say it currently accounts for about 5% of their current staff costs, which they will need to find elsewhere. Their remaining costs come from income produced by the Duchy of Cornwall, Prince Charles' Â£1bn estate.Statements on the Sussexes' website,externalsuggest the couple expect this will continue. The crisis meeting is taking place at the Queen's Sandringham estate They say they already pay the costs of their private travel. After criticism of their use of private jets last year, they say that wherever possible this will be by ""commercial air carriers, local trains and fuel-efficient vehicles"". Official visits are carried out at the request of the Foreign Office and are paid out of the Sovereign Grant - and it seems that the duke and duchess anticipate that this will not change. By most people's standards Prince Harry and Meghan are already very wealthy. David McClure, author of Royal Legacy, a book about the Royal Family's finances, says the duke inherited Â£7m when his mother died, while Meghan was a successful actress - who alsoran a lifestyle blog- when they met. ""Together, they might well be worth Â£10m to 15m,"" he says. Queen and Prince Harry to hold face-to-face talks Questions answered as Harry and Meghan 'step back' Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights How could the couple make money? Meghan Markle: The wellness guru she could have been But the couple could turn to the private sector to earn more money. Mr McClure says senior royals are aware that working in the commercial sector can be a ""potential minefield"". And BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond says the general rule has always been that if you are a working royal, you don't really do paid work, especially if it could cause a conflict of interest. The Earl and Countess of Wessex faced such allegations when they tried to run a TV company and PR firm, respectively. Nearly any employment they might embark on would open the duke and duchess up to criticism that they were exploiting or monetising the royal brand, our correspondent adds. The duke and duchess carried out a tour of Africa last year, but what royal duties will they keep moving forwards? There has been no indication that the duke and duchess intend to renounce their titles. Harry's mother, Princess Diana, gave up the title ""Her Royal Highness"" when she divorced Prince Charles. However, commentators have suggested the Palace is unlikely to go down this road again given the criticism it faced following this move. In December it was also revealed that the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing and charitable fundraising - and renouncing their royal titles could mean they lose some of the status this brand is built on. The meeting is unlikely to consider the issue of succession: it would take an act of Parliament to alter the line of succession, wherePrince Harry currently stands in sixth place. The proposal from the duke and duchess is that they divide their time between the UK and North America. Canada, where the couple spent a six-week break over Christmas,has been touted as a possible base for the couple. Meghan lived and worked in Toronto for seven years during her time starring in the US legal drama Suits and has several Canadian friends. The Daily Mail's royal correspondent, Rebecca English,has suggested the couple may eventually settle in Los Angeles,external, the city where she grew up and her mother still lives - but not until President Trump's time in the White House is over. How much time they spend in the UK may be a crucial question, asMeghan is believed to be applying to be a British citizen, which requires that she only spends 90 days abroad each year. And as Archie - currently only eight months old - grows up, where he attends school could determine where the duke and duchess have their main home. Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage has been refurbished with taxpayer funds The couple plan to continue to use the Grade II-listed house in Windsor, which was refurbished with Â£2.4m in taxpayer funds. Keeping it will ensure they ""will always have a place to call home in the United Kingdom"", they said. But they acknowledge that this depends on the permission of the Queen, who owns the property. If the couple choose to base themselves outside the UK for any length of time, there are likely to be tax implications, according to BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell. Under the Canadian tax system, anyone who lives in the country for 183 days or more a year must pay tax on their global income, regardless of where it is earned or received. Similar rules apply in the UK, but the limit is 90 days. Harry has been warned he risks facing a ""double tax"" on his income if he divides his time between the two countries,according to the Mail on Sunday,external. The duke and duchess said in their statement on Wednesday that they intend to continue ""to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". One of the tasks facing the meeting of senior royals will be to decide what exactly this means. ""It's not at all clear how much in the way of royal duties the prince and Meghan see themselves doing,"" says the BBC's Jonny Dymond. Former Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter said any attempt to step back from their royal duties would pose problems. ""You're either a royal or you're not a royal - you can't have one leg in one camp and another leg in another camp,"" he said. According totables compiled each year by retired insurance broker Tim O'Donovan,external, the duke attended 201 engagements last year - his second-highest number since he committed to full-time public duties - while the duchess had 83 engagements. That is some way below the number of the busiest royal, Prince Charles, who attended 521 functions - although Mr Donovan stresses that the effort and preparation for each varies. The duke and duchess intend to continue ""to honour our duty to the Queen"" In April, the Sussexes intend to launch a new foundation, which they say will ""advance the solutions the world needs most"" through ""local and global community action"". They say they have researched the work of many well-known and lesser-known foundations in developing their plan. The Sunday Telegraph,externalsays they may try to model their foundation on organisations like those run by Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Melinda Gates and George and Amal Clooney. The paper says the couple have obtained a UK trademark for The Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But it says that if they want to attract wealthy US-based donors, they may also need to set up a stateside ""friends of"" organisation so donors can benefit from local tax-breaks. The Sussexes' handling of media relations has already caused controversy within the Royal Family. A source told the BBC thatPrince William was ""furious""after the couple's ITV interview in October. With the duke and duchess proposing major changes in their PR operation, other royals will have an opportunity to raise concerns at the meeting. This video can not be played Prince Harry has said he and Prince William ""are certainly on different paths at the moment"" Part of their plan is to withdraw from the royal rota, which gives some UK publications privileged access to royal engagements on condition that they share pictures and quotes with other publications. The couple say they are concerned about ""frequent misreporting"". They also say they want to connect with the public more directly through social media, adding that the rota system can restrict them from publishing new images themselves. The couple say their security as ""internationally protected people"", provided by armed Metropolitan Police officers, is mandated by the Home Office. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said this arrangement should continue. ""I think the British taxpayer should pay for the security of Harry and Meghan and their family as they do for former ministers,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, highlighting Prince Harry's Afghanistan service. Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""safety was always a priority"" for the Royal Family, although she said she would not discuss the arrangements for protected individuals. Butthe Sunday Times,externalsaid the Metropolitan Police is considering replacing expensive firearms officers with guards armed with Tasers for several VIPs, in order to cut costs. It quotes former head of royal protection Dai Davies saying the move would be ""nonsensical"", however, because of the Taser's short range and one-shot limit.

Beales boss: 'Councils really don't care',"Councils ""really don't care"" about supporting High Street trading, the boss of struggling department store chain Beales has told the BBC. Beales, which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881, has warned thatit could fall into administration. The company runs 22 stores across the UK and about 1,000 jobs are at stake. ""We've only managed to get one council to help us out on a temporary basis,"" Beales boss Tony Brown told the BBC's Today programme. ""At the moment, in my view councils really don't care. They get their business rates, whether we're there or not, because the landlord pays if the store closes."" Worst year for retail in 25 years, says trade body Mr Brown said that his current focus was trying to secure a ""profitable future"" for the department store. Several options are being considered, including seeking a buyer, negotiating rent reductions with landlords, and restructuring the business by closing some stores. ""In the towns in which we trade in, we are the retail heartbeat of that town centre,"" he said. He stressed that landlords were ""mostly"" helpful and could see a long-term future for the business, but he has felt let down by local and central government. ""For example, in a number of our stores, I pay three or four times more business rates than I do rent. Now, that can't be right,"" he said. He added that ""the sheer weight of the additional costs that are piled upon us - if you take the pension increases, you take rates, you take changes in the way we can apply for lending - there is a co-ordinated effort, or what feels like it, to make it as difficult as possible [to trade on the High Street]."" In the year to March 2019, Beales reported a loss of Â£3.1m, up from a loss of Â£1.3m for the year earlier, as costs swelled and sales dipped. Beales is by no means the only High Street chain to be struggling. Last week, the British Retail Consortium said that UK retail sales fell 0.1% last year, marking the first annual sales decline since 1995. It added that sales in November and December were particularly weak, dropping 0.9%. Last week also saw the John Lewis Partnership reporting a fall in festive sales at its department store chain. It warned that its staff bonus may be in doubt as profits were expected to be ""substantially down on last year"".

She was helped by Clive Lewis quitting the race - with several of his backers switching to back her candidacy. Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips had already qualified for the next stage. Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, led the way with 88 nominations, ahead of Mrs Long Bailey on 33, Ms Nandy on 31 and the other two contenders on 23 each.

All five candidates - Angela Rayner, Ian Murray, Dawn Butler, Rosena Allin-Khan and Richard Burgon - have secured enough nominations to get through to the next stage of the race. Jeremy Corbyn's successor will be announced on 4 April. He is standing down after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row last month.

Flybe tight-lipped over collapse threat,"Flybe boss Mark Anderson has told staff that he and the management team remain ""focused"" on turning the airline round. Mr Anderson's comments came in an email to staff following reports that the airline is in crisis talks in an attempt to put together a rescue deal. According to Sky News,,externalFlybe, which has already been bailed out once, has been struggling to secure fresh finance. In his email, Mr Anderson stressed that Flybe was continuing to operate as normal. ""All my energy, and that of our Leadership Team, is very focused on continuing to turn Flybe, soon to be Virgin Connect, around and deliver the heartfelt service that our customers expect,"" he said. ""I do appreciate that the headlines some of you have already read are disturbing but I want you to know that we are determined to do everything we can to make this work."" He told staff he was ""extremely grateful"" for their hard work and commitment. In an earlier statement, Flybe said it was focusing on ""providing great service and connectivity for our customers, to ensure that they can continue to travel as planned"". Flybe boss Mark Anderson has asked staff not to speculate on rumours and to focus on their work while it works to turn the airline around Flybe, the UK's biggest regional carrier, added: ""We don't comment on rumour or speculation."" The reports come a year after Flybe was bought for Â£2.8m by a consortium including Virgin Atlantic and Stobart Group. Since then, the consortium has invested tens of millions of pounds in the troubled carrier, but losses have continued to mount. Tourism adviser and researcher Prof Annette Pritchard, of the Welsh Centre for Tourism Research in Cardiff, commented on Twitter that Flybe provided ""a vital social and cultural link for many marginal economies"". 'Valuable connectivity': Why Flybe matters Based in Exeter, Flybe carries about eight million passengers a year from airports such as Southampton, Cardiff and Aberdeen, to the UK and Europe. Its network of routes includes more than half of UK domestic flights outside London. If the business collapses, more than 2,000 jobs will be at risk. Matthew Mills, a graphic designer based in Shropshire, recently booked flights for his family to Germany with Flybe. He is also one of the 10,000 consumers still waiting to receive a refund from collapsed travel firm Thomas Cook on a holiday that was meant to take place in November. ""You don't know whether to laugh or cry,"" he told the BBC. ""We've used Flybe quite a bit in the past because we have family in Germany and we don't have many alternatives in the UK - if Flybe goes under, we'd be looking at 50% more in prices on flights to Germany, easily."" Worried Flybe customers have taken to Twitter to express their concerns, saying they are still waiting for information on whether their flights will go ahead. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC understands that EY has been lined up as administrators if Flybe were to go under. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""I am appalled that once again the future of a major UK airline and hundreds of jobs is being discussed in secret with no input from employees or their representatives. ""According to reports, the airline could have collapsed over the weekend, which would have been devastating news."" Mr Strutton called on Flybe's owners and the government to talk to the union, saying staff had a right to know what was going on. Exeter is home to Flybe's headquarters and a quick look at the departures and arrivals board here illustrate just how important the airline's connections are to the area. Of the eight departures to destinations such as Manchester, Newcastle and Jersey, seven of them are operated by Flybe. The taxi driver who brought me from the train station told me his firm had paid Â£40,000 to secure a concession inside the terminal. ""Flybe is a massive part of our business"" before helpfully reeling off a list of arrivals and departure times he knew off the top of his head. Its not just the flights - over 400 people work at HQ, plus they run a training academy for apprentice plane engineers. The airline is in talks with both the Department for Transport and the Business Department to see if the government can provide or facilitate a rescue. The government refused a request from Thomas Cook for Â£150m in emergency funding, with Boris Johnson claiming it would have provided a ""moral hazard"" - a dangerous precedent that would see the government called on to rescue other failing private companies. However, the government may face a political hazard. It has vowed to focus on regional connectivity which the collapse of Flybe would do nothing to improve. Prof Loizos Heracleous, an aviation industry expert from Warwick Business School, said it would be ""no easy task"" for Flybe to attract new finance. He added: ""The aviation industry is an unattractive industry in terms of performance and returns on investment at the best of times. ""It is saddled with high-cost assets, namely planes, and key costs that fluctuate uncontrollably, mainly fuel, which accounts for around a third of total airline costs. ""On top of that, they face high regulation, often aggressive unions, low barriers to entry that increase competition, and high bargaining power of buyers."" Ben Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter, said Flybe provided ""valuable connectivity throughout the UK"" and called on the government to intervene. He called Flybe ""a strategically important business"". The industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""We do not comment on the financial situation of any of the organisations we regulate."" As long as Flybe carries on flying, there is no need to worry and certainly no reason to try to get your money back,writes Simon Gompertz, BBC personal finance correspondent. If the airline was to fail, however, all flights would most likely be cancelled. Those with paid-for bookings could find they lose their flights and their cash. If your flight is part of a package deal covered by the ATOL scheme, then you should be protected and have the right to a re-booking or refund. Otherwise you can try to retrieve the money from your credit card company, if that's how you paid. There is also a debit card chargeback scheme which can help. Many travel insurance policies are not much use in these situations, unless you stumped up extra for the Scheduled Airline Failure option or something similar. Those stuck overseas might be left hoping that the government will direct the CAA to step in, as it did when Monarch and Thomas Cook went under, to bring back stranded passengers for free.

Labour contenders woo MPs ahead of deadlineClive Lewis and Emily Thornberry are under pressure to get enough support before nominations close.,"This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Emily Thornberry will join four others in the next round of the contest to become Labour leader, after winning the support of enough MPs and MEPs. The shadow foreign secretary passed the threshold of 22 backers less than 10 minutes before nominations closed. She was helped by Clive Lewis quitting the race - with several of his backers switching to back her candidacy. Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips had already qualified for the next stage. Sir Keir, the shadow Brexit secretary, led the way with 88 nominations, ahead of Mrs Long Bailey on 33, Ms Nandy on 31 and the other two contenders on 23 each. Mr Lewis, the lowest-ranking candidate, pulled out after getting only five nominations. The deputy Labour leader post is also vacant after Tom Watson stood down from Parliament. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Which Labour contender is the most working-class? All five candidates - Angela Rayner, Ian Murray, Dawn Butler, Rosena Allin-Khan and Richard Burgon - have secured enough nominations to get through to the next stage of the race. Jeremy Corbyn's successor will be announced on 4 April. He is standing down after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row last month. Announcing his exit on Twitter, Norwich South MP Mr Lewis said the contest ""was never just about the Labour leadership but about our survival as a political movement and mapping our path to power"".

Both Nadia Whittome and Rachael Maskell, who were originally backing Mr Lewis, switched to support Ms Thornberry. Mr Lewis urged his opponents to take on board some of the ideas he had argued for during his short-lived campaign, including more working with other political parties and progressive forces. ""I now throw down the gauntlet to other Labour leadership candidates and ask them if they are brave enough, strong enough, to take forward some of the issues in my manifesto,"" he said. ""In the coming weeks I'll be watching their responses closely before deciding who to support."" Among the prominent figures backing Sir Keir are Tottenham MP David Lammy, who has been named vice-chair of his campaign, and former leader Ed Miliband, who said he had ""the best experience and vision to deliver 21st Century socialism for the country"". In a speech in east London, Ms Nandy urged Labour to ""think big and paint a broad canvass"" as it seeks to bounce back from its defeat.

""Gusts will be lower inland with 45-55mph likely. A narrow band of squally, heavy rain moving east, accompanying the strongest winds, may be an additional hazard."" Allow Twitter content?

Philippine Taal volcano begins spewing lava,"This video can not be played Time-lapse of lightning storm swirling round Philippine volcano A volcano in the Philippines has begun spewing lava, as authorities warn that a ""hazardous eruption"" is possible ""within hours or days"". In the early hours of Monday, a weak flow of lava began seeping out of Taal volcano - located some 70km (45 miles) south of the capital Manila. Taal had earlier emitted a huge plume of ash, triggering the mass evacuation of 8,000 people from the area. Taal is the Philippines' second most active volcano. Situated on an island in the middle of a lake, it is one of the world's smallest volcanoes and has recorded at least 34 eruptions in the past 450 years. Authorities in the surrounding province, Batangas, have declared a ""state of calamity"", signifying major disruption. On Sunday, the volcano emitted a giant plume of ash, with rumbling sounds and tremors also reported. Weak lava has begun flowing out of the Taal volcano A total of 75 earthquakes have occurred in the Taal region, with 32 of these earthquakes ranking 2 and higher on the earthquake intensity scale, said Phivolcs. ""Taal volcano entered a period of intense unrest... that progressed into magmatic eruption at 02:49 to 04:28... this is characterised by weak lava fountaining accompanied by thunder and flashes of lightning,"" the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in a statement. But Phivolcs director Renato Solidum said that signs of a hazardous eruption, including ""flows of ashes, rocks, gas at speeds of more than 60km/h horizontally"" had not yet occurred, according to CNN Philippines. Phivolcs has now raised the alert level from 3 to 4, out of a maximum of 5. In pictures: Taal erupts and coats Philippines towns in ash Taal volcano provides backdrop to wedding photos Can we predict volcanic eruptions? Authorities have also warned of a possible ""volcanic tsunami"", which can be trigged by falling debris after an eruption, pushing the water and generating waves. 0- Quiet 1- Some disturbance but no eruption soon 2- Low to moderate seismicity - could eventually lead to eruption 3- Relative high unrest - eruption possible within days or weeks, or it could die down 4- Intense unrest - hazardous eruption possible within days 5- Hazardous eruption - lava flowing or fountaining, ashfall, dangers to nearby communities Source: Phivolcs The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that more than 450,000 people are estimated to live within the 14km danger zone of the Taal volcano. Ash fell on several areas nearby with residents advised to wear masks. One resident in metro Manila said shops had begun to run out of masks. ""When I went to my car, I saw it was covered in ash. I hurriedly went to buy a mask from a drugstore but they had run out,"" Angel Bautista, a resident of Paranaque told Reuters. The government has warned retailers not to hike mask prices amid the surging demand. Earthquakes and volcanic activity are not uncommon in the Philippines, which lies along the Ring of Fire - a zone of major seismic activity, which has one of the world's most active fault lines. By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Tagaytay, Philippines As we approached the Taal volcano area this morning we saw local residents shovelling thick wet ash from the roads. Pineapple groves, normally verdant and luscious, now looked grey and lifeless. In the distance Taal continued to billow ash and smoke miles into the sky. As the morning went on the ash clouds became darker. Police manning a 14km exclusion zone stopped people from travelling into the area close to the volcano, but there was a steady flow of cars and trucks moving out. On the back of one pick-up truck, I saw a large family with their treasured household possessions. They were moving in the direction of the Philippine capital Manila, where many people are choosing to stay with relatives. Cars, buildings and roads have been left covered in ash Even birds have been blanketed by ashfall The volcanic ash had forced Manila's international airport to suspend all flights on Sunday. Phivolcs had warned that the ""airborne ash and ballistic fragments from the eruption... posed hazards to aircrafts"". The popularity of volcano tourism The privately owned volcano that is always active Tsunami hazards from volcanoes 'underestimated' The Civil Aviation Authority announced later on Monday that it had resumed ""partial operations"" as of 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT) for flights departing the airport and 12:00 for arrivals. The Philippine stock exchange also announced it would halt all trading on Monday. Ash from the Taal volcano has affected thousands of residents in nearby areas President Rodrigo Duterte's office has also ordered the suspension of government work in Manila and the closure of all schools in the capital. The active volcano is at the centre of the 230 sq km Lake Taal, formed by prehistoric eruptions Taal is a ""complex volcano"", which means it doesn't have one vent or cone but several eruption points that have changed over time The head of Phivolcs calls Taal ""a volcano within a volcano"" and says as such it is ""very dangerous"" Taal has erupted in different ways more than 30 times in the past 500 years - most recently in 1977 A 1911 eruption killed about 1,500 people. A 1974 eruption lasted several months Residents evacuate as Philippine volcano spews ash Volcano tourism in the spotlight after New Zealand Volcano's spectacular eruption caught on camera.

Mr Murphy was speaking after the Stormont parties met Secretary of State Julian Smith to discuss how much will be allocated. The finance minister refused to comment on how much exactly had been proposed. Earlier the prime minister said the government had made ""huge commitments"" as part of the deal.

""We have to analyse the verbal figures that were given to us tonight by the secretary of state, but my initial read of them is they fall way short and I wouldn't tend to accept that.""

Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said the Good Friday Agreement ""is working again"". ""North-south cooperation is going to resume. We are going to beef up and deepen cooperation."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson meeting the new executive ministers at Stormont Castle First Minister Arlene Foster said the prime minister must ""step up to the plate"" and deliver what the government has promised in extra funding for Northern Ireland. ""We need significant and sustained investment, not just this year but over a number of years. This is crucial in ensuring transformation in areas such as health and also our road and water infrastructures,"" she said. Mrs Foster also said the possibility of water charges being introduced as a means of raising revenue was not supported by anyone in the executive. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she had impressed upon the two prime ministers ""the importance of coming through with the funding promised as part of the deal"". ""All executive ministers are committed to working together to tackle some very serious issues in our society and across public services but, quite simply, we need the money to make it happen. ""We have done our bit and I look forward to the fulfilment of the commitments made by the two governments to let us get to work."" We'll never know exactly what the new ministers said to Boris Johnson as they met him inside Stormont Castle, but one thing's for sure, money talks. The government has been tight-lipped when it comes to revealing how much it's prepared to stump up for Stormont this time, but there are rumours of another few billion pounds coming our way. The executive has a mountain to climb in terms of tackling waiting lists, school budgets and roads projects, with ministers relying on a big pot of money to take the necessary decisions. Asked about the exact figure, Boris Johnson said it wasn't ""just about money"" - an answer that might set alarm bells ringing. The party leaders will want to ensure the government doesn't go back on its word - so they'll be meeting Julian Smith at some point on Monday to go over the final details of the deal.

On Saturday, a new power sharing government was formed by Stormont's five main parties. They agreeda deal with the governmentsthat includes extra funding for Northern Ireland, but the exact figure is not yet known. The deal - entitled New Decade, New Approach- was reached on Friday after months of negotiations between the parties and the two governments. Stormont's power-sharing coalition, led by the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, had collapsed in January 2017 after a row over a green energy scandal. Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill were appointed first and deputy first ministers on Saturday The return of devolution means the executive can now take decisions that had been stalled due to the three-year absence of ministers.

"Philippine Taal volcano begins spewing lavaAuthorities have warned that a ""hazardous eruption"" could take place ""within hours or days"".Asia","This video can not be played Time-lapse of lightning storm swirling round Philippine volcano A volcano in the Philippines has begun spewing lava, as authorities warn that a ""hazardous eruption"" is possible ""within hours or days"". In the early hours of Monday, a weak flow of lava began seeping out of Taal volcano - located some 70km (45 miles) south of the capital Manila. Taal had earlier emitted a huge plume of ash, triggering the mass evacuation of 8,000 people from the area. Taal is the Philippines' second most active volcano. Situated on an island in the middle of a lake, it is one of the world's smallest volcanoes and has recorded at least 34 eruptions in the past 450 years. Authorities in the surrounding province, Batangas, have declared a ""state of calamity"", signifying major disruption. On Sunday, the volcano emitted a giant plume of ash, with rumbling sounds and tremors also reported. Weak lava has begun flowing out of the Taal volcano A total of 75 earthquakes have occurred in the Taal region, with 32 of these earthquakes ranking 2 and higher on the earthquake intensity scale, said Phivolcs. ""Taal volcano entered a period of intense unrest... that progressed into magmatic eruption at 02:49 to 04:28... this is characterised by weak lava fountaining accompanied by thunder and flashes of lightning,"" the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in a statement. But Phivolcs director Renato Solidum said that signs of a hazardous eruption, including ""flows of ashes, rocks, gas at speeds of more than 60km/h horizontally"" had not yet occurred, according to CNN Philippines. Phivolcs has now raised the alert level from 3 to 4, out of a maximum of 5. In pictures: Taal erupts and coats Philippines towns in ash Taal volcano provides backdrop to wedding photos Can we predict volcanic eruptions? Authorities have also warned of a possible ""volcanic tsunami"", which can be trigged by falling debris after an eruption, pushing the water and generating waves. 0- Quiet 1- Some disturbance but no eruption soon 2- Low to moderate seismicity - could eventually lead to eruption 3- Relative high unrest - eruption possible within days or weeks, or it could die down 4- Intense unrest - hazardous eruption possible within days 5- Hazardous eruption - lava flowing or fountaining, ashfall, dangers to nearby communities Source: Phivolcs The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says that more than 450,000 people are estimated to live within the 14km danger zone of the Taal volcano. Ash fell on several areas nearby with residents advised to wear masks. One resident in metro Manila said shops had begun to run out of masks. ""When I went to my car, I saw it was covered in ash. I hurriedly went to buy a mask from a drugstore but they had run out,"" Angel Bautista, a resident of Paranaque told Reuters. The government has warned retailers not to hike mask prices amid the surging demand. Earthquakes and volcanic activity are not uncommon in the Philippines, which lies along the Ring of Fire - a zone of major seismic activity, which has one of the world's most active fault lines. By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Tagaytay, Philippines As we approached the Taal volcano area this morning we saw local residents shovelling thick wet ash from the roads. Pineapple groves, normally verdant and luscious, now looked grey and lifeless. In the distance Taal continued to billow ash and smoke miles into the sky. As the morning went on the ash clouds became darker. Police manning a 14km exclusion zone stopped people from travelling into the area close to the volcano, but there was a steady flow of cars and trucks moving out. On the back of one pick-up truck, I saw a large family with their treasured household possessions. They were moving in the direction of the Philippine capital Manila, where many people are choosing to stay with relatives. Cars, buildings and roads have been left covered in ash Even birds have been blanketed by ashfall The volcanic ash had forced Manila's international airport to suspend all flights on Sunday. Phivolcs had warned that the ""airborne ash and ballistic fragments from the eruption... posed hazards to aircrafts"". The popularity of volcano tourism The privately owned volcano that is always active Tsunami hazards from volcanoes 'underestimated' The Civil Aviation Authority announced later on Monday that it had resumed ""partial operations"" as of 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT) for flights departing the airport and 12:00 for arrivals. The Philippine stock exchange also announced it would halt all trading on Monday. Ash from the Taal volcano has affected thousands of residents in nearby areas President Rodrigo Duterte's office has also ordered the suspension of government work in Manila and the closure of all schools in the capital. The active volcano is at the centre of the 230 sq km Lake Taal, formed by prehistoric eruptions Taal is a ""complex volcano"", which means it doesn't have one vent or cone but several eruption points that have changed over time The head of Phivolcs calls Taal ""a volcano within a volcano"" and says as such it is ""very dangerous"" Taal has erupted in different ways more than 30 times in the past 500 years - most recently in 1977 A 1911 eruption killed about 1,500 people. A 1974 eruption lasted several months Residents evacuate as Philippine volcano spews ash Volcano tourism in the spotlight after New Zealand Volcano's spectacular eruption caught on camera.

Canadian PM promises 'justice' at Iran plane vigil,"This video can not be played ""We need full clarity on how such a horrific tragedy could have occurred"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he will seek ""justice"" for those killed on board a Ukrainian passenger plane downed by Iran. Mr Trudeau spoke in Edmonton, Alberta at a vigil for the 57 Canadians killed in the disaster. The PM promised to pursue answers from Iran, which admitted its military shot down the plane in error, killing all 176 people on board. Iran had previously rejected suggestions that it was to blame. ""This tragedy should have never occurred, and I want to assure you that you have my full support during this extraordinarily difficult time ... you give us purpose to pursue justice and accountability for you,"" said Mr Trudeau, addressing a crowd of 2,300 people in a university gym. ""We will not rest until there are answers."" Mr Trudeau attended the memorial on Sunday, as a second day of anti-government protests against Iran's leaders erupted. Justin Trudeau said ""we will not rest until there are answers"" Iran's belated admission that it ""unintentionally"" hit the Boeing plane with missiles has caused outrage at home and abroad. At protests in Tehran and other cities, there were chants against the leadership and reports of clashes with security forces, which fired tear gas. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was shot down near Tehran last Wednesday, shortly after Iran had launched missiles at two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Iran faces watershed moment What we know about flight PS752 Those strikes were a response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. Dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden died on the plane. Iran has invited Canada, Ukraine and Boeing to take part in an investigation into the disaster. Those responsible, Iran says, will be held accountable and prosecuted. BBC's Jessica Murphy, Edmonton, Alberta Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand gazed out from the photograph projected on the screen with wide smiles, looking like they had been caught laughing at a shared joke. The ""sweet couple"" likely were. Along with their two daughters, Daria, 14, and Dorina, 9, they were remembered for their quickness to laughter, their generosity, their full embrace of life. This video can not be played Pedram Mousavi, Mojgan Daneshmand, and their two daughters were all passengers on flight PS752 The family of four were among the 13 victims of flight PS752 who came from the Canadian city of Edmonton. A crowd of some 2,300 people packed into a university gym on Sunday to pay respects to those lost - family, close friends, colleagues, classmates -  whose deaths have left a hole in so many lives. Prime Minister Trudeau told the crowd that in their sorrow ""your entire country stands with you"". Mr Trudeau promised to pursue answers from Iran A friend of Pedram's, through a letter read by his former student Hossein Saghlatoon, said the loss was ""too much to bear"". He was looking forward to many more memorable moments with Pedram and his family, he wrote, ""but alas, the cruel hand of destiny had some other plans"". After a wave of anti-government protests on Saturday, demonstrators returned to the streets despite a large deployment of security forces. Riot police, members of the elite Revolutionary Guard on motorbikes, and plainclothes security officials were out in force. Revolutionary Guards - what do they do? Iran's only female Olympic medallist defects In one apparently symbolic act rejecting state propaganda, video showed students taking care not to walk over US and Israeli flags painted on the ground at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran.

Many of the protesters are women. This video can not be played A crowd gathered outside Amir Kabir university on Saturday, calling for resignations and accusing officials of lying US President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated warnings that Iran should not target anti-government protesters, saying, ""the World is watching.

Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill were appointed first and deputy first ministers on Saturday The return of devolution means the executive can now take decisions that had been stalled due to the three-year absence of ministers. The executive is expected to hold its first meeting on Tuesday, the same day that the new chairs of Stormont's scrutiny committees are likely to be chosen.

Schools closed after severe gale warning,"This video can not be played Footage from Bel Hawson shows waves crashing onto the A83 in Ardrishaig as cars drive along Parts of Scotland have been hit by severe gales and flooding as Storm Brendan sweeps in from the Atlantic. Ferry routes covering much of the west coast as well as the Northern Isles have been cancelled or disrupted. A large tree has fallen at Maybole in South Ayrshire, partially blocking the A77, and may take several hours to clear. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency,external(Sepa) has also issued 32 flood warnings and 16 flood alerts. The yellow warning issued by the Met Office covers a 14-hour period from 10:00 until midnight. A further warning for snow and ice across Scotland is in place from 01:00 until 13:00 on Tuesday, with up to 6cm (2in) on higher ground. A history of UK named storms A tree crashed into the garden of a house in the Garthdee area of Aberdeen Caledonian MacBrayne,externalhas cancelled ferries on all 28 of its routes for the rest of the day. CalMac operations director Robert Morrison told BBC Scotland it was unusual for a storm to be large enough to affect the whole network, but that it was not unprecedented. He said: ""We are in the worst of winter weather conditions and will be probably for a few days more. ""The Met Office forecast was for Storm Brendan to blow through within 14 hours, but the forecast for the coming days is also quite significant and we will have to keep a close eye on that. ""Our main aim will be to try and offer our services where it's safe to do so, but only where it's safe to do so."" Northlink Ferries,externalalso told passengers there may be disruption on services to Orkney and Shetland. The Aberdeen to Lerwick sailing scheduled for 19:00 has also been cancelled. TheMet Office has warned,externalof a ""very windy period"" beginning at about 10:00 on Monday. In the Garthdee area of Aberdeen one resident thought a branch had blown down when he received a mobile phone alert, triggered by his home CCTV system, at 16:34. But when Greg Paluch returned from work he was shocked to discovered a tree had fallen into his garden and landed just short of his front door. Mr Paluch, 35, said: ""It could have been worse considering the height of the tree. But no one was at home and no one was hurt - that is the main thing."" Waves have been crashing onto the shoreline in Troon The wild weather has also hit Stornoway The Met Office said people should expect: Some delays to road, rail, air and ferry transport, particularly for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes and bridges Some bus and train services affected, with some journeys taking longer Coastal routes, sea fronts and coastal communities affected by spray and/or large waves Some short-term loss of power and other services The lighthouse at Port Ellen in Islay was enveloped by waves Stormy seas have been whipped up at Ardrossan in North Ayrshire ""The strongest winds are expected around exposed coasts and hills,"" the Met Office said. ""Here gusts of 60-70mph are likely, with a few sites perhaps seeing gusts to 80mph - especially around Irish Sea coasts and around the west coast of Scotland where the strongest winds are most likely. ""Gusts will be lower inland with 45-55mph likely. A narrow band of squally, heavy rain moving east, accompanying the strongest winds, may be an additional hazard."" Allow Twitter content?

Second day of protests in Iran over downed plane,"This video can not be played Students at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran refused to walk over US and Israeli flags in an apparent show of defiance against Iran's government Iran's leaders have faced a second day of protests following their admission the military shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board, many of them Iranians. Protesters in Tehran and in several other cities chanted slogans against the leadership. Clashes with security forces and the firing of tear gas are reported. Iran admitted ""unintentionally"" hitting the plane after initially denying it, amid rising tensions with the US. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was shot down near Tehran last Wednesday, shortly after Iran had launched missiles at two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Those strikes were a response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January. Iran faces watershed moment What we know about flight PS752 Dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Sweden died on the plane. Demonstrators attended new protests despite a large deployment of security forces. Riot police, members of the elite Revolutionary Guard on motorbikes, and plainclothes security officials were out in force. Revolutionary Guards - what do they do? Iran's only female Olympic medallist defects In one apparently symbolic act rejecting state propaganda, video showed students taking care not to walk over US and Israeli flags painted on the ground at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran. In some social media clips, protesters can be heard chanting anti-government slogans, including: ""They are lying that our enemy is America, our enemy is right here."" Many of the protesters are women. Social media footage showed clapping and chanting protesters in Tehran's Azadi Square. BBC Persian says there has been a crackdown there by security forces, with tear gas fired. The semi-official Fars news agency said up to 1,000 people were protesting at various points in the capital. Protests were also reported in other cities. This video can not be played A crowd gathered outside Amir Kabir university on Saturday, calling for resignations and accusing officials of lying Those who decide to continue demonstrating will be mindful of the violence with which the security forces have dealt with protest movements in the past, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. On Saturday, students had gathered outside two universities. They initially did so to pay respect to the victims, but angry protests erupted later in the evening and tear gas was reportedly fired to disperse them. A number of Iranian newspapers have covered the vigils for the plane victims alongside headlines such as ""Shame"" and ""Unforgivable"". But there has also been praise for what one pro-government newspaper called Iran's ""honest"" admission of error. There were also protests on Sunday in Tehran in support of Soleimani, and opposing the US and UK. US President Donald Trump on Sunday repeated warnings that Iran should not target anti-government protesters, saying, ""the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching"".

Britain, meanwhile, has condemned the arrest of the UK ambassador to Iran in Tehran as a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said Rob Macaire was detained after attending a vigil where he was paying respects to victims of the crash, some of whom were British. UK condemns ambassador's arrest in Tehran Mr Macaire said he left the vigil when some people started chanting and had played no part in the demonstration. Protesters burn a UK and an Israeli flag in Tehran Iran on Sunday summoned the ambassador to complain about ""his unconventional behaviour of attending an illegal rally"", the foreign ministry website said. Iranian protesters set a UK flag alight in front of the UK embassy on Sunday. In other developments on Sunday: US Defence Secretary Mark Esper told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday that he ""didn't see"" specific evidence that Iran was preparing attacks against US embassies.President Trump had said on Friday he believed four embassies were under threat. Mr Esper said he shared the president's belief that there ""probably and could've been attacks on additional embassies"" Eight Katyusha rockets were fired at the Balad air base, which has housed US forces north of the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. Four Iraqis were wounded. There have been several recent attacks on the base blamed on Iranian-backed militias Hundreds of mourners are attending memorials in the Canadian cities of Toronto and Edmonton, At the latter,  Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the crowd he would pursue justice and accountability on behalf of their families and friends BBC's Jessica Murphy, Edmonton, Alberta Pedram Mousavi and Mojgan Daneshmand gazed out from the photograph projected on the screen with wide smiles, looking like they had been caught laughing at a shared joke. The ""sweet couple"" likely were. Along with their two daughters, Daria, 14, and Dorina, 9, they were remembered for their quickness to laughter, their generosity, their full embrace of life. The family of four were among the 13 victims of flight PS752 who came from the Canadian city of Edmonton. A crowd of some 2,300 people packed into a university gym on Sunday to pay respects to those lost - family, close friends colleagues, classmates -  whose death has left a hole in so many lives. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told the crowd that in their sorrow ""your entire country stands with you"". A friend of Pedram's, through a letter read by his former student Hossein Saghlatoon, said the loss was ""too much to bear"". He was looking forward to many more memorable moments with Pedram and his family, he wrote ""but alas, the cruel hand of destiny had some other plans"". For three days, Iran denied reports its missiles had brought down the plane, with one spokesman accusing Western nations of ""lying and engaging in psychological warfare"". But on Saturday morning, a statement read on state TV accepted the plane had been shot down. Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander, said a missile operator had acted independently and alone, mistaking the plane for a ""cruise missile"". This video can not be played Footage shows missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran He also said he had informed the authorities about what had happened on Wednesday, raising questions about why Iran had denied involvement for so long. Both Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky and Justin Trudeau have demanded accountability from Iran. Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' Why were so many Canadians on the plane?

Royals gather for talks over Sussexes' future,"The Duke of Sussex, the Duke of Cambridge and the Prince of Wales will all attend talks on Monday The Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge have denied ""false"" claims that their relationship was damaged by bullying. A statement by Princes Harry and William described a newspaper story as ""inflammatory"" and ""offensive"". The Times quoted a source sayingthe Sussexes felt they had been pushed out,externaland ""constantly bullied"" by William. It came as the brothers, the Queen and the Prince of Wales met to discuss Prince Harry and Meghan's future. The couple want to step back as senior members of the Royal Family, while also becoming financially independent. A statement on behalf of Harry and William said: ""Despite clear denials, a false story ran in a UK newspaper today speculating about the relationship between the Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge. ""For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful."" The Times declined to comment on the princes' statement, but the paper acknowledged in its report that claims of bullying were strongly contested by other sources close to the Cambridges and Harry. In October, Harry responded to speculation about a rift between the brothersby saying the pair were ""on different paths at the moment""but he loved William ""dearly"". What's on the agenda for the royal talks? Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' Dan Wootton, executive editor of the Sun which broke the news of Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to step back, said: ""It is quite extraordinary that at a time when Prince William and Prince Harry are having so much warfare behind the scenes that they have come together to issue this joint statement."" He told the BBC that while he would not use the word ""bullying"", Prince Harry and Prince William's relationship has become ""incredibly strained over the past 18 months"", and that has played ""a big part"" in the disruption the Royal Family is experiencing. Robert Hardman, royal biographer and Daily Mail journalist, said ""it shows the depth of the bond between those two brothers"" that they responded to this allegation so quickly, and it demonstrated their desire to ""avoid any sense of confrontation"" at the meeting. These talks have been described as ""royal history in the making"" by BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond. Meghan was expected to join the discussion by phone from Canada. It is hoped the talks will produce a ""next step"" on the way to defining the couple's new relationship with the Royal Family - in line with the Queen's wish to find a solution within days. However, our correspondent said a deal ""might take time"" to be agreed and implemented. Among the issues likely to have been discussedare what funding the duke and duchess will receive, whether they will keep their titles and what royal duties they will continue to carry out. The group was expected to review a range of possibilities for the Sussexes, taking into account plans outlined by the couple. The final arrangement could provide a blueprint for future royal generations, including the Duke of Cambridge's younger children Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Monday's gathering at the Queen's estate in Norfolk - being described as the ""Sandringham summit"" - was the first time the monarch has spoken face-to-face with Prince Harry since the Sussexes' announcement. Prince Charles has returned from Oman after attending a condolence ceremonyfollowing the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said. The Queen attended a church service at Sandringham on Sunday morning Newspaper reports suggested the couple could conduct a potentially damaging television interviewif they were unhappy with the outcome of the discussions. Broadcaster and friend of the couple, Tom Bradby - who made a documentary with them last year - wrote in the Sunday Times: ""I have some idea of what might be aired in a full, no-holds-barred, sit-down interview and I don't think it would be pretty."" In Sandringham the players will receive a series of options, a range of possibilities. These will be based on the stated aims of Prince Harry and Meghan. Leaving aside the heady brew of contradictions detailed elsewhere, the balancing of these different aims and demands is hard enough. Money is a big issue. But so will be the status of the court of Prince Harry and Meghan that emerges. Maybe a deal comes on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. But what are not up for negotiation are service and survival. Both must be observed by Prince Harry and Meghan if they are to remain royals. But will the couple really agree to the restrictions that service and survival demand? A deal will probably be crafted - however the direction of travel is one way. Prince Harry and Meghan are looking for the exit. Read more. In their statement on Wednesday, posted on the couple's official Instagram account, the duke and duchess said they intend to ""step back"" as senior royals and work to become financially independent. They also said they plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". How could Harry and Meghan make money? The Sussexes' statement in full Meghan is in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie after flying there amid the ongoing discussions, which have involved the UK and Canadian governments. She and Prince Harry had been in Canada over Christmas, before they returned to the UK last week after a six-week break from royal duties. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. The couple were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. And in December it was revealed that the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.

Queen and Prince Harry to hold face-to-face talksSenior royals will meet at Sandringham on Monday to discuss Prince Harry and Meghan's future.UK,"The Queen attended a church service at Sandringham on Sunday morning The Queen has summoned senior royals to Sandringham on Monday for face-to-face talks to discuss the future roles of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Palace officials told the BBC that Prince Harry, the Duke of Cambridge and the Prince of Wales would all attend, while Meghan is expected join the discussion over the phone from Canada. The Sussexes say they plan to step back as senior members of the Royal Family. There is no suggestion a conclusion will be reached at the meeting. But BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said it is hoped that the talks will produce a ""next step"" on the way to defining the couple's new relationship with the Royal Family - in line with the Queen's wish to find a solution within days. He added that there were still ""formidable obstacles"" to overcome in the talks. Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement Why Meghan and Harry have Canada in their sights How could the Sussexes make money? Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has spoken of his ""sadness"" at the broken bond with his brother,the Sunday Times reports.,external According to the paper, Prince William told a friend: ""I've put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can't do that any more; we're separate entities. This video can not be played Views from the public at Sandringham Estate: 'You can't just be a royal then decide not to be' ""All we can do, and all I can do, is try and support them and hope that the time comes when we're all singing from the same page."" Prince Charles is currently in Oman, after travelling overnight to attend the first of three days of official condolences alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson,following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said. He will return to the UK in time to attend Monday's talks. On Sunday morning the Queen was seen smiling and waving to crowds as she was driven to church in Sandringham. Prince Charles is in Oman, where he met the country's new sultan Monday's gathering at the Queen's estate in Norfolk - being described as the ""Sandringham summit"" - will be the first time the monarch has come face-to-face with Harry since the Sussexes' announcement, which was posted on their official Instagram account. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the trickiest area will be to agree the financial position of the Sussexes, who saidin their statement on Wednesdaythey intend to ""step back"" as senior royals and work to become financially independent. The couple also said they plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". There are likely to be tax implications to any decision to base themselves outside the UK for any length of time and Buckingham Palace will want ""tight protocols to prevent them cashing in on their royal status"", our correspondent added. Monday's royal summit may not be the last such gathering needed to sort things out; but enough progress has been made by palace staff and civil servants for the most senior members of the family to meet to discuss some pretty concrete proposals on the way ahead for Prince Harry and Meghan. There are still formidable obstacles - it's not at all clear how much in the way of royal duties the prince and Meghan see themselves doing. On that will hang issues such as funding and liaison between the palace and Prince Harry and Meghan's new organisation. Unpicking the current relationship is complicated - creating a new one, that lasts, will be even tougher. There's a strong desire to get this done. But equally the deal must be robust and workable. Precedent is being established here - a way of doing things that may extend in years to come to other members of the royal family. The Queen, Prince Charles, William and Harry are expected to review a range of possibilities for the Sussexes, taking into account plans outlined by the couple. If a deal is agreed in the coming days, there is a general understanding that it will take some time to implement. Meanwhile, Meghan is in Canada with her eight-month-old son Archie after flying there amid the ongoing discussions, which have involved the UK and Canadian governments. She and Prince Harry had been in Canada over Christmas, before they returned to the UK on Tuesday after a six-week break from royal duties. On Friday, the couple's official Instagram account returned to publicising their appearances. Pictures were posted showing the couple during a private visit on Tuesday to a community kitchen in north Kensington, west London, where meals were cooked for families displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire. Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their struggles under the media spotlight. The couple were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year.

Second day of protests in Iran over downed planeThere are calls for senior officials to be dismissed after a passenger jet was mistakenly shot down.,"This video can not be played Students at Shahid Beheshti university in Tehran refused to walk over US and Israeli flags in an apparent show of defiance against Iran's government Iran's leaders have faced a second day of protests following their admission the military shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board, many of them Iranians. Protesters in Tehran and in several other cities chanted slogans against the leadership. Clashes with security forces and the firing of tear gas are reported. Iran admitted ""unintentionally"" hitting the plane after initially denying it, amid rising tensions with the US. The plane, en route to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, was shot down near Tehran last Wednesday, shortly after Iran had launched missiles at two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Those strikes were a response to the US killing of senior Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on 3 January.
